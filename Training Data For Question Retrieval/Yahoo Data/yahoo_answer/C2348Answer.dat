y4CXrGTVaa	The best advice I could give you is to talk to your professor and have her clarify it for you. <br>  <br>  However...<br>  <br>  Overall, I think she wants you to discuss the Industrial Revolution and how it caused this backlash of people wanting to return to nature (think of pre-raphaelites). For example, here is a quote from a man in 1830 England:<br>  <br>  "Buildings have risen ‘like an exhalation,’ till villages have swelled into towns, and towns into crowded cities, the unenclosed lands have been wrested from the poor in the country; the village greens, the fields and open spaces in which the youth of the towns and cities were accustomed to take their sport and exercise, have been built upon, or forbidden to them, till the health and spirits of hundreds and thousands—may it not be said millions—have been sacrificed, and their morals corrupted by the pernicious amusements to which under the privation of natural relaxation, they have been forced (Lasdun 137)."<br>  <br>  A good fictional book to examine this phenomenon is "North and South" by Elizabeth Gaskell. Also look into different health scares of the time and what they thought would prevent them (essentially good ventilation/clean air)<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.

TXy9hI1Aaa	The 1985 Singh Decision<br>  Basically gave rights to refugees in Canada to receive a hearing despite not being actual citizens. It is more clearly summed up below where I found quoted...<br>  <br>  "<br>  The procedural fairness of the inland refugee-determination process was the central focus of the Supreme Court of Canada's landmark decision in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration. Two concurring judgments by Mr Justice Beetz (Estey and McIntyre concurring) and Madame Justice Wilson (Dickson and Lamer concurring), held that denying claimants access to an oral hearing did not meet the standard of procedural fairness required by section 7 of Charter. Wilson J. found that the word 'everyone' in section 7 protected all human beings 'physically present' in Canada, and that security of the person encompassed 'freedom from the threat of physical punishment or suffering, as well as freedom from such punishment itself.' Wilson J also rejected the government's argument that administrative considerations, such as the costs and delays of a more elaborate process, are relevant to the constitional calculus. 'Certainly the guarantees of the Charter would be illusory if they could be ignored because it was administratively convenient to do so.'<br>  "|`|IzxVlE6Caa	Below is a portion of the article from the site. In sum, it was a decision made by the Canadian Supreme Court, regarding a Mr. Singh, that resulted in giving rights to immigrants and, in part, giving a "back door" to immigrants to enter Canada. <br>  <br>  The following are some facts about the Singh Decision (taken partly from Charles Campbell's book "Betrayal and Deceit: The Politics of Canadian Immigration"; and CPC MP Art Hanger's 1994 research paper, "The Singh Decision and Canadian Refugee Determination Policy"). Mr. Campbell served for 10 years on the Immigration Appeal Board (a predecessor of the current Immigration and Refugee Board), eight as Vice-Chairman. Mr. Hanger is a current MP.<br>  <br>  (1) The Singh Decision was a verdict of the 1985 6-member Supreme Court of Canada. A Mr. Singh had been denied refugee status by the Minister on the advice of the Refugee Status Advisory Committee.<br>  <br>  (2) The Immigration Appeal Board denied subsequent applications for redetermination, and the Federal Court of Appeal refused his application for a judicial review of the decision.<br>  <br>  (3) Mr. Singh's lawyer claimed that his client's rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and under the Canadian Bill of Rights had been violated. His case and those of six other individuals in similar situations were heard together. Mr. Singh and five others were Sikhs from the Punjab. The other five had also claimed Convention Refugee status. All six said they feared persecution by Indian authorities as a result of their political activities and beliefs. They were associated with the Akali Dal Party which was demanding independence for the Punjab. The seventh claimant was a woman from Guyana.<br>  <br>  (4) Lawyers based their appeal on the meaning of the words "everyone" or "a person" in Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They claimed that since their clients were in Canada, they (like Canadian citizens) should be entitled to the protection of the Charter and Bill. <br>  <br>  (5) The Singh Decision was a landmark ruling because it stated that the words "everyone" or " person" included refugee claimants. John Manion, former Deputy Minister of Immigration, has said that the authors of the Charter intended the words "everyone" and "person" to refer only to Canadian citizens. However, the justices involved in making the Singh Decision ruled that these two words meant anyone physically on Canadian soil, including people who had arrived here and made refugee claims shortly after their arrival. <br>  <br>  (6) The Singh Decision also entitled all refugee claimants to a "hearing" of their claim. Three of the six Justices said this meant an "oral hearing". The other three said a claimant could have either an oral hearing or make a written statement of his claim. <br>  <br>  (7) Experts have viewed the Singh Decision in different ways. John Manion characterized the decision as "a disaster". On the other hand, MP Art Hanger argued in his 1994 research that, "The Singh Decision left "open the possibility of removing, without a hearing, all persons claiming refugee status who arrive from safe third countries." <br>  <br>  In Mr. Hanger's opinion, "The right to a full and fair hearing is intended to apply only in the event that the security of the person of the refugee claimants is definitely in danger". This security could be determined by simply looking at the country from which the person arrived. If it was "safe" (that is, if it had a well-established record of respecting human rights), then the person could and should be removed from Canada and returned to the "safe" country. <br>  <br>  (8) Since the time Mr. Hanger wrote this opinion, immigration lawyers and advocates have convinced the federal government that it must negotiate agreements with other countries before it can declare those countries "safe". This has made it extremely difficult to return claimants to countries which would be classified by most standards as "safe".<br>  <br>  (9) As interpreted in the late 1980's, the Singh Decision resulted in the establishment of the Immigration and Refugee Board in 1989. Most experts agree this has proved to be a very expensive and cumbersome mistake. In Mr. Hanger's opinion, it has been "a monstrous failure". Charles Campbell has said the Immigration and Refugee Board should be eliminated. In his seasoned view, the current process should be returned to experienced immigration officers who would hold an oral hearing with each claimant at point of entry.<br>  <br>  Senior civil servants such as Mr. Manion estimate refugee claimant expenditures alone cost Canadians around $2 Billion per year. Since 2000, Canada has averaged 30,000+ refugee claimants per year. Since 1989, total costs have been in the $30 Billion range.<br>  <br>  (10) Since the IRB was established, all cases have gone before them--even the most obviously fraudulent. No allowance has been made to distinguish between genuine and false refugee claims. No attention has been paid to the fact that many claimants had actually not arrived from

FwXsEFzRaa	high school is not that bad. many of your friends are going to split up and what not but you will make more friends. in my high school experience, most of the people i encountered were usually nice. the teachers are not great but are friendly. movies tend to overexaggerate high school a bit.|`|DmL2WCDdaa	haha i am a freshman right now and let me tell you, high school is a BLAST.<br>  <br>  the main difference between jr. high and high school is that in high school, you like school over home. in jr. high, you like home over school. this is mainly because jr. high tends to be boring and overloaded with drama, with very little homework which makes home a nice experience. on the other hand, high school is filled with fun, friends, and learning. but the real suffering starts when you go home and tackle the pile of homework. <br>  <br>  if you are the studying type, pursue that and know that it's a whole lot harder in high school. you may start out acing everything because it's your first time, but it might get overwhelming after a while and you may start to get sidetracked (2nd sem fres-soph year).<br>  <br>  if you are the extracurricular/easygoing type, pursue that and have fun with it! it's definitely not about competition, but more about what you learn from it. <br>  <br>  so some good survival tips:<br>  -balance yourself out, don't overload with honors classes if you're 1)not up to the chalange or 2) not used to late nights studying.<br>  -DON'T PROCRASTINATE!! that's probably the best advice i can give you. even with all AP/honors classes, if you start your homework/projects/essays early, you will be getting a nice 8 hours of sleep every night. if you don't.. well.. let's just say, you'll probably be staying at your current height .<br>  -pay attention in class, take notes. you'll learn that every class is of the utmost importance in high school unlike jr. high. be attentive!<br>  -which leads to, this: DON'T BE ABSENT unless you're puking blood.. no just kidding. but seriously, absence from class will have pretty big consequences. once you're behind, it's REALLY hard to catch up. <br>  <br>  wish you the best of luck next year, and just remember to HAVE FUN! don't go killing yourself. :D

So when a plant loses a limb, it does mitosis to replace the lost cells. <br>  <br>  2. Sorry, I don't know what each letter is, so I don't get it.

VQ2Lk4vWaa	I completely disagree, not that Im a good debater or laywer, but people that age have not developed the life experience to make logical decisions about things.<br>  About the car insurance (Im an insurance agent so I believe strongly on this one) statistics prove that people under the age of 19 are more likely to get into a severe accident. Just look into all those cars that go flying by you on the freeway doing 90mph. Most of them are teens, I think it's fair to charge them more. <br>  On voting, just the other day my 16 year old sister mentioned that she thought it was "cool" that our new president had smoked pot and drank alcohol. She said it would be cool to "party" with him. Imagine having a bunch of kids voting for someone based simply on the fact that they look like they can party or because they are better looking than the other canidate. This is how teens minds work. That is what is important to them....<br>  On alcohol and Cigs I think you should have to be 21. Bottom line! Their brains are not developed enough at 16 or even 19 to handle items that alter their already diluted perception. People that age can barely handle going to school and keeping a job, now throw getting drunk in there and you have a recipe for disaster. <br>  Rules are in place to protect teens. They lack experience and dont know what the real world is like. The think they know everything and can handle anything then they get into a situation that is too much for them and who do they run to? mommy and daddy. Im not saying ALL teens are like this, I know there are some out there that are responsible and could handle things, but they are far and few between.|`|GIzBFnrUaa	Well, statistically the biggest 16 year old killer isn't the war or guns but it's what they call a Mustang.<br>  This isn't an opinion but a fact.<br>  So when 16 years olds moan and cry that they want cheaper insurance they are only proving how "green" they really are.|`|Co0F4czRaa	The earlier you start using the bad stuff the more addicting it will get

I live in New Jersey, and one school (Richard Stockton University) gives a full ride if you are in the top twenty percent of your class. That is really easy to achieve. Another school (Rutgers) doesn't give such easy full rides. You need an SAT score around 2100, and you need to be in the top 10%. Go to collegeboard.com. This website helped me soo much with my college search. If you have a college in mind, go to their website and look under their scholarships. It should say what they give out. Good Luck.
1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	A grad student typically takes 2-3 classes, and that is considered full-time in grad school.  Your chances of getting an assistantship vary by field - if you're going into math or the sciences, you can pretty much expect to be offered one by any decent university.  They'll pay your tuition and a small salary in return for you grading papers, proctoring exams, and/or doing research.  My university says the assistantship is 20 hours a week - so 50% would be 10 hours a week.  But don't expect it to stick to that - I work more like 60 hours a week when I'm at home, and 24 hours a day when I'm away on a research trip.  If you do well on the GRE, send them the scores, it can only help.  If they don't require it, then it shouldn't affect your chances.
d0brzTt2aa	For a standard essay, a thesis statement tells the purpose of your paper, and the side (if any) that you will be taking.<br>  <br>  It usually is the last sentence of the introductory paragraph. <br>  <br>  For instance, if I was to write a persuasive essay on school uniforms, my first paragraph would talk about a general idea of them, maybe how uniforms began and how popular they are. At the end, my thesis will reveal the outline and purpose of my essay. <br>  <br>  "School uniforms should be kept in schools because they keep students in focus, and allow parents and school authorities to control the students better."<br>  <br>  Obviously I am against banning school uniforms in this paper. At the end I listed three specific points: parents, school, and students.

If it is really dark blue then I'd also let him touch some velvet.<br>  pink: this is a tough one! I'd ask him to smell the rose again but imagine this as the younger sister of this smell.<br>  green: I'd ask him to take a deep breath and ask him to think of a moment when he was in deep distress then suddenly that worry was all over - how he felt at that sudden passing of extreme worry.

kiD47XbTaa	Well, most of this scene is Katherine and Petruchio arguing wittily. <br>  But if you refer to Petruchio's monologue before this line (181-190), he is 'flattering' her and speaks of her reputation for mildness. And in his final line:<br>  "Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife" (Line 190). <br>  "Moved" in other words means Led. <br>  When Katherine says "You were a movable", she means that you're easy to lead. <br>  I think the reason why you think it refers to furniture is when Katherine replies to Petruchio "A Joint Stool", but this is just them arguing wittily. In other words, they're just trying to out-do each other.

s9tvr0DTaa	To be without hope surely means to have given up on life. Many people all over the world live in extremely challenging situations, leading hard lives in appalling conditions. What keeps people going in such circumstances is the glimmer of hope that things can change.<br>  <br>  This is one thought that came to mind when first reading the poem "Hope is a thing with feathers" by Emily Dickinson. Another is that whoever or wherever you are in the world there is always hope, and what's more hope costs nothing.<br>  <br>  What is striking about the poem is its absolute simplicity, both in structure and in the words the poem presents. However the content and ideas being discussed in the poem are really far from simple, the idea of hope in "extremity" and hope in the "chillest land/And on the strangest sea," is a quite philosophical way of viewing the world. The clear and easy way the rhyme scheme works in conjunction with the simple words certainly works in counter to the content. It is clear that this poem is much more than a simple piece of verse.<br>  <br>  One of the messages of the poem seems to say that whatever life throws at the individual there is always the dove-like glimmer of hope that sits in all of us that is so strong that its voice can still be heard in the "gale" of stormy times. Everyone goes through stormy times in their life and no matter where you are on earth or from which "strangest sea" you inhabit but there is no need to despair. <br>  <br>  Pain and hope the poem seems to be saying, comes to all of us, but hope is the resistance that keeps human nature stubborn and fighting the things that life throws at us. Hope through the metaphor Dickinson uses, is a bird that "perches in the soul" of everyone, regardless of race, gender or status. It is something that everyone has to "keep them warm" against the storm of life, and it never stops singing nor does it ask "a crumb" of the user. It is something that is present within us that we take for granted and usually think little of, until that is we come across poetry like this to capture our attention.<br>  <br>  There is a definite contrast within the poem between hope on the one side as represented with the words like "warm," "Soul," "sweetest;" and in the pain of life as represented in words like "storm," "gales," "chillest." Although there is a clear battle between these two elements, it is clear which one comes out on top as the voice of hope can still be heard through the gales and storms. It is clear that whatever the battles we may face, hope wins through in the end.|`|1113a0e16d7694011f5bdb01076e75dfaa	Sorry,<br>  I knew a Bubbles for a time. She had feathers.

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	You need to be careful about this as CCs often don't offer much in the way of hard-science courses that are appropriate for majors.  Make certain there is a 2 semester bio course suitable for premed and majors, 2 semester general chem course, 2 semester algebraic physics course or higher, 2 semester organic chemistry course, and at least some side bio courses such as cellular/molecular, microbio, and some others.   If these courses are not offered you will have difficulty doing them in just 2 years when you transfer, and likely end up taking 3 years to finish, or two years plus an overloaded summer session making up courses.   This is as these courses are highly sequential so students at 4 year schools always take them in their first two years.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Usually the liberal arts degree AS is fine as long as you meet all the prerequisits.<br>  <br>  My community college actually had a degree called Transfer Certified.

AA11480344	I think you should do: Marijuana is not a Dangerous Drug<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :D|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	Not a great title to tell you the truth, it's insinuating that everyone thinks marijuana is dangerous when speaking as a doctor in training it has more medicinal uses than just about any plant. The title would be a little bit like titling an essay about racism in the judicial system "Many Young Blacks Aren't Headed to Prison," see the title is very defensive as if you have to protect the subject because ALL readers have biased beliefs. People with a closed mind aren't your target audience, rather the individuals who can unbiasedly examine evidence are the ones you need to appeal to with an interesting, but informative title. You could use one of the quotes that Harry J Anslinger said to voting citizens in the 1920s (middle class whites) and even federal officials: “Smoke a Joint and You’re Likely to Kill Your Brother,” but make sure you include the quotation marks in the title. Marijuana: Menace to Life, Health and Morals? would be another good one, this is the first two paragraphs of my essay if you wanted to comb them for information. Feel free to shoot me an email if you want more information.<br>  <br>  Imagine what the United States would be like if all crimes carried penalties more damaging to the perpetrator than the results of the crime itself; this would mean that attempted suicide would be punishable by life imprisonment or even death. This seems farfetched, and yet, without a moment’s hesitation the average American would condemn another citizen for using the herb Cannabis, which has been cultivated for over five thousand years (found at a Romanian burial site dating to approximately the 3rd millennium BC). According to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter: "Penalties against drug use should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself; nowhere is this more clear than in the laws against the possession of marijuana in private for personal use."<br>  <br>  In Virginia, which is one of the strictest states against the private usage of marijuana, the average convicted rape term was a mere 9 years (only part of which would actually be served) and the penalty for cultivation of Cannabis was between 5 and 30 years and up to a $10,000 fine according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s 1993 Datafile. This brings about numerous questions, such as why is rape deemed less harmful to society than the growing of Cannabis? In order to fully answer this complex question the history of marijuana in America must be examined closely. In the early 20th century the majority of Americans were not familiar with plants of the genus Cannabis, with the possible exception being hops which were used in a wide variety of alcoholic beverages. It was not until the early 1920s that some newspapers began reporting the use of a plant called Marijuana (this is a fusing of the names Maria and Joanna, as it was possibly called by sailors in Mexico). These reports were few and far between, resulting in little public interest in what would soon be known as “the foremost menace to life, health and morals in the list of drugs used in America.”|`|yKGKsWMsaa	the last one "Marijuana, not a Dangerous Drug"

In high school I was known as a sort-of-high-marks student, so sometimes I could team up with some other smart people, or a few friends, but having to interact with a bunch of cliquey idiots was unedurable. <br>  Now that I'm in college and I'm even more cynical and nihilistic, I absolutely cannot stand working with other people. It's no one's fault but my own, obviously. I just have a general hatred of all humans, myself included, and justifiably so.

YdLzkAepaa	You would need to really ace the LSAT and have an excellent GPA.  Since HLS, like most other law schools, looks at these two statistics together, a good way to predict your odds of admission is to check out some of the online law school probability calculators mentioned in the article linked below. <br>  <br>  In addition to LSAT and GPA, "soft" factors can also help.  These include any honors and awards you have received, adversities and hardships you may have overcome, impressive volunteer or work experience, leadership experience, and anything else that might set you apart from the next applicant.  <br>  <br>  My advice would be to focus on the LSAT. Take a course or buy official LSAC study materials if you prefer, but be sure to practice with full-length, timed prep tests.  You should also plan to take college classes that interest you and that you can excel in, since your GPA will be critically important to your application as well. As the second link below mentions, you typically need at least a 3.8 undergraduate GPA to gain admission.
lzEuuseJaa	Yes, there are public, private and boarding performing arts schools. It would be helpful to know where you are located to better help you. <br>  <br>  Two performing arts boarding schools are:<br>  Interlochen  <a href="http://www.interlochen.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.interlochen.org/</a><br>  Idyllwild Arts Academy  <a href="http://www.idyllwildarts.org/academy/academy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.idyllwildarts.org/academy/aca...</a><br>  <br>  Many private schools have excellent performing arts programs, even if they aren't specifically a performing arts school. Look at the websites of nearby private schools to get an idea of which ones have big arts programs. It will be obvious by how they are presented on the website. Like at a Catholic high school near me, they have a very good 4 year performing arts program with classes that other students not in the program do not take. <br>  <br>  Private Schools:<br>  <a href="http://www.privateschoolreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.privateschoolreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  Boarding Schools:<br>  <a href="http://www.schools.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.schools.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.boardingschoolreview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardingschoolreview.com</a><br>  <br>  There may also be a performing art public magnet or charter type school near you. Ask around. Just to give you an idea, in LA, there is Arts High, which emphasizes performing arts, but is better than most LA public schools. Academics until about 12:30 and arts the rest of the afternoon.  <a href="http://artshigh.org/" rel="nofollow">http://artshigh.org/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xFeGxPtoaa	If you live in New York.

2Q2ltt1Saa	Originally, it referred to lice, which is generally spread about in younger school-age kids because of all the new activity with each other and the outdoors.  It's spread from that to refer to just 'boy germs' or 'girl germs' and general repulsion against the opposite sex which is common at that age.<br>  <br>  Given current-day society, I'm surprise Lyosl hasn't made a spray for kids to prevent cooties... but that's a different story....|`|FsVZCk0laa	Cooties is a word in North American English, used by children, referring to a fictitious disease or condition, often infecting members of the opposite sex, usually used by boys, but this is a phase and goes away by age 9-12. One catches cooties through any form of bodily contact, proximity, square-dancing, contact with an infected person's possessions, or third-party transmission. In prepubescent children, it effectively serves as a device for enforcing separation of the sexes.<br>  <br>  The earliest recorded use is from a World War I memoir published in 1918: "Of course you know what the word "cooties" means....When you get near the trenches you get a course in the natural history of bugs, lice, rats and every kind of pest that had ever been invented." The word may be derived from Filipino kuto, literally meaning head lice. Humorous use is first noted in 1905, Cooties first inflicts itself on your *** then it may work its way to the lower back causing Cootie Syndrome.|`|EzLP6Jahaa	They got the idea from like you know, germs and bacteria. Aids, and stuff. THAT'S really stupid, though, because it's all little kid stuff.<br>  <br>  It's not real. Are you immature? This question sure is.|`|NdERdQJUaa	Cooties aren't real|`|OlF3tstvaa	When little kids say that, they mean something along the lines of: "Ew! Girl Germs!" or boy germs if you are a girl. They aren't real, just a story to keep little girls and boys from "icky stuff" like kissing ans hugging. It was probably started by a parent from a reference to HIV and AIDS, which are STDs (sexually transmitted diseases).|`|03e1b22ff05e6b64805763f168df8f5baa	Cooties are real, cooties is another word for body lice (or louse)|`|vyGyLV7paa	they are real and they are a hormone found only in pre-pubecent boys.  i don't know exactly what they do tho|`|6eXRX4jpaa	hpv or aids|`|4pXAeKE8aa	no its just somthing little kids used to say cause they didnt like boys/girls when they were little<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|3OoCiOkAaa	Cooties precede HIV and Aids. It became a popular phase for kids in the 1950s to say. I think it originally referred to head lice which children seem to always catch . But it stuck and it was simply a term young boys used to delineate themselves from young girls.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think Michael Jackson used this term to refer to girls as well. Therefore that shows his mentality. <br>  <br>  <br>  But it now is simply a mythical bug that girls or boys are supposed to have said by the opposite sex.

mBNnlrsuaa	Here re a few<br>  <br>  Once there was a toilet seat name Bob. He was very sad he was a toilet seat because whenever someone missed the toilet…. Anyway he was done with being mistreated. So one day he decided to poop on someone so they’d know what it feels like. So he found this pickle named Steve and he pooped on him and Steve died. Moral of the story: Pickles are allergic to poop.<br>   Once upon a time, a turkey named sassafrass toddled it's graceful body over to the lagoon, which was filled with mustard. There he saw his friend the goat. Just as there were about to enjoy some scones with tea, the chupacabra jumped out of the mustard and ate their heads.

qSRsqWqpaa	I don't like either of them.  Japan deserved every bit of both of those bombs, and they got what they deserved.  They could easily have avoided the second bomb by surrendering after the first was dropped, but they decided not to.  <br>  <br>  And when you say it was "unfair", it was also unfair to our men in Pearl Harbor when they woke up to a massive air raid.  And it was unfair when those children accidentally stumbled across a Japanese balloon bomb (that's what I call them) in the mid-west.  There is no "fair" or "unfair" in war.  <br>  <br>  Plus, if the justice system had been implemented on Japan in this war, half of the Japanese Army would have been charged with war crimes.  So the U.S. can easily fight any real court argument.<br>  <br>  I can't really help you because I don't see Japan as having a justifiable argument.|`|PlAGkwFdaa	I like the first one too.|`|qg4vG3t5aa	i like the first one, but instead of starting so many sentences with "so" you might want to change it to something else :)

OpczguDsaa	Was there any point in this question besides bragging about your grades... it's hard depending on the person obviously, for my best friend who is a dedicated student, it's easy cake and she could probably handle even more (which she is planning). For my cousin who would prefer simple pleasures in life, it's quite a challenge. Besides that what does it matter? If you're taking it, you're taking it... speculating how difficult it will be is pretty worthless, you will be inputting the same effort all the same. Courses aside, you have to remember stuff like college essays, applications, visiting campuses, etc.<br>  <br>  and for the record, mommy always said, "If you need to brag about it, then you're probably not good enough at it."|`|kvog6ICCaa	I've always been told that Junior year is your hardest year. As far as your AP classes go, at my school AP psych is the easiest one. You should be fine going from Algebra 2 hon to precalc, that's not a huge jump. Just make sure you check with your guidance counselor and  teachers to verify that the courses you're taking are right for you! (:|`|qbWfyuOYaa	Your senior year is hard if you cannot manage to complete the work.  Have you heard of senioritis? seriously, it really depends on whether you can endure the AP courses or not.  What I'm getting from your previous/current years so far, you seem to have that ability to maintain the grade of "As" and "Bs" in honors/ APs, which is really good since colleges want ot see that you are challenging yourself.<br>  <br>  I took similar courses as you did, except for anatomy and physiology, guitar, french, and personal fitness.  Now I'm a senior and I am taking 5 APs: government, calculus, environment, literature and comp., and Spanish.  Talk to your guidance counselor about this.  From my perspective, if you have the guts to take those AP courses, do it! It will help you in the end if you get a 3,4, or 5 on each of them.
933XLRGCaa	For starters, both are great careers that will always be in demand.  I am a speech path student, and might be a little biased, but I will try to answers your questions.<br>  <br>  An occupational therapist has a broader range of duties and responsibilites than does a speech pathologist. They work to improve gross and fine motor skills, while an SLP works to improve speech and language skills.  <br>  <br>  I chose a career in speech pathology for several reasons.  First, I love working with kids and have a very caretaking personality.  Second, I have always had a passion for it; I became addicted to reading at an early age, and always did well in English and foreign languages.  In addition, I desired a career where I would have some independence and also make a good living.  An occupational therapist probably shares many of these qualities, minus the speech/language stuff. <br>  <br>  You can feel good knowing though, that each job pays decently, and each will always be in high demand.  Good luck!|`|COg8rZnJaa	Speech Pathology has to do with teaching people to speak and helping them improve their speech like pronunciation and talking clearly. OT are trained to order and fill out paper work for equipment needed for special need people with disabilities and working on their fine motor skills like gripping writing and so on. If you are interested in filling out paper work and helping people you should become an OT. If you like working with children and helping them improve their speech you should become a speech language pathologist. For both jobs you need to be devoted.|`|ShhSpZjJaa	OT is not all paperwork like the last answerer is assuming. Speech can also be a hefty caseload, which in turn will have you sitting around at the end of the day writing out clinical notes. Both have their ups and downs. One good thing is OT's usually work with an OT assistant, who can help you out throughout the day, I do not believe that speech pathologists have that. Mouth oral motor skills are assessed in speech pathology, and movement and fine motor skills are assessed in Occupational therapy, of course there are many other things covered under each career's field. You choose, they are both good careers.

However we are all doing well because we went to uni. One of my sisters is in I.T, one is training to be an accountant and I am doing a PhD (fully funded by the university because I did well in my undergraduate degree and had work experience of the area that my PhD is covering). The incentive for all three of us was that we wanted to better ourselves and not get stuck in dead end jobs, earning basic wages for the rest of our lives. A powerful incentive if you are quite intelligent to start with because the thought of doing the same thing day in day out is enough to make me want to give up totally.<br>  I'm not sure why less people go to university from the working class these days.

People who are on welfare get the most, but they work the least!<br>  <br>  Those who are the first in their families to pursue a bachelor's degree, working their way to pay for their education, suffer, because the Expected Family Contribution places them in a category that predicts them to come up with a high amount of funding, and from where?

There are several but the _best_ way is what works best for you.  <br>  Some suggestions are: Memory cards- Front of card has the word, back of card has the definition.  To learn the meanings, read the front of the card and answer it before looking on the back to see if you're correct.  To spell the word, do just the opposite; read the back of the card to a) know which word it defines and b) spell it.<br>  Another way is to have someone help you do the steps above.  I've found having someone to help, helps me to learn faster.|`|klcqgST9aa	Reading seriously extends your vocabulary exponentially, but if you're just going to look up words, perhaps flip through a dictionary. The meaning and spelling are all right there.<br>  <br>  Um, I think flash cards would be useful. If you made your words in the morning, go through them before bed to make sure you know them, and then you have them for later so you won't forget them, and you can go through them again. Also, with flash cards, you can flip them over and around so that you can guess word by difinition, or deifinition by word.<br>  <br>  Oh, sorry. On the flash cards, but the word on one side, and the definition on the other. And use a light pen or pencil. A marker will bleed through. Use note cards or half a note card to make them.

Some schools have the BSW program.  If you are interested in the master's or Ph.D. level degrees in social work I've seen people with varying degrees.  Which school you are accepted to for the MSW or DSW programs will depend on your application to that program and how committed you look to advancing their vision of social work.  So at the Bachelor's level it helps to have a sociology, anthropology, political science, social work, psychology, any science degree.  From there it all depends on how good of a writer or what work experience you've had.  <br>  <br>  Social work degreed people can do clinical counseling.  Other people performing counseling/therapy sometimes have substance abuse AA degrees, substance abuse training, bachelors degrees in social work, psychology, sociology, case work.  Counselors also can have master's degrees in the same as well as family and child counseling, alternative medicine (holistic/acupuncture), ...<br>  <br>  What really helps is to talk to people in behavioral health agencies.

oLI2SJ08aa	A good pre-med school is not needed for you to get into a good med school. You certainly don't need to go to Johns Hopkins for pre-med to be able to get into Johns Hopkins for medical school. You'll be fine going to community college for a year or two. Your basic medical school requirements will transfer over.<br>  <br>  To make yourself really prepared for med school, get experience. Do internships. Shadow doctors. Volunteer at a hospital.

Make sure your credits can transfer, but in the end where you take the courses that matter is what counts for med school.

Q7lvSU03aa	Every year the US News and World Report magazine puts out a special college edition.  They rank many colleges in the US and give a lot of basic information, including average GPA of accepted students and what percent of students are accepted.  They also have some basic information on their website, but the magazine was a major source for me when I was picking a college.<br>  <br>  The only other thing you need to consider is your SATs.  A good SAT score can make up for a lower GPA.  Also GPA is an average - so just keep working hard and you should be able to raise it.

tFHbilsYaa	Work study is one of many financial offers you might receive to help pay for your schooling. If you receive work study, then you will be able to get a job on campus and earn a portion of your expenses. If you are receive a full financial aid package that covers your educational expenses for the whole year, work study might reduce the amount you have to borrow by allowing you to earn the money working instead. <br>  <br>  At the two colleges that I have attended, the work study jobs were the best on campus. They are guarenteed to students with work study money, and they are often extremely flexible with your working hours. <br>  <br>  Finally, if you get a financial aid package and you decide later that you don't want work study, then most schools will let you drop it and borrow the difference (if you are not already borrowing the fedeal loan limits). <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3hqKWJi2aa	No. It is actually the opposite.

jmy2RXDKaa	Here Is John Talking About The Song:<br>  The first line was written on one acid trip one weekend. The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend, and it was filled in after I met Yoko. Part of it was putting down Hare Krishna. All these people were going on about Hare Krishna, Allen Ginsberg in particular. The reference to "Elementary penguin" is the elementary, naive attitude of going around chanting, "Hare Krishna", or putting all your faith in any one idol. I was writing obscurely, a la Dylan, in those days."<br>      * "It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant, like people are doing with The Beatles' work. Later, I went back and looked at it and realised that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought, Oh, ****, I picked the wrong guy. I should have said, 'I am the carpenter.' But that wouldn't have been the same, would it? [Singing] 'I am the carpenter....'"<br>  <br>  Some have speculated that the opening line, "I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together", is a parody of the opening line of "Marching to Pretoria", a folk song: "I'm with you and you're with me and we are all together." [7]<br>  <br>  The song also contains the exclamation goo goo g'joob with "koo koo g'joob" heard clearly in the second. Various hypotheses exist regarding the origin and meaning. One is that the phrase was derived from the similar "koo koo ka choo", to which it is often mondegreened, in Simon and Garfunkel's Mrs. Robinson, written in 1967. However, the film The Graduate, where "Mrs. Robinson" debuted, did not appear until December 1967, a month after "I Am the Walrus", and The Graduate Original Soundtrack (which contained only fragments of the final version of "Mrs Robinson") was not until January 1968.<br>  <br>  James Joyce's Finnegans Wake contains the words googoo goosth at the top of page *557, where it appears:<br>  <br>      ...like milk-juggles as if it was the wrake of the hapspurus or old Kong Gander O'Toole of the Mountains or his googoo goosth she seein, sliving off over the sawdust lobby out of the backroom, wan ter, that was everywans in turruns, in his honeymoon trim, holding up his fingerhals...|`|bNheuULUaa	it means there were drugs involved in writing it. but i guess a walrus is lazy and lays around all day no worries....idk...|`|87CAVhs2aa	Well... nothing.|`|OdvWnBC8aa	It means the beatles were on some major drugs when they wrote the song...

B2oo9SmIaa	I'm being honest, and I seriously think that your speech is too short. When you start with a two sentence intro, it ends too abruptly. Expand your intro and talk about fame and what it means to various people. And then you pop that first question. <br>  <br>  Your examples are good, but they are too short too. And in a speech, you've got to flow with your words. What you've written should be modified to make a speech. But overall, its good. Just expand parts of your speech to make it seem more deep and seem more lengthy. Hope this helps for you.

57j6hSjNaa	I'm studying anatomy and physiology also.. Your teacher is "cold-blooded" for doing that to you guys, but this will only make you a stronger student.<br>  <br>  First off, pace yourself, but never procrastinate. For ex. if your teacher says, "read chapter  24 and I'll test you tomorrow.." Make sure as soon as you get home, you start hitting those books.. Don't turn on the t.v. or eat a big meal, because it will make you tired. Get a snack to hold you over for a cpl hours. <br>  <br>  2. Secondly, sit at a table or desk with sufficient lighting. Never study on the couch or your bed. <br>  <br>  3. Skim the chapter in your book. Meaning get the jest of the topic the chapter is going to cover. Have a note book, pen and highlighter at your side. Then begin to read the book in depth and jot down anything that IS important and that YOU think is important.<br>  <br>  4. Ask yourself questions while reading. If the chapter is about the Integumentary system. Then write your notes Cornell style (just for organization purposes,) but write your notes in a manner you will remember and comprehend. <br>  <br>  5. These questions will help mold your notes. Such as "What is a integumentary system?" "What are the components?" "How does the skin system work?" "What allows these components to work?" Ask the what, who, why & how questions. <br>  <br>  6. Answer these questions briefly. Then write an example, in a way you can relate and make sense of the it. <br>  <br>  7. The book also has outlines. Make sure to understand those outlines under the main topic. Write them in your notes also in a brief way with examples.<br>  <br>  8. Use flashcards. All the highlighted words or definitions in your chapter should be on your flashcards. Practice an hour with these cards. That way you can quiz yourself or ask someone else to quiz you.<br>  <br>  9. Take a break. Take a water, snack or bathroom break.. Maybe listen to a fav song or two. Then go back to work, no later that 15 mins. <br>  <br>  10.

XCzpQvDvaa	I'm just getting done my welding diploma now and i started with no knowledge of the trade and now I hold 8 tickets in it and am top 5 in the class. Welding is alot of fun, everyday is something new and you can take pride in your work, however it is very skill based and you need to get the arc time in to develop those skills and maintain them. When your looking into a welding college make sure they teach SMAW(stick), GMAW(mig), FCAW(fluxcore), GTAW(Tig) and pulse mig and tig, because those are becoming more wide spread in the field and it will help to have experience in the new technology. An average day at my college is about 4 hours of shop time welding and then 2-4 hours of theory, the book work is easy as long as you pay attention. If you want to be an extremely good welder you should be very dexterous because you need to have complete control over yourself while you weld(I'm talking overhead mainly and pipe welding). Over all i think welding is a great career, salaries range from $10-$150 per hour depending on how good you are and what connections you have and theres lots of room to expand like weld inspection.|`|YBRQsmLMaa	To weld means to join/fuse 2 pieces of metal-by hammering or pressing or fusing.Welding schools teach and train the apprentice to do  welding by all  the 3 methods.Remember it is asier said than done.It's a tough joblAnd unfortunately ,inspite of the  hazards,the wages are miserably low which is a typical Indian tradition.|`|xtVRvomJaa	i dont know much about welding but if you want you could send in a cv to a local weder and ask for work experience for a week and see if you like it. also ask a person or friend who has done welding before if they would reccomend it. remember ask them lots of questions|`|lrlhdPjJaa	yea it is a pretty cool job my dad is one and he is happy with his job
28d2ee07c2da4f8c9116c55988afad58aa	1.) Candy does not want to kill his dog because it has been with him for a very long time and he loves it dearly. He does not know what he would do if he killed it.<br>  <br>  2.) Candy says this because he feels that if someone was to shoot him, it should be him as it is respectable and it makes sense to start and end life with Candy. Letting a stranger do it is not respectable and does not let Candy have THE last moment and the respect of doing it himself. (The dog was going to die soon anyway, he was very sick and old).<br>  <br>  3.) Curley picks on Lennie because Lennie is a physically big guy. Curley is very short and small and does not like big men as he says earlier in the story.<br>  <br>  4.) Lennie is scared and does not know waht to do. He is not used to making decisions himself, he usually just listens to George. He also does not want to risk losing his oppurtunity to take care of the rabbits.|`|jM7CyxQzaa	It's years since I read this<br>  <br>  I think Candy didn't want to kill his dog because he couldn't bring himself to do it. Partly because both he and the dog were old he saw himself in the dog.<br>  <br>  Candy then felt guilty that he didn't do the 'last thing' for his dog and instead let a stranger do it.<br>  <br>  Curly picked on Lennie because he was both frightened of him and a bully in general - like all bullies he picked the one who couldn't fight back for his victime<br>  <br>  Because Lennie was mentally retarded and had neither the sense to stand up for himself, or the mental ability to know he was being picked on, he was basically a very gentle man.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, if you don't get any more answers then it may...<br>  <br>  Good luck with the homework|`|DhzGbsGbaa	- He doesnt want to kill his dog because he's had it for a long time and its one of his only friends<br>  -He says this because it should have been someone close to the dog saving it from misery then a stranger killing it because it smells.<br>  -Curley picks on Lenny because he is staring at him with a smile on his face because he is dreaming of living of the fat of the land.|`|pwXK9A4haa	i would go to your local library first thing tomorrow and get a copy of it. their is also a movie of this book. i saw it like ten million years ago so i can't remember enough to answer this question.

It was just too much for him to leave his man's best friend.<br>  <br>  Candy said he should have shot his dog because it was HIS, not someone else's. He regrets not doing it himself. It was his hand that should have pulled the trigger.<br>  <br>  Curly picks on Lennie because, I believe He is jealous by his size and strength. Curly is a tiny man and always has to prove the other guys he's tough. Since Lennie is kind of retarded, Curly can pick on him without worrying be insulted/agreed back.<br>  <br>  Lennie doesn't fight back when Curly hit him because he only listens to George. Lennie couldn't understand why he was being hit, really. So he was just waiting for George's permission.|`|Vy4jvBjDaa	Candy doesn't want to kill his dog because it was his only friend, and he raised it from a pup.<br>  He says he should of shot it because he thought it was terrible that he let someone else put an end to the dog he raised and love for so many years. He thought he should be the one to put it to rest.<br>  Curly picks on Lennie because he noticed his disability, and Curly's a jerk. He knew Lennie would do little back.<br>  Lennie didn't fight back because George told him to not cause any trouble.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Of Mice and Men - CliffsNotes<br>  Online study guide for John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men.

If you're humming with your mouth closed, your nose is the only way for the air to escape, so blocking your nose stops the humming.|`|44b4fdd7ed7cc42e599ec8a9302e9632aa	yes, the humming sound comes through our noses, you can also hum with your mouth open.|`|6YCl499eaa	When I tried humming to figure it out, I just noticed that we usually hum with out mouths closed.

Qu9V3AiPaa	I am doing the same thing. My lecturer has given us a spec to follow and we basically compile a folder according to that spec. You must research small businesses that may be struggling and the reasons why i.e the credit crunch. These businesses can be in the farming industry or other industries. Make case studies of these businesses and possibly apply analytical frame work. The case studies must be compared to struggling farming businesses and should have similar problems. The main aim is to find a solution to stop the struggle. The main solution is to diversify so make a brainstorm on how diversifying can help.

wzxmWDs4aa	Did you do the suffragettes at GCSE?<br>  It's a really easy topic that I did for an open essay question, and the title I used was:<br>  <br>  "Did the violence of the Suffragettes eclipse all their other achievements?"<br>  <br>  The answer is pretty much yes, and you can introduce the work of the suffragists and look into the violence of the suffragettes. Also you can argue that theoretically it was not the actions of the suffragettes that ultimately brought about the vote - that was the beginning of World War 2. But they did highlight the cause, and were the precursors of feminism. You can also look at male attitudes towards women in the victorian era - there are load sof really good sources (important for history) and cartoons, and loads of info on the internet.<br>  <br>  Other good ideas:<br>  <br>  -Who was the historical Robin Hood?<br>  - What effects did Lincoln's emancipation proclomation have on slaves?<br>  -Compare and contrast an Civil rights in Maoist China, with those in 1960s USA<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!<br>  Let me know if you need any more advice for the suffragettes if you decide to do it!|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Sex in the Whitehouse

Low biotic diversity<br>     3. Simple vegetation structure<br>     4. Limitation of drainage<br>     5. Short season of growth and reproduction<br>     6.

The arctic is known for its cold, desert-like conditions. The growing season ranges from 50 to 60 days. The average winter temperature is -34° C (-30° F), but the average summer temperature is 3-12° C (37-54° F) which enables this biome to sustain life. Rainfall may vary in different regions of the arctic. Yearly precipitation, including melting snow, is 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches). Soil is formed slowly. A layer of permanently frozen subsoil called permafrost exists, consisting mostly of gravel and finer material. When water saturates the upper surface, bogs and ponds may form, providing moisture for plants. There are no deep root systems in the vegetation of the arctic tundra, however, there are still a wide variety of plants that are able to resist the cold climate. There are about 1,700 kinds of plants in the arctic and subarctic.|`|MJFvBOjfaa	The arctic fox lives in the borean tundras. They normally have to dig through ice to find the nutrients it needs in the dirt, but it normally eats small mice and other rodents. (packs have been found to take on larger creatures in the tundras though)  Other animals are rodents, rabbits, wolves, and fish of course! The plant life is normally ever greens, like pine trees, rowan trees, and cork-bulb. The arctic fox migrates to the north when it gets warmer actually because they are used to the cold temp. of the tundra. Hope it helps!|`|BM2RLpKWaa	''Does the price of perfume effect how long it would last?''

Same with the Romans.|`|1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	hand  <br>  O.E. hond, from P.Gmc. *khanduz (cf. O.S., O.Fris., Du., Ger. hand, O.N. h?nd, Goth. handus). The original O.E. plural handa was superseded in M.E. by handen, later hands. Meaning "person who does something with his hands" is from 1590, hence "hired workman" (1655) and "sailor in a ship's crew" (1669). Clock and watch sense is from 1575. Meaning "round of applause" is from 1838. The linear measure of 4 inches (originally 3) is from 1561, now used only in giving the height of horses. The meaning "playing cards held in one player's hand" is from 1630; that of "a round at a card game" is from 1622. The verb is from 1642. First hand, second hand, etc. (1439) are from the notion of something being passed down from hand to hand. Out of hand (1597) is opposite of in hand "under control" (c.1200). Hand over fist (1825) is suggestive of sailors and fishermen hauling in nets. Hands-on (adj.) is first recorded 1969; hands-off (adj.) is from 1902. Hand-jive is from 1958. Hand job is 1940s; hand-me-down as a modifier is first recorded 1874. To win something hands down (1867) is from horse racing, from a jockey's gesture of letting the reins go loose in an easy victory. To hand it to (someone) "acknowledge someone's ability" is slang from c.1906. Handy is from c.1310; handful was in O.E. Phrase on the one hand ... on the other hand is recorded from 1638, a fig. use of the physical sense of hand in reference to position on one side or the other side of the body (as in the lefthand side), which goes back to O.E. Hands up! as a command from a policeman, robber, etc., is from 1873. Hand-to-mouth is from 1509.|`|YA2TzdRxaa	The word "hand" comes from the German word "Hand", (pronounced  Hant).This is because the Saxons invaded England before the Norman Conquest.<br>                English is a language made up of many different roots.

That will open up many more doors for you.  I don't want to stereotype, but the spanish population is the fastest growing in our country.  In your field, with a degree in Spanish, you can write your own ticket.  Do a semester in Spain or a summer or two in Costa Rica with the school.  It will help greatly, and look great on the resume.  Good Luck!

RAxSichXaa	Here is a start:  <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/molecular-weight-gas-vapor-d_1156.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/molecu...</a><br>  <br>  You need to know that a mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters at Standard Temperature and Pressure, so you need to know that:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_co...</a><br>  <br>  Your instructor or your text should tell you which standard you are to use, otherwise for simplicity use one atmosphere pressure and room temperature.<br>  OK, so a mole of O2 is approximately 32 grams.  34g/32g = 1.06 moles<br>  <br>  1.06 moles x 22.4 l/mole = 23.8 liters.  <br>  <br>  You may also need to know about the "Ideal Gas Law" which says that<br>  Pressure x Volume / Temperature is constant.  So if you change one thing at least one of the other things must change.<br>  <br>  Let P1V1/T1 be the original set of values and P2V2/T2 be the values after the changes are made.<br>  <br>  then P1V1/T1=P2V2/T2.   It is important to know that pressure must be in terms of absolute pressure and not standard gage pressure and temperature must be relative to absolute zero.<br>  <br>  I hope this is helpful.  I know it might be more than you asked for but you will probably encounter it all sooner or later.

mhFpZT3laa	They take very few of their own pre-meds, but this number is still far greater than any other single university. The inside man always has an advantage.<br>  <br>  the biggest things to get into medical school, aside from GPA and MCAT scores, are that you have had interesting and meaningful experiences in:<br>  1) Community Service<br>  2) Medically related volunteering/work<br>  3) Research (most important for those wanting to go to a research heavy school)<br>  <br>  Everything else that you do outside of these three areas is what makes you unique, interesting, and can only improve your chances. I personally feel that one of my strongest features when applying was my dancing experiences. These three things, especially 1 and 2, are critical to many schools, because it shows both a tendency towards compassion and charity, as well as provides you with a basis to prove why you want to go to medical school. Because of this, here are my personal recommendations on selecting a school.<br>  <br>  1) Has a research program that is large enough to sustain undergraduate participation.<br>  Look for schools that have undergraduate thesis projects, undergraduate fellowship positions, etc. A school with Research 1 designation is great, because that means there are tons of research projects going on. If you never publish or present a paper, that's fine. However, doing so can be a major boost, especially if you are author or co-author, or even 29th author of a paper that makes it into a major journal like Nature. It does not necessarily have to be medically related research, but I would recommend it if you are contemplating MD/PhD.<br>  <br>  2) A moderately well known school.<br>  I personally would recommend limiting your choices to one of the top 200 or so schools. You want a school that has had a decent number of pre-meds, because this increases the chances of an admissions committee knowing something about the opportunities available at your school. It also increases your chances of getting good advising from a pre-med office. I am a member of the faction that believes that prestige is not a significant factor in the admissions process. Having gone to a public school that isn't even ranked in the Top 100, I have interviewed at a number of the Top 20, 10, and 5 schools. I personally believe that your own merits outweigh the name of your school significantly. This is not to say that I believe a 3.5 is the same as one school than another. Admissions committees often have "experts" on a given school, or look at statistics like the average GPA and MCAT score of pre-meds in past years. Thus, a 3.5 at Princeton might be more impressive than a 3.5 at John Doe public school, simply because the average GPA and MCAT score at Princeton is a 3.5/33, and a 3.5/28 at John Doe. Clearly, it was harder to earn a 3.5 and 33 at Princeton than a 3.5 and 33 at John Doe (though, the equal MCAT scores would somewhat minimize this). Suffice it to say that a 3.5 and 28 at Harvard isn't going to beat out a 3.8 and 31 at John Doe, all other things being equal. This being said, I feel that opportunities at the more prestigious undergrad schools outside of academics are excellent. However, I feel that any big public school like OSU, ASU, etc will have similar opportunities by virtue of their sheer size. Any school that made it in the top 200 should have enough of everything for you to succeed if you are good enough. If you are good enough at one place, you are good enough anywhere, so long as you aren't handicapped.<br>  <br>  3) A School with a medical school or that is near one.<br>  The inside man always has an advantage. If you went to Harvard College, you will have a stronger shot at Harvard Med. This is because you have three years to build relationships with the medical school, do research under doctors affiliated (and thus get letters) with the school, and become an expert on that school. The opportunity to work with doctors at any medical school probably increases your chances everywhere. There is always the chance that they will be recognized, and its a great way to get insight in academic medicine.<br>  <br>  4) Go to a school near a reasonably sized city.<br>  Cities have a lot going for them by virtue of their huge populations. There are all sorts of activities available in research, community service, and just fun things that will make you a more well rounded and interesting person. Being near a city means you will also be near at least a few good hospitals or clinics. This saves you on travel time and ease of access, as it is likely students from your school have already built connections with nearby schools.
AA10176626	Mrs. Trujillo:<br>  <br>  Your research and conclusions are dead on. In fact, I'd say that more than 99% of the information on Federal grants is false.<br>  <br>  Federal grants are awarded by various government agencies to enable research organizations, state and local governments, colleges and universities, and social service organizations to perform a service - a service that the government finds useful or necessary.<br>  <br>  For example, a local social services organization might need help establishing a new food bank service for the hardcore homeless of a rural community in Wyoming. Either their grant writer, or a professional agency would sit down and put together dozens of pages of grant application, trying to convince the government of the need for the service, and the organization's unique qualifications for providing it.<br>  <br>  The key is that the government awards "grants" for DOING something. Grants are not awarded for being part of some group, or having some handicap, or being a single mom, or being in a really bad financial bind.<br>  <br>  The government offers ONE large-scale group of grant program for individuals - those are the grants that are part of the post-secondary financial aid system - grants for college. Even that's a situation where the government is supporting people who "do something" - because it's a good public policy to encourage the population to become educated. An educated population is a healthier, more efficient, and more self-supporting organization than a less educated one. So the government awards grants to students who would otherwise be unable to afford the cost of a college or technical education.<br>  <br>  If you want a financial aid grant, you must be a registered student at an eligible institution of higher education. The "grants" are paid directly to the school on your behalf, so you can't qualify unless you will be attending one of these schools.<br>  <br>  You apply for all forms of federal student aid, including the various grant programs, by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA. <br>  <br>  When completing the FAFSA, you'll answer more than 100 questions about your personal and financial circumstances, and that information will be used to evaluate your financial aid need. The Department of Education will calculate an Expected Family Contribution score, and send that score to any school that you ask them to send it to. The financial aid office at that school will use your EFC score to determine what forms of aid you qualify for, and what types of aid the school has available.<br>  <br>  If your EFC score is particularly low (less than 4041), you are said to have demonstrated "exceptional need", and you will qualify for the need-based forms of financial aid - these are the types of aid that include grants. If you do not demonstrate exceptional need, you will be offered access to the government's Stafford lending program.<br>  <br>  There are NO forms of grants for personal financial assistance, like paying bills, fixing up your house, avoiding foreclosure, etc. There are also NO forms of grants for being a single mom, being an Aleutian eskimo, or being the direct descendant of a Mayflower Pilgrim.<br>  <br>  The government DOES provide financial assistance - but those are not grant programs, those are means-tested government benefits programs. You've heard of these programs before - they're things like SSI, Food Stamps, TANF (which used to be called welfare), Veteran's benefits, disaster relief - programs like those.

LwywrSRkaa	Sounds like you will be able to manage it with those A's and A*'s, that's great! However you said you didn't have to work hard for your mocks but that doesn't mean you shouldn't work hard for your A-Levels because it is VERY different from GCSE's. But if you picked further maths, do you really need to pick maths? Maybe you should swap it for a language like French, as many medical terms are French terms. It will give you a different advantage. =) Oh and I don't know if psychology however is seen as a 'soft' A-Level so you should check that to make sure.
wzxmWDs4aa	There is no point in doing 5 A levels - no university requires it, and it's a big jump from GCSE to AS level, you might find it harder than you think.<br>  <br>  I did four A-levels and I didn't drop a subject at AS.<br>  I would advise you to drop the psychology if you want to get into medical school. It's not really taken that seriously by UK universities and viewed as a bit of a doss. Just do four, and don't drop one at AS if you can take it!! The more subjects you take, the more you will be expected to get A grades in. Just work at getting the highest mark on the ones you do have.<br>  <br>  Why put yourself through more work than you have to? because A levels are a lot of work!|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Ouch.. 5 A levels.. :\<br>  I'm only doing 3 (if I stay in 6th form) but my grades are lower than yours..

Most tech companies today have a branch that functions in China, and Japan is known for it's tech sector. <br>  It's about betting on the future importance of that country's industry.

t5rol0y6aa	It depends on whether you owe the school or Pell or Loans from an R2T4 calculation if you stopped attending all of your classes before.  You have to attend class at least 60% of the semester.  Just ask the previous school if you owe Pell or the school.  If you did not receive aid the first time then it shouldnt be a problem.   If you did you could also be on financial aid probation or suspension.  If you are not on FA Sus then you will be able to receive all aid.  Go to www.pin.ed.gov and apply for a pin number , then www.fafsa.ed.gov to complete the 09-10 FA application with your 2008 tax info and sign it with your pin number.

3S4ci6Traa	For a question like this I'd look at the root definition of each of the key words.  The key words would be "perplexity", "bewildered", and "pity".<br>  <br>  perplexity: a tangled, involved, or confused condition or situation.<br>  bewildered: completely puzzled or confused.<br>  pity: to have compassion or show mercy for.<br>  <br>  Since "bewildered" is describing the "pity", that's where the imagery would come into play, while the phrase in itself is adding upon the thought of the "perplexity" of the given situation.  It may help to look at the full sentence rather than just that fragment, but I'll go with what I have here.  From this standpoint, I would have to guess that the situation conjures a feeling of confusion, but not a normal sort of riddled confusion, more of a confusion of being stuck inbetwixt two feelings.  This in turn creates a feeling of self-pity in the individual due to the internal struggle between the two feelings or thoughts.|`|YWgrU1k9aa	Is there a person feeling confused (perplexity), or feeling puzzled sympathy (bewildered pity) for someone or something?<br>  <br>  Do these things create an image in your mind?

86DXgyTdaa	It's not usually anything to do with political correctness, its to do with whatever the person that writes the exams choose to put them as. Most of the people that write the exams are also teachers at the same time, so it is really common for them to use their students names in the exam paper.

yiyvlbKLaa	you better thank me for this =)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Birth and death<br>   <br>  Statue of King Leonidas I in SpartaSparta was above all a militarist state, and emphasis on military fitness began virtually at birth. Shortly after birth, the mother of the child bathed it in wine to see whether the child was strong. If the child survived it was brought before the Gerousia by the child's father. The Gerousia then decided whether it was to be reared or not. If they considered it "puny and deformed", the baby was thrown into a chasm on Mount Taygetos known euphemistically as the Apothetae (Gr., ?ποθ?τα?, "Deposits").[53][54] This was, in effect, a primitive form of eugenics.[55]<br>  <br>  There is some evidence that the exposure of unwanted children was practiced in other Greek regions, including Athens.[56]<br>  <br>  When Spartans died, marked headstones would only be granted to soldiers who died in combat during a victorious campaign or women who died either in service of a divine office or in childbirth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Education<br>  Main article: Agoge<br>  When male Spartans began military training at age seven, they would enter the Agoge system. The Agoge was designed to encourage discipline and physical toughness and to emphasise the importance of the Spartan state. Boys lived in communal messes and were deliberately underfed, to encourage them to master the skill of stealing food. Besides physical and weapons training, boys studied reading, writing, music and dancing. Special punishments were imposed if boys failed to answer questions sufficiently 'laconically' (i.e. briefly and wittily).[57] At the age of twelve, the Agoge obliged Spartan boys to take an older male mentor, usually an unmarried young man. The older man was expected to function as a kind of substitute father and role model to his junior partner; however, it is also reasonably certain that they had sexual relations (the exact nature of Spartan pederasty is not entirely clear).[58]<br>  <br>  At the age of eighteen, Spartan boys became reserve members of the Spartan army. On leaving the Agoge they would be sorted into groups, whereupon some were sent into the countryside with only a knife and forced to survive on their skills and cunning. This was called the Krypteia, and the immediate object of it was to seek out and kill any helots as part of the larger program of terrorising and intimidating the helot population.[59]<br>  <br>  Less information is available about the education of Spartan girls, but they seem to have gone through a fairly extensive formal educational cycle, broadly similar to that of the boys but with less emphasis on military training. In this respect, classical Sparta was unique in ancient Greece. In no other city-state did women receive any kind of formal education.[60]<br>  <br>  <br>  Military life<br>  Main article: Spartan Army<br>   <br>  Marble statue of a helmed hoplite (5th century BC), Arch?ological Museum of Sparta, GreeceAt age twenty, the Spartan citizen began his membership in one of the syssitia (dining messes or clubs), composed of about fifteen members each, of which every citizen was required to be a member. Here each group learned how to bond and rely on one another. The Spartan exercised the full rights and duties of a citizen at the age of thirty. Only native Spartans were considered full citizens and were obliged to undergo the training as prescribed by law, as well as participate in and contribute financially to one of the syssitia.[61]<br>  <br>  Spartan men remained in the active reserve until age sixty. Men were encouraged to marry at age twenty but could not live with their families until they left their active military service at age thirty. They called themselves "homoioi" (equals), pointing to their common lifestyle and the discipline of the phalanx, which demanded that no soldier be superior to his comrades.[62] Insofar as hoplite warfare could be perfected, the Spartans did so.[63]<br>  <br>  Thucydides reports that when Spartan men went to war, their wives (or another women of some significance) would customarily present them with their shield and say: "With this, or upon this" (? τ?ν ? ?π? τ??, èi tàn èi èpì tàs), meaning that true Spartans could only return to Sparta either victorious (with their shield in hand) or dead (carried upon it).[64] If a Spartan hoplite were to return to Sparta alive and without his shield, it was assumed that he threw his shield at the enemy in an effort to flee; an act punishable by death or banishment. A soldier losing his helmet, breastplate or greaves (leg armour) was not similarly punished, as these items were personal pieces of armour designed to protect one man, whereas the shield not only protected the individual soldier but in the tightly packed Spartan phalanx was also instrumental in protecting the soldier to his left from harm. Thus the shield was symbolic of the individual soldier's subordination to his unit, his integral part in its success, and his solemn responsibility to his comrades in arms — messmates and friends, often close blood relations.

AA10948829	Yes, it's allowed as in there is no law against it (although your university may have different ideas), but your plan probably isn't going to work the way you think it will.<br>  <br>  American universities are not the same as American high schools. Regular high school classes can often be a joke. Very little homework is assigned, class work isn't challenging, and tests are nothing to worry about. Classes go at a slow pace and only the basics are ever covered. This is why serious students take honors and AP classes, which are at least somewhat of a step up from the regular classes. Teachers are much more attentive and lenient, as well.<br>  <br>  University classes aren't like that--especially once you get out of introductory courses. While you may only have an hour for each class' homework (sometimes more and sometimes less depending on the class) for lower division classes, you're going to be spending a lot more time on upper division classes than I really think you realize. You're going to have hours and hours of book-reading to do, research to do, papers to write, and homework problems to do that you're going to burn yourself out really fast, stress yourself out, and find yourself strapped for time. You won't get to know your professors or make any valuable connections during your time at college (because there is more to college than school and partying; you also need to be KNOWN to people so you have a chance of starting your career right after graduation).<br>  <br>  And, anyway, this is all with the big "IF" you'll be allowed to take those credits all at once and nothing goes awry with your master plan anyway. How do you even expect to afford all this?|`|bbw4Trzgaa	Check with your dean with regards to your current degree.  What degree do you plan on getting?  Each degree is different, for example my A.A.S. degree requires 60 credits.  Good luck, you sound like a great student, don't worry about socializing!  Just be yourself and you will do great.|`|AA10952792	the schools here are kind of a joke, especially here in California, compared to the rest of the world. but anyway, you might not be able to. some schools require a residency meaning you have to take a certain amount of units there. my school does. and taking more than a full load requires approval form the dept. but if can show you are capable you are good to go. and plus, you really need to be sure the classes you are taking are for the right cal state. so many people transfer form a CC and have to retake certain GE's because they don't transfer. and some schools, like mine, only let you take maybe 1 or 2 classes at another college at the same time. so ask an admissions adviser at the cal state you intend on studying at and ask them. you might not be able to exactly what you want.|`|XtGF2jpcaa	I definitely applaud you for doing this all in two years, (Im graduating 3) I guessing that your current 4-year school probably has a limit on how many credits you can transfer in (usually 60) So while the plan is great you should definitely discuss it with your advisor.<br>  <br>  Two things to note: 1)  If you are planning on continuing to Grad school, too many CC credits (or paticular ones) will hurt your chances of getting in. 2) Be cautioned that your quality of education will be significantly hurt so I  definitely recommend talking to your advisor at your 4-yr school to figure out the best plan. Best of Luck!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	High schools in America are a joke.  Universities are a different matter.  I think you're in for a rude awakening.  It's not a matter of what's allowed; you earn a bachelors degree after earning a certain number of credits.  If it takes you two years, great.  If it takes you 6, fine.  Most people try to finish in 4.  I think you might want to restrict yourself to, say, 3 summer courses to start with and see what the workload really is.  Most colleges recommend students take at most 2 at a time.

zCOvQwQhaa	It's not hard to answer at all because you're asking about the average teacher and not a specific teacher or a specific location.<br>  <br>  According to the US Dept. of Labor (the people that track such things), the median income of the group "Teachers—Preschool, Kindergarten, Elementary, Middle, and Secondary" is $43,580 to $48,690.  Median means that it is the middle - half make more, half make less.  <br>  <br>  The lowest 10% make $28,590 to $33,070 while the highest 10% make $67,490 to $76,100.<br>  <br>  It doesn't mean the same as "starting salary" which the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) tells us is $31,753 with a bachelor's degree and no experience.  AFT tells us that the average salary of all teachers is $47,602 which is right in the range that the Dept. of Labor tells us is the median.<br>  <br>  How much you (or any other teacher) can make depends on your education level, where you teach, experience level, and additional activities (such as coaching or administration).|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Tough to answer because it can vary by $25,000 depending on what state you work in.  Best guess in Ohio is about $45,000, starting salary is about $30,000.|`|hfDohxp5aa	Salary schedules are public information. You can call any school district and find out their starting pay and how you can go up the pay schedule.

If that fixes it, you were thirsty.<br>  <br>  2.  It takes time for the full signal to get to the brain.  Fix a plate of what looks like a reasonable serving.  Then wait for 15 minutes - that give the signal time to get through.  Eat slowly and be aware of each bite.  Savor the taste and chew each bit 20 times. <br>  <br>  3. Eat what you want, not just what you think you should.  Making something forbidden, and you can't think of anything else.  Say "I will not thing of hot fudge sundays, I will not think of hot fudge sundays."  Close you eyes and what is the first thing that comes to mind?  Sometimes if you can just have one serving of what is calling to you , you can get past it.<br>  <br>  4. Sometimes you think you are hungry, when you are really using food to change your mood.  If you are bored - you use food to entertain yourself.  If you are upset, you use food to make yourself feel better.  This is not the same as hungry, but it can feel like it.  If you feel bad, close your eyes and remember a happy time.

cMZEmpp0aa	It depends on the college. Many colleges allow people to request a specific roommate (e.g. if you and a friend are going to the same college, you would each request to room with the other). If you don't have a friend you would like to room with, you'll probably wind up filling out some kind of questionnaire or psychological evaluation so the school can learn more about your personality and try to pair you with someone compatible. Many schools also have dorms or floors specifically for groups of students -- for example, it's not unusual for first-year students to be grouped together in specific dorms, so it's also likely that your roommate in your freshman year would also be a freshman.<br>  <br>  Really though, if you want a definite answer to this, your best bet is to contact the housing department at your school and ask if they can tell you about the process of assigning roommates.|`|hU9e2O7Gaa	It really does depend on what college you go to but it typically goes like this: you will fill out a basic questionnaire asking how you live like cleanliness, whether you smoke or not, your sleeping habits, etc. They try to match according to that.

D:|`|76652fe766b064dedfef1f9a09de248faa	Deep-sea fish, defined as those living below 200 m, inhabit a most unusual photic environment, being exposed to two sources of visible radiation; very dim downwelling sunlight and bioluminescence, both of which are, in most cases, maximal at wavelengths around 450-500 nm. This paper summarises the reflective properties of the ocular tapeta often found in these animals, the pigmentation of their lenses and the absorption characteristics of their visual pigments. Deep-sea tapeta usually appear blue to the human observer, reflecting mainly shortwave radiation. However, reflection in other parts of the spectrum is not uncommon and uneven tapetal distribution across the retina is widespread. Perhaps surprisingly, given the fact that they live in a photon limited environment, the lenses of some deep-sea teleosts are bright yellow, absorbing much of the shortwave part of the spectrum. Such lenses contain a variety of biochemically distinct pigments which most likely serve to enhance the visibility of bioluminescent signals. Of the 195 different visual pigments characterised by either detergent extract or microspectrophotometry in the retinae of deep-sea fishes, ca. 87% have peak absorbances within the range 468-494 nm. Modelling shows that this is most likely an adaptation for the detection of bioluminescence. Around 13% of deep-sea fish have retinae containing more than one visual pigment. Of these, we highlight three genera of stomiid dragonfishes, which uniquely produce far red bioluminescence from suborbital photophores. Using a combination of longwave-shifted visual pigments and in one species (Malacosteus niger) a chlorophyll-related photosensitizer, these fish have evolved extreme red sensitivity enabling them to see their own bioluminescence and giving them a private spectral waveband invisible to other inhabitants of the deep-ocean.|`|KAUHdcF1aa	<a href="http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.genet.42.110807.091417?cookieSet=1&journalCode=genet" rel="nofollow">http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/...</a>|`|ZQxCcG6qaa	larger surface area of body...so they can obtain as much light that is available..|`|oRXdDPBvaa	blue|`|7sqpiGgoaa	bigger leaves? idk

However, it's important to know the theory to be well educated in science.<br>  <br>  So yes, you will have to learn evolution, but there's not much time spent on it and you don't have to believe it- Just don't make a huge fuss when the topic is brought up.<br>  <br>  ALSO:<br>  In regards to the answer above me, no, not every public school has people being shot.

You're school will probably have a group of Christians with similar beliefs to yours that you can hang out with.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	No there is no such thing as an evolution class. However the topic is covered in a science class.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	Public school is an ungodly place. there's no prayer in it. Nothing like private school. Yes, they do teach evolution in biology class, DO NOT LET THEM BRAINWASH YOU!!!<br>  <br>  Public school is also filled with drugs, alcohol, smoking, sex, bullies, shootings, etc.<br>  <br>  Switch to home school, you'll be glad you did.|`|LfLJtSTxaa	Uh, no. In my experience, you don't even really get into evolution unless you take certain upper-level biology classes in high school. Even then, it's not a very thorough study at all. Middle school general science is far too broad to dwell on any one topic for very long, and you spend more time on earth/space science and simple physics than you do on chemistry and biology, which is what evolution falls under. What little biology there is in middle school is more of an extremely brief and shallow overview of anatomy and physiology than anything else.<br>  <br>  So no, there is no such thing as an "evolution class." If there is such a science class that deals strictly with evolution, it's probably offered in college, not in public middle or high school, and it's probably more of a discussion/debate class than a practical science. So you have nothing to fear. Just remember: what you are taught in science class is not meant to be an attack on your personal beliefs, so don't take it that way. It will only make you look silly.<br>  <br>  Honestly, though, I have several friends that came to public high school after having been at a private school for eight years, and none of them have ever expressed a desire to go back to private school.

LJkPRqN0aa	it seems kind of amateur to me....i personally wouldnt be asking a question at all in the intro... the intro is suppose to involve what you are going to talk about in your next body paragraphs.... in order of what you are going to talk about. and i dont really see the subjects you are going to discuss unless they are "laws are necessary to maintain a civil socienty for the sake of humanity by avoiding anarchy, restricting the human nature of impulse, and creating and allusion of what is right" if that is what you are talking about i would definitely minimize those into simpler words.... they are too long of an explanation....needs work but its an ok start.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	The point of view seems to be confusing.

GF1NPlBSaa	Clemson is considered a "more selective" university so there's a lot of competition to get in.  You have to have a very strong academic record to receive consideration.  I think this link will help you with actual statistics:  <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/oirweb1/fb/factBook/CommonDataSet2008.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.clemson.edu/oirweb1/fb/factBo...</a><br>  <br>  Specifically, see sections C7 (take special note: extracurricular activites and work history are *not considered* in the selection process--in other words, don't let your grades suffer by joining lots of clubs), C9 (SAT/ACT scores), and C10 (high school rank percentiles).  <br>  <br>  Clemson does NOT claim that "almost all" their students are in the top 10% of their HS class.  It does, however, indicate that 84% of this year's freshman class were in the top 25%.  I think your class percentile gives you a really good chance.  SAT scores are what receive the most consideration from Clemson, I believe, so definitely concentrate on that.  I believe the average SAT score last year was 1230 but you should aim to be in at least the 75th percentile or above, i.e. you should attempt to score above 1320.<br>  <br>  Also, this link indicates that in 2006-07 the average unweighted GPA was 3.59 (on a 4.0 scale), so you should aim for that (preferably higher). <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/prospectivestudents/documents/CollegePortraitCLEMSON.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.clemson.edu/prospectivestuden...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Clemson is getting more selective each year as it climbs in the rankings.

d8876255c27f26ef43eeab619d5cc580aa	Thesis: "It can be shown that during WWII jewish children had the desire, strength and will to survive Hitlers holocaust by hiding in the most dangerous and unforgivable places". Something like this may work. I have read a great deal on these issues and children would do anything to survive and that means ANYTHING. I have read of some who actually slept at night in sewage systems, inside of outhouses, or some good Samaritans who helped to hide children and these places were not very nice places to be, yet they lived to see liberation. Places such as bunkers under pig stys on farms, or simply changing their (identities) names and religions and live with families that were not their own. All of it reads to be very heartbreaking. Do research to find the depths of what these children would do to live, where they would hide and even the outside help that they recieved to accomplish such greatness. And by that I mean that I wonder if kids today would go to such lengths and have such street smarts to evade capture from the most brutal regimes in history.<br>  <br>  The significance of the survival of (children) holocaust victims is that they lived to tell their story and they lived to do what Hitler tried to deny the world...procreation of more jews. Hitler wanted the world to be rid of jew's, gypsies, cripples and other "undesirables" , yet these children lived and became productive happy citizens adding to the jewish population. By the way, there is a great deal out there to read on this subject,.

You start by doing research into your topic. Then you draw conclusions from your research, and once you have those conclusions, you write your thesis statement around them. <br>  The topic 'Children hiding during the Holocaust' is too open ended. You need to refine it more. Are you talking about how children hid? Who hid them? Why they were hidden? How successful attempts were at hiding children? What happened to them after the war ended? <br>  Depending on your research (and this is going to be a difficult topic to research as other than Anne Frank's diary, there are not a whole lot of testimonies about hiding) you might want to touch on the moral dilemma of a child who is hidden away when their family is marched off to the concentration camp. Would there be a pull to go with the family? Or to save themselves? How about the ages of the children involved? Could they be safely assimilated into a German family? <br>  There are so many permutations of this theme, but your conclusions are going to depend on what your research tells you.|`|NJhXW72Yaa	I am not sure as to what your stand is , but, how about something like this:  During a time in Nazi Germany, many people, including men, women and children suffered horrid atrocities at the hand of the  Gestapo, the SS and from concentration camps.  Many died during this time period, children included, but, some children hid during the Holocaust, most notably Anne Frank. <br>  <br>  Email me if you need more help.

Almost too perfect that they are somewhat robotic. <br>  <br>  Then one day, someone passes the wealthy guy a note. This person is desperate to leave the island but cannot. He/she tells the wealthy guy that since young, the inhabitants have been fed all kinds of propaganda and are brainwashed. Worse, there's a plant that is indigenous to the island that everyone eats. Unknown to them, this plant is like a drug and has a quality that makes those who ingest it very malleable and very agreeble. Anyone who does not conform to the rules are discreetly 'removed' from this island utopia. <br>  <br>  Then perhaps the wealthy guy finds his room ransacked. Someone has found the note in his room. He knows that they know that he knows, and he now fears for his life. The rest of the story can be about how he flees the island. The end!|`|GP8ScMZqaa	That sounds racist, but who cares.

Bkl0515eaa	Using any type of weapon in deliberate, indiscriminate attacks against civilians was and is against the rules, customs, and laws of war, as described in the Geneva Conventions, Hague Conventions, a 1938 League of Nations Resolution, a 1961 UN resolution (General Assembly 1653), and the Just War tradition of the Roman Catholic Church dating back hundreds of years. The purpose and effect of the bombs was not to destroy military personnel or weapons, but to cause as much civilian death and devastation as possible in order to intimidate the Japanese government into surrender. If somebody did that to us, we would call it terrorism.<br>  <br>  Some may argue that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were in fact military targets, containing manufacturing facilities, and in the case of Nagasaki a naval base. But then, why were the bombardier aiming points the exact centers of both cities? It would be the functional equivalent of aiming for Staples Center in Los Angeles to take out Raytheon 10 miles to the west and JPL 10 miles to the Northeast, along with hundreds of thousands of civilians in between. Or aiming for downtown Norfolk to take out Norfolk Naval Base 5 miles to the north. It may take decades or centuries, but eventually the hypocrisy of the US slaughter of German and Japanese civilians will be acknowledged.<br>  <br>  Whether or not they were about to surrender is irrelevant because by 1945 they were no longer a strategic military threat.  Japan is an island nation, and its strategic offensive capability is based entirely on naval power. By 1945 Japan's navy was on the bottom of the Pacific. We had 30 heavy aircraft carriers (Essex class and similar) to their none. We had 10 new battleships (Iowa and South Dakota classes) and 15 older battleships (North Carolina, Colorado, and Pennsylvania classes) to their none. We had hundreds of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines to their less than fifty. We had 30,000 aircraft in the Pacific and 40,000 in Europe to their 5,000. We had 30 million tons of commerical merchant ships to their 1 million tons (soon to be zero thanks to our submarines). Looking at these numbers, you don't have to be an Annapolis graduate to see that they were not a threat. The US Navy had Japan completely surrounded. Nothing was getting in or out, they were completely cut off. Without steel and oil, they could only build wooden ships powered by sails and oars. No matter how you slice it, they were done, even if their leaders (and ours?) were too dumb and stubborn to see it. We could have maintained a strategic quarantine on them for decades with no trouble, and they would be confined to their little islands for as long as we felt necessary.<br>  <br>  An invasion would have been a senseless waste of lives. Such a costly action would only be morally justified to eliminate a dire threat to our nation. Using atomic bombs to stop a senseless invasion is also, by definition, senseless. By that time of the war, Japan was not a threat. Unconditional surrender was not rqeuired to maintain our security for the simple reason that Japan's armed forces were completely crushed. Invasion or atomic bombs served only one real purpose: revenge.<br>  <br>  BTW good points on Leahy and Eisenhower.  I suspect most Americans are unaware of the opposition to the atomic bombs from some high-ranking officials.  MacArthur was also against it.  However, most American officials at the time were in support of it.  But I think centuries from now the verdict of history will be with Leahy, Eisenhower, and MacArthur.|`|UBFGCvVOaa	I didn't know Japan was about to surrender.  I was taught the opposite in school in Minnesota, but that doesn't mean anything because it's already established that the US knew about Pearl Harbor and 'let' it happen to gain the support of public to enter the war.

A two prong Invasion plan was drawn up to commence in Nov 1945.  Resultant American casualties were conservatively estimated at one million men by the fall of 1946.  Twenty eight million Japanese had become a part of the National Volunteer Combat Force and the Japanese civilian population were prepared to fight to the death casualties were estimated at perhaps 10 million Japanese in the course of an invasion.  The invasion of Japan never became a reality because on August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb was exploded over Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Within days the war with Japan was over.<br>  The official reason for dropping the bomb was to shorten the war and save lives, both American and Japanese.|`|1113a0e16d7694011f5bdb01076e75dfaa	"..... cause japan was about to surrender"<br>  <br>  You know that for a fact, do you?

dCewrtXaaa	How about Dan Quayle's May 19, 1992, speech to the Commonwealth Club of California on the subject of the Los Angeles riots? <br>  <br>  <<In this speech Quayle blamed the violence on a decay of moral values and family structure in American society. In an aside, he cited the title character in the television program Murphy Brown as an example of how popular culture contributes to this "poverty of values", saying: "[i]t doesn't help matters when primetime TV has Murphy Brown — a character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman — mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another 'lifestyle choice.'" <br>  <br>  Quayle drew a firestorm of criticism from feminist and liberal organizations and was widely ridiculed by late-night talk-show hosts for this remark. The "Murphy Brown speech" became one of the most memorable incidents of the 1992 campaign. Long after the outcry had ended, the comment continued to have an effect on U.S. politics. Stephanie Coontz, a professor of family history and the author of several books and essays about the history of marriage, says that this brief remark by Quayle about Murphy Brown "kicked off more than a decade of outcries against the 'collapse of the family.'" In 2002, Candice Bergen, the actress who played Brown, said "I never have really said much about the whole episode, which was endless, but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did.">>|`|2v3l5Xfiaa	I heard of a fantastic tool called google - I dont know if you have this extra in your internet.

One way to go about this is to participate in extracurricular activities, esp. in a leadership capacity.  When possible these activities should help highlight skills that are related to your desired course of study or ultimate profession if you are stating such in your essays.  Public service is looked kindly upon as well - if you are active in community improvement projects be sure to note these efforts in your application.  These activities should be long-term in nature too, a one-off project here and there, that are disparate, won't be as impressive.  Focus on activities that you feel strongly about.<br>  <br>  Another important issue to remember is to develop good recommendations.  Cultivate your relationships with "important" people if possible, the Superintendent of Schools, your Principal, your State Senators, Councilmen, your boss from work, etc.  The more they know you the better the recommendation they can write for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  Let me know if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help.  BTW, just out of curiosity, why are you so focused on USC vs all the other schools out there?

AA12074269	There is a major difference between degrees in Australia and those in Canada and the US. American et.al degrees are more like general degrees where you dont decide your major until second year - you take electives, lots of different subjects and then decide what you want to do. In Australia you do a BA (History), BSc(Microbiology) etc - that is the name of the degree and you start specialising from the first day,.<br>  <br>  Thats why Australian degrees are generally 3 years as compared to the American which are 4 years in length<br>  <br>  So if you are doing a History degree, you will be unable to take a Biology subject - as the students in the Biology course are expected to do subjects X, Y, Z as well. You sign up for the package of "types of subjects" History - politics may be interchangable but not cross Faculties.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	In most Canadian universities a degree program will have core requirements that will keep you fairly busy. Often there are options within that program.<br>  <br>  One usually has to take an average of one course per semester that is not core to your degree. Taking a second can be an overload so you usually have to ask dispensation to take more than one.<br>  <br>  Where your university has independent studies, you have to describe your own study plan and get approval for it before you start. For instance if your independent studies were in the field of environmental studies, your assigned faculty member would want to know that you have a list of courses in environmental studies and other subjects that the university could seriously call it independent studies(environmental studies). The expectation would be that you would effectively invent a basis of a thesis that would be completed during the course, so that you really have a reason to be studying independently.<br>  <br>  My son did that, and found that completion of that thesis, which was more like a PHD thesis, was an enormous undertaking for an undergrad. But the work to complete it put him in contact with some leaders of industry, and provided him with a very well paid job straight out of university.|`|2eztcCO0aa	I didn't go to college in Australia, but here in the states I was able to write my own degree plan to fit with my career aspirations and take the courses I wanted.  I got a degree in interdisciplinary studies.  It was a lot of work, though.  I had to get professors to be on a special committee to oversee my education, and justify each course.  <br>  <br>  Here is the U.S. we can take a double major or minor in another discipline.  We can also ask to take another course as a free elective in place of what the usual elective choices are.<br>  <br>  Do you have an academic advisor?  Ask him or her what your options are.  Don't take a course without doing that or it may not count for anything and just be a waste of money and time.|`|szyrw5P0aa	you need courses outside your major anywhere you go

All States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories license physicians.<br>  <br>  Education and training. Formal education and training requirements for physicians are among the most demanding of any occupation-4 years of undergraduate school, 4 years of medical school, and 3 to 8 years of internship and residency, depending on the specialty selected. A few medical schools offer combined undergraduate and medical school programs that last 6 years rather than the customary 8 years.<br>  <br>  Premedical students must complete undergraduate work in physics, biology, mathematics, English, and inorganic and organic chemistry. Students also take courses in the humanities and the social sciences. Some students volunteer at local hospitals or clinics to gain practical experience in the health professions.<br>  <br>  The minimum educational requirement for entry into medical school is 3 years of college; most applicants, however, have at least a bachelor's degree, and many have advanced degrees. There are 146 medical schools in the United States-126 teach allopathic medicine and award a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree; 20 teach osteopathic medicine and award the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree.<br>  <br>  Acceptance to medical school is highly competitive. Applicants must submit transcripts, scores from the Medical College Admission Test, and letters of recommendation. Schools also consider an applicant's character, personality, leadership qualities, and participation in extracurricular activities. Most schools require an interview with members of the admissions committee.<br>  <br>  Students spend most of the first 2 years of medical school in laboratories and classrooms, taking courses such as anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, psychology, microbiology, pathology, medical ethics, and laws governing medicine. They also learn to take medical histories, examine patients, and diagnose illnesses. During their last 2 years, students work with patients under the supervision of experienced physicians in hospitals and clinics, learning acute, chronic, preventive, and rehabilitative care. Through rotations in internal medicine, family practice, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery, they gain experience in the diagnosis and treatment of illness.<br>  <br>  Following medical school, almost all M.D.s enter a residency-graduate medical education in a specialty that takes the form of paid on-the-job training, usually in a hospital. Most D.O.s serve a 12-month rotating internship after graduation and before entering a residency, which may last 2 to 6 years.<br>  <br>  A physician's training is costly. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, in 2004 more than 80 percent of medical school graduates were in debt for educational expenses.<br>  <br>  Licensure and certification. All States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories license physicians. To be licensed, physicians must graduate from an accredited medical school, pass a licensing examination, and complete 1 to 7 years of graduate medical education. Although physicians licensed in one State usually can get a license to practice in another without further examination, some States limit reciprocity. Graduates of foreign medical schools generally can qualify for licensure after passing an examination and completing a U.S. residency.<br>  <br>  M.D.s and D.O.s seeking board certification in a specialty may spend up to 7 years in residency training, depending on the specialty. A final examination immediately after residency or after 1 or 2 years of practice also is necessary for certification by a member board of the American Board of Medical Specialists (ABMS) or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). The ABMS represents 24 boards related to medical specialties ranging from allergy and immunology to urology. The AOA has approved 18 specialty boards, ranging from anesthesiology to surgery. For certification in a subspecialty, physicians usually need another 1 to 2 years of residency.<br>  <br>  Other qualifications. People who wish to become physicians must have a desire to serve patients, be self-motivated, and be able to survive the pressures and long hours of medical education and practice. Physicians also must have a good bedside manner, emotional stability, and the ability to make decisions in emergencies. Prospective physicians must be willing to study throughout their career to keep up with medical advances.<br>  <br>  Advancement. Some physicians and surgeons advance by gaining expertise in specialties and subspecialties and by developing a reputation for excellence among their peers and patients. Many physicians and surgeons start their own practice or join a group practice. Others teach residents and other new doctors, and some advance to supervisory and managerial roles in hospitals, clinics, and other settings.|`|bB0M5QYhaa	Step1Earn a bachelor's degree from an accredited and recognized undergraduate school. Choose any program of study, but have pre-med or some type of science concentrated major. <br>  Step2Prepare to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The test administered by the American Association of Medical Colleges. There are many programs that give MCAT preparation courses. The pre-health advisor at the college will know of the resources that are available. <br>  Step3Research medical schools. Find out what their minimum requirements are and what they are looking for. Many medical schools rely on an admissions committee to determine the acceptable applicants. Find out all the information necessary and supply it. <br>  Step4Find research, shadowing and community service opportunities. Many schools look for a commitment to the community and a healthy desire to truly help others. Doing research and shadowing doctors is a good way to get experience being around the medical community. It is also a way to know for sure medicine is the right field of study. <br>  Step5Complete and submit an application to the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). It is an online application that requires fees based on how many schools applied to. They require certain documents to be sent it before the application is completed and submitted to the individual medical schhols. <br>  Step6Wait for an invitation from the medical schools to complete their secondary application or to continue on to the next part of the application progress. They may call for an interview. Then they will decide on acceptance. <br>  Step7If accepted, attend medical school and be successful. Mediocre students never get into any of the surgical residency programs. Only the top students are accepted into the neurosurgery programs. <br>  Step8In the senior year of medical school, research and apply for neurosurgery residency programs. Different residency programs have their own qualifications and requirements. Go through a process called "Match" that will determine the appropriate program. <br>  Step9Before attending the residency program, take and pass the state licensing exam. <br>  Step10Complete the 6 to 8 years of the residency program. If there is a fellowship after this, complete that also. <br>  Step11Become a licensed physician by taking the state board certifications. Since neurosurgeons are specialists, get certification from the American Board of Medical Specialists. <br>  Step12Apply for a job at a hospital with an opening.|`|fSzEGjUlaa	medical school. <br>  <br>  neurosurgeon... i totally forgot what they do, but i know... but i can't remember... it's on the tip of my toungue.|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	Hey that's what I want to be too!

s9tvr0DTaa	Classical Conditioning (also Pavlovian or Respondent Conditioning) is a form of associative learning that was first demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov [1] . The typical procedure for inducing classical conditioning involves presentations of a neutral stimulus along with a stimulus of some significance. The neutral stimulus could be any event that does not result in an overt behavioral response from the organism under investigation. Pavlov referred to this as a Conditioned Stimulus (CS). Conversely, presentation of the significant stimulus necessarily evokes an innate, often reflexive, response. Pavlov called these the Unconditioned Stimulus (US) and Unconditioned Response (UR), respectively. If the CS and the US are repeatedly paired, eventually the two stimuli become associated and the organism begins to produce a behavioral response to the CS. Pavlov called this the Conditioned Response (CR).<br>  <br>  Popular forms of classical conditioning that are used to study neural structures and functions that underlie learning and memory include fear conditioning, eyeblink conditioning, and the foot contraction conditioning of Hermissenda crassicornis.

It would be like trying to sprint an entire mile without getting tired... that is not possible because you would get tired quickly.

Just be sure to make a clear difference between Learning, Knowledge, and Wisdom.<br>  <br>  "Learning" is the absorption of facts.<br>  <br>  "Knowledge" is the ability to put those facts to use (methods).<br>  <br>  "Wisdom" is the indefinable process by which we learn to balance our actions and thoughts.  Wisdom is not necessarily a product of learning or knowledge, but has more to do with how we deal with life's situations.|`|McC08v7haa	That actually sounds like a cool approach if you can back it up with cool ideas.<br>   Im taking english 12 ap right now btws.<br>  Or, you can talk about the differences in the three. and give plenty of examples that you have come up with from your own experiences!<br>  Hope I helped.

Protons have a positive charge while electrons have a negative charge.  Since opposites attract the electrons are held "in orbit" bound to the protons in the nucleus until sufficient force is applied to overcome the electron/proton attraction.  I hope this helps and good luck.

He either got what he wanted from you, or he is just as confused as you are.  I would wait it out.  If he approaches you with caution, he was confused.  If he doesn't approach you at all, he used you.  I hope for the prior reason.|`|HJbqA4hkaa	He's uncomfortable because of the hook up dear.

He slept with you because all he wanted was sex, it had nothing to do with you as an individual.  He went with the other girl to the party because he needed someone new to sleep with.  Don't take it personally, he is just a male with hormones and has no thought process.  You should slowly remove yourself from the situation and attempt to focus on school, or another activity that does not involve partying.  Do you have a support system at your school to help you?  My answer may seem harsh, but many of us need a wake up call sometimes.  This is your chance to get your life back on track and not make a huge mistake.  Good luck.

In addition, you added the second sentence "But she has left".

Once in a post may be forgivable (after all, when I type quickly I sometimes make typos!), but multiple ones drive me nuts.<br>  <br>  I can see mixing up, say, "less" and "fewer."

Everyone has strong suits and are weaker at other things.  That doesn't make them dumb.<br>  <br>  Besides, just the other day I did the same thing.  I wrote then when I meant to write than.

kSZx9cY5aa	I teach music at a k-12 school, ages 12-17 and sorry to say that you need to play most instruments well. I did drums at college so that's what my "speciality" is, but I can also play piano. guitar, flute, violin and I know the basics of most other instruments and i'm also a vocalist. I NEED to be able to-if I didn't I wouldn't be able to do my job. <br>  To become a music teacher I had to pass practical exams, and if I had of failed them I wouldn't be teaching. <br>  I don't know if it's changed-I doubt it. But still look at college sites and see what their requirements are. <br>  If you're going to teach music, you're going to need to know how to <br>  play ;)<br>  Good luck!|`|0ltOn9Rxaa	It depends on the school ... I originally went to school for music education and I had no audition....for that (I did audition to be in the choir)<br>  really any school will have a program just check into it
YMI6Yl18aa	That would depend. <br>  <br>  If you want to study french at Cambridge then yes. You would also need to do french as A level as well, because the uni course would be an extension to that. Most people do french in combination with another course, maybe another language? <br>  <br>  If you want to study something else then no of course not. What i will say though, is that any modern language that you can speak fairly well is a great bonus on your CV. Employees will find you far more attractive in a job interview if you can speak another language, especially french or other modern european languages. <br>  <br>  So basically unless you are wanting to do french at Cambridge, you don't have to do it at GCSE, though it is always useful to have as a skill.

wF3YmF4Naa	You probably will have to retake Cal 1 in college. Some schools do have placement tests but those are just for entry level courses and I don't think Cal is entry level. However, some school offer other tests to receive credit for classes without taking them. For instance, I received credit for my general science requirement and my two general English requirements by passing what's called a CLEP test. So ask your college academic adviser about those options.

jygcvFAMaa	here's my answer:<br>  Darwin's Theory of Evolution - The Premise<br>  Darwin's Theory of Evolution is the widely held notion that all life is related and has descended from a common ancestor: the birds and the bananas, the fishes and the flowers -- all related. Darwin's general theory presumes the development of life from non-life and stresses a purely naturalistic (undirected) "descent with modification". That is, complex creatures evolve from more simplistic ancestors naturally over time. In a nutshell, as random genetic mutations occur within an organism's genetic code, the beneficial mutations are preserved because they aid survival -- a process known as "natural selection." These beneficial mutations are passed on to the next generation. Over time, beneficial mutations accumulate and the result is an entirely different organism (not just a variation of the original, but an entirely different creature).<br>  <br>  Darwin's Theory of Evolution - Natural Selection<br>  While Darwin's Theory of Evolution is a relatively young archetype, the evolutionary worldview itself is as old as antiquity. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Anaximander postulated the development of life from non-life and the evolutionary descent of man from animal. Charles Darwin simply brought something new to the old philosophy -- a plausible mechanism called "natural selection." Natural selection acts to preserve and accumulate minor advantageous genetic mutations. Suppose a member of a species developed a functional advantage (it grew wings and learned to fly). Its offspring would inherit that advantage and pass it on to their offspring. The inferior (disadvantaged) members of the same species would gradually die out, leaving only the superior (advantaged) members of the species. Natural selection is the preservation of a functional advantage that enables a species to compete better in the wild. Natural selection is the naturalistic equivalent to domestic breeding. Over the centuries, human breeders have produced dramatic changes in domestic animal populations by selecting individuals to breed. Breeders eliminate undesirable traits gradually over time. Similarly, natural selection eliminates inferior species gradually over time.<br>  <br>  Darwin's Theory of Evolution - Slowly But Surely...<br>  Darwin's Theory of Evolution is a slow gradual process. Darwin wrote, "…Natural selection acts only by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take a great and sudden leap, but must advance by short and sure, though slow steps." [1] Thus, Darwin conceded that, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down." [2] Such a complex organ would be known as an "irreducibly complex system". An irreducibly complex system is one composed of multiple parts, all of which are necessary for the system to function. If even one part is missing, the entire system will fail to function. Every individual part is integral. [3] Thus, such a system could not have evolved slowly, piece by piece. The common mousetrap is an everyday non-biological example of irreducible complexity. It is composed of five basic parts: a catch (to hold the bait), a powerful spring, a thin rod called "the hammer," a holding bar to secure the hammer in place, and a platform to mount the trap. If any one of these parts is missing, the mechanism will not work. Each individual part is integral. The mousetrap is irreducibly complex. [4]<br>  <br>  Darwin's Theory of Evolution - A Theory In Crisis<br>  Darwin's Theory of Evolution is a theory in crisis in light of the tremendous advances we've made in molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics over the past fifty years. We now know that there are in fact tens of thousands of irreducibly complex systems on the cellular level. Specified complexity pervades the microscopic biological world. Molecular biologist Michael Denton wrote, "Although the tiniest bacterial cells are incredibly small, weighing less than 10-12 grams, each is in effect a veritable micro-miniaturized factory containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery, made up altogether of one hundred thousand million atoms, far more complicated than any machinery built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non-living world." [5]<br>  <br>  And we don't need a microscope to observe irreducible complexity. The eye, the ear and the heart are all examples of irreducible complexity, though they were not recognized as such in Darwin's day. Nevertheless, Darwin confessed, "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree." [6]

8yE2sYGeaa	That all you feel is important returns to dust and there is nothing to show for it|`|Wb7n512Waa	Dust refers to "this world" where we are, which is the most remote position from the Creator and in fact we are in complete concealment from Him as we have no perception of Him whatsoever. In this world the ego is the ruling force. If we develop a sensation that something important is missing and nothing in this world is fulfilling to us, then we could arrive at the method which enables us to rise into spirituality and this means we aspire to change our desire to be for others or the Creator rather than the self, the ego. The prayer for this inner change means that we want to raise "Divinity from the dust". Every word in the bible refers only to inner states in relation to ones perception of the Creator in accordance with their inner desire as they are progressing in spirituality. A person who wants to understand the true meaning of what is written in the bible must first acquire the method of adding additional spiritual senses of perception as the bible was written for previous generations who had smaller egos than we do today and it is beyond our understanding. Here a some links for you to explain more in depth the meanings and symbols in the bible: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kabtoday.com/epaper_eng/content/view/epaper/6977/(page)/6/(article)/6980" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabtoday.com/epaper_eng/conte...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/the_secret_meaning_of_the_bible.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/the_secr...</a>|`|eYdTRXFMaa	Throne to me has the connotation of power, whereas dust is the opposite.<br>  <br>  My idea tahat a "throne of dust" is just an illusion of power.<br>  <br>  For example, I could say: Rush Limbaugh thinks he is important, but in reality, he sits on a throne of dust.|`|bxD4MP4baa	<a href="http://fitanswering.moltion.com" rel="nofollow">http://fitanswering.moltion.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.
bqUy7MKTaa	same|`|FjyqdUqeaa	Ditto.<br>  it means something like<br>  " Same " <br>  " Me Too ! "<br>  " Right Back At You "<br>  <br>  For Example..<br>  <br>  Person 1- " I hate maths "<br>  Person 2- " Ditto ! " ( aka " Me Too!

Swayze's character would use that when ever Moore's character said "I love you" He never said those words to her while he was alive and so when he said it after he was dead se thought it was not him until he said "ditto"....<br>  <br>  Were you trying for ditto?.......as in repeat or good day to you too.<br>  A dido is also a prank<br>  <br>  If not either of the above, it must be the queen of carthage|`|u6DbSRm4aa	DITTO, not dido<br>  It means that you agree with what was just said, e.g.<br>  "I love ravioli"<br>  "Ditto!"|`|VSiMrZkOaa	Like "the same" or "right back at ya"|`|pMnMgt4Vaa	it means DIDO know that its not christmas and you should take your santa hat off.|`|jdXhRGpcaa	the same thing you just said|`|ispD8O8paa	it's actually ditto. :)<br>  <br>  Ditto, which at first glance seems a handy and insignificant sort of word, actually has a Roman past, for it comes from dictus, "having been said," the past participle of the verb dīcere, "to say." In Italian dīcere became dire and dictus became detto, or in the Tuscan dialect ditto. Italian detto or ditto meant what said does in English, as in the locution "the said story." Thus the word could be used in certain constructions to mean "the same as what has been said"; for example, having given the date December 22, one could use 26 detto or ditto for 26 December. The first recorded use of ditto in English occurs in such a construction in 1625. The sense "copy" is an English development, first recorded in 1818. Ditto has even become a trademark for a duplicating machine.|`|ZzAxCBy4aa	ahaha, that's funny because i always say Dido.<br>  Dido basically means same to you, or back to you.<br>  <br>  Example: Person 1- You look pretty today<br>                 Person 2- Dido<br>  <br>  its just another way to tell someone something back with out actually saying exactly what they said|`|MhySf1guaa	Dido means, i think the same, like if you had a bad day and so did your friend and she was chatting, and you said "I had a really bad day today", and then she said "dido", that would mean she had a bad day too.|`|MCczXQW3aa	means the same. or like same idea. just whatever you are talking about that you have the same basic idea.|`|o72Ng7IRaa	Ditto means "Same here", "Me to", "I feel the same way"<br>  <br>  Example,<br>  Person 1: "I just love when DigiMan anwers my question."<br>  Person 2: "Ditto. He keeps it real."|`|3s5hCHWuaa	It's ditto, not dido.  And it means 'same here' or 'back at ya'|`|Tp8OtBuEaa	it means you mean the same thing that someone else said..... CONFUSING|`|SjGpbohiaa	Same.
UTlnR0Ugaa	probably your local community college, considering you can't tell the difference between "too" and "to."|`|CgOs2ViPaa	hm I would say that your GPA and extracurriculars are really good, but you would need to up your SAT scores to get into UCLA, USC, or Stanford. I don't know what you're interested in for a career so I can't really tell you which colleges to apply to. And don't base your perceptions of colleges just on prestige or the name. I mean, just because Stanford is Stanford doesn't mean you're going to like it there. <br>  <br>  Idk what colleges to tell you because theres seriously like SO many colleges that you could apply and get into. And I don't know where you want to go to college so yeah. but I guess like. UC's? Claremont Colleges? Ivy Leagues? Liberal Arts Colleges? Idk there's definitely alot of possiiblities

It has info about different US scholarships for college students and their grades requirements.|`|7Nlp17x6aa	Not everyone can get financial aid, but even if you could, you won't get a lot. Student loans definitely can give you enough to survive because your only borrowing the money that you'll pay back when you have it|`|H9OFtkeoaa	No!! Well maybe yes if everything goes right and you learn some tricks.  If you are working on a higher degree you have to budget carefully.  If you are off of your parents hospitalization you will need a student plan and you must allow for any deductibles you incur.  A summer job is not a given.  If you need to do a summer internship it may not pay.  You have to budget for rent and food for the summer months.  Be sure you are not responsible for your roommates rent if they disappear.  You will need good clothes for interviews prior to graduation.  They can cost.  Plan plane rides ahead of time. The tickets get more costly towards the day you fly.  If you fly round trip and have to change the day you fly back it may be cheaper to eat the return leg of a round trip and buy a one way ticket.  Drive an extra hour to a less expensive airport.  Do your FASA based on an estimated tax form so that you can get it in early.  Stay in good graces with anyone you may need to borrow money from on short notice.  Don't plan on getting a break on food prices by sharing with a roommate.  They like expensive food and eat things you would never eat but they will eat everything you like.  If the school charges the same for full time as long as you carry over 12 hours then schedule 16 hours and drop the course early that is dragging all of your other grades down.  This can result in a five year program that you thought was going to be four years but you will have better grades.  Go to a college where there is public transportation so you do not need a car.  And most important.  You do not have to go to college right after you graduate.  A job with tuition assistance is a great help.

Eating more fruits and vegetables and keeping your calories down and your level of activity up, would be good for your health.

3P7SpJ7Qaa	Don't worry about it. It's traditional to try and scare the freshmen. If you don't want to do anything you listed above, you don't need to. Just keep your mind on your studies, take interesting classes, and you'll meet people worth knowing.<br>  You probably won't see too much of your old friends (I know I never do) but it's really worth it to meet new ones. Just keep your wits about you. If they do drugs or stuff like that, stay away from them!<br>  Don't worry about dating. You can get along quite well without it. It causes more trouble... I say avoid that emotional roller-coaster. You'll have plenty of time to find that special someone later on. <br>  Join a club, or one of the sports teams. I personally recommend Mock Trial, Band, Choir, or Drama, but it doesn't really matter as long as it has a good adviser.You'll meet some real jerks, true, but most people are fairly friendly.<br>  Go for the highest level classes you can get into. The Honors classes will be the most interesting you've ever had, and the AP programs are well worth the extra time and effort they take.<br>  Keep ahead of your homework! I can't stress this enough. I took to doing all my work in homeroom freshman year and could get away with it, but by sophomore year it no longer worked, and it took me half a year to get back on track.<br>  If it's a single story school, don't buy one of the elevator passes.

MKJAQ2koaa	When you turn 18 years old you go to the post office and fill out a draft card. Now then the U.S. does not draft people no more, this is not the 1940s or the 60's. Now then most of the wars for the exception of Iraq are fought in the halls of congress. But if for some ungodly reason world war 3 broke out, then they would draft the single men and woman first, then the ones who were married and then the ones with 1 child and so on. But to be honest now days you have to have a high school diploma, pass a government test and be smart as hell and physically fit to get into the service. <br>  <br>  (Tip) if you need a debate go to the nearest army recruiting center and ask them why you have to have a high school diploma now days unlike the 40's and 60's and chance's are they'll say because of technology.

Qy9mH2s7aa	Dear Dad letter....<br>  <br>  A father passing by his son's bedroom, was astonished to see the bed was<br>  nicely made, and everything was picked up. Then, he saw an envelope,<br>  propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, 'Dad.' With the<br>  worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter, with<br>  trembling hands.<br>  <br>  'Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I<br>  had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene<br>  with Mum and you.<br>  <br>  I've been finding real passion with Stacy, and she is so nice, but I<br>  knew you would not approve of her, because of all her piercing's,<br>  tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older<br>  than I am.<br>  <br>  But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we<br>  will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of<br>  firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more<br>  children.<br>  <br>  Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't, really hurt<br>  anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves, and trading it with the other<br>  people in the commune, for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so<br>  Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!<br>  <br>  Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday,<br>  I'm sure we'll be back to visit, so you can get to know your many<br>  grandchildren.<br>  <br>  Love, your son, Joshua.<br>  <br>  P.S . Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house.

Ftkr9jqYaa	New-economy organizations Require revenue items to be $75,000/year per account, in order to attract “outside sales personnel.” So, you do not find sales forces selling small items. <br>  <br>  This means that it is not worthwhile to have a salesperson servicing a company unless the account with that company involves revenues of at least $75,000 per annum. In other words, with NEW-ECONOMY ORGANIZATIONS, the rule is that no sales personnel need be sent to outside companies unless revenues exceed $75K annually, so accounts involving small sums of money do not require outside sales personnel.<br>  <br>  Give less liberal automobile expense reimbursements than in the accounting-focused old-economy organizations.<br>  <br>  In new-economy organizations, expense accounts to sales personnel for car expenses are reduced, because there is more concern for cost minimization and profit maximization, and less concern with obsolescent accounting policies.<br>  <br>  Also these organizations may not take advantage of Fixed and Variable Rate Automobile allowances.<br>  <br>  Instead of utilizing traditional accounting procedures, such as fixed- and variable-rate automobile expensing, new-economy organizations focus more upon simply minimizing automobile expenses.

nkLzaCm1aa	i think if you're referring to statistics, "realistically" would be a good use of that word. if you're referring to a conversation, "truthfully" may be better than "realistically." good question i had to think about that, because they do reflect similar meanings.|`|vsRjnbTfaa	It's hard to explain.  I had a class my senior year of high school that dealt on nothing but truth.  Real means something that is.  True is something that someone or someones believes to be real.  Real is the state of being true and true is the belief of something being real.  For instance, if i take a brick and drop it on your foot, then you will know for a fact that that **** hurts and the pain is real.  However, if i drop a brick on someone else's foot and they go and tell you that it hurts and is painful, then yes it may be true but you really have no physical proof.

EvyY3dUNaa	Data, or facts, may be derived from several sources. Data can be classified as primary data and secondary data. Primary data is data gathered for the first time by the researcher; secondary data is data taken by the researcher from secondary sources, internal or external. The researcher must thoroughly search secondary data sources before commissioning any efforts for collecting primary data. There are many advantages in searching for and analyzing data before attempting the collection of primary data. In some cases, the secondary data itself may be sufficient to solve the problem. Usually the cost of gathering secondary data is much lower than the cost of organizing primary data. Moreover, secondary data has several supplementary uses. It also helps to plan the collection of primary data, in case, it becomes necessary. We shall therefore discuss secondary data first and then take up primary data.<br>  <br>  Secondary data is of two kinds, internal and external. Secondary data – whether internal or external – is data already collected by others, for purposes other than the solution of the problem on hand.<br>  <br>  Business firms always have as great deal of internal secondary data with them. Sales statistics constitute the most important component of secondary data in marketing and the researcher uses it extensively. All the output of the MIS of the firm generally constitutes internal secondary data. This data is readily available; the market researcher gets it without much effort, time and money.<br>  <br>  Sources of External Secondary Data – Examples<br>  <br>  The Internet is a great source of external secondary data. Many published, statistics and figures are available on the internet either free or for a fee. <br>  <br>  In research, Secondary data is collecting and possibly processing data by people other than the researcher in question. Common sources of secondary data for social science include censuses, large surveys, and organizational records (Mintel). In sociology primary data is data you have collected yourself and secondary data is data you have gathered from primary sources to create new research. In terms of historical research, these two terms have different meanings. A primary source is a book or set of archival records. A secondary source is a summary of a book or set of records.<br>  <br>  Advantages to the secondary data collection method are - 1) it saves time that would otherwise be spent collecting data, 2) provides a larger database (usually) than what would be possible to collect on ones own However there are disadvantages to the fact that the researcher cannot personally check the data so it's reliability may be questioned.|`|AA12095483	Primary data is a direct report from someone who was actively involved in whatever it is you are discussing. Secondary data is someone who has heard about it, has read about it, or has learned about it at arm's length. <br>  The merit of primary data is that it is direct information, uncontaminated by being transmitted through another source. The demerits of primary data are that sometimes the person who is on the field sees only part of the action. For example, a soldier under fire in a battle isn't very aware of what is happening somewhere else because he's totally involved with what is happening around him. <br>  The merit of secondary data is that it can be gathered from a number of primary sources and weighed together to put together an overall assessment of what has happened.

That's what makes it "external." So instead of getting graded by a teacher, you will be graded by a professional examiner whose job is to go from school to school and to conduct these examinations (if they're oral exams) or to read hundreds of exam papers from different schools and mark them all (if they're written exams). The main difference is that, because the examiner doesn't know you like a teacher does, their exam is unbiased--but if you have an off-day, they won't know that, either.|`|8eeKI0h0aa	If you are talking 'medical' then it simply means; they are not gunna stick anything up ya or in ya...relax

His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption - and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them good-by.<br>  <br>  I thanked him for his hospitality.

"Arrested for" means he did it and they nailed him.  Suppose it's later discovered that he didn't do it.  The person in question could sue.  Adding "allegedly" doesn't help.<br>  <br>  "Charged with" is a much safer phrase.  If police filed charges, that's a verifiable fact.

In the 15th century, when the Longbow was introduced, it had the same effect as automatic weapons of today. Interestingly enough, legend has it that this is where the practice of flipping people off came from. When French Troops would capture British Longbowmen, they would amputate their middle finger as this is the finger you "pluck" the bow with. When French soldiers would advance on British positions, their Longbowman, who were not captured,  would stand atop the protective walls with their middle finger raised to show that they could still "pluck the yew". Yew being the type of wood that the bows were made from. Just thought someone may find that interesting.

You could try comparing compounds to recurves, long bows to short in relation to power, or compare crossbows of today. Honestly the fibers and composites used today are miraculous, though I think the archers of yesterday were infinitely better. Ive read in "Medieval Arms and Armour" by the Museum of London that a good long-bowman could, in still winds, shoot an arrow through a bracelet at 100 yards. Then again, it was there whole life as a soldier and they practiced all the time.

WpGROxH8aa	I'm not sure that there would be any online high schools free of charge. But you could get your GED and I'm sure there are plenty of free resources to help with that.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Here's a list of a few online high schools:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://distancelearn.about.com/od/virtualhighschools/tp/OnlineHighSchoolProfiles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://distancelearn.about.com/od/virtua...</a>

ezT1nsexaa	Sounds like you just need to take it easy. You're only 16. There's still time in your life. For the fields that you're interested studying or working in, get involved in an activity involving it. For example, volunteering at a hospital for the medical field. This way you'll be around the field more and see if you'll like it.

laVGEEeraa	See if Ontario has a "Department of Employment and Economic Development." Websites like those usually have all their data online and you can get detailed lists of not only what accounting jobs are in demand but also what other industries are expected to be in demand in the future.<br>  <br>  All accounting jobs are usually repetitive and boring and not very fulfilling unless you like that type of work.  On the other hand everyone needs accountants and always will.  Apply at Harvard if you want a school's name to give you a better salary than any other, but for Business Administration degrees I would suggest Marketing or Management rather than simply Accounting and except for big name schools one is like any other, but community schools are usually cheaper than private colleges.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	forensic accounting is a total blast- did it for 5 years- then go to law school and you'll be a force to be reckoned with|`|cug8GruKaa	Google your most local business school...............|`|icufa8Otaa	WATERLOO!

IhZeoXqvaa	Just so you know, sqrt is square root<br>  <br>  <br>  y = sec(x), at (pi/3, 2)<br>  <br>  To find the equation of the tangent line, you must first find the slope of the tangent line. This is accomplish by first evaluating the derivative ....<br>  <br>  y' = sec(x)tan(x)<br>  <br>  ... and then setting x = pi/3, to evaluate the slope, m.<br>  <br>  m = sec(pi/3)tan(pi/3)<br>  m = [1/cos(pi/3)] (sqrt(3))<br>  m = [1/(1/2)] (sqrt(3))<br>  m = 2sqrt(3)<br>  <br>  Now, this becomes a high school problem.<br>  Find the equation of the line thru (pi/3, 2) with slope 2sqrt(3).<br>  <br>  Using the slope formula,<br>  <br>  (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = m<br>  <br>  Let (x1, y1) = (pi/3, 2) (our given point)<br>  (x2, y2) = (x, y) (our general variables)<br>  m = 2sqrt(3) (our evaluated slope).<br>  <br>  (y - 2)/(x - pi/3) = 2sqrt(3)<br>  <br>  Isolate y, and that is your line equation.<br>  <br>  y - 2 = 2sqrt(3) (x - pi/3)<br>  y - 2 = 2sqrt(3) x - (2pi/3)sqrt(3)<br>  y = 2sqrt(3) x - (2pi/3)sqrt(3) + 2|`|AA10439008	Plug π/3 in to the derivative for x to get slope<br>  Then use point-slope form for the line y - 2 = (slope)(x - π/3)
