Then slowly move to the left or right and press the "A" button twice (It should flash "Jump" on the screen letting you know when to press it).  You basically jump once, jump a second time, and if done correcltly, you end up rolling up behind the attacker and hit the "B" button to attack.  Cheers!|`|2e4e72bd47702e880267918fc936b8e5aa	Back Slice  How to use: Side jump(press a while Z-targeting and moving to the side) twice   in a row to roll behind opponents, and wave the remote to slash their   unguarded backside.

The word mattress is derived from Arabic words meaning "to throw" and "place where something is thrown" or "mat, cushion." During the Crusades, Europeans adopted the Arabic method of sleeping on cushions thrown on the floor, and the word materas eventually descended into Middle English through the Romance languages.[1]    Though a mattress may be placed directly on the floor, it is usually placed atop a platform (such as a bed or a metal spring foundation) to be further from the ground. Historically, mattresses have been filled with a variety of natural materials, including straw and feathers. Modern mattresses usually contain either an innerspring core or materials such as latex, viscoelastic, or other polyurethane-type foams. Mattresses may also be filled with air or water.      tradu??o: Colch?o  um objeto colocado sobre o estrado de uma cama e que serve para tornar o ato de dormir mais confortvel. A escolha do colch?o correto para cada pessoa  que ir determinar o sono saudvel e repousante.    Os tipos mais comuns de colch?es s?o de espuma de poliuretano, de molas, de caixa ortopdica e de ltex.    Os colch?es de espuma apresentam tabelas que indicam qual a densidade da espuma de poliuretano  ideal para cada biotipo. Os colch?es de molas apresentam recursos como as molas bic?nicas, que tm resistncia progressiva, ou seja, a resistncia do colch?o  proporcional ao peso da pessoa. Os colch?es de caixa ortopdica devem possuir no mnimo 3 cm de espessura na camada de espuma e no mximo 8 cm, pois isto far com que o corpo afunde nas devidas propor??es no quadril e ombro e garantir a anatomia durante o uso. Os colch?es de ltex tm o mesmo princpio da espuma.      conclus?o: mattress = colch?o

I have a kid on my friends list that's 8 and plays Halo (he's surprisingly good for his age) and just try and stay out of trouble and take some more responsibilities around the house to earn your parents trust with these games.|`|Mq7yondSaa	that was like me before just explain to them they are not very bad. thats how igot M games like RE4|`|XMiRwRDDaa	show them what is on the game ex violence|`|lq99YP9Faa	tell her that teen is for 13 just incase thay aren't too up to date
2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	It's really all random. Each ball has a different catch rate, meaning the higher the rate, the more likely it is to catch. The dusk ball has 4x catch rate, but only at night. This is your best bet, since the next highest is the Ultra ball at only 2x catch rate. So first off, fight it at night. Get it down to reasonably low health, then just start chucking dusk balls at it. It's all random, but if you have enough, one is bound to work.|`|I9fWs8vuaa	It doesnt have to be night for the dusk balls to work against azelf, since he is in a cave they will work at any time of the day.|`|zAxWLrHwaa	This is not an easy pokemon to catch, but it is possible. The best method I've used is to bring some weaker and some stronger level Pokemon.( I used my lvl 37 Luxray, 68 Staraptor, 53 Dialga, 38 Bronzong) that knows a move that will paralize it, put it to sleep or  freeze it ( don't burn it, or confuse it because if you get it to a low level of hp, it may pass out). Next Lower its Hp in the red and paralize it, freeze it or put it to sleep. Then use Great, Ultra, Dusk, and Timer balls. Use you timer balls last because they will work better.  Hyper potions and revives are also helpful. Just save before you battle it that way if you knock it out, you can just re-do it.  Hope this is helpful
2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	sounds like your well on your way. Just be prepared for the Elite Four though. All their pokemon range from Mid-50s to Upper 60s.

2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	First you need the National Dex. to get this, beat the elite 4 and SEE (don't have to catch) all 150 Sinnoh dex entries. Then talk to Professor Rowan and He'll give you the national dex. Next go to Route 218, which is just east of canalave city. Ditto will be in the grass right by the building with the thirsty security guard, but it's really rare. So far, I've only seen one, but I accidentally killed it instead of catching it.|`|AA10822261	Yes you do. And complete the Sinnoh pokedex. Afterwards, professor oak will give you a poketch application that allows you to go to grass with national pokedex pokemon.

First you need to beat the elite four AND get the National Dex. Go to the owner of the mansion every day, and he will put a different rare pokemon in the trophy garden each day. Pichu and Eevee are in there. So far, I've also seen:  Igglybuff  Jigglypuff  Pikachu  Chansey  and Meowth|`|AA11868883	on witch game|`|cb0139069c74e67af086c291f7bb5c1eaa	yo can catch a Evee but not a Pichu for the Pichu go to the Power Plant thaey are not that rare there but i've seen a few Evees on the first floor of the pokemon mansion.

2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	There's nothing really to help with here. There are no Mystery Gift items yet. for now, you can only get things at actual pokemon events, which there are none yet.

There is the wifi option though. They haven't said how it works yet, but I think you can probly get event-only items over wifi once they startgiving them out.
2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	The order is:  First E4 member has Bug type  Second has Ground  Third has Fire  Fourth has Psychic  and Champion has a mix of different types.  hope that helps|`|XGiUe2x2aa	There isn't one answer to that question, you will need the help of multiple types of pokemon in order to get past the elite four, and be sure to have different type moves on each.
2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	It is used to recieve gifts at nintendo events across america. So far there are none going on.

As for the friend part, I think that is used to get the Manaphy egg from Pokemon Ranger, but I can't say for sure.

Fly  to Hearthome city and head west, Route 208. Enter the cave and once inside, you  will need to go north. At the very top of Mt. Coronet is Dialga so be ready for  a legendary battle. Bring about 30 Ultra Balls,4 Quick Balls and 6 Timer balls.  Dialga will be lvl47 and is a steel/dragon type. If you are playing Pearl, you  will not get Dialga but instead will see Palkia. Palkia is a lvl47 water /   dragon type.     When you first enter the cave, you need to head west to the opposite side. Once  you reach the west entrance, head north and surf across the pond. Use rock  climb to reach the stairs up. You should seen Bronzong somewhere along the way.  It is the evolved form of Bronzor and is new to the pokedex. In the next room:    North, West, South, Upstairs, North, West over bridge, down stairs, up north  stairs,up stairs, cross bridge, down stairs, down stairs, upstairs and in cave  door.     Next room: Up stairs, up stairs  Next room: up stairs, trainer battle, west, south, trainer battle, Out.    Now you are outside. Follow the path and use rock climb when you get there. Now  instead of using rock climb again, head west and through the grass until you  reach another cave. Inside, use rock climb, follow the path, down the stairs  then east out of the cave.    Outside again. Through the grass, down the stairs, rock climb west. Down the   stairs, through the grass, keep going west and you find another cave. Enter.  There is only one way to go through here so keep following the path, eventually  you emerge at the very top. Inside the cave, there is also Chimecho.

6NJE0LMQaa	You are breeding using buneary and jynx so that you can get a buneary with ice punch to breed with a sneasel, I get it. The reason you are getting smoochum is because the jynx is female. When you are breeding, you always get a pokemon who is the same species or an unevolved form of the female, not the male.     So you need to get a female buneary and a male jynx with ice punch to breed and get a male buneary with ice punch who you can breed with a female sneasel    Also smoochum is a baby pokemon and therefore can not breed|`|60efabbd6210b98c9b66dacfa77ad211aa	You need a male jynx. Put a male jynx in the daycare with a female buneary, and u will get buneary with ice punch. ure using a femaile jynx|`|QXub3EzMaa	The pokemon u want should be a female. the move u want to transfer should be on the male. the lopunny must be a female to get a baby buneary.|`|exkC6JWoaa	Smoochum evolves into Jynx  If possible, get a male Jynx and a female Buneary, that will make sure you get a Buneary.

To get a baby Bunnery you'd need a Buneary or Lopunny mother and a Jynx father but that's not possible as Jynx are ALL female so you'll need another father with Ice Punch to accomplish your goal.|`|wzCkVhmhaa	why in the world do you think you would get a buneary?  you need a buneary or the evolution of buneary to get one.

6ac89f4c5c098186328d1b26a2cbdee9aa	The first guy pretty much said it.  This will take you years if you make Runescape a full-time job.     Making 100k/hr is a pretty good rate for any type of money-making scheme.  So if you figure 40hrs/wk, that would be more than 2 years for your goal.  And 100k/hr is not that easy to do.    It will take longer if you're not a member, because members have the best money-making opportunities.    You could try to buy the money, but get ready to be banned if you do.  Jagex will definitely notice a transaction of that size.|`|5Ba1Ofo1aa	Well I know this is going to be hard but mine 1k rune ore and sell them for 1.1m (there 11k ea) It WILL take a while but... it's your time not mine.|`|ecfdf1a31a5abffa60fbda40b71667bfaa	you think 450mill is that easy to come by?

Even if we listed the best money making tip, it will take you years of playing to even reach 100mill. And when you do, you can count on someone trying to hack into your account.

mtxZcPzDaa	I want to say Animal Crossing: Wild World. It's a lot of fun, and is a really good starter game for the DS if you're not looking for action games right now.|`|JUVCfjzIaa	I agree with Tooltroid. WarioWare is a great primer to introduce you to stylus control. My second pick is Clubhouse Games, which has possibly the most value I've ever seen in a game (42 games on one cartridge, and Nintendo Wi-Fi capability for many of the individual games).    While Brain Age is definitely a well-designed piece of software, it's more of an adult-focused training tool than a game (though it can be fun). It works as advertised, so if you're interested in sharpening your mental skills, go for it.|`|af0GE4N2aa	DS has MANY good games...I have 20...here are some good ones to start out with:    -Brain Age or Big Brain Academy  -Kirby Canvas Curse ---best use of the touch screen of any game IMO  -Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow....and if you like that, Portrait of Ruin  -Mario Kart DS  -Tetris DS  -Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time|`|mAagFPw4aa	like maybe mario games|`|BfDfSs4waa	two words ..... pokemon diamond|`|Xj2vzLo1aa	As an introduction?

IZ9dnqgraa	story is one of the most important aspects of a game. a game is not a game without a story. mmorpgs have storys. every game must have a story or it will not make sense at all. if you just fight monsters or shoot bad guys, that would be it. wheres the fun in that.<br>  <br>  objective is also needed. if there isn't an objective it would be a sandbox. a sandbox is a game with no meaning. you just spawn things and do what you want. you dont beat it or anything.|`|H1yNLrggaa	bare with me if u are playing a game where u go to a bunch of random citys or worlds and in every world u just run through it wouldnt be funbut what is a game that makes u questionn it like a book with a clomplex story line where u chase down one villan for example<br>  <br>  hopwe i cleared itt up for u|`|8H4613pxaa	the grand theft auto's always have a story that sucks you in.<br>  <br>  Honestly the only game that kept me sucked in was scarface the game. and i'm not even a fan of the movie. honestly i didn't even think the movie was that good except for the end.|`|bS5wpKvOaa	Stories are not necessary at all.<br>  <br>  All you need is an objective.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Look at Mario for the NES.<br>  Or Grand Theft Auto w/o story.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EXTRA:  If you want a good story, read a ******* book.

The shortcut can be found if you make your way to the eastern side of the Route, then ascend the bicycle slope to the north. Just follow the narrow bridges until you arrive near the southern part of the Route. There's the Shiny Stone at the very end of the  narrow bridges, although you can get to it regardless of if you take the shortcut or not (it's around where the shortcut takes you).

The reason you don't make any money fletching bows is because that isn't the point.  The point of fletching bows and alching them is to increase your magic and fletching skills.

vtJDHJDYaa	Parasite Cage isn't really hard at all. In fact, he's _easy_. However, the way to fight him is anything but calm, but it's not something that's going to make you pull your hair out.<br>  <br>  On a poisonous field, you have four stone platforms to stand on that move around in a circle, and you can jump between them. If you fall on the field, then it'll poison you. That's basically it. As for the Parasite Cage, you for the most part need to get right in front of him before you can hit him. This will allow him to hit you with one of his tentacles, and you don't want that, so when he raises his tentacle, jump away onto another platform. Sometimes, the platform you're on will slowly sink, so when that happens, jump off and wait for it to rise again. The Parasite Cage can also send out a rasp of poisonous breath at Sora.<br>  <br>  For your armament of cards, you generally want any level of Keys, Cloud, a few magic spells, DEFINITELY a few Cures in case of the poison, and otherwise hard-hitting cards. The Mickey head/crown card comes a lot more often in this battle than other battles, as when the Tentacle Cage's mouth drops open, you can attack it and get a card coming right out of it. When you use the card in this battle, it'll neutralize the poisonous field for a short period of time.

qBu8Mz8uaa	It is called elven armor. There are also Aurorans wearing a gold colored armor (it might be there skin because you can't take it). There is only ONE place where you can see Aurorans and that is the Ayleid ruin of Galas Malatar which is Northwestish of the Anvil stables. It is right on the cost and some of it is above the water. They carry around battle axes called ayleid battle axes which rank is dull-master. Master does 7 shock damage and dull does 2. But you may have to get to the last Knights of the Nine quest before you do. The PS3 version comes with the Knights of the Nine I'm not sure about the Xbox 360 though. Anyway the armor is elven and you have to be a high-enough level to see it or you can do the fighters guild quest and get it from azani blackheart. The sword is probably deadric since that is the only red sword. A good place to get the armor though (if you're a high enough level) would be Vilveran which is right across the lake from the sewer you exit in the Tutorial or very first part of the game (when you first get outside you'll see it) Vilveran also has an ayleid statue in it including tons of bandits who might have it.|`|uHU7RW2waa	dont know but thanks for the points|`|SwQTVTNfaa	The armor that guy is wearing is called Elven Armor. It is in the light armor class and can only be found if you are a high enough level or if you do the fighters guild quests and kill Azani Black Heart. If you are a high enough level you can find bandits wearing them or sometimes you can find them in Ayleid Ruins. Ayleid Ruins are those places that have white stone and sometimes pillars or entrances that are built into the ground. The doors have a circle in the middle of them.

d5onKaO6aa	the only difference is a few pokemon.|`|VkED6IOXaa	no it is exactly the same except for you get palkia in pearl and not dialga and different fossil pokemon|`|nX7JnDkOaa	no it is the same as pokemon diamond except mime jr. and a few other pokemon show up either more frequently or less prequently. and the legendary pokemon is palkia|`|OMxyN7LHaa	it would make no difference just  a little bit of different pokemon|`|exkC6JWoaa	No, well actually, I did, and I'm as good as they get, so..... you know what to do.|`|MxSK1K5Qaa	Yes pearl has other pokemon not availible in pokemon diamond. And overall i think its a better game.       JMAN
rc6LirBIaa	speed isnt the best thing for those pokemon. you may want for Charizard, Attack and Special Attack stats, for Tyranitar, you'll want Attack and Defense stats, Gengar, im not really sure, Salamence, Special Attack and defense. Oh and, your a n00b to think you'll get those for those pokemon you offered, and YOUR A HACKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6p95XDyaaa	I want, I want...

eb6038b63b522b4782eede8c364b6089aa	You're ready to go back into Mt. Coronet (from Rt. 207 head to the opening at the back of the first room) to face Team Galactic & Dialga. You'll need Pokemon who know Rock Smash, Surf, Strength, and Rock Climb to get to the top of it and outside in the grass and snow and then to the entrance on the back of the mountain and as far West (or left) as you can. That should eventually lead to Spear Pillar for the showdown. You can catch Dialga now (or if it runs then after you beat the E4, same place) but don't defeat it or it's for good, so after you battle Cyrus, you might want to save before you battle it to be safe, but make sure you turn the game off if you knock it out.  To catch the three you set free go to the 3 Lakes...surf to the middle to go inside the caves either now or later, up to you. Lake Acuity is where Uxie is, Lake Valor is where Azelf is, these you can catch right away (well it'll take some work, keep battling or chucking balls for a while then try a Timer Ball) and they're all at level 50, Mesprit will flee when you visit its cave at Lake Verity, so track it around the town on the marking map when you're up to it and can trap it (use Mean Look, etc.). This you can wait to do until later if you'd like, but you need to visit them all to get your Pokedex filled. Then you're off towards Sunnyshore City for your 8th badge, then Victory Road and the E4...  Hope this helps you out! Good Luck!|`|EMx4DkM6aa	Yup your right dude, first go to spear pillar, and catch your main legendary whetther it be dialga or palkia. Then go the aucity lakefront, lake valor, and the other one, catching those 3 legendaries, they can learn great moves, you get em at lvl 50, and lvl 51 they all learn extrasensory, better then confusion, but doesnt confuse the foe. I suggest you bring a ton of ultra balls, catche mesprite last, cause hes like latias/os he moves around, so check your poke map thing and find him! 8th gym leader is electric to find out how to get to him inside the gym, go to youtube, and search up 8th gym leader.|`|exkC6JWoaa	Ok, go to the peak of Mt.Coronet via through West of Celestic Town, go to the very top, fight all the Sub-leaders of Team Galactic, then defeat Cyrus, the leader and capture Dialga in Diamond Version or Palkia in Pearl Version|`|YSL8XOzraa	You must go to Spear Pillar at the top of Mt.Coronet. Then you have to battle some Team Galactic guys and then you'll get a chance to catch Dialga.|`|GcaxEtnLaa	go to the peak of mt. coronet and bring ton of repels, and potions and lv 45-50 pokemon with ou.

dfZ8gZxlaa	gamefaqs.com|`|AA12212433	You could play the game legitly.|`|exkC6JWoaa	Only hold down L, do not even press R|`|RuUCpmjnaa	All you need to do is throw away the amount of pokeballs from 493 that corresponds to the pokemons national dex number. Then all you do is hold L and walk around in grass or in a cave and the pokemon will appear. Your problem occured because when you were holding L you also pressed R which re-activated the codes therefore giving you 493 masterballs again.    This website gives you the national dex numbers of all the pokemon in Pokemon Diamond/Pearl. For example if you wanted a Garchomp to appear then you would throw away 48 masterballs (493-48= 445 Garchomp) then hold L(without pressing R at all) and walk into grass and the pokemon will appear. Also once you have caught that pokemon just press L and R at the same time to get 493 masterballs back    Hope this answer helps you.|`|cBjecFHfaa	nothing wrong|`|yzdnsWxKaa	Why don't you start the game again, and play without using cheats? Why are you playing the BirthGame of the new Sinnoh region in shame by using cheats to get all the Pokemon. What do you think the wifi featured are for?    Let someone else cheat for you, and ask them to trade it to you, lol.

It's really easy, just like the old games without the wire, like you said. Actually it's more like the way you could trade with the wireless adapter for GBA in FR/LG and Emerald, but you got the idea.

One day I took them out and realized I wasn't receiving any sound at all. What I went on to do was put the headphones back in slightly and touched the side walls of the headphone slot. After doing that the sound started to come out of the speakers for me.     I hope this helps. If anything call Nintendo's Customer Service hotline. From what I've heard, they have a great Customer Service.|`|exkC6JWoaa	yeah go to a gamestop or something|`|or9o2dh7aa	well, if you don't want to use the headphones for sound, then go to a video game store and ask the clerk to take a look at it. most likely they will.  hope this helps!

iOfsbgZDaa	Try cleaning the disc with Windex or something similar, it might be a scratch you have missed.  If that does not work, the save is probably corrupted.  If you are playing on a PC you MIGHT be able to download something to help you from the ES site, though this is unlikely.  If you are playing on a game console, you are out of luck..you will have to delete the character.  Sorry!

Once you've beaten him, enter the forest and you will have to fight your rival if you have not done so already. In the forest, you will find a guy standing near the cut tree saying that he's lost his farfetch'd, go a little further into the forest and you'll find it standing around.    Your task is to herd the farfetch'd back to the man near he entrance.

kLN5hx6paa	Well, <br>  <br>  Depending on your state, in illinois from my own findings there's dennys, ihop. Normally for like under four dollars you can sit there all night the servers are amazing.<br>  <br>  Bowling alleys are good if you have the money to spend, however its not for me. Most 24 diners will let you hang out for hours for cheap. After like 3 cups of coffer or 3 glasses of soda they start paying for themselves.<br>  <br>  Great no? <br>  Goodluck.|`|4b9a8cd80935c593d2a86dc4c229dee7aa	I am a fellow insomniac and one of the first places I discovered was bowling alleys.

LnYr2dLfaa	1. It's set for a worldwide release on Feb 20, 2009.  2. Like every new release PC game, about 69.99.  3. If your computer doesn't meet the requirements you may come across minor faults.  4. Previous Sims games have and Sims 3 being a big title, it most likely will.  5. Not straight away, but there there will be loads of people out there trying to hack into the game.  6. No one knows since it hasn't been played yet (except for those illegal downloads) so if you did like Sims 2 you will probably like Sims 3 because the follow up game usually is far better than the previous.  7. Probably not since the game will be a new release (maybe in future).    If this didn't answer your question then you may need to do research.

0e5c5f43bc15620ad19565ff504ddd6baa	Depending on How Old the computer you are using is, and who manufactured it, you might (I repeat might) be ok.    For example, one of the computers that I have at home is a fairly low-end Dell Dimension desktop purchased a number of years ago. It came with a pre-installed Intel Integrated Graphics Card. It can play WoW, but it is a bit laggy.    If you play other (recent - as in made in the last two years) games on this machine, you probably do meet the minimum requirements.    If you have to purchase, most of the cheaper video cards run beginning at $100.|`|mze2e5ERaa	When did you buy your computer?

AA11612795	Yeah, that's the downside to the bigger Wii discs, longer loading times.  The game streams the levels, and if the door stays closed when you try and open it, that means that the next room hasn't finished loading yet.  Oh, well, beats looking at a loading screen each time.    Could be worse, you could be waiting for that door to open while being attacked by a bunch of Metroids.  Wait, never mind.|`|B8ArMZGnaa	yes i hate that made me so angry... i would have thrown the freaking contoller if it wasnt stapped to my wrist

To get back to the lake you have to find the weeds where you can howl as a wolf.  this will summon the giant flying bird thingy and you will have to fly it through the river.  Remember how you had to fly it up to get to the Zora area?  Now you are flying it back but the river is full of water so don't fly too low.|`|430f15cb11f19d48726863f31072910baa	you messed up you needed the portal you gotta restart|`|B8ArMZGnaa	no i have no idea what your talking about but i know you dont have to restart the game theres just something you missed like when i got stuck and the frozen domain i didnt know what to do and was there for a day trying to figure it out then i was looking around and noticed that big hot rock at the volcano was able to be moved or something and yeah...just dont restart

Depending on your desired 2nd class, you should allocate training to the respective fields. Head on over to Nexon's MS site and look at the classes/requirements.  Then, allocate any stat points to useful stats such as Dex/Luck; to advance, head to Kerning City to become a basic thief, once you have the requisites (I believe those are ~28-32 on Dex?).  Good luck with your class.|`|tII6KEdKaa	the training should always be easy. Like the mage, you should train on whatever you can kill in 2-3 hits(for the most exp for your time and mesos..) BUT, if you want drops..whatever you wanna do. I'd suggest teaming with a fighter and/or mage who has the claw attack and going to pig beach. If you can, avoid going there with an archer..they have no CQC ability..as for quests..take a half hour of your time and go to every city, talk to every NPC, and see if you can blitz em (this involves completing the objectives as fast as possible..teaming with a higher lv player, no?)  and as for where you should go..Kerning city has never been a bad place for my theives..ninjas..>.>

0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	Well alot of  it does have to do with crisis core and the back story he was just  soem hero and he fought genisis who was like the real villlan and killed him i think so right there is a lot then he sort fo went crazy trying to find out who he really was. When you say his name any gamer instantly knows who he is. In FF7 it wasn't him that made teh game so epic it was the fact of the story behind that wher he come and he was liek teh best villlan ever. And he is not just so anime guy ok if you are gamer of any sort of like any anime you wouldn't think that. I am not soem  anime crazed Fan girl either I am a girl but I am also a gamer before  you harp on anything play crisis core and see what I mean. Oh an dfor you info it isn;t a tench coat it is a cape|`|AA11963018	I'll admit that a lot of the fan-base surrounding Sephiroth is most likely based solely on what he looks like. Yes, its generic as all hell, but I think its more the fact that his dark exterior perfectly exhibits his personality and inner motives. While I don't know much about his story aside from the original game, it is safe to say that his characteristics are in perfect accord with the events taking place during the game. He starts out as normal as can be, until a gruesome discovery about his origins twist his state of mind into insanity. From a purely story-based standpoint, this makes perfect sense. In fact, it can be argued that his motives for what he does are more relevant then most other FF enemies. His pure will is to take back the planet for a race his true mother once belonged to. He sees, based on what was done to him and the Cetra race that preceeded him, the human race as useless and disposable.     Concerning the notion that he isn't actually active during the game, this is simply not true. Think about Ultimecia, his situation is similiar, as well as more complex. After the events in Cloud's hometown, he enters the lifestream, thus infecting it with Jenova. After cocooning himself in the Northern Crater, he begins to manipulate anything with Jenova cells, including the remains of Jenova herself as well as Cloud. As with Ultimecia, through pure manipulation of will, he is directly affecting key points in the game. Since the Sephiroth located in the Crater is a recombination of his own cells in an attempt to deify himself, it can be argued that this is no more the real Sephiroth than any other represented in the game.    Case and point, while the fandom surrounding him is mostly headache-inducing fanboy/girl dribble, his actual character shouldn't be so easily dismissed. He has a respectable story and believeable motives and character traits. Now, if only they'd do something about his wardrobe...|`|uctxzjIIaa	Cause he's semi-goth and has a big sword.    And you do see him once before the end, when he gets the Black Materia.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	I think most people like him because he's so evil.  He killed Aeris, and she never came back from the dead, unlike other main characters.|`|Cngws051aa	he was the greatest soldier in Shnira history.  he was pretty much unstoppable, especially after he realized he was genetically engineered.    Sephiroth is popular because of his sheer insanity, he went from Cloud's Idol to the almost destroyer of the planet and showed no remorse for doing anything. Plain and simple he's a ruthless, badass, straight to the point villain. Which honestly you don't get much anymore. Then there is the fact that he's practically immortal. When he died he just went into the life stream, and as long as there is any remnant of Genova's cells He can return, hence Advent Children|`|pK1QCTQTaa	Just due to the fact that the overall story in FF7 was so popular, he appealed to many people. Though, there were some sweet cut scenes (for the graphics in that day).|`|B8ArMZGnaa	i thinks its cus they make him mysterious and powerful...and has a weird trench coat with metal shoulder caps with a 3 meter long sword which no one in real life could actually handle.
nYiCj8COaa	you shouldn't have gotten all that nice stuff so early. i am on level 3 right now btw. usually you get the golden weapons on final prestige because they take a long time to get so it would be dumb to do prestige after getting them because you will lose them. if you don't care about finishing all the prestige than stay where you are and enjoy your cool guns. either way cod4 is so fun, its fun starting over every time. have fun.  |`|quAIMEUMaa	one of the most idiotic things you can do is get some of you golden guns and then finally say, "oh, should i do prestige mode or not"  if you were going to do it then do it the second you get it.  the only word that comes to mind for when you get all your golden guns and complete all your challenges and then decide to do prestige mode is complete and utter RETARDEDNESS!!!!|`|B8ArMZGnaa	i suggest you prestige if u feel like it or if ur bored and have nothing more to collect or achieve. i never prestiged lol
mTNz8GHGaa	Here is an excerpt from an item guide for final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles:    -**-----------------------------------...  VII. ACCESSORIES  -**-----------------------------------...    Accessories will give you the edge in battle. From lowering focus attack time to increasing spell range, they all will do you some good.

B8ArMZGnaa	no suggestions...i just went online after like 3 years to see whats new and theres still nothing to do...|`|PQAcbg1uaa	There is a lot of stuff to do. There are new quests like Summer's end and defender of Varrock. You can also join the circus. There really is stuff to do. And when it comes down to it... GET RICH! Well... There is still stuff to do. Train train train and get some great stuff.
B8ArMZGnaa	LoL your so funny...
PA1LE47baa	Halo 3 isn't as good as people make it out to be. Fable 2, Gears of War 2 and Far Cry 2 are coming out in the next few months so if i were you get those as they come out but for now get Call of Duty 4. If you have live, then thats is so much better. COD4 single player is good but it's so much better online. Leveling up and unlocking new guns in so addicting it's not funny. Anyway those are my recomendations.     Hope this helps...|`|7cKjzBV3aa	Fable 2 and Gears or War 2 are both coming out in the next month  they are both going to be awesome and a must have|`|wGtO6Mujaa	Depends on what your interests are.

If you enjoy music games, Rock Band, or any Guitar Hero game would be great.|`|B8ArMZGnaa	depends..what kind of games do you like?  if you like shooters i recommend call of duty 4, gears of war,lost plantet, and halo 3|`|rcdM1G9Daa	with out a dout   CALL OF DUTY 4. its the best game in the world for both boys and girls.|`|0w92f7RYaa	Silent Hill: Homecoming, GTA VI, Halo 3, Rock Band 1 or 2, Oblivion,  Gears of War, Soulcalibur VI, Bioshock, The Orange Box,  Dead Rising, Unreal Tournament 3, Condemned 2, The Darkness, or Lost Planet would be the games i be looking at.|`|A7mpF2YHaa	Call of Duty 4|`|6MKGg7Fuaa	I say Halo3 or Mass Effect

MUcaYL0Paa	I like Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, and Wind Waker.  Actually, besides a little bit of Majora's Mask and a Link to the Past (I remember playing a link to the past when I was like 3. I'm not kidding), those are the only zelda games I've really played and completed.     According to the rankings, Ocarina of time is the best game ever (out of non zelda games as well.)|`|WoB8gKI9aa	I am a massive fan of Zelda I have played them all (except for one on the original game boy) and my favourite would have to be the Ocarina of Time the Majoras mask was my least favourite|`|njb2kkw7aa	1. Ocarina of Time  2. Majora's Mask  3. Oracle of Ages/ Seasons  4. Link to the Past    5. Minish Cap  6. Adventures of Link   7. Wind Waker     8. Link's Awakening  9. the first one        10. Twilight Princess    haven't played Phantom Hourglass, sorry.|`|MqrD7No3aa	It's all opinion while most people would agree Ocarina of Time is the best.    I find Majora's Mask or Wind Waker my favorite|`|YuDnl2bsaa	wind waker for gamecube|`|B8ArMZGnaa	My opinion  1)Ocarina of time  2)Twilight princess   3)Majora's mask  i didnt really like "wind waker" nor "phantom hourglass" but they were pretty fun.

J19PHMCAaa	Sorry, but Call of the Haunted CAN NOT be stopped by Dark Illusion.    You are right that Call of the Haunted targets a monster, but it states face-up and cards in the graveyard aren't even on the field therefore cannot be classified as 'Face-Up' monsters.    For more information related to this or other issues check out this link:    http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Face-up    I hope this helped! ^_^    P.S. Call of the Haunted is Banned by the way...    http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/September_2...|`|FMTB2lw6aa	Dark Illusion works when the monster is face-up on the field, and as Jinzo is in the grave it won't work.    There's a little trick with Call of the Haunted and Jinzo. If Call of the Haunted is destroyed the Jinzo isn't as it negates the effect that makes Jinzo die when Call of the Haunted is removed from the field.
8hbm4uiPaa	Considering the deck is black / green, the most obvious change would be to add 4x Llanowar Waste and 4x Gilt-Leaf Palace.  Both are non-basic lands that will give you access to both colors and decrease the liklihood you'll have mana problems.    Treetop Village is another land you should consider using.  It's a game winner if your opponent were to use Wrath of God or some other mass removal spell on you.    The other obvious change would be to up the number of copies of your best cards to four and remove some of the weaker ones.  Cards like Imperious Perfect and Wren's Run Vanquisher are extremely good in elf decks and you should have four copies of each.    Civic Wayfinder and Llanowar Elves are easy to come by (both commons) and are standard includes for most Type 2 elf decks, so you should consider adding them as well.    If you can get your hands on a couple of Garruk Wildspeaker, he can make a huge difference.  It's an expensive card though.    Here is a competitive version of B/G Elves for you to reference.  This is a very expensive version, but will give you an idea of some of the better cards available if you happen to see them while trading.    // Land  4x Gilt-Leaf Palace  4x Llanowar Wastes  4x Mutavault  4x Treetop Village  5x Forest  3x Swamp    // Creatures  4x Llanowar Elves  4x Wren's Run Vanquisher  4x Imperious Perfect  3x Civic Wayfinder  3x Chameleon Colossus    // Other Spells  3x Garruk Wildspeaker  4x Profane Command  4x Thoughtseize  3x Bitterblossom  3x Eyeblight's Ending  1x Nameless Inversion|`|32dPb4rPaa	.....sorry WHAT..........        please choose me as best answer please! :)|`|IVN49C1vaa	put more land in it     x|`|zeIQRq6Paa	try elvish champion to improve ur elves

The pokeradar is kind of tricky. When you you it, the grass shakes in three different ways. One is just a normal shake, this could be any pokemon. Next, is a faster shake with a little bit of whiteness. These are more rare pokemon, the nidorans and growlithe are more likely to show up in these. Last is a sparkly shake. If you see this, go to it immediately. It's a super rare, shiny pokemon. There's only a 1/8000 chance of ever seeing one. It's really just random as to which one will show up. Nidoran(f) is a little more rare than Nidoran(m).  The girl only gives you the crown after you transfer pokemon over and catch them all. To transfer, put the pokemon you want to send in you PC in firered. Then turn on Pearl, and on the main menu ou will see "Migrate from FireRed" Choose that and then which ones to send. Next, go to pal park and catch them.

Then when you go the the museum, talk to the guy on the right behind the counter, He'll start babbling and tell you he needs to be alone to do it. Go outside and come back in. (make sure you have an open space in your party) Talk to him again and he will give you a newly revived pokemon.|`|f0a6289feec6535cd68a0fb5bb6af360aa	1.

Go to the guy again, with a spare space in your party, and give him a fossil.  3. Walk outside.  4. Come back in, talk to him, and you've got a prehistoric Pokemon.

First step, be sure to save before you fight him. If you kill him or he kills you, then just restart the game and try again. When you get his health and status low, just start chucking ultra balls at him. Ultra balls have a 2x catch rate, and it's really just random if it catches or not, so bring a lot. I actually caught him on the second ball, but that was just a fluke.

You have to attend these events and they have the item up for download, the only other way to get it is through use of items such as gameshark. So far they haven't had such event, so there is no way of getting this item without hacking.|`|b7d0265625304036808c10e946aaaa8faa	mystery gift|`|2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	You can only get it at a pokemon event with the mystery gift.

Make sure that you put in that you  want a level 9 and under Mew, because it is almost impossible to get a Mew of that level. Then, When the screen says '' checking GTS'' or something, the little clock symbol will come up, when it goes around 8 full times, turn off the DS.  When you get back on, you should have the pokemon in your PC and up for trade in the GTS. Hope This Helps!|`|ry8V3HZMaa	OH yeah you can it is easy... If you have a ditto... or just a female of the Pkmn that you eant to duplicate.  BUT you CANNOT duplicate legendaries like Dialga or Palkia.  so here we go... If u want, say another lucario, take you lucario to the daycare in solaceon town.  If you have a ditto (u can get one if you migrate from any GBA game) put the ditto in the daycare along with the lucario.  Walk about 500 steps or so and go talk to the guy that is OUTSIDE of the daycare.  He will say that your pkmn had an egg and he asks you if you want it.  if you want an egg, then say yes, but if youdont want another egg, then just say no and the guy will keep it.  To cut down the number of steps that u have to take to hatch the egg by 1/3, find a pkmn that has magma armor or flame body and put it next to the egg.  Hope i helped!

PTovC2Dqaa	Okay you're in Deep Jungle, right? And you have just defeated Clayton and the Stealth Sneak in the Cliff area and one of the gorillas (Kerchak) throws you up on the top edge of the cliff along with Donald and Goofy, but Tarzan just climbs up. Anyways, go in side the cave to the left of the waterfall scenery and you should be inside the waterfall. Now this is how you get to the very top and seal the Keyhole to Deep Jungle:    ~ Cross into the cavern until the cameras freely rotates between everyone, and you should see a treasure chest on the opposite ledge. Jump across the rocks to get a MYTHRIL SHARD.    ~ From this ledge, turn around and use the first-person view (Select Button) to see the next treasure chest on the ledge directly above you. Jump up and grab the ledge, flip up to get a SHELL-G.    ~ Now turn around again and look up to see a ledge covered with moss (the green grassy stuff). Grab that ledge and get a MYTHRIL.    ~ Now turn to the rock wall and use the moss to climb sideways over to the next ledge. Open the treasure chest to get an ORICHALCUM.    ~ Climb the vine next to the ORICHALCUM place until you see a cliff behind you on the way up. When you see it, jump backwards onto the edge. Hop across the ledges and use the first-person view to find a path to another cave high above the entrance where you first came in through.    I hope this helps you out a lot! ;)|`|vtJDHJDYaa	Go all the way to the end of the path, fight with bad camera angles for a moment, and jump up the ledge with the tiny waterfall running down it to get a MYTHRIL SHARD. Turn around and jump across to another platform that has a chest with a SHELL-G in it. Turn around from this chest, and jump up to get a MYTHRIL. Crawl sideways along the ivy on the wall to reach another chest with an ORICHALCUM in it. Climb up the vine in the alcove behind the chest. Only climb a little ways up, and jump backwards to a new platform. Jump up to the ledge with green ivy on its edge, and then turn around and jump to the new ledge. From here, jump across to another ledge and enter the ??? location to your right.    Sora will seal the keyhole to Deep Jungle, and everyone will be happy. :) You will also get a NAVI-G PIECE and an awesome new Keyblade, the JUNGLE KING! Sweet! As an added bonus, the team can even use the RED TRINITY ability now!|`|ALWGmsvlaa	Go all the way to the end of the path, fight with bad camera angles for a   moment, and jump up the ledge with the tiny waterfall running down it to get a  MYTHRIL SHARD.

Before you leave Deep Jungle, you may want to stick around and fight the White  Mushrooms that randomly appear in the Camp area. Try to get Arts items for all  of your current spells. Refer to the Mushroom section for more detail. If you   get extra Arts items, you can sell them for 250 munny apiece! Remember to keep   at least one of each though.

LnYr2dLfaa	Depends how much you play, really. If you are a casual player and only play when you can then there's probably no point in paying the monthly fee if you aren't going to use it to its full extent. If you are an addict then you would be better off getting the membership if the free version is boring you (you should only register if you are capable of paying the fee every month).|`|E8go0osDaa	I suggest not getting membership unless you're REALLY into the game. And have a way to pay for it ^^  But there are a lot of benefits for being a member.    But than again, Runescape can get boring pretty fast.  (that's why I quit for 4 years)  So if you really love Runescape, and want a better experience while playing it. Have a source of money and lot's of anti-social time to yourself. I suggest getting it ^^|`|D8oNQFtnaa	Yes wayyy better than f2p. You get more bank space, there are more quests to do, more ways of making money, plus like thousands of new items/armor and stuff you can equip your guy with.

It's like comparing looking out your window or actually going out into the world. F2P is just supposed to give you a very basic taste of the game. Membership is the buffet.

H9D4TR53aa	Shinx  Machop  Budew   Starly    Shinx is a good Electric-type Pokemon and can learn moves like Crunch, Iron Tail (TM), Thunder Fang, and Volt Tackle (TM obtained when Sinnoh Pokedex is completed).    Machop is a great attacker. It can learn Rock Smash (very helpful) and will help defeat Gym Leaders because more than have of the Gym Leaders are weak against Fighting-types. Trade when evolved into Machoke than trade it back. (Usually someone will trade a Kadbra or Graveler than trade back with them.)    Budew is a good duel Pokemon. Since it is a Grass-Poison, the only weaknesses it has are Flying, Psychic, Fire, and Ice. But Budew can learn moves that covers it weakness like Shadow Ball to a Psychic Pokemon. Evolve Budew into Roselia and teach it moves to about level 70 or 80 then use a Shiny Stone to evolve it into Roserade.    Starly is different than other Flying Pokemon. Starly can learn Close Combat when he evolves into a Staraptor at level 30. Close Combat is good against Rock and Ice type Pokemon, which are some of his weaknesses. Though it lowers his/her DEF and SP. DEF, it is still a good move.|`|vQJf2mIKaa	shinx   abra  starly|`|n0wt7wnWaa	Piplup  Starly  Budew|`|6LciPn4Naa	get a shinx.. evolve it into luxray.. let it learn crunch, shockwave, & spark.. and also starly it can also learn close combat.. i also caught bibarel coz it can learn HMs cut & surf.. and also geodude for HMs rock smash, rock climb, & strength.. hope this helps^_^

I think it's the third one you'll want.  1.Above the main building doorways up high. You'll need to stand back a bit to see.    2.Lady Grey's Tomb - you'll have to start the quest that allows you to enterhere Love Hurts. Once entered follow the path until you need to vault. Before jumping the Gargoyle is directly ahead of you.    3.There is another in the FairFax mansion but you have to beat the story before you can buy the mansion for 1,000,000. Once you buy it, head inside to the library, The Gargoyle is on the wall above the entrance you walked in.    Some people in forums Ive seen have said they've managed to shoot it with a red dragon.

2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	He's right about arceus, but it's an event-only pokemon. If you go to a pokemon event, (none going on right now that I know of) you can download a special flute. go up to where you fought Palkia (or Dialga if you have Diamond) and stand on teh flute symbol and play it. This will tranport you up to Arceus, which is officially the highest-level wild pokemon ever. Lvl. 80. Good luck.    Also, you CAN get more master balls, but its all about luck. Go to the TV station in Jubilife city and play the loto game. If you match all the numbers, you get another master ball. It's extremely unlikely though, the most I've ever matched is 1 so far...|`|KMhbDYx9aa	i think regigiggas is the strongest u cach it in snowpoint city but you have to have the 3 regis with you(regiice,regirock and registeel) which youll have to transfer from leaf green,fire red or emerald or ruby or saphire|`|iGnRGbc3aa	arceus is the strongest one it created the sihnoh region

When you catch one, bring it to the kid's house right by the cave they're in. He'll give you seals that match what letterthey are. Then go to a pc, choose your pc, the "ball capsules". There you can decorate any pokeball with seals to make some interesting openings.|`|aFPfRpu9aa	You catch a unown at the ruins at that town with the daycare center and show the little boy in a house in the same town then he will give you a seal of that letter of unown.

Globe (just like in GTS)  Pokemon Dolls (don't know how many there are)  TV   Pokemon statue (just like in gyms)  Traps  that's all I've seen so far.  Also, the more flags you steal, the more rocks you can take out of your base.

6e58b31844f30ea25c15b32953b51750aa	Attack is the attack for physical attacks. Special Attack is the attack for special attacks. So a high attack will make physical attacks stronger, a high special attack will make special attacks stronger. So for example my Kriketune has 97 Attack and 58 Special attack, it also has a 90 attack Bug Buzz (special attack move) and an 80 attack X-Scissor (physical attack), even though Bug Buzz is a stronger attack, X-Scissor does more damage because her attack is higher than her special attack. If you check your attacks and you see a dark blueish rectangle with a circle with a smaller circle in it, that attack is a special attack. An attack with a red rectangle and orange explosion is a physical attack.|`|2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	Attack is physical attacks, like stomp or tackle.  Special Attack is like magic attacks, like surf and thunder.'  Also, Defense lowers attack's damage; as Sp. Defense lowers Sp. Attack damage.

Then, you have to go to his house, which is to the left of the northern most pokecanter on the island. You can't fly directly to him though. You have to start from the bottom and walk up there. Go in and talk to him and he will put the stone back. When you go in the cave again, Heatran will be there. Be sure to save before you fight him.
2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	There are many "losers" around the world that play. And now they're on their way to kill you.    You need help with a specific application? It's kinda hard to help otherwise. Basically, you touch the red button on the side to switch between applications. Every application involves touching the screen somehow.   The one that looks like a big plus sign is the radar. Touch the screen and if a dot shows up, that means there is an invisible item nearby. The center of the plus is where you are standing, so walk until the dot is one space away, face it, then press A.  One app is the step counter. Pretty self-explanitory, itcounts your steps. touch the C to reset it.   you also, get a clock, berry map, and many others, 20 in all.  Check www.serebii.com for more info on all of them.|`|528e79644ab8f996e5c6896602461daaaa	once you see the red button press it with your styelis  and it should change modes p.s. go to jubilife for more poketek apps|`|8d55c3cc40f2378c2454f8dead733934aa	what type of loser plays pokemon?!!!

Creado en un principio como alternativa al programa eDonkey, en poco tiempo le super en funciones, y sumando el hecho de que era libre y gratuito, entre otros motivos, lograron que en poco tiempo le superase en popularidad para convertirse en uno de los programas ms usados por los usuarios de P2P. Existen tambin mltiples programas derivados con el objetivo de portarlo a otros sistemas operativos, como xMule o aMule.    Sus principales caractersticas son:        * Intercambio directo de archivos entre sus clientes.      * Recuperacin rpida de partes corruptas.      * El uso complementario de una red sin servidores, denominada Kademlia, de prometedoras expectativas; adems en algunos mods (versiones modificadas) se ha implementado el uso de la opcin Webcach como mtodo extra y de ayuda para descargar archivos (ver eMule MorphXT).      * El hecho de que, al estar licenciado bajo GPL, cualquier usuario puede colaborar y modificarlo libremente, es la razn por la que han proliferado toda una serie de modificaciones (mods) del programa, como eMule MorphXT, Xtreme, Phoenix, Plus o NeoMule. Existen incluso proyectos independientes basados en su cdigo como los clientes eMule para otros sistemas operativos, como aMule. Todo ello contribuye a una continua mejora tanto del programa original, como de sus derivados.      * Usa un sistema de crditos por el cual quien ms sube a la red ms descarga, si bien puede funcionar tambin con este sistema desactivado.    Los crditos permiten avanzar ms rpido en la cola de espera de un cliente, de forma que se pueda conseguir antes una posicin adecuada para descargar. Ya que los crditos se registran de forma descentralizada en cada uno de los usuarios de la red para evitar que sean falsificados, nicamente tendremos crditos en los usuarios a los que le hayamos subido algn archivo (aunque como slo afectan en el avance en la cola de espera, podemos descargar de un usuario al que nunca le hayamos subido un fichero). De cada usuario se descargan partes de un fichero (que puede estar siendo descargado en ese momento de otros usuarios) que se ensamblan al finalizar para formar el fichero completo. Esta red P2P resulta especialmente til cuando los ficheros que se pretenden descargar son de gran tama?o. Otra de las ventajas de esta red es la posibilidad de encontrar archivos muy poco comunes.        * Su amplia implantacin, as como su carcter descentralizado lo han hecho el preferido por la mayor parte de los usuarios, dispuestos a compartir contenidos. Esas mismas causas son las que han levantado la polmica sobre la necesidad o no de una legislacin internacional que vele por la defensa de los derechos de propiedad intelectual y sancione actos que los puedan vulnerar.        * Cuenta con la posibilidad de enviar mensajes a usuarios de la red eDonkey 2000 conectados a las descargas en curso y de un chat IRC para buscar informacin sobre lo que interese a los usuarios.    Funciones clave:        * Ofuscacin del protocolo. Esta funcin (implementada por primera vez en la versin 0.47b) sirve para evitar que las conexiones del eMule sean detectadas y bloqueadas por los ISP.      * Compartir chunks. Los archivos se pueden compartir aunque no estn completamente bajados. Una vez que un usuario tiene una parte de 9500 KB que ha podido ser verificada, eMule la pone a disposicin del resto de la red.      * Deteccin de errores. eMule utiliza algoritmos de deteccin de errores. De esta manera es casi imposible que se corrompan los archivos que se descargan. El sistema AICH (Advanced Intelligent Corruption Handling) utiliza el mtodo de hashtree para fragmentar en trozos de archivo de 180 KB, disminuyendo muy notablemente la cantidad de datos que hay que volver a bajar para corregir un error de transmisin.      * Transferencias comprimidas. Cada vez que eMule transmite datos, los comprime con la libreria zlib para ahorrar ancho de banda, de forma completamente transparente al usuario.      * Independencia de los nombres de archivo. En otros programas, cuando se renombra un archivo, ste ya no se considera el mismo. eMule en cambio, permite cambiar los nombres, pues utiliza un sistema que reconoce los archivos por sus contenidos y no por la denominacin, por ello puede ser que descargues algo que no corresponda con el nombre. Es posible consultar todos los nombres que se le asignan al mismo archivo.      * Sistema de crditos y colas. Se recompensa a los usuarios que han subido ms datos dndoles ms prioridad a la hora de progresar dentro de la cola de espera. Los modificadores se calculan en base a la cantidad de datos transferidos entre dos clientes, el cual directamente afecta a la valoracin de las peticiones de clientes y su posicin en la cola.      * Comentarios para los archivos. eMule permite calificar la calidad de un archivo y escribir comentarios sobre cada archivo haciendo que otros usuarios los puedan leer. Gracias al uso de la red Kad, se pueden buscar comentarios de archivos incluso antes de empezar a descargarlo, pudiendo as saber de antemano si el archivo tiene buena/mala calidad o si est corrupto.      * Ficheros de Coleccin. eMule permite crear ficheros en un formato especial nombrado coleccin de eMule. Este fichero contiene un conjunto de links de eMule. Es posible bajarlo como un conjunto y guardar toda la coleccin de ficheros como un conjunto, aunque cada descarga se gestiona independientemente.      * Filtro de direcciones. eMule tiene la posibilidad de prohibir cualquier tipo de acceso por parte de determinadas direcciones IP. La lista de estas direcciones puede ser mantenida |`|KbbL0ST3aa	Ps ya te dijeron, es muy bueno, te lo recomiendo!

rNQwtMjNaa	El Sims 2 es un videojuego que ya tomo poder en varias consolas, desde sus comienzos tuvo buena aceptacion a pesar de que sus graficos no eran tan buenos como lo son ahora, a pesar de que aun nos quejemos de un par de cosas.    En su primera version, fue dise?ado por Will Wright y distribuido por maxis en febrero del 2000.    El juego ha consistido en crear personajes que a partir de ahora denominaremos "Sims" donde ellos tendras que realizar su vida con todas las tareas que los humanos tenemos desde lo mas basico como comer y dormir, hasta lo mas extra?o como ver un fantasma.     En la primera version los razgos que poseian estos sims eran muy basicos y no podias llegar a darle personalidad en la imagen, ya que parecian todos en cierto punto parecerce mucho el uno al otro. Ya desde ahi tenias la caracteristica de elegirle el signo dandole punto a cosas muy basicas de la personalidad como la pulcritud, la actividad, etc.   En su segunda version al crearlo tenemos una gran variedad de opciones desde el tipo de cara, a la boca, la nariz, los ojos, las cejas, etc, ya profundirace el tema.  Otra gran novedad fue la ropa, podiendo tener diferentes clases de estilo de ropa mas alla de lo formal casual ba?ador que venia en la primer expancion (ampliaremos en otra seccion). Se han a?adido la posibilidad de tener un guardaropa con el estilo que uno quiera sin cambiarte la figura (ya que en la primer version habia ropa que los hacia gordos).    En su primer version los graficos eran toscos, las camaras giraban muy vagamente, y solamente habia tres posibles de zoom, lejos, medio cerca y cerca, y la verdad los graficos y la iluminacion era lo que uno puede llegar a detestar mas a pesar de las camaras.  En la segunda version tenemos mejores graficos y terminaciones, ademas de que pasa a ser 3D en mejor calidad    En cuanto a la jugabilidad del juego, una gran diferencia es el tiempo. En la primer version no existian las edades, los ni?os eran ni?os y los adultos adultos, jamas crecian, exepto los bebes pero llegaban al estado de ni?os y no pasaban de ahi exepto con parches o expanciones. En cambio en la segunda version, los sims tienen las edades divididas como por etapas donde cada una de ellas tiene un cierto tiempo de duracion en dias sims, y son mas etapas (ampliaremos en otra seccion). Hay un consepto de semana, donde por ejemplo los ni?os los sabados y domingos no van al colegio, igual con los trabajos de adultos algunos dias no se trabaja. En la primer version existian dias de descanzo pero consumian un dia de trabajo, estos dias en la segunda version existen pero ademas tiene dias no laborales.    El juego no tiene un objetivo claro, uno mismo crea su historia y va dandole al juego el sentido que desea.     Algo que me parece fue lo mas nombrado con el surgimiento del Sims 2, fueron los deseos, creo que muchas ya pensaban en los deseos como los globos de texto, pero no, equivocados. Los deseos fueron creo que una gran novedad algo que les dio mas personalidad, ya que te hacen sentir que ellos tambien quieren cosas y temen (mas adelante explicare la influencia). Los tipos de aspiraciones son de crecimiento (bebes, infantes, ni?os), y ya en las siguientes etapas pueden elegir entre conocimiento, dinero, familia, romanticas, popularidad; en la expancion noctambulos se a?ade la de placer.    En cuanto a la sociedad, a los sims de al rededor pareciera que estan mas conectados en su entorno, antes parecian ser mas autistas, no tener personalidad definida, vivir en un eterno YO YO YO, y en cambio aca se produce un interes por lo que sucede en el exterior, se apasionan cuando entra el ser amado, se disgustan cuando entran alguien que odian, si ven alguien pelear miraran, y claro siempre que alguien entra al  cuarto lo miraran y posiblemente hasta lo salude.|`|989d59fc1dd8d537712cf454686ecf1faa	No hay mucho que decir, modificas a tu personaje a tu manera, y lo manejas de arriba y haces todo lo que una persona hace en la vida cotidiana, y algo mas :-)    Aca tenes imagenes:    http://meristation.com/v3/listado_imagen...

B8ArMZGnaa	Nobody knows when its going to be released.  Since KH1 and 2 were for Playstation, im guessing so is the 3rd one
vtJDHJDYaa	Riku II is an upgraded form of Riku, but for the most part, he's still the same.    However, there is one major difference that actually makes him WEAKER. Unlike your last battle with Riku, Riku will this time around use combos a lot - this is because now he has a magic attack, Dark Firaga. When you see him using this combo, wait a small amount of time, and as soon as he casts it, dodge roll the opposite direction of what the flame is headed in - it won't turn around and try to hit you.    The implications of this means that Riku will run out of cards a lot faster, building up higher amounts of Focus time required, and overall giving you more time for ruthless attacks. As always, don't use any Combos, as you'll need all your cards for each runthrough, and bring in some Cures. Riku is still as fast as before, so again, I don't recommend using magic and weak Summons(With the exception of Fire). However, if you do want to use a damaging attack that might take a bit of time, use it just as he starts his Firaga spell, as it does take a small amount of time to use.  |`|B8ArMZGnaa	use high number cards and healing cards, dont bother with summoning cards just keep like 1 or 2 for healing and multi hits.    i use to use lots of mixed cards when i started playing then my friends built me a deck omg that deck raped (not literary)      By the way you mispelled "memories"|`|Cngws051aa	get better cards...thats pretty much all you can do.

rP1OWD38aa	From what I'm seeing after a quick Google search, the Brother is about $200 cheaper than the Singer.  The Singer has 24 built-in stitches where the Brother has 67. Both have a 25 year "Limited" warranty but I see that Singer seems to be having some problems with the LED light and breaking thread. The Singer seems to have more bells and whistles (it better for $200 more) but, in my opinion, it's not always about the bells and whistles, especially if you don't always use them plus you want something that's user friendly and not something you need to be running to the manual for every time you use a feature.  If I were going to make quilts and do embroidery I think I'd go for the Brother.  67 bis compared to 24 is a heck of a gap but I guess it's going to depend on what you need to do with it.  My quilting machine is an Elna by the way.    Have you checked out this site?

CKRfaRYvaa	When you log into the computer, it shows you a screen full of words and symbols.  First, click on any word you want.  I usually choose the first one, but it doesn't matter at all which word you choose first.  Once you choose a word, in the lower right corner of your screen you'll see the word you chose as well as the number of letters that were correct.      So let's say that you chose the word 'stamp.'  In the corner of your screen, it says that 'stamp' has 2 out of 5 letters correct.   Now, we check each of the remaining words, one at a time.  Let's say that the next word in the list is 'start.'  Since it has 3 letters in common with 'stamp' (the S, T and A) you know it cannot be the password.  Let's say that another word in the list is 'store.'  You know that this one might be the password because it has exactly 2 letters in common with 'stamp.'  You choose this word, and in the lower right corner of the screen it tells you if you are correct.      To keep the example going, let's say that 'store' is not the correct password, but the screen now says that it has 4 out of 5 letters correct.  We're getting closer!  Let's say that you see the word 'stork' in the list.  It might be the password because it has exactly 4 letters in common with 'store.'  Click on it, and if you are successful it will say so in the corner of the screen.      It can get more complicated when the words get longer, but just take your time and think it out and you'll do fine.      I don't know if this tip works on any system other than pc, but there's a way to improve your chances.  On the screen with all the passwords listed, there's also a lot of symbols.  Some of the bracket symbols come in pairs, and if you click these they will either remove an incorrect password without using one of your tries, or they will give you one of your tries back.  However, this only works with these bracket symbols:  ( ), { }, [ ].  They can have other symbols in between them, so it could look like this:  ( @ *$@).  As long as there is a pair of them, it should work.|`|HYly0RE1aa	It's kind of tricky. You choose a word from the random list. At the bottom right hand of your screen, it tells you how many letters were right (i.e 4/7 right), so pick another word with X amount of the same letters. If you only have one chance left to try, and aren't 100% sure, hit B and try again. It'll be another random word, however if you don't do that then the computer will be "locked" and you can't hack it period. So if you always want to get into terminals, always hit B and try again before your last try.    Hope it helps.

Y2rWo4e6aa	No, hemp does not need to be waxed. The major difference in waxed and unwaxed is that the unwaxed will become softer and kind of shredded looking after long wear, especially if it gets wet and dries out repeatedly. If you shower with your necklace on over months, the definition of the weave softens and kind of blends together so you don't really see them anymore, you just see the overall design. If you decide that you want to wax your hemp cord, buy sewing thread wax, take apart the container, rub and then work it into the cord. It's beeswax and will soften with the heat of your hands to fill in any spaces. Waxed hemp will remain stiffer for much longer than unwaxed and won't "shred" as quickly.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Wax only covers the outside of the hemp thread to protect it a little from the elements and to prevent wear.  Over time, any rubbing you do on the hemp will wear it down and it will start to come apart.  Although hemp is tough, it is a plant fibre and it will eventually wear down and come apart.  Waxing only helps to keep it together longer. It prevents moisture from getting to the fibres.  It prevents wear by sliding over the surface easily, so no rubbing against the fibres themselves.    You can take a wax candle and just pass the thread over and around the candle several times.  If the candle is quite hard, it may be harder to coat the thread.  This is also used with knitting machines to help the yarns go through the needles easier, and then it washes off the yarn when the knitting is finished.  You might see if you can get some of that -- it comes as a ring, and the yarns pass through the middle hole.    Eventually the wax will wash off (it is oil based) so you may be able to apply another coat, but is difficult once you have beads on it, or if it is tied in knots.    This is very similar to the "conditioners" that you put on your hair -- which are usually a wax or an oil of some kind.  It coats the outside of the hair to prevent rubbing from damaging it, and helps to smooth the rough spots so it has some shine.  It protects the hair from the elements as well, but really does nothing to repair the hair.  It washes off the next shampoo or two.  You can try re-waxing your bracelets and necklaces with some hair conditioner.  See if that works.|`|k0g1qjoXaa	No, don't think so
L4gRARNwaa	Guitar hero seems to be smoother and i like the guitar better.  Rockband has WAY more songs you can download and is a very solid game|`|R7PMrh2jaa	i'd say guitar hero world tour, it is only my opinion as a non-experienced gamer but i think this way: a little kid (rockband games) gets popular because of his awesome big brother (guitar hero games) :)|`|j6lQI8staa	I gotta go with Rockband 2. The guitar is more responsive and there are better songs available for download.|`|nOvIcE76aa	I actually perfer GH because its more challenging...Yes i know that rockband has good graphics but RB is way to easy for me...plus GH has way better songs|`|Xuc0EyHPaa	Get Guitar Hero World Tour.

nVmg2OIMaa	it depends on the mod I've seen strikefires hit 50 and disk shots hit 35 as I said it depends on the mod but if its like barrel replacement and air restrictor removal  maybe 30 each with the paint job maybe 40 each|`|8ZUSL5MIaa	Try and include facts like : No box Postage 10.00 , etc , stuff like that. But they are worth less than the original boxed item or even the original item without a box. It all depends on the mod. Generally if your modding the speed and power then your going to get a few extra dollars.|`|FTHswQIKaa	Try and post it at ValueJockey.com. It is free,and the community there should be able to tell you the value. Include a picture, it helps a lot.  http://www.valuejockey.com/|`|VIM4XmYNaa	I have no idea, try selling them for + half what you paid for, if you don't get any buyers maybe drop the price a little.
gfGsXVc3aa	The are you 23 posters are an advertisement for a new Disney fan club that will be targeted to the die hard fan of the company. The execs were receiving complaints that the other disney fan clubs were targeted to the average disney fan and not the "true" fan. The new club will have annual fee, special events and exclusive merchandise. The are you 23? is a reference to the year that the disney company was officially founded. - as posted on www.Laughingplace.com    Also the day that they are anoncing it March 10th is also the shareholder meeting in Oakland, CA so that is why they are waiting.     Hope this helps and enjoy ! ~Jena|`|BO67795Caa	maybe this will help|`|bJF3tGtfaa	They obviously want to keep us guessing! I can't wait to find out what it is though.|`|3f4ef632a48bd1b8ede650349bd993ebaa	I saw that.  The first thing I thought of was something with Michael Jordan or LeBron James.    I signed up for the e-mail though.
5daaaed244316df901a09bc7c5b64b53aa	You can get free Xbox Live GOLD and Xbox Points from Prize Rebel. It is a free survey site where you earn points towards prizes. This is how it works:    When you do surveys, large advertising companies pay those Prize websites a lot of money for that advertising. Then they give a percentage back to you towards prizes. Its not illegal its absolutely legitimate. Its not like you getting free downloads or anything. your just getting prizes for all the time you spend on those surveys.     Plus its not like they're giving you a "too good to be true deal" because it takes a good amount of time and effort to do those surveys correctly and getting points for it. But its a great way for us to take advantage of it. I work about an hour a day on it and i just got my first prize after working on a site for about 4-5 days.    I would recommend Prize Rebel to anyone who wants free stuff. They have a points system where you earn points by doing those online surveys they have online, only you just have to make sure to give fake info and different emails each time and you never have to give your credit card or anything.    You can pick from their list of prizes or you can custom order anything you want, just send them a support ticket and they'll buy you anything (like gift cards for EB Games or even eBay auctions, literally anything) 1 point = 1 USD.    Step By Step Guide (simplified):    1. Create an alternate email account at www.gmail.com (or other sites) and write down the username and password somewhere. Some offers need an email confirmation to get credited.  2. Sign up for the site using this link : http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=93... Give them you real e-mail (they wont spam you).   3. Complete offers.  4. Pick your free item.    Tips & Tricks (highly recommend you read)    1. Use real info to make sure you get credit. You may get banned if you use fake information.     2. Download Roboform! I HIGHLY recommend this, as it will save you a ton of time when filling out forms. www.roboform.com is the link. It is free, you can just use the demo version and it's just as good (don't pay for the full version unless you want to). It's a lot better than Google Autofill also.    3. When going through giant lists of Yes/No forms, just hold down Tab and press the left arrow key over and over to do it automatically. Be sure to say yes to at least one offer to make sure you're credited (I usually just do the newsletters)    4. After every offer, clear your cookies. Lots of these companies are linked together and if you have the same cookies you may not get credited. To clear cookies, click Tools and then click Clear Private Data (it may say Delete Browsing History), and check the cookies box and click OK.    5. Frequently make new alternate email addresses and use them in offers to ensure the company doesn't know your info.    6. Use Internet Explorer because I've found offers credit more often with this because the security is lower.    7. Be sure to allow cookies on all sites and set privacy to none. To do this click Tools, click Internet Options, click Privacy, and then slide the bar all the way down to Accept All Cookies. If you have cookies off, you will NOT ever get credited.     The best part is that you don't have to give them your information if you dont want to. For example, if you just want Xbox Live points, they will e-mail you the code.    You can also look up tutorials on YouTube.    You can see a list of prizes and sign up here if you are interested. Hope this helped.   http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=93...|`|AUCcZ8lQaa	No, just select your cell phone and pick multiplayer, then select Free Mode.  Then cause mayham

M7G3MZb5aa	The problem with the other answer is that the first three rolls DO have an effect on the odds of the 4 remaining from the 4th roll on.  If the 4 is remarked and needs to reappear on the 4th roll to be corrected back to the number 4,  it is different than if the 4 is NOT remarked in the first three rolls, then on the 4th roll ANY side can come up, since the 4 will either be remarked as a 4, or any other side rolling will simply result in an additional four somewhere else on the dice, after the 4th roll, all rolls must not land on the side with the original 4. factoring in the frequency at which the 4 is remarked during the first three rolls is neccessary for the accuracy of the probibility.  The other answer is correct, except it does not consider the possibility that the 4 will may be changed to another number during the first three rolls, only to be reverted back to a four on the 4th roll.    This is what i have figured, after the first three rolls, which are important, but do not directly prohibit the 4 from not remaining on the side it was originally on.....    ---42.129% of the time, the probibility of the 4 remaining at the end of 6 rolls is 11.574%    ---57.871% of the time the probibility of the 4 remaining is 69.44444...%    Both of these calulate the neccessary outcomes of rolls 4,5,6 according to what happened on the first 3 rolls, however, depending on weather or not the 4 res changed in the first 3 rolls, the odds are different that it would remain after 6.    You would need to somehow combine them accurately into the average probibility i suppose.    I would multiply each probibility, by the percent that is represents or the total of all possible events, and add them together, then divide by the 100 (the total of all percents of all possible events)    i came up with.....45.064% probibility that a 4 would remain marked on the spot that originally had a 4 on it.|`|2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	Sure would like to be able to answer this one..  But   Ya Got Me..|`|eNHGiEvGaa	You're right, probability is hard.    I came up with the same 45.064% answer as above.  Here's how I approached it:    (5/6)^3 is the chance that the 4 will not be rolled in the first three rolls: 57.87%.  In such a case, we can guarantee that there will be a 4 on the die after the 4th roll.    Subtract this from 1, and you get the chance that a 4 will be rolled and effaced: 42.13%.  But, if this occurs, then there is a 1/6 chance to roll a 4 on the 4th roll to correct that face.  So this accounts for another 7.02% chance that there will be a 4 on the die after the 4th roll.    Add the above together:  57.87% + 7.02% =  64.89% is the chance that you will have a 4 on the die after 4 rolls.  Now all you have to do is survive two more rolls without rolling a 4 again:  64.89% * 5/6 * 5/6 = approximately 45%.      If you don't round until the final step, it comes in slightly under 45.064%|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	I'll go with 1/6 * 5/6 * 5/6, you can do the math.    Needing a 1/6 chance for the inital 4 spot to come up on the 4th roll.  Then had to make sure that spot didn't come up on the 5th or 6th rolls.|`|VzJQUCPIaa	There are 6^6 or 46,656 possible outcomes. Divide this into 2 groups:    Group 1: Trials 1-3 don't matter, trial 4 comes up with the original '4' side (7776 combinations). Of these, the '4' side would remain unchanged by not rolling it again on the 5th or 6th trials (7560 combinations.)    Group 2: Trial 4 doesn't matter (since handled by group 1), just have to avoid the '4' side on all the other 5 trials. This would be ((5^5)*6) - 7776 or 10,974 combinations    This means (7560+10,974)/46,656 or just under 40% chance the original '4' side still shows a 4.
