MrhVcAqZaa	Yes. We missed the opportunity to change our country. Everything was a missed opportunity. The ousting of Marcos Regime could have been the opportunity for us Filipinos to be better, maybe so much more better than before. The people who started the EDSA missed those golden chances of leading this country to be in her glory. On the other hand, the personalities of EDSA  never missed the opportunity to enrich themselves and placed themselves to power. <br>  <br>  Note: I didn't had the chance to see the interview of commodore robles Allan. This is my personal opinion.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	Yes.  We missed the opportunity that the event in Edsa brought us.  It should have been a good time to start with a pristine government and honest governance manned by unscrupulous people.  It should have been a good lesson to us at how important preserving democracy is in our country and to never allow dictatorship, in any form or under what name, to control us.<br>  <br>  Filipinos have very short memories.  We forgot how others made big sacrifices, some offered their lives, just so we can redeem the democracy that we have lost.   We forgot how to value our being free.  Free to voice out our concerns without fear of threats or deaths.  I think the most valuable lesson is never to be dictated upon and never to be duped into believing the words/promises of "trapos".  Likewise, to be vigilant at all times lest we become complacent in the security we feel right now... only to wake up, one day, and find out we have another dictator at the helm of our country/government.|`|YALlJatBaa	Yeah.  I missed it.<br>  <br>  I was also in Riyadh back in that time.   And this friend of mine, a Filipino, who says he is Chinese when ever anyone asks, says he dreamed of an uprising.   That next morning when the news reached us, he was so flustered that his dream came true.  Of course, he could just be pulling our leg, and must have heard it all on radio.<br>  <br>  But the event really was a missed golden opportunity.   I could have used all the commotion to rob the Central Bank.|`|AA11212130	If we are talking about EDSA 1986...It is a golden era that no one in this world have missed. If there is anyone who failed to be mesmerized with the greatness of that event, it would be the Marcoses. <br>  <br>  If we are talking about EDSA nowadays...It is a golden road that causes traffic jam and need to be missed on rush hours!<br>  <br>  =D|`|HY7x9j7yaa	a big "YES"|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	my lips are sealed....|`|VGMFkcziaa	I think not.

MrhVcAqZaa	It is wishful thinking of a corrupt leader who doesn't want to leave the office.<br>  <br>  It is also can be one way of discouraging the people that another EDSA wouldn't as effective as it was before. Some sort of reverse psychology, anyway if you heard that kind of comment, would you still join another EDSA? <br>  <br>  The problem is the comment came from a leader whom we all happened to hate. If the comment came from President Barrack Obama I would have believed. But from GMA? Nah... I don't think so... why will I believe a cheater?|`|z5fFoTMBaa	These are my thoughts:<br>  <br>  What's the world have to do with EDSA? Is it because if we show them we are a rowdy, raucous, unruly folks they will pull away their investments?<br>  <br>  Personally, I think they should find another street. Another revolution in that historical thoroughfare in the name of "freedom", convenience, and whatever they want to call it is a blatant disrespect for the people who gave them the freedom they are enjoying and abusing now. I don't think democracy is not fit for the Philippines. Or, at least, Filipinos do not have the capacity (hopefully not yet) to understand and appreciate it.<br>  <br>  Can we not move on as a mature people?|`|AA11212130	Naming and having another rally on EDSA ..for me is as simple as "I need power and publicity". <br>  <br>  EDSA 1986 gave the Philippines the deepest respect from the rest of the world. <br>  <br>  Those after that...simple as "I need to take Malacanang".|`|YALlJatBaa	Leave what the rest of the world thinks.<br>  <br>  If we want to stage another Edsa, the rest of the world has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  And if GMA says otherwise,  I may not agree with whatever she says, but I will fight for her right to say it.|`|DGACpICWaa	i dont know. maybe. siguro di ko alam eh. kung mangungurakot ang gobyerno natin malamang magkakaroon pa ng edsa 4.|`|VGMFkcziaa	whatever you do if we got corrupt government nothings gonna change i mean yes somethings change PH going even worst|`|pyhglHaSaa	The EDSA revolutions, particularly the People Power of 1986, will forever be etched in the minds of patriotic Filipinos.  That's because it was spontaneous, passionate and long-overdue!  At that time, the people has had enough of bad government and the catalyst that Aquino provided reverberated through the hearts of many.  And in unison the people cried for justice and won!<br>  <br>  A replay in 2001 was quite lackluster in comparison.  A 3rd replay is not going to do much either.  We don't need another EDSA.  What we probably need is a more drastic never-been-done tactic.  What happens if ALL Filipinos stay at home for a day or two - a 48-hour silent protest?  Absolutely no one leaves the home --- offices & classrooms would be empty; no one to ride and drive the buses, cabs, etc.; no one to answer phone calls in BIR, SSS, NCSO, etc.; no activity in all sectors in all of Metro Manila and all urban areas.  <br>  <br>  Let's see how GMA takes this message from the people - "Step down or do something right!"|`|ApYYZoxoaa	another EDSA?<br>  and what after the drama?
dpKntiZoaa	I just got home and heard this from my husband - I used to live very close to here until we moved last year and the planes came over very low.  It was always on my mind and my blood ran cold.<br>  <br>  On Dutch news it says there is going to be a press conference at 13.00 CET and wounded have been taken to hospitals - but no confirmation on how many have been fatally injured.  One newspaper says seven (a tabloid though) but a reputable site confirms 4/5 body bags have been taken from the plane - so I do fear that not all have survived, and thoughts are with family at the moment.  I hope for the best, but fear for the worst.<br>  <br>  Hopefully the press conference will clarify and help to stop rumours.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Tv news (Dutch) confirmed (13.06pm) the press conference is moved to 13.30 but eye witnessess have confirmed more than one fatality.<br>  <br>  The Dutch national news channel are reporting nine fatalities.  A member of the crisisteam mentioned over fifteen, including the pilot and crew in the cockpit.<br>  <br>  EDIT 13.33 - the news conference in Dutch confirms 9 fatalities and over 50 wounded at this time.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Unfortunately it is no a rumour.  I watched the press conference on tv here myself with the regional major who have the confirmation with the authorities as well.  So this is official very unfortunately.

I3z7y7xZaa	Oh my giddy aunt!! I live on the Isle of Wight lol- what a coincidence!! And I'm going to the festival, too!! Whoop whoop!!<br>  Right...it will take you quite a long time to walk from ryde to newport, and were talking HOURS!! Not to mention getting lost and everything...as I dont even think I could walk that far, and I've lived on the island all my life! It is actually SO FAR, thinking about it, and I really dont think it's a good idea. It's miles!!!! You'll be in agony by the end of it lol- trust me!<br>  <br>  But don't worry...there really is no need to walk, anyways! Just get on the bus and ask for a 'student rider'. This is where if your a student living on the island you can get anywhere for just ￡1.00! Your meant to have a little student rider card that you show, but I dont have one and my friends dont have one and we still get away with it if you ask for a student rider and if they say ''where's your card'' just say I do have one but I left it at home. lol. Works every time! So...just get on the bus and say '2 student riders to newport please'' and it will be only ￡2.00 for the both of you to get there, which is near to nothing, really!<br>  <br>  ANYTHING is better than walking to newport! Believe me...the word 'torturous' would be an understatement!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and good luck, and have lots of fun at the festival!! Rumour has it....Blondie are playing!! YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  XXXXXXXXXXXXX
rvTcDJ6yaa	I travelled around Europe by myself for the most part. I did what you are going to do and found I felt safe everywhere I went.<br>  I did what you are going to do...I got up early and got out about doing all my sightseeing and then headed back around 5-6pm..After 10 hours or so of wandering around I was quite tired. I would eat at my accommodation or close by or even get some food to take back with me. In the evenings  had a book, watched CNN ( usually the only english speaking travel) listened to music and wrote postcards and in my travel diary. At times I was able to socialise depending on where I was staying ( Hostels are better for socialising in the lounge area!)<br>  <br>  As pointed out just use your common sense, don't advertise things to take eg keep your bags closed at all times, keep things in your inner pockets as outer pockets on a bag are more easily accessable to "pickpockets" have some dafeguards for just in case ( eg copies of everything in different places, extra money hidden somewhere etc)<br>  The only pickpocket I ever came eye to eye with was in Barcelona where a gypsy woman came up to put a carnation on my lapel...there is another woman coming up from behind..one of the few places I travelled with a friend who know what was happening and pulled me away. Just keep an eye out, keep a hand on your bag at all times.Have a fantastic time..its a wonderful place!!! Don;t be afraid to go east either...I went ot Czech republic, slovenia and croatia as well and they rate in my top places...utterly wonderful!|`|kfMcRr1Vaa	yes all very safe|`|JHAqEETmaa	It's safe in those countries but use your common sense.<br>  For ex, in any big city don't go to problematic parts of that city.<br>  If you see in the street some suspect people avoid them.<br>  If someone approaches you with strange intentions go away, call the police, well you know what to do.<br>  <br>  PS - why not Portugal? is near Spain, very friendly people and quite cheap. and fantastic too!|`|AA10347643	Not at all an issue to travel alone but make sure not to be spotted that you are alone just for safety measures.
W9zRaPp9aa	3,500 Baht is minimal for farm labor here in Thailand. This would probably be the minimum an individual would make and if is possible to support one local Thai on this income upcountry.<br>  <br>  Laborers from the refuge camps around the Cambodian border make about 60 baht per day for common farm labor.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that for most families who do not own property both parents will work and children above age 16 will also work in some capacity to keep the family in food and shelter. <br>  <br>  Hotel maids make between 5,000 and 6,000 baht per month and that is considered good.<br>  <br>  It is not what you or I would consider a good living, but it is subsistence.|`|AA10254694	Usually Thais live in family groups and pool their money.  A single Thai would have trouble living on 3500 baht but its better than no baht.

The Crimea, a little "continent" of its own, is a popular vacation destination for tourists for swimming or suntaning on the Black Sea with its warm climate, rugged mountains, plateaus and ancient ruins.

Love the people there, they are very open and friendly. You can't help but learn Italian. That is what I loved most. <br>  <br>  Then there is the food and that is also something worth visiting for.|`|896406d7dedb37c4ef791414e98ee7d9aa	They call Italy the Beautiful country (Bel Paese) because of the natural enviroment so varied (from Alpes to sea) and the pieces of art (architecture, sculpture, paintings) you can admire. They say that more than 50% of western art are in Italy.<br>  Another art, tipically italian, is cuisine with such a variety of dishes and wines. In Italy have been living, in the centuries, Arabas, Spanish, French, Normans, Germans, Austrians ans many others, that gave such a cultural diversity to the country, including many dialects. Even for that italians, generally speaking, are tolerant|`|C0xGFq2Qaa	I lived there six years.  It was absolutely amazing.  I have to say that my favorite places to go were downtown Vicenza and San Marino, but I also loved Venice, Rome, Pisa, and Verona.  <br>  If the pizza isn't enough, Italian pasta is simply amazing.

AA10740352	I have been to Alaska twice, once  in June and then on a cruise inside passage and land tour in May. What you need to pack is not that much different from any other cruise or trip. The weather in Alaska on land can be very pleasant; maybe in the 70's during the day. It will likely be rainy in a couple of your port stops like Juneau and Ketchkan. Not a downpour but like showers.<br>  <br>  It will be pleasant on ship while you are in inside area but breezy and chilly on open decks. When you get near the icebergs and glaciers it will be cold. And I mean like hat, coat and gloves cold. But the way to dress is layer your clothes so you will be warm enough when its cold but not too hot when you are in warmer areas. Instead of a ski jacket, take a lighter one that you can wear comfortably over a sweater or hoodie. Take some long sleeved shirts and slacks. Take a cap or hat and even gloves. Think underclothes, shirt, sweater, jacket for your dress each day.<br>  <br>  Most ships that do the Alaska cruises have areas where you can see things without being outside. They also generally have a solarium, a glass covered pool and hot tub area. And of course the ship will have a gym. So you can take things to enjoy these activities on ship.<br>  <br>  The dress on ship is casual all day until 6:00PM. So take:<br>  - swim wear,<br>  -sun glasses and sun screen, lotions,<br>  -a warmup suit or sweats to relax on ship in,<br>  - a hoodie and a jacket that you can wear over it,<br>  - a hat and gloves for when you get near the glaciers and ice fields,<br>  - a rain poncho because it will likely rain in Ketchakan and/or Juneau,<br>  -a book if you are a reader,<br>  -your music player,<br>  -sneakers and clothes to workout in if you like to use the gym, -good walking shoes,<br>  -your camera, and binoculars,<br>  -other personal toiletries.<br>  <br>  After 6:00 PM they request that you wear "sports or resort casual" attire. That's attire that you would expect a person to wear in a business office, (like a bank employee), shirt with a collar, slacks, skirt, blouse, etc. You can still wear shorts and swim wear in the pools and spas but not in public areas like dining rooms and restaurants, show rooms, bars, casino, etc. Don't over pack , take clothes that you can mix and match tops and bottoms and plan to wear each piece twice.<br>  <br>  Your cruise will have a formal night when you can wear your best stuff and get pictures taken, and maybe meet the ship’s Captain. The formal nights are REQUESTED not required attire. You will not be denied entry to the main dining room if you decide not to dress up, as long as you are at least sports casual. But most people do dress up; a suit or tux for men and a gown or party dress for women. Women should take a shawl or other wrap for the formal dress.<br>  <br>  Some other packing tips:<br>  <br>  - Its best to pack using soft-sided luggage because with space limited in your cabin it fits under the beds better if its not hard sided luggage.<br>  <br>  -Take a small carry-on bag for the last night of the cruise. On the last evening you will be required to put your luggage outside your cabin by about 2:00 AM so that they can start taking it down to the lower deck for offloading the next morning. So you will need a small bag for your toiletries and your clothes that you sleep in.<br>  <br>  - If you want to use the pool, hot tub, or gym as soon as you get on the ship, take clothes for these in your carry on bag because your checked luggage will likely not get to your room until much later in the afternoon, maybe by @ 6:00 PM.<br>  <br>  - If you are taking your cell phone, MP3 player or other item that needs to be plugged in take an extension cord as the plugs in the cabin are generally not in the best places and there are usually only one or two.<br>  <br>  - Take a small bottle of hand sanitizer and/or hand wipes. There are generally sanitizer dispensers at the entrances of restaurants, the buffets and dining room, but some times the are not there or not working. The sanitizer helps prevent the spread of the Norwalk Virus that sometimes occur on cruise ships.<br>  <br>  - Take a can of air freshener for your cabin bathroom; it has no exhaust fan.|`|AA12333875	Depending what weather you are use to it is nice weather in Sept. I live in upstate New York & our weather is about the same. Always alittle cooler near or on the water. Day time highs in the 70's & nights in the 40's. I have taken over 29 cruises there & some say to expect rain but, I have only seen rain once between ports which only lasted afew hours.I only wear jeans & T-Shirts & lite weight jeans jacket. Never saw anyone with a heavy coat or gloves.<br>  Enjoy.
LN3ocDmXaa	2 points of the triangle are at florida USA (miami i think) and the island called bermuda.|`|2Itepwgsaa	The boundaries of the Triangle vary with the author; some stating its shape is akin to a trapezoid covering the Straits of Florida, the Bahamas and the entire Caribbean island area and the Atlantic east to the Azores; others add to it the Gulf of Mexico. The more familiar, triangular boundary in most written works has as its points somewhere on the Atlantic coast of Florida; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and the mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda, with most of the accidents concentrated along the southern boundary around the Bahamas and the Florida Straits.<br>  The area of the Triangle varies by author.<br>  <br>  The area is one of the most heavily-sailed shipping lanes in the world, with ships crossing through it daily for ports in the Americas, Europe, and the Caribbean Islands. Cruise ships are also plentiful, and pleasure craft regularly go back and forth between Florida and the islands. It is also a heavily flown route for commercial and private aircraft heading towards Florida, the Caribbean and South America from points north.<br>  <br>  The Gulf Stream ocean current flows through the Triangle after leaving the Gulf of Mexico; its current of five to six knots may have played a part in a number of disappearances. Sudden storms can and do appear, and in the summer to late fall hurricanes strike the area. The combination of heavy maritime traffic and tempestuous weather makes it inevitable that vessels could founder in storms and be lost without a trace – especially before improved telecommunications, radar and satellite technology arrived late in the 20th century.|`|lDzw5NSqaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HquSLVaRyQ0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HquSLVaRy...</a>|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	If you connect Bermuda, Florida and Cuba you get the region referred to as the Bermuda Triangle|`|MvHqbWmNaa	The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a region of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean in which a number of aircraft and surface vessels are alleged to have disappeared. Some people have claimed that these disappearances fall beyond the boundaries of human error, equipment failure or natural disasters. Popular culture has attributed some of these disappearances to the paranormal, a suspension of the laws of physics, or activity by extraterrestrial beings. Though a substantial body of documentation exists showing numerous incidents to have been inaccurately reported or embellished by later authors, and numerous official agencies have gone on record as stating that the number and nature of disappearances is similar to any other area of ocean, proponents of paranormal phenomena claim that many have remained unexplained despite considerable investigation.

Bangkok is for shopping and Temples visit. So polluted that I am sure honeymooners will not enjoy.  The South is seas and beaches with all those breath-taking beauty of white sands and sunny days along the beaches. Chiang Mai, the North of Thailand, is a low-faced tempo of life with beautiful nature of beautiful flowers and trees.  It is always cooler at night times.  The beautiful waterfalls adds life to the green scenarios.  People are very friendly and hospitable. Shopping is always a bar gin that you will enjoy to try your ability.  May is somewhat a rainy month and might enjoy "walking in the rain once in a while.  From Bangkok , getting of the plane, go to Chiang Mai.  Spend a week in Chiang Mai and then fly direct to The South. Spend a week there, and then go back to Bangkok for shopping and <br>  sight-seeing.  And from Bangkok, you can fly back to your destination.|`|627c2b0c53e67e0573c687d7108ae06daa	Phuket or Chaing Mai???? huh??<br>  <br>  Chaing Mai is in the north; Phuket is an island in the south.<br>  both are better than Bangkok for honeymoon; but I always think, "beach" for honeymoon...<br>  (phuket)<br>  cept that there are sooo many prostitutes there<br>  less so in Chaing Mai<br>  <br>  In May it should still be end of hot season, maybe transitioning into rainy season|`|8eSKd8QXaa	If you have never been to Bangkok don't bother about it the traffic jams will put you off about Bangkok, Phuket is a nicer place for a honeymoon or Chiang Mai, Chang Mai is cooler compared the former The history of Thailand started in Chaing Mai interesting place.|`|94ab0da7299b6d087039f5b8d0109652aa	Bangkok|`|1FPTD5I5aa	Spend a few days in Bangkok at the beginning of your trip and at least a final night back in Bangkok before you fly home.  This way you can relax a bit, see the city and perhaps take a tour or two.  You can get tours through travel agencies pretty easy, choose a tour one day and leave the following day.    Sometimes choose a tour in the morning and leave that afternoon or evening.<br>  <br>  The last night in Bangkok will set you up for your taxi ride back to the airport and give you a final day of souvenir shopping.  You could also take in a dinner cruise too.  To go all the way to Thailand and not see Bangkok wouldn't be too smart.     <br>  <br>  If you need any hotel recommendations mention how much you want to spend per night.  Choose a hotel near the Skytrain route so you can use that overhead transportation to get around the city.  <br>  <br>  While you are in Bangkok you can either arrange for an overnight sleeper train to Chiang Mai or arrange for a flight through one of the many travel agencies.   In Chiang Mai you can also get tours through travel agencies.  You can visit hill tribes, see the Long Neck Women, visit the Golden Triangle area and Chiang Rai.  Also, there is rafting and visits with elephants.  A visit of 5 or 6 days in Chiang Mai will work out okay.   Why Chiang Mai and not Phuket, it is because you can find beaches in many countries all over the world, visit Northern Thailand and see some of places that make Thailand so unique.<br>  <br>  Thailand is warm all over and you will still get a tan in Bangkok and Chiang Mai.    Some hotels have pools.   Read up on Chiang Mai and Bangkok and see what interests you. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nxVcydKRaa	I suggest Chiang Mai because bangkok is a heavily polluted city. I went to bangkok this year and it was very busy and there was a hazy sky a lot of the time. Chiang mai might be better because its further up north and they have wonderful fabrics up there. You could  do some shopping during your honeymoon. I also suggest some of the beaches that are very pretty, maybe even go snorkeling on Ko Samet, Ko Tao or Phuket. Another great place to visit in Thailand is The Erewan Falls in Kanchaneburry (might be misspelled), it is a seven teared waterfall and once you get to the top it is amazing. A must go to is Bangkok they have a tourist street if you like and they have the Grand Palace with many magnificent building with Boddi Satvas carved into them. The downside of Bangkok is that the Tuk Tuk drivers will rip you off and take you round about town. Don't listen to someone if they say that the place you are going to is closed or if a temple is closed and will be open later than 6:30 because its a lie. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Have fun wherever you go! ^.^|`|pmJ5wOilaa	If you're only there for 10 to 14 days, it seems a bit of a trek up to Chiang Mai and then all the way back to Phuket.<br>  <br>  While Bangkok isn't the most scenic city in the world ("Ah darling, isn't the dawn traffic beautiful!"), there are plenty of things to see and do. The Temple of The Emerald Buddha, The Grand Palace, The Floating Market, not to mention shopping in places like the MBK Centre, Emporium and CentralWorld. Sure they're the tourist spots, but then you are first-time tourists so cover the obvious places as an easy introduction to the country.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy yourselves, the next time maybe hit the likes of Chiang Mai,Chiang Rai, Koh Chang or whatever. 10-14 days isn't really a lot of time to get a feel for the country.|`|KXpxXPPFaa	My friends and family live there.  I travel there all the time.  The Hotel, Resorts in the hills above Chiang Mai are the best.  Privacy, a true romantic, tropical experience.

And when Egyptians were building pyramids, everybody else was still hanging in trees. So I don't get why some Greeks get off on that stupid "you were hanging around in trees" bit, especially considering that MODERN Athens, for example, was a speck on the map until the early part of the 20th century. Guess it's easier to judge others from the great past of 2,500 years ago rather than the nothingness of even 100 years ago when Greeks were the ones swinging around from trees. Krima.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I don't know what my people were doing 2,500 years ago, since unfortunately my ancestors didn't think to pass down a family tree through the millennia.

Perhaps your people were swinging from trees back then too.<br>  <br>  Anyway, what I want to say is, yes one should be proud of his/her origins and history, but using that to support some sort of superiority complex (which is the obvious intent of that expression) is just lame. There's a difference between being proud and being arrogant. That expression falls into the latter category.<br>  <br>  @Feta: Good quote you picked. Yes, it's apparent from Plato's writings that Socrates didn't have much of a relationship with his wife. If I remember correctly, there's a story that while Socrates was imprisoned awaiting his death penalty, his wife came to visit him. Socrates was totally oblivious to her presence, as he was concentrated in deep thought, and so to get him back to his senses, his wife pissed on him. What a woman.

pcHp7Dgkaa	All citizens and permanent residents are eligible for Medicare.<br>  <br>  It pays for 100% of care and medical treatment in public hospitals and a percentage (can be 100% though more often less than that) of the cost of out of hospital GP and specialist visits, pathology and ancillary medical services. Most dental, optical and physiotherapy services are not covered by Medicare. Doctors and specialists are generally privately employed and patients can freely choose their doctors and specialists for out of hospital care.<br>  <a href="http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/public/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/publ...</a><br>  <br>  Patients can also take out private health insurance if they wish to be treated in a private hospital and also for items not covered by Medicare (dental etc). Medicare pays part of private hospital cover charges and premiums are subsidised by the government. Private health insurance is inexpensive compared to most overseas countries and the principle of 'community cover' applies. Private funds MUST accept (and continue to cover) all applicants regardless of their medical, surgical or claims history and the same premiums must be charged to everyone with the same level of cover in that fund.|`|wcUhuNPVaa	Like the person above said its called Medicare. If you live in the USA you probably would find it hard to understand. But basically the government pays a scheduled fee when you see a doctor or buy prescription medication or go to hospital.<br>  Say for example the government pays $20.00 when you see a doctor some doctors charge $30-$50 more than that so the government pays the first $20 and the patient pays the balance. But some doctors only charge $20 so the ptient pays nothing else<br>  And if you buy prescription medicines you only pay about $20 and the government pays the rest of the purchase price.|`|TzPofCDxaa	It is called Medicare and 1% of your tax pays for it.<br>  It is called a Medicare levy.<br>  <br>  Brilliant system and top level care.

Typically, if you act like you know what you are doing, and immiediatly give them a credit card, they may not even ask for ID. If you look really young, you might have a problem.

xcDwLp4uaa	OK well first of all you should have known that journalists are notoriously underpaid before you started studying so ask yourself why you went into that field. Are you passionate about it? Do you enjoy it? Those things are more important than money at the end of the day (in my opinion). If it is what you want to do then don’t give up at this first obstacle. <br>  <br>  Secondly where are you studying? Some journalism degrees are out of favour in the industry, which could explain why you are struggling. This would also be important if you are changing course, make sure that you go somewhere with respected programmes in whatever field you decide on.<br>  <br>  Thirdly where and how are you applying for internships? What media do you want to be in? Are you passionate about news, sport, fashion etc? Have you had someone else look at your CV? Do you have a portfolio?  Be willing to work for free as an intern, be willing to work night shift etc all you need is a foot in the door.<br>  <br>  Besides writing what other skills do you bring to the table? Do you have any outside interests or hobbies? What is your other major? You need to stand out from all the other applicants.<br>  <br>  I think it is quite normal to have these doubts at this stage of your education it can be quite overwhelming trying to enter any industry. The media industry is also under a lot of strain due to the economy, as I'm sure you know. <br>  <br>  Alternatives...since you are so far along in your degree I would look at alternative majors that you can transfer some of your credits to. You don't want to start all over again. Maybe law?<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for you :-)|`|XtlbY0rvaa	with the 2010 World Cup less than 500 days away , I hear prostitution will be paying well (you can demand payment in Euros and $$$ plus you will get protection from the government)<br>  <br>  EDIT: TLC, thanks for your pm - glad to see you have a sense of humour|`|HeD1Uchqaa	Insurance is always a thriving business.

Their religion gives them no choice.<br>  <br>  The Muslims are also against their fellow Arabs. Reports about the repression of Hamas opponents were obtained from Palestinians detained by the IDF during Operation Cast Lead. For example, Hamas operative Nawaf Faisal Atar, a resident of Al-Atatra who was detained on January 11, said that Gazans who dared to oppose Hamas were shot in the legs [as corroborated by the Amnesty report]. He said that Gazans were afraid to oppose Hamas because its operatives did not hesitate to call people Israeli collaborators and execute them. <br>  <br>  Hamad Fajar Saleh, a resident of Jabaliya, who was detained on January 12, said that in 2007 Hamas operatives shot and killed his brother, who had guarded the house of the Palestinian Authority employee responsible for internal security. He also said that Hamas prevented people affiliated with Fatah from getting the food and other items of humanitarian aid they were entitled to from UNRWA.<br>  <br>  In addition the media (especially those affiliated with Fatah) issued similar reports. For example, during Operation Cast Lead a motorcyclist was reported to have shot and killed a Palestinian in Gaza who had been suspected of collaborating with Israel and who escaped from the detention facility attacked by the Israeli Air Force. According to eye witnesses, the victim was shot three times in the head and chest.<br>  <br>  .|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	This subject requires an immense amount of reading.

UIJorsD7aa	@nada (what an appropriate name... lol):<br>  You are an antisemite if you buy into Holocaust denial, which you obviously do!!!<br>  <br>  6 MILLION MURDERED JEWS IS THE NUMBER THE NAZIS RECORDED!!!!!<br>  <br>  The Nizkor Project, an anti-denial group based out of Canada, puts simply puts it: "Given the evidence... why do people deny the Holocaust?"<br>  <br>  Today, denial has largely been relegated to fringe hate groups, neo-Nazis, and blatant anti-Semites. So for the answer, it's worth looking at what such groups themselves say on the subject. The Nizkor Project has an entire section of its website devoted to the statements of the National Socialist White People's Party on denial. Their leader, Harold Covington, is quoted from a 1996 bulletin paraphrasing leading critic of Holocaust denial Deborah Lipstadt:<br>  <br>  "The real purpose of Holocaust revisionism is to make National Socialism an acceptable political alternative again," Covington summarizes. Then he adds, "I normally don't agree with anything a Jew says, but I recall exclaiming, 'Bingo! Got it in one! Give that lady a cigar!'"<br>  <br>  Covington is quoted elsewhere as saying, "Take away the Holocaust and what do you have left? Without their precious Holocaust, what are the Jews? Just a grubby little bunch of international bandits and assassins and squatters who have perpetrated the most massive, cynical fraud in human history."<br>  <br>  Many see Holocaust denial as an anti-Semitic attempt to legitimize white power and hate group ideology. Though some deniers have attempted to minimize this reality and cloak their efforts in scholarship, their own statements reveal their primary motivations.<br>  <br>  Still in the years just after the Holocaust, denial was less a blatantly anti-Semitic movement and more the outgrowth of extreme libertarianism, anti-war thinkers, and perpetrators themselves attempting to avoid blame.<br>  <br>  The father of the denial movement was Harry Elmer Barnes. Hardly a raving anti-Semite, he was once a respected historian. He was an anti-war writer in the years prior to World War II, and after the war based his criticism of U.S. involvement on libertarian principles. It was these positions that led Barnes to write off the Holocaust as a piece of Allied propaganda--something most other libertarians rejected even while embracing his other writings.<br>  <br>  However clear the historical record may be, it remains forever vulnerable to popular ignorance and apathy. The tactic of deniers is to pose questions, raise doubts, and ignore historical evidence. While informed people might call Holocaust denial ridiculous, their clear strategy and goals are far from that.|`|mB8Q3iXqaa	you people get off on asking these questions here... sick|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Of the 17 million who were killed in the Holocaust, 6 million were Jews.<br>  <br>  This has been established without a doubt.

yZkOeAgRaa	Hey there!<br>  <br>  You came to the right place--I grew up in Phoenix!  Given the time of year, your best bet for finding a hotel would be to look at a website like www.kayak.com.  It pulls rates from all sorts of different sites to find the best deal.  With Spring Training about to start, rooms can fill up fast.  it's still comfy in Phoenix right now, and with the ballgames many flock to the ballparks.<br>  <br>  Look at rooms in Mesa, Tempe, Chandler, and Ahwautukee.  These are outlying suburbs with easy access into the city (also where I grew up, so I know that area much better).  Chandler has a huge mall/shopping complex.  That city is about 15 miles outside downtown Phoenix.  Lots of good deals there.  In Tempe you've got Mill Avenue, just off ASU, with lots of good shopping.  Ikea is there.  You're a short jump to Scottsdale, the ritzy area with great shopping and eating.<br>  <br>  Given the time of year, you might check to see if you can get a good deal at the Pointe at South Mountain.  Gorgeous resort right at the border of Tempe and downtown Phoenix.<br>  <br>  If ytou need any restaurant tips, things to do, places to see, just send me an email.  I can list off LOTS to do and side trips you will love.

Then the work should be such that the child has regular contact with at least one parent.<br>  <br>  Children develop better when they feel secure and have a routine. That would be impossible if her only parent is working shifts. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could find work as ground crew with an airline for now.

j3S9Qlknaa	Food poisoning is a common, usually mild, but sometimes deadly illness. Typical symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea that occur suddenly (within 48 hours) after consuming a contaminated food or drink. Depending on the contaminant, fever and chills, bloody stools, dehydration, and nervous system damage may follow. These symptoms may affect one person or a group of people who ate the same thing (called an outbreak).<br>  <br>      * The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that in the United States, food poisoning causes about 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and up to 5,000 deaths each year. One of the most common bacterial forms of infection, the salmonellae organisms, account for $1 billion in medical costs and lost work time.<br>  <br>      * Worldwide, diarrheal illnesses are among the leading causes of death. Travelers to developing countries often encounter food poisoning in the form of traveler's diarrhea or "Montezuma’s revenge." Additionally, there are possible new global threats to the world's food supply through terrorist actions using food toxins as weapons.|`|u751ggNiaa	Food poisoning is when food is contaminated, and usually comes from a restaurant/food service establishment that makes you sick.

TcgUVcYwaa	If I was in your situation I would do the following:<br>  <br>  Do a quick visa run. As a US citizen you are allowed to stay 6 months starting from entry, so if you pop into France, Belguim or the Netherlands for a day or two you might get a new entry stamp and another full 6 months in the UK. You can find cheap flights by looking at www.skyscanner.net Do it as soon as possible so that it doesn't look like a visa run (if you do it with only a week left on your 6 months it will look suspicious and you might not be left in again) and if possible stay for longer than just a day. A week makes the story of "visiting friends" more plausible. I suggest picking a random bigger city with a university (not Paris, Brussels or Amsterdam!) and then using a hospitality site -  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_service" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality...</a><br>  <br>  Work on the front of getting married, in the UK and in Denmark. <br>  <br>  I found the following links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/infs/inf2visitors#9248746" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/infs/inf4husbandswivespartners" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/...</a><br>  <br>  Regardless of what the links say, worry about getting married first before you get worried about being allowed to live with each other. If push comes to shove and you are not allowed to join your husband in the UK (because he is too poor and cannot support you) you can always move to another EU country. As long as your husband is with you you can easily get a work and residency permit in another EU country. <br>  <br>  Another EU country is also the solution when you need to apply for the visa - instead of flying to the USA go to France and apply at the French embassy in Paris (or as alternatively mentioned, go to Sweden or Denmark). Wait for your visa to come through there, maybe with a small tent and sleeping bag, camping out to save money on accomodation. <br>  <br>  So the answer to your question seems to be the following - you can get married in Denmark, but then you need to wait in Denmark (or another country) for the spouse visa to come through before you can travel back to the UK. <br>  <br>  (I think you might be able to go back after the marriage as a visitor, but you wouldn't be able to start the process of getting all the documents you need in order to stay permanently.)  <br>  <br>  P.S. I am on couchsurfing - and would be willing to host you. This is to show you that hospitality sites really work.|`|agLImxKTaa	It sounds like there are way more complications to this than where you get married or apply for a visa.|`|qq5nceCXaa	Basically even if you apply for a spouse's visa you'll be in the same issue with accommodation, support and so on.  You can't show that he can support you (and the state expects adults to look after themselves not have mum and dad put them up).<br>  <br>  Getting married isn't going to help you much until you solve the support issue.  <br>  <br>  One option is that you find a job that no UK national can fill and then leave the country to apply for a work visa (tier 2).  This relies on you having a special skill and finding a suitable employer.  Sometimes family can help with that, but be careful as they are getting much stricter in this area.  The problem you'll have is maintenance funds again, so no money is a blocker, unless someone can provide you with a bank account and funds to get round this.<br>  <br>  On the whole until he has his back fixed and gets set up you're stuffed.  All the suitable routes (student, worker, etc) require money, and without that no one will want you.  The world hates an economic migrant, that's the odd thing about capitalism.  You can move jobs, money, factories, whatever all round the world, but labour is fixed.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Even if you were to get married in another country, you would still have to go back to your own country to wait for your spouse visa. Your husband will not be able to sponsor you for a visa until he gets a job and his finances in order. It's best to wait it out a few months. If you moved to the UK with him after getting married, you would not be automatically approved for a spouse visa

Air travel is still safe.  Just think about all the rides and fun you and your family will have at Disneyland.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Coincidence.

xiB1BPwsaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Didn't you notice that all this started to happen after Obama was sworn in as President???????????|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	It's weird but plane crashes tend to happen in threes.|`|Fm5YsQnfaa	Often air crashes go unreported. It depends on how much news is about at the time.<br>  <br>  Television news has to fill a slot and whilst airline crashes rate quite high on the list of things to report, if some one prominent had been assassinated and a major celebrity had been arrested, the stock exchange had crashed or the Aliens from some far off planet had landed somewhere. A foreign airline in a far off land crash landing may have slipped through with out note.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	1. First plane crash involved a bird strike. That would quite impressive if someone arranged that. <br>  <br>  2. Second was a horrible turboprop plane in a incident that involved bad weather.<br>  <br>  3. The one today is hard to determine, but regardless the death rate is very low. Luckily. <br>  <br>  Doesnt exactly seem like sabotage, does it?|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Coincidence.

It is weird that all of a sudden though 3 planes crashed, one deadly for everyone which some say could of been bad decision by pilot by flying through ice on auto pilot. The hudson river crash was very lucky, if that fuselage would of broke apart at least 3/4 wouldlda been dead.

UJoNqCLPaa	Well I'm from the UK.  I wouldn't say the people are hot over here! They are pale and not the best looking people tbh. The UK is well known for not having the best looking people in europe anyway. They have a lot of fake tan too just to make up for crap weather and they look a bit cheap and tacky.   Look up 'chavs' then you'll know what I mean.  The Uk is good to live as it is a thriving country although some brits are rude and always try to put on an act to look 'hard' which is stupid.  But only in the UK will you get this stupid behaviour.  Although the UK is going through a very difficult and hard time at the moment what with the recession and loss of jobs etc...  It's hard to find work plus immigration problems.   It's a good place to live, although if your looking for hot goodlooking people then the UK is definately not your best bet.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Oh dear......... I do hope these other posters never come here!|`|wvPDo4gXaa	i don't now what it is like to live there... but i doubt the people their are hot .. they look heartless.. okay they look like they have a stick up ther a$$|`|4Uyr6dUOaa	THe morjority off Brits are nice people, so you two stop slagging us off.

And we probably have the same sort of mix of people as from where you live, some hot, some not.   We are not all pasty and we are not all fat.   And all heartless? Wrong !|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	Its pretty cold! but fun :) and weer as Hot as they come haha :)!|`|MQJQDBONaa	Nope.  To be perfectly honest, the majority of the Brits are pretty stuck up and rude.  And hot?

UJoNqCLPaa	I don't know I also want to know if the trains will be up and running tomorrow morning.    If it snows like it did today then probably not. Your best bet is to listen to the radio and watch the tv news for updates.  We may not know until tomorrow morning.  Some transport might be running I don't know.|`|PZZkjST7aa	I think it depends how much it snows tonight.  Some did start running later in the day in London today, you can keep updated at the TfL website:  http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/livetravelnews...|`|QAwwmDuDaa	They will run but they might not be on time.|`|Y47WgY4Laa	We're not psychic unfortunately so your best bet is to keep an eye on the news, listen to the radio and keep checking the TfL news page:    http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/livetravelnews...|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	Who knows?    Even TfL won't until later tonight/tomorrow morning.  All you can do is log on when you wake up and/or look out of the window/listen to the local radio!
f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Not really. Some do let themselves go, true, but that is the way of things. I think you are just starting to notice it, like when one starts to read the obituaries or notice plane crashes and it seems like there are more than usual. Look at old family or general historical photos - you'll find fat people and skinny ones. It's the same anywhere.<br>  <br>  I do think everyone would be better off eating decent healthy food, but I don't think it's as bad as it's painted to be in the press. It is also not the government's responsibility - people need to account for their own health.<br>  <br>  And no, all Americans are not fat. Don't believe the hype. According to the media we are all fat and/or have eating disorders. Anything is more sensational and press worthy than the truth, which is that we have fat people and skinny people. How could all Americans be fat? Be logical. It's like that book on how French women don't get fat - well, some do.<br>  <br>  And the whole thing about obese people costing the healthy millions - is that worse than smokers or drinkers costing the country millions? Because the cancer and heart attack rates of those people are higher. Obese people generally don't live that long statistically so they aren't that much of a drain. They are just an easy visible target, as opposed to a drinker or smoker who is unhealthy but thin. <br>  <br>  It isn't as simple as it's made out to be.<br>  <br>  That said, I am always surprised by teens and college age students being fat - how is that possible? Older people have to work to keep weight off as gaining is part of aging to an extent. But a teenager has such a high metabolism that to be overweight at that age is a warning sign.|`|ZDTcxwtVaa	No, I honestly don't believe they are turning into an obese nation. Like any other country, they have their overweight people, and they have their skinny people. It's like any other country really.|`|4swYFtsSaa	no its pretty much the same as ever they have programs to sort out the fat kids in school and adults airnt like does fat lazy americans with there scooter things|`|4VY7u6tNaa	Crazygirl.....I hear ya!

My mother always told me never go out with a man with longer hair than you, or bigger boobs than you.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	Americans are fat period. And yes I am American. My husbands family is all irish and aome of them keep their weight down and the others REALLY let themselves go and go.It is a mosh pit at family get togethers for the food and they don't seem to ever make enough.It's really disgusting to watch them eat.At our edding, someone snuck into the food before the line to congradulate the couple and got mustard all over my dress. The pictures werent'' even finished. sigh|`|3Tlq60FTaa	Well all i know is dat we Irish love to eat out !!<br>  <br>  i know of quite a few small towns, maybe even villages with up to 5 takeaways at a time !!!<br>  And kids nowadays have so much more money that they used to for their lunch and so. <br>  <br>  I can't really say that Irish people are gone obese, but i can see where your coming from.
Vlp50eEGaa	The Thai military let PAD do whatever they wanted and didn't try to stop them this is the reason PAD was able to shutdown the airport.  Now the military will do what it should have done with PAD if the UDD would try anything stupid like that.  Troops would come out in full force.  The military controls the government here.  So no UDD would not even try to shutdown the airport.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	I don't think they will be  doing  such stupid thing again.  Because doing so, they are not just  destroying the present form of government, but they are destroying the whole country, economically and socially.|`|mnIeK8q6aa	I seriously doubt it. The airport occupation cost Thailand a fortune in missed business. Add to this the current world economical crisis, and the fact that the first thing people stop doing is going abroad on a holiday. <br>  The last thing Thailand wants is another airport occupation. This time it seems the authorities are much more on the ball than in the past. The UDD and the PAD can protest all they want, provided they do it in a civlized way.<br>  <br>  As in the past, you'll be perfectly save. Neither the UDD nor the PAD is intentionally targetting tourists. The airport was an exception. And even there no violence has been used.  <br>  <br>  Stay away from the government areas (the only thing more or less worth seeing there is Dusit Zoo anyway) and you will have a great holiday. <br>  <br>  Enjoy it! Leave the worries at home.|`|AA10213143	UDD,they are truely and strongly believe in democracy,they do all the things base on the democracy and human right. so they  pay respect for the country and the other people. this kind of people will never shut down the airport or do any thing that harm the other people's right. <br>  so don't worry u and the other people (both thai and foreiner) will be fine.<br>  <br>  the protester who had shutdown the airport last time was PAD. they are ****,no respect for anybody.  so please don't compare the UDD with this **** PAD. it's totally different.|`|j5UYj1RDaa	the udd wasn't the ones who shut it down it was pad. and they got there way..you don't need to be worried.

N4ZAzxdMaa	The state governments giving more and more licences to pubs have now made our youngsters real drunkards. I would like to tell this incident which happened recently when i visited India. I happened to go and spent some time in a pub with my friends. I was totally surprised to see many of the conumers in the pub were young kids of the age 16 to 18. Couple of them were my old friends''s sons. When I spoke to the pub staff, I came to know that they were frequent visitors. The worst part is that all of them came to the pub in their own bikes and will be driving back home after the consumption of alcohol. This culture has to be stopped or else as a nation we will pay a huge price later on. I realy support any one taking some initiative to put a control on such alcohol abuse by youngsters.|`|AA11272288	Your question is politically motivated so need not answer|`|AA10034457	Pub culture been a part and parcel of Indian culture from ages. There use to be toddy sale places where a woman sells toddy to male customers. So, bar tender being a lady is also part of Indian culture. Recent term pub culture is not new to India. Only difference is in olden days, people use to drink in open fields. Now they drink in a pub.|`|ZmikGFTEaa	Different people have different view.. people who are used to going to pubs will obviously vote against curbing pubs as they are addicted to going to pubs and hanging out there..<br>  but recent trends have showed that many of our youth are getting easily diverted and they loose their conscience easily and thanks to these pubs they get easy access to drugs and alcohol and then when they cross over extreme limits then they end up ruining their lives and become addicts and hence this leads to deterioration of their healths and all their moral culture and values become useless..<br>  India is a country of cultures and this pub culture is definitely not a part of indian culture and this is leading to the degradation of our youth and hence it has to be curbed and proper awareness has to be created..<br>  there are many other past times that youth can indulge in instead of going to pubs and hanging out ..<br>  Hope this helps
jLTDqVHsaa	Well, the difference is that some trains are local and some trains are express. In Manhattan, the 4/5 run express, and the 6 runs local, making every stop.    If a train stops at a station, it stops there in either direction. So, if there was a train that worked for you to get there, it will work for you coming back. The only change would be a time-of-day change; some trains that normally run express switch to local at late-night hours.    Look at the map:  http://mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm    White dots are express stops. All trains stop there. Black dots are local stops. Only the local trains stop there; expresses will SKIP those stations. For example, look in Manhattan along Central Park West. You're at 59th Street/Columbus Circle, and you want to get to 81st Street. You see it's a local stop. So, you get on the B or C train. If you got on the A train, it would blow right past the museum and wouldn't stop again until 125th.    There are printed maps on every subway platform and in every subway car. The printed maps have small letters next to each station to show you which trains stop there (if you're not sure which trains run local). There is also an information box at the bottom of the map to describe the nuances of each line regarding time of day and day of week. You can also see this information by clicking on a route icon to see its map.    The printed map is available in PDF format at the link I posted above.    So, on the 4/5/6, if you need to get to 86th Street, just take whichever train comes first, they'll all stop there. If you need to get to 77th, take the 6 only, as it's the local.    If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!|`|dQUEc95Paa	the 4,5, and 6 all goto different places....you should http://www.mta.info/nyct/subway/index.ht... make yourself familiar with the above link. It should be able to answer your questions about where they go and stuff. Some of the subways are express trains and thats why some routes overlap. Also sometimes some stops are shut down due to police activity and the such, that you have to keep upto date yourself. Weather doesnt really affect the subway besides some delays, but delays effect the whole system.

WfwFuQB0aa	most people have already answered the question.<br>  <br>  Mumbai (previously Bombay) is in the south of India whereas the Punjab is in the North and is predominantly a Sikh country and borders onto Pakistan and close to the Himalayan mountain range so therefore can be cooler in winter whereas Mumbai is closer to the equator so therefore much hotter.

PA0bGBtCaa	I would HIGHLY recommend not becoming a flight attendant right now for several reasons. The first as you mentioned is seniority. It can go a lot of ways here. If you are working for a large legacy airline like American, Delta, or Continental, then seniority is something you would never get. The only airlines that are hiring flight attendants right now are small regional airlines. I would say stay away from those because the pay is low and turnover is really high.<br>  <br>  I was a flight attendant for over three years. I had no seniority. I was on reserve status my whole time. That meant that I had to find a way to commute to my base city (usually a hub city for the airline) and get a crash pad (an apartment shared by up to 10 more flight attendants) and wait for my phone to ring telling me where I was flying to. You are guranteed a minimum of 75 hours of pay if you don't fly while you are waiting, but hours are not guranteed. You're filling in for sick leave, vacation, and last minute trip giveaways. A "trip" can vary. Usually I was gone for only four days at a time, but there was one trip where I worked 14 DAYS STRAIGHT! It's really hard to determine what you would actually work.<br>  <br>  Training length is also based on the airline. The airline I was an inflight with was about three weeks long. It's very intense and the studying is tremendous. I found that there were very few pro's to the job these days. Talking to some of the flight attendants I had met during my time said that being a flight attendant was awesome in the late 90's when the airlines were booming along with the economy. Nowadays it's cutback after cutback and their pay and benefits get slashed along with it. Flight attendants are constantly being laid off by the thousands only to be possibly recalled a few months later.<br>  <br>  I would focus on raising my child for a while until this economy settles down. The airlines are in the same cycle with the economy. When it picks up again, then the airlines will start adding more flights with demand and then they will need more flight attendants. But in the meantime, I would just find some sort of other job while your husband is away.|`|6q86rICnaa	Being away from your 18 month old is going to be extremely hard, and you have to deal with the stress of your husband not being around. Think about this.|`|lXaAFIHfaa	I think with your husband being gone for so long I think you should stay close to home until he is finished. Your precious daughter is going to need a parent that is consistently there for her everyday. Enjoy watching her grow and learn new things so you can share with your husband all that she is doing and he will enjoy it more coming from you than your mom. This is just a short season of your life. I can only imagine your need to not feel so isolated and lonely. Maybe you can look into getting a job nearby or doing daycare. Take the time while hubby is gone to look into and research all your options for becoming a flight attendant for when he returns. Good Luck!!

dpKntiZoaa	If you are visiting now, then visiting Aalsmeer or Lisse (De Keukenhof gardens where all the flowers are) is not really practical as there is nothing to see (and not open)    So, given the weather (yes it's bordering on average around 2 degrees the last week), then I would suggest:    2/3 days in and around Amsterdam.   - Anne Frank house  - Museums (depending on what you like, see here http://www.amsterdam.info/museums/) and/or galleries are also nice to see  - Sightseeing such as the Oude Kerk, Artis Zoo (town centre), Flea market, different squares, restaurants etc  - Canal cruise - nice (warm) way to see the city  - Seeing a bit more around Amsterdam such as De Bloemenmarkt, Albert Cuyp markt    1/2 days - Belgium  Gent & Brugge are really lovely towns to visit for the day    Other places in NL (for a 1/2 day trip from A'dam) as an idea:  - Madurodam - (good for at the end of the trip when you have seen more of NL) - is a Miniature creation of attractions and places in NL.  This can be combined with a trip to Den Haag (the Hague)  - Arnhem with Burgers Zoo, Open Air museum, and can combine with  Veluwe National park and Kr?ller-Mller Museum (art)  - Zaanse Schans - a taste of olden days and also windmills  - Rotterdam (personally not my taste, but a different city architecturally and feeling than Amsterdam)  - Delft is very beautiful and picturesque and you can see Delftware and potteries there    Y!A won't allow me to link everything (max 10 links), so a good site to read up on all the attractions is http://www.planetware.com/tourist-attrac...    P.S. - I forgot the clothing part (very important!).  It's cold and a little wet, and in some places mentioned, can also be windy.  Therefore, pack layers of clothing which are warm, sweaters, jeans, warm coat which is rainproof.  Umbrella's are not really practical due to the wind..... and good walking shoes - essential if you want to see a lot of places!    Have fun!|`|GfphOIdOaa	Antwerp's very nice as well. Keep in mind that you'll need an hour and a half to get to either Antwerp or Brugge from Amsterdam. It indeed is like 0 around her, sometimes snowing. Take a waterproof jacket with you and some good shoes. Leeuwarden is a nice place to visit as well (2 hour train). Still, in 5 days, I wouldn't pack the program too full. You rather may want to go to Rock planet at the edge of the red light district to see where Hard Rock Cafe got their idea from. I spend my 3 days there.|`|HRr6lZ16aa	This article is a bit older, so the prices might be out of date, but my coworkers wrote it specifically about daytrips from Amsterdam, and it's full of good ideas.

I believe what you are asking about is a "Visa Waiver" form.  They are for people coming to the U.S. as a visitor if they live in certain member countries.

WE DO NOT DESTROY PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR BLOODY NATIONALITIES.|`|XS8XRwpnaa	I agree with €ura .<br>  How can you think like this, how can you think 6 countries are enemies of the peace? <br>  And if Russia would destroy them, would  Russia help  with keeping peace on Earth ?|`|22dc2e8c806eff6be9ef6b2a1cd4f1dfaa	All nations in the Balkans and the Caucasus are "enemies of peace", because they're so willing to fight each other. However, I do believe that Russians should side with Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Cyprus in opposition to Albania, Turkey, and Azerbaijan, primarily because protecting the European civilisation should be their duty. There's no point in claiming any high ground here, just 'us and them'. Armenia is an external, non-European ally against a greater threat, though I'm quite certain that many Russians dislike it as much as Azerbaijan due to excessive immigration.<br>  <br>  Bosnia and FYROM are merely misguided, nothing profoundly wrong about these two. Bosnians are Muslim Serbs\Croatians. Macedonia has a large Muslim minority, but Macedonians themselves are really just an intermediate stage between Bulgarians and Serbs with a weird Alexander the Great fixation. The differences here are superficial, and the conflict not irreconcilable.<br>  <br>  Romania isn't an enemy at all. Do you mean that there are lots of gypsies there when emphasising the first part of the name? Well, as far as I know, Romanians are that fond of them either. I've got no quarrel with Romania, and polls show that Russians are comparatively well-disposed towards Moldovans (much better than towards Armenians, for instance).|`|6N47TXvsaa	I wish you could ask a question about the events of 23 February 1944.<br>  Why not discussing about the reason why Russia has many enemies. Isn’t it because of Russia’s notoriety?  Maybe we shall talk about the millions of people who were killed during Soviets. Russia has to help herself to solve her domestic problems such as economy and democracy.<br>  <br>  Although Russia is a significant power in the region but we are not afraid of anyone who threats of sovereignty. Death is better that the situation in which the non-Russian nations are facing within the Russian federation.
ymXlF9Rnaa	Relentless: The Struggle for Peace in Middle East. "Relentless" is a powerful one-hour documentary using primary source video clips to examine the history of the Mideast conflict and how the Peace Process unravelled in a surge of violence. "Relentless" provides Americans of all backgrounds and persuasions with the balanced, honest facts needed to understand and contextualize the struggle in the Middle East. An acclaimed production for individuals and nationwide communities concerned about the struggle within the Middle East and the threat of a broader conflict that could engulf the West. "Relentless" is an important documentary for anyone interested in learning the truth about the Middle East conflict. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2533702461706761547" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a>|`|tod8jy9Paa	Since Rabin there have been 6 Israeli leaders<br>  Begin<br>  Shamir<br>  Netanyahu<br>  Barak <br>  Sharon<br>  Olmert<br>  Probably out of this bunch of crooks Begin and Sharon were the worst but there is little to choose between anyone of them They all want to rid Palestine of all Arabs.|`|fvcLcPEFaa	I doubt that there is any strong leader in Israel , any of those can certainly lead for war ,but none of them can lead to peace , as we saw lately the negotiations between Israel and Hamas Via Egypt , Israel did not know what actually its all about , they went on capturing more Palestinian in west bank but they do not know what to do with them<br>  To cover up the lack of leader ship on the Israeli side ,they only are capable of causing the same on the the Palestinian side , since early occupation Israel has targeted so many Palestinian leaders , killed or jailed , <br>  but that who said Israel provides Arab with ( schools ,,, ) this is some thing the least can be described is funny , people before 1967 were living much better life in both of Gaza or in west bank , to provide Gaza now for instance with electricity or ,,,, it is a must , Israel should bring each Gazan all his needs . if Israel is making out of Gaza or west bank a big jail ,Israel then should provide each newly born kid all his needs from age 00 till 120 years old or more as long as he lives , so stop moaning and go do your duties , even more the same as German has paid Israel for a long time Israel must pay for the suffer of each Palestinian for the 60 years of war in which Israel was acting the master of WC|`|wVsjgj35aa	They have learned that negotiating for peace may result in death.|`|94bb61256f23e8536fbbb0c03386ad63aa	They have become more realistic and see the Arabs for what they really are.|`|b8ae5eef3b2d61ecb71b1965967306bcaa	This is an excellent question. Israel has become far too lenient in her treatment of Arabs since Rabin was executed. We must remember that Israel taught the Arabs about schools, hospitals and roads. Israel provides the Arabs in that region with food, medicine, water, electricity and building materials and has done so as charitable donations (Israel spends billions of shekalim each year donating these and other items to the Arabs). Her treatment of the Arabs has gone from soft to far, far too soft. Thank you for a good question.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	The Israel government now differentiates between the"good terrorists"  (PA and Fatah) and the "bad terrorists" (Hamas and other radical Islamist groups).<br>  <br>  People throughout Israel seethe at the very possibility that Israel might indeed trade hundreds of the most lethal convicted terrorists in exchange for the one Israeli whom Hamas has managed to kidnap. <br>  <br>  The people who most feel the injustice in their gut are the family members of the 1,478 people murdered by terrorists since the inception of the Oslo process in 1993. After all, freeing these terrorists would place highly motivated killers on the streets of Israel and create an incentive for Hamas to kidnap anyone else in Israel's open society, with the promise of even greater blackmail in the future.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .

I liked southside.. dont ask me about west side or downtown/northside i never realy go over there much except  go out downtown... orange park is too crowded during rush hour and weekends idk much about arlington but there are some nice homes there too, my friend's friend lives there and has a nice big house and pool... southside (the easternmost side of it) have very nice houses too, i know one 'hood that is gated.. but i like southside and the beaches.
RlXnu2Xyaa	Peru is an awesome place to visit. I don't know much about Cusco, but in Lima, to eat out you might need like 10 to 16 dollars per day. (not including alcohol). Of course it all depends on where you go. Per night, it could be between 30-50 bucks, again it all depends on where you go. Don't drink water from the sink, always buy bottles of water. Peruvians are used to drink water from the sink, but this might make you sick. Try not to eat fresh vegetables, unless you are in a nice restaurant( Because of the water). Don't take all your money with you. Specially in Cusco, because you are going to see little kids asking for money, and if you give them some and they see the rest of it, they might tell someone else and then you'll get in trouble. I could tell you lots of things about Lima, but I don't want to bother you. Take yellow taxis. Have fun. Enjoy the food which is awesome.

pcHp7Dgkaa	It wouldn't have helped if you had lied and in fact, would have gone very badly against you. You must have been in your relationship for at least 12 months to get a (de facto) spouse visa and when it came to proving a length of 12 months, you would not have been able to do so - much better to have been honest. There's no way of getting around the 12 month requirement without actually living together for 12 months.<br>  <br>  If you haven't already been here on a working holiday visa (assuming you qualify for one), that would probably be your best bet. On that, you could live with her in Australia for another 6 months or longer (collecting heaps of proof along the way) and the two periods together should then qualify for the spouse visa.<br>   <br>  If that's out of the question, your only alternatives are for her to live OS with you for another 6+ months (perhaps in New Zealand?) or for you to apply for a prospective marriage visa.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/booklets/1127.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/booklets...</a>
TcgUVcYwaa	There are several ways to do this:<br>  <br>  Train or plane plus train. <br>  <br>  For plane check out<br>  www.whichbudget.com<br>  and www.skyscanner.net<br>  <br>  If there are no flights directly from Rome to Salzburg, check out flights to Innsbruck and Munich. <br>  <br>  It costs about 20 EUR to get from Munich to Salzburg (use the so-called Bayern-Ticket) and about 36 EUR to get from Innsbruck to Salzburg if you use the EC train. <br>  <br>  A train ticket from Salzburg to Venice should cost around 80 EUR if you use the fastest connection via Villach. But you can do it cheaper for about 70 EUR if you use the slower connection via Innsbruck, Brennero and Verona and use only regional trains in Italy. Ask the ticket clerks in Salzburg to sell you a normal national Austrian ticket to Brennero for about 39 EUR. Then have them sell you an international ticket from Brennero to Venezia St. Lucia. Tell them you want regional trains ()only. This should cost about 29 EUR. Play around with www.oebb.at and www.reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/... to get a connection that works. <br>  <br>  For Rome-Salzburg by train the trick with two tickets (one for Italy and one for Austria) does not work out. The regular fare for this journey is around 100 EUR, travelling time 11+ hours with the fastest trains.

I think I took enough clothes for like 14 days?!1 Just take enough clothes to last you 7 days, so lets say 7 t-shirts, couple of shorts and maybe a pair or two of 3/4 lengths. and of course undies and essentials.<br>  <br>  It may be classed as rainy season, but it's still going to be really hot!<br>  <br>  You can pretty much buy everything you could ever need out there as there are tonnes of boots and pharmacies that will sell any of the usual stuff that you might need. As well as any clothes, you can get them really cheap out there if anything gets ruined.<br>  <br>  So just 7 days clothes, wallet, cards, sun glasses, repellant, camera and your off!<br>  <br>  Beware of scams going to Cambodia from Thailand, if you can avoid it don't get the bus!<br>  If you do, ensure you take US dollars to Cambodia as that is their main currency, and DO NOT change it at the border when people tell you they will give you a much better rate than you'll get in the towns, you get ripped off majorly!|`|9kbpTnroaa	Get a canoe bag from a camping shop. about ￡10 thats your waterproofing sorted. then put this inside your ruck sack. and everything else inside the canoe bag.<br>  <br>  take 2 of everything t shirts/ shorts trousers etc . wear one wash one <br>   <br>  Id also take <br>  <br>  a sleeping bag liner <br>  high deet content mosquito repelent<br>  some water purifacation tablets ( just incase you dont trust the bottled water)<br>  sunglasses and suncream<br>  a hat<br>  couple of plastic bags<br>  and a warmish top or jacket<br>  a Spork ( spoon and forlk combo camping shops sell)<br>  <br>  saving space : roll your items instead of folding<br>  pack light at home then just buy stuff you find you need Thiland is cheap and Vietnam cheaper!|`|sAwmwynnaa	pack what clothes you need to wear in the climate, it won't be really cold so you won't need jumpers and stuff, if you do they're really cheap in Thailand.<br>  get some mossie repellent and a plastic sheet to keep the rain off.|`|zFWvMQUKaa	Alright, I am a boy scout and can assist you in this matter. First of all, you need a good hiking backback, and with 6 weeks outside, try to keep your clothes clean as much as you can, because you will likely want to reuse them. You also want to have a good water bottle or two on you, nalgene brand is prefered: My brother and his friends put on on a railroad track, and it flew off without being broken, and if you do manage to break it, you can return it for a new one, garenteed. You also want a compactable sleeping bag that can compact to a small space so you may pack more. Bug spray and sunscreen is crucial, so bring that too. Even though your group leader should have one, you should always have a first aid kit. You also want to pack your clothes in trash bags to prevent them from getting wet, and of course, bring a poncho, not a rain coat. If you are responsible for your tent, realize you can put it in a trash bag and attach it to the back of your backpack because it will take up too much room inside of your backback. If you wear contacts, bring a pair of glasses, too, because contacts are not very reliable in the wilderness. After all the neccesities, bring what you want to, just don't bring anything you won't mind losing. EX: bring a disposable camera, not your expensive digital one. Bring a deck of cards and money too for Texas Hold 'em and Up and Down the River! Gambling passes time. Oh yeah, if you have enough extra room, bring and inflatable mattress too!|`|R7wvYYDJaa	I travelled for 6months on the same size bag so your be fine, I was in Vietnam too for a few weeks. Take bare essentials, one small towel, a weeks worth of underwear, small shampoo, soap, travel wash etc, the countries your going to are very cheap if you find out you need something you have forgotten, take a rainmac which folds into a bag, also a very thing sleeping bag - more than anything your want it to put down on a bed / train bed if it looks grubby. In Vietnam you could buy these silk sleeping bags everywhere and these are perfect for the job and tiny too.<br>  If your planning on trekking make sure you have some clean socks that you can keep dry or your end up with blisters, as for footwear, take a good paid of walking trainers and a pair of flip flops and that will do you!, Dont forger the good thing about back packing is its not a fashion parade!|`|a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	1.  Whether you're traveling on- or off-trail, keep your heaviest items close to your back, centered between your shoulder blades. This holds true for internal- and external-frame packs.<br>     2. Pack heavy items near the top of your pack for on-trail travel, to center the weight over your hips.<br>     3. Pack heavy items near the bottom of your pack for uneven terrain or cross-country travel. This keeps your center of gravity low for better balance.<br>     4. Keep often-used items such as sunscreen, snacks, map and compass where you can get to them easily.<br>  <br>  Get everything out that you think you might have to take - and I mean absolutely everything.<br>  <br>  Stage 1:<br>  Get all the hair dryers, the Sony Discmans, the tumble dryer and sod it, why not, your mountain bike. Get them all into one tidy room with a bed, preferably double. Arrange everything into piles i.e. pants, socks, shorts, T-shirts, 'have to takes' (i.e. passport, first aid kit, steri kit etc.), 'would like to takes' (jumper, big towel, inflatable neck pillow, boyfriend - yup, get him squatting up there on the top of one of the piles - for a bit of a giggle anyway!), 'other' - for all the other bits and pieces that you haven't got a clue about.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stage 2. <br>  Be cruel to be kind. Get rid of all those things that you put in the pile on the slightest hope that maybe the pile wouldn't be too big and you could slip them in, such as slippers, dressing gown and boylfriend (apologise and offer beer and chocolates). Hopefully your pile will have decreased somewhat. Convince yourself that it actually looks to be a load when it is sitting there on the bed, however, when put in the backpack, it will all fit. Start to pack. When you realise that the bloody thing is full up and you only have a quarter of the things in there, kick it very hard, curse the fact that it is all my fault and that I have obviously got it wrong about what to pack, give up on the idea of going off travelling and then break down in tears.<br>  <br>  Stage 3<br>  Dry your eyes and re-read the bit above about not taking everything with you. Have a look at everything you have and have a go at another dummy pack. Take just one thing from each pile (assess which is the best T-shirt, pair of shorts, jeans, shoes etc.), apart from 'The knickers' pile, where you can take maybe four or five for this stage of packing. By putting the very bare minimum from each pile into the bag, you will soon see how it grows. Assess the result. If you still have too much, you are either doing something wrong or have bought your pack from the sparrow accessory shop! If there is still loads - you've got to be really severe with yourself as you have got to leave with a three quarters full backpack.<br>  <br>  I'm not joking about this, I'm deadly serious. Aim for this. If it is full, but not bursting at the seams, you'll only regret it as you'll have no room to collect all those bits of memorabilia that will appear here and there and have to come home with you. If, on this pack, you are looking fairly confident, get serious and go to...<br>  <br>  Stage four<br>  <br>  The 'final pack'. Now we're getting into the fairly heavy stuff. Get your piles and make sure you have everything you think you will need.<br>  <br>  Start to pack!<br>  <br>  Getting it all in<br>  <br>  Sleeping bag<br>  <br>  This needs to go in a position where it can be accessed easily i.e. every night! Usually there is a place in the bottom of your pack which is accessible with a zip, where it can be stored (see diagram below). This bottom section of your pack is normally separated with a string drawn 'false bottom'. You can either leave this open and have one big deep pack, or draw the string up and have a pack with two compartments. I always split my pack into two. This bottom section is where I keep my sleeping bag and the things I don't usually need, i.e. jumpers, smart clothes etc. They can be tucked away there and left until you need them. They also form a firm base at the bottom of the pack - a kind of false floor if you like that is closer to the surface, so that if you do need to find things, you don't need to delve down really deep.<br>  Packing<br>  Really important tip<br>  <br>  ...that my dad taught me years ago, always pack to the corners. This is crucial here, as you will be surprised how much extra space you will have if you get things squashed into the deep corners.<br>  <br>  knickers and socks<br>  <br>  Can either be put in a drawstring bag and so laid flat all the way across the pack , which is a bit more organised so that you know where they are and don't end up with a search harder than for The Holy Grail when you need a clean pair! Or, as I normally do, use the knickers and socks to fill in the cracks and empty gaps here and there. <br>  <br>  T-shirts<br>  <br>  These are best rolled. Think of a Swiss roll and attempt to make your T-shirt look like it. Fold the arms in to make it look like a rectangle.<br>  <br>  Fold it in half across the middle and half again.<br>  <br>  You should then be left with a long, thin rectangle.<br>  <br>  Turn it around and then roll tightly from one end to the other.<br>  <br>  If you do this with all your T-shirts you will be left with loads of Swiss roll shape things that can be stuffed down the sides and into holes here and there that need filling.<br>  <br>  When you come to use them they should be fairly crease free if rolled properly.<br>  <br>  T-shirts can also be flat packed, again adding to the layered effect in the pack if you prefer this method. The only problem with doing this, if you give it a go, is that you are left with annoying gaps at the side that can end up as wasted space.<br>  <br>  PackingA quick note at this point<br>  <br>  You may think that I am being really 'anally retentive' and sad in the way I pack my bag and organise my things. Well... I'm not, so sod off with that thought. I soon learnt that to get in a habit with packing my backpack was a good idea. There were times when I'd spend what seemed like hours trying to find a particular T Shirt, sun cream, or annoying little things like a tiny tube of lip-salve. There have also been times when I was in a hurry and had to have my backpack packed and 'be outta there' faster than a weasel in a wind-tunnel - everything seems to happen in slow motion, you're stuffing the thing faster and harder than an angry chef with the wrong sized turkey two hours before the Christmas meal!<br>  <br>  At times like those, the bloody thing will never close and you eventually leave panting and sweating picking up the bits and pieces that fall out en route. 'Been there, done that'. This is where the idea of making layers in your backpack comes into its own. If you take out the third layer down... when you come to put it back, you can simply put it on the top, or make it the new second layer down. Am I confusing you here, or do you know what I mean? With anything I say, try it and see how you get on. The idea is for you to have a go and find out what's comfortable and best for you.<br>  <br>  The Rolling & Coiling Technique<br>  <br>  ...imagine first thing in the morning after a particularly fibrous meal the night before! (or, slightly more tasteful, imagine putting a dead snake in your bag... alive ones are only for the harder readers out there!). This is an interesting technique that a couple of people I have met do to fill their pack.<br>  <br>  Basically it works on the principal of creating a whole series of snake like things which you can coil into your bag. With everything from T-shirts to jeans, shorts, shirts and underwear - just roll them up to be long and thin and then coil them into your bag.<br>  <br>  If done properly it does cut down on creases.<br>  <br>  Camera film<br>  <br>  These can be put into freezer bags and so rolled into a long snake which can be put anywhere in your pack. The freezer bags will keep them dry, and, combined with the little plastic containers they are in, they will be nicely protected.<br>  <br>  Dresses/skirts<br>  <br>  By putting the dress or skirt into a stocking you will create another long snake like object which can be put anywhere in your pack. Apparently this also stops it getting creased. I haven't tried this, in that I don't, contrary to all the rumours, actually possess any dresses or skirts. However, I am lead to believe that it works, so if you have to take either of these for your 'smart/work outfits', then give it a go. Keep the stocking for use later to avoid being recognised when you enter a bank in Belize with a sawn off shotgun... another great way to finance your trip!<br>  <br>  Tampons<br>  <br>  It is always advisable to stock up, take them out of the boxes and put them into a waterproof (water-tight even better) bag of some sort. When Carolyn Martin was hiking in South Africa she had to swim across a river with her pack, forgetting that she'd stored her secret supply in one of the pouches down the side. Two weeks later she discovered 'Tampon City' quietly expanding towards Botswana...<br>  <br>  Generally, in all developed countries you'll have no problem finding them. However, in the Third World, they are considered a bit of a Western luxury and can cost a fortune - so plan your route accordingly. Stock up prior to departure and then, if heading into less developed regions from more Western areas, stock up again. If you run out, there are always the local varieties which are a bit more bulky, but do the job. Remember, we are in the 21st Century you know!<br>  <br>  Sanitary towels<br>  <br>  Bulky but fun! They are getting smaller and smaller by the day, except for some places, for example in Africa, where the marketing guys for Pampers still get their ideas! If you have your favourite variety that, should you miss the plane, have big enough wings to get you those last three thousand miles home, stock up (again in that super dry place you are creating in your pack). Should the worst come to the worst, the local stuff will always do the job.<br>  <br>  Female backpackers'The Pill'<br>  <br>  If you are on|`|sni5mjtTaa	Just try to be really organized.

Medvedev's candidacy was selected by then President Vladimir Putin.[3] On 10 December 2007, he was informally endorsed as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections by the largest Russian political party, United Russia and several pro-presidential parties, and officially endorsed by United Russia on 17 December 2007. A technocrat and political appointee, Medvedev had never held elective office before 2008.|`|yVGyhcvAaa	Medvedev & Putin is the Prime Minister.  Many speculate that Putin will try to run for President again when Medvedev's time in office is up.  Putin has tried to push for the term of the Russian presidency to be extended (to 6 yrs?) so that he can be in office longer.<br>  <br>  Russia's political system has some interesting quirks to it.  You are legally only allowed to be president two terms in a row, but it doesn't say anything about coming back after those two terms & being President again.  So Putin was President of Russia already for 8 years, but if Medvedev & company change the laws, Putin could be President in the future for another 12 years.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	Dmitry Medvedev|`|xCfHnQBbaa	You know!

I went there in august and hit every bar down there. The hardrock cafe & Bar Room is where I had the most fun. The only problem is that it's very expensive to drink all night and if you don't stay at a hotel then it will be a problem to get home.    What I would suggest is hit up a bar that I go to every weekend. It's called Mulligan's Clubhouse Grille, and it's located in Harmarville. It is a blast to hang out down there and if your lucky, you might even see a steeler player.    If you want more info on this restaurant/bar then check them out on facebook.

0wTzlG2haa	Honestly it's not a bad idea to get the passport and be done with it.

Have you looked into that?<br>  <br>  The only reason I would not go ahead and get it is if I were changing my name soon (in process of marriage or divorce) b/c then you have to send them more money to send you a new passport with the new name.<br>  <br>  Passports are good for 10 years though so it's really not that expensive.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	The new law starting in June requires a passport if you are not on a cruise that starts and ends in the same US port.

dpKntiZoaa	If you want to get rid of things second hand then I would say go with Marktplaats.nl.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, if you are living in & around Den Haag then go to the ASH (American School) site and they have a yahoo group for expats buying and selling (in English).  Sales at homes are mentioned there, but only advertised within the group.|`|WawPounraa	as far as i know, yard sales are only allowed on queens day|`|dai4nP0yaa	Well it's abit confusing. The vrijmarket on queens day actually exist because there are no taxes on sales. But at all other times of the year trade is taxed. So whether it's technically illegal or not, in practice you can't really pay taxes on those sales so... An alternative thing to consider is that most second hand stores will gladly take your stuff if they see any prospect of selling it and will pay you something for it. Also advertising the stuff on-line or with those little posters in the super-market might be a good idea. It's unlikely anyone will arrest you for selling your stuff, but you might get funny looks from the neighbors (and a small chance of being asked to stop) if you put all your stuff outside and try to sell it. <br>  <br>  Best bet is advertise on-line and with little posters in supermarkets, or if you can wait until April and then sell it on the street.

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	Consider that the recession has hit California harder than most other states. For the past four years in a row more people have moved OUT of California than have moved in. Jobs are almost nonexistent, and finding work here will be extremely difficult. The state is broke, and cutting services. It is one of the highest taxed and regulated states. Living here you would be in one of the most expensive states to live in. This is not the time to be moving to California.|`|j0ZsYrUJaa	ok, the first two posters obviously have never been to California.  Avoid truckee because of tourism?  wat?  Pollution in San Francisco, but not Oakland?  wat?  Kids grow up spoiled because of the rich and famous? wat?      Do not live in Oakland unless you can afford a 2 million dollar house in the hills.  Do not live in Sacramento unless you want to live in the grand theft auto capital of the USA.    Avoid the LA basin at all cost.    Best places : East Bay (besides Oakland and most of Hayward) Is a great place.  Plenty of sights to see, plenty of things to do. San Francisco is a hop away. Lots of history. (and not bad for pollution) Tahoe and Reno are 3 hours away.        If you like it hot, try Southern Cali in the Mojave. 3 hours to Disney, or three hours to Vegas. However, the air quality can be very bad when the pollution rolls over the hills from LA.      I've lived in the bay area for 5 years (this time) and I have never seen a movie star. My life, or my kids lives have never been influenced by the "star studded atmosphere" This still doesn't make it the ideal place to start a family. This depends on what you plan on doing for a living. Private school an option? The public schools in some areas can be very underfunded, but not too bad in others.     And yes, traffic can be bad.      All in all, there are SO many variables.  California is a very large state. The cost of living can be high in some areas. The crime rate can be high in some areas.  There is a lot of history here, and over all it has very beautiful areas.    Peedlepup is partly correct: California HAS been hit hard. However, this turns it into a buyers market. If you can afford to buy a house, now is the time to do it.|`|1brMbc8Daa	California is a very nice place to live. The people are very friendly and hospitable, but it really depends on where you go. The cities that I would want to live in are Sacramento or Oakland. I wouldn't want to live in places such as San Francisco because of high pollution, Beverly Hills because of prices, Truckee because of tourism, but overall the whole place is amazing. There are so many options there that aren't available to the rest of the country. It actually isn't an ideal place to start a family, though because in California, the kids grow up spoiled because it's a place where the rich and famous live. So they grow up with all of these star-studded celebrities for role models. You'd think that they get the same amount of exposure to celebrities, but they actually get even more because they live in the same state as all of these famous people. Also, traffic is terrible! It would take you at least two hours just to get across the highway. Traffic runs usually from 3 pm to 7 pm. But it's always always crowded. But if you do move there... you won't regret it.|`|c4225d9583bacc6aaa33ccf6f6ca917aaa	i live in the bay area.. i like it because all my friends and family are here.. different places to go..but i went to school in orange county (southern cali).. i recommend living there if you can afford it.. like the irvine area..growing community.. close to LA and SD, but the traffic is not as bad as it is in LA.      beaches are the best!  better weather too.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Compton, Watts and East LA are nice.|`|42caeb5abf4bf84fd4e6be61249c66e3aa	"Truckee because of tourism"    that made me laugh :)    California is wonderful. I have lived here 20 years out of my 28 on this earth and it still amazes me on the beauty, the people are open and kind. Very aware of each other and the enviorment. THere are many nice places.. San Diego, the Bay Area, Sacramento, LA, Tahoe, Napa.There are mountains, rivers, lakes, oceans, cities, everything. I give it a thumbs up...    why not try it?|`|2pvAbIDUaa	California has some beautiful spots but the wind blows alot over there which means there is an awful lot of trash blowing everywhere.The pollution is nasty(most of the time there's a gray green cloud over the major cities.)Traffic really sucks there,too.(Traffic will stop in all 8 lanes for a person on the side changing a flat tire)NOT KIDDING  The only thing good in that state is the food. Awesome food on the roach coaches!!! Real mexican food by real mexicans.|`|AA10990269	I actually just went ot california for my christmas vacation. It seemed like a really great place to live.

The farther you get in the hills, the better...  However, if you plan on living by BART, there are MANY better places to live.  It can be costly to live in the Oakland Hills. (we wont even get into fire issues, or the fact that the hayward fault runs right through)  Downtown Oakland isn't all that bad, but it isn't all that great either. Stay away from areas just south of down town (foothill and Macarther area can be kinda scary)    Not sure what direction you are commuting on BART, but just 2 or 3 stations to the south is San Leandro. Its a lot quieter than Oakland for sure. (Bayfair Bart station is even better, one more stop to the south)   Personally, I would look into Walnut Creek.  They have bart, and is becoming the new shopping mecca of the east bay.  Its just a few stops to the east of Oakland, on the other side of the tunnel. Buying a house there can get costly, but I hear there is plenty of rental areas available.    tl;dr: Some of Oakland is OK. East and South of there is better.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	it's not that bad. like any big city, there are dangerous neighborhoods, but the danger is only in those neighborhoods, and people know to stay away. there are many parts of oaktown, it's a big city, and most are beautiful and safe.  the downtown was a little empty for a while, but in the last few years it has seen a revival, there are more businesses and more people out on the streets. the people are african american, but not thugs. 19th street and broadway, where the station is, counts as part of downtown.     many areas are really nice, and many areas are filled with very rich people. in general, the higher in the hills you go, the nicer it is.  great neighborhoods include lake merritt, piedmont, montclair, rockridge, and many others.    and it's close to berkeley and san francisco if you need a change of pace for the day.|`|b1c6b4fd039d63df1c72b5e940e3cfe3aa	First off oakland isn't bad ... i used to live there and nothing happened to me or my fam.. maybe your just a punk and you get your info from the everywhere else instead of oakland.. and thugs?!?

There are NO forests here. There are TREES, but a stand of trees does not make a forest. If you've ever been to Yosemite- THAT's a forest.    Being from the OC myself, I think you're thinking of Foxborough Park.    The beach next to Dana Point Harbor is Doheny State Beach.    Laguna has houses with cliffs on them.

The "white lady," who materializes in fog and likes to call attention to herself, has been sighted on Los Rios Street, the Capistrano Villas, Las Brisas, and in the foothills behind Del Obispo. She's a playful ghost, dressed in a long white dress, who cavorts and teases, but never lets anyone catch up to her. She took strychnine in the 1890s and died on the front porch of the home of a lover whod jilted her.
wgMh9qCkaa	As an American who lives six months every year in southwest France, I want to tell you not to worry about appearing rude if you visit the USA. Do not make the simple assumption to say that the etiquette is reversed. For instance, it would NOT be rude to enter a shop in America and to greet the shopkeeper with a "Hello" and a nod. That would be quite nice. Just don't be offended if they don't respond -- it's just that they're not used to hearing it. Your "Hello" would be welcome.  I think people who work in retail are generally a little more friendly and open on the West Coast than the East Coast, and in smaller towns as opposed to big cities, but there are always exceptions. I say "Hello" in American shops all the time, in an effort to bring a little smile into a store with me.     In fact, I think the most important thing I can encourage you to do while visiting the US will be to try to smile a little bit more often than you might normally smile in France. In many parts of the US, if you're walking down the street and you happen to make eye contact with someone approaching you, it's common to make a little acknowledgment by giving a very brief little smile and nod. This doesn't mean if you're on a crowded street in New York that you need to be looking at and smiling at everyone and saying "Hello" all the time. No, no, no. But in a smaller town, or on a quiet street, sometimes if there are only a few people on the street, you might  say something like "Hello" or "Good morning" when they pass, even if you don't know each other. I know in France that would be considered pretty strange, to speak to someone in that friendly way without having been introduced.   I guess the simple way to look at it is that the French (in the southwest, in the countryside) that I am around are extremely polite, and a bit old-fashioned, compared to my homeland. California is almost overly-friendly, with people giving each other big hugs after only having been introduced ten minutes ago. In France, once I have been introduced to someone by a mutual acquaintance, or once I have completed a transaction with someone, they are usually quite friendly and helpful and kind.   Don't worry about visiting America and offending anyone! Just greet people as you normally would (except in English, of course!), and just remember to smile at people a little more than you would normally do in France. I know the French don't mean to be scowling all the time, but to a Californian walking down the street in France, the lack of smiles is a little intimidating. It's a silly thing, but it makes a big difference. We say "Hello" with a smile.|`|IwsAGl3Zaa	If you're out shopping in the U.S. it is customary to give other shoppers as much space as possible.  If you do have to cross in front of them (Reach for something, etc), you simply say excuse me to give the other person a chance to move away before you move in.    Saying a greeting to someone while entering a shop is custom if: it's a small shop, you have questions, etc.  In most clothing stores the employees are supposed to be discreet unless they're asked a question.  It's simply a matter of assuming the customer knows what they want.      If you're out of the street, most people look down.  They only smile or greet each other if they make accidental eye contact.      As far as the handshake, if someone offers you their hand, shake it.  Grip their hand firmly, not too loosely or tightly, and shake (usually only one shake).  Make you sure look them in the eye and smile sincerely (or as sincerely as possible).      These are mainly just for the city.  If you're out in the country things are different.  I personally think that people are friendlier in the country.  If you have any other questions let us know:)  Have a great day!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Yes, the French and many other southern Europeans have a whole different take on personal space. As long as you're aware of this, you'll be fine.    It's also true that not greeting the shopkeeper or other person in the shop is considered rude. Even if you can't say the word, catch their eye, smile and nod. Me personally, I wouldn't ignore a shop attendant anywhere - you might need to ask them where something is. I don't think you're expected to say hello to perfect strangers in the street either ..... This is something that's done in Ireland, mainly because Ireland has a low density of population, and everyone is 'acknowledged' in this way, in rural areas anyway. I sincerely doubt it's the norm throughout America, although like Ireland it may be the done thing in rural areas.|`|AA10254694	American personal space is about three feet or one meter.|`|uqb7dkBbaa	The only one I can attest to is the personal space.

If you stay at this B&B, you will not need to use the car unless you go out of town.  You can catch the trolley to downtown (cheap) with one pick-up stop within easy walking distance of the B&B.  There are several other B&Bs on the street, but this is one of the nicest and great breakfast food.  You will feel like you are the royal family. I don't remember the price, but when I went a year or so ago with my boys, this was competitively priced with hotels located in downtown without the exorbitant parking fees. You might be able to negotiate a lower rate if you are staying during the week and it is for all five nights.  Have a great time!  San Antonio has so many things to see and do - such a great atmosphere.
ZPxJNpMxaa	South Africa is a developing country but has many characteristics of a developed country, for instance, infrastructure.    Both income and wealth in South Africa are very unevenly distributed and as such so is the standard of living....we have the very rich ( a very small percentage of total population) , the middle class( majority but broad) and some still living in poverty or at least below the "bread line".....generally speaking the standard of living is acceptable for most but there are those that depend on aid.

bzfXbM4raa	The expected population of GTA in 2020 is 7 million.  Most of the people will gather in the suburbs like Missisauga, Brampton, and such.  The actual downtown core, although extremely dense, has grown at a much slower rate than most of the city.      Toronto has proposed a new light rail system, extending most of the TTC lines.  The line extends to many parts of Missisauga, so I would expect to see Missisauga grow even more.  Although it is a city in it's own right, it will always be overshadowed by Toronto.|`|l9c2Uw5baa	Population will spill out in the suburbs of the GTA - this will extend the GTA to what it already is.  Higher taxes as transit will have to be extended to those areas.
xcso6EuBaa	I have been on 6 cruises with Royal and you will love it.  If you don't include excursions, how much you spend will depend on how much you drink as that is the majority of the cost.     Figure a mid range bottle of wine for dinner is $30- $40, a few poolside drinks and a few after dinner drinks and you are probably looking at $300-$400 for the week.  The only other costs would be if you wanted to go to the high end restaurants on board which are $20 or so per night per person but it is an exceptional experience.      The other big cost is the tips at the end - $3 per person, per day for the waiter and the room steward and $1.50 per day for the bus person.   Overall you are probably looking at $100-$120 for the tips.       You can buy booze in the gift shop on board at reasonable prices (duty free) to cut back on costs but it doesn't save much if you have to buy the mixers as well.     On tip though...if you can, try not to think too much about money...when you finish a trip and look back on the memory, you rarely remember how much you spent...Enjoy it..    Also the casino can cost you if you like to gamble..    Have a great time.|`|9c5de07d75d981b60774ab1e37de89bfaa	Food is included in your cruise price, as is tea, coffee and juice at breakfast.  You pay for anything else you drink; beer about $6, drinks about $8.  Wine can be purchased at supper for about $30 a bottle and up.  Then there is the casino . . .  Don't forget they charge a daily tip per person, l forget how much, maybe $15.|`|AA11466154	I think you should bring at least 1000  dollars that will cover you on ship and land.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	The basic cruise fare includes your room, meals in the regular dining rooms and buffets, room service, shows, and most ship facilities. Many ships also have free pizza, ice cream at various times. sushi, and hot dogs and hamburgers.    The extras are first tips. Figure about $10 per day per person for the tips to the room steward and wait staff. This is optional and some cruise lines automatically charge you. It can be adjusted or reversed at the end of the cruise. You should also tip a few dollars if you use room service. All bar drinks will have 15% added for a tip.    Many ships have alternate dining facilities that have a service charge of $15 on up. It may be a steak house or an Italian restaurant for example. There are also specialty coffee bars that have a charge. All bar drinks including sodas have a charge. The only free bar drinks are at the Captains Reception and the Repeat Cruiser Reception. Do not assume that the drinks being offered when you board are free. They are not. Bar drinks are $6 and up. Some ships are even charging for juice at any meal other than breakfast.    Some cruise lines sell a soda card for about $4 a day. It is only for fountain soda. Unless you have 3 sodas a day it is not worth it. You can also buy a specialty coffee card which gives you 15 for about the price of 12.    There is a charge for any personal service such as laundry, salons, private trainers, etc. Spa treatments are very expensive, $50-$100. There is also gambling which includes the casino, bingo ($10-$20 per session), and sometime deck games such as horse racing. A ship photographer will be taking pictures all over the ship and at special occasions. They cost over $10 each. Phone calls in the room are about $8 a minute. Some ships have cell phone service. You are charged for international roaming by your phone service at about $2.50 per minute. There is also a charge for using internet service on a ship but it is cheaper than phone calls.    Sundries are very expensive. Figure at least double the normal price. If you need a watch you will find no better prices anywhere.    Off ship excursions are expensive. They start at about $30 and can be in the hundreds. You can book them on the ship or go on your own. The ship will not leave without you if a cruise excursion is late. With one you did on your own they will not wait.    ? ??l???q ?|`|X6rFPI2laa	How much you spend will depend almost entirely on whether and how much you drink alcoholic drinks and soft drinks, whether and how much you gamble in the casino, whether you do any shopping on board, whether you go to the spa, whether and how much you use the internet and telephone, whether you have laundry done for you, etc.  The minimum you spend will be the daily tip amount posted to your account, so figure about 140 for that for 2 people.  Beyond that, it's up to you.  By the way, on board the ship everything will be charged to your account, which most people pay by credit card, although you can settle your bill with cash the last night if you prefer.  For the casino, you can simply stick paper money into the machines rather than charge your account.      Have a great trip!|`|GPeXvcdOaa	royal carribean is a really good cruise. if u go to the casino and buy a lot of drink you can get up to a thousand|`|T6nmD3X9aa	Besides your tickets and excursions at port, it is usually about $700-1500. You have to figure even soda is ridiculous (like $2.50 a bottle), meals are mostly included (but you will probably eat out in mexico too), if there is gambling it will be higher end. There is no cash on most of the ships for food or shopping, you charge everything to your room and pay at the end. The pictures are a little pricey, but they sucker you in to at least a few. Spa and some of the shows can cost money (some shows are free, look for those too). My husband and I had a bill that came to $1200 after all was said and done, not too bad for the week vacation, but it was a little shock to us!!! That included shopping on the boat, sodas, alcohol, spa, meals, & pictures.     Have a great time!

If you are going THIS coming weekend, you will technically be missing the biggest weekend of Mardi Gras, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  The festivities will still be in swing.    There will still be tons of people and parties going on.  I rarely recommend sticking to the French Quarter but in y'alls case it is not such a bad idea.  There are plenty of strip clubs ( if you guys are into that kind of thing.) Also there is plenty of great food and awesome live music all over the city if you would rather go a different route than the typical bachelor party.  There are even boating and fishing excursions very near the city that offer great dude bonding time.  Harrah's casino can be a fun spot for a group of guys trying to let off steam.      Trust me, it is the perfect spot for a group of guys looking to let loose.  You will never have a dull moment, there is plenty to do, and it is a city where no matter the hour, drinks and fun are to be had.  Have fun and don't sweat it.

Go to www.mardigras.com for more info on Carnival in New Orleans.    There are many strip clubs in the first 5 blocks of Bourbon Street.    There is also always music, but the bands change: Go to www.bestofneworleans.com and click on Music then Listings or to www.offbeat.com and click on Listings, then Music.     Note that music clubs often advertise "No Cover", meaning there is no charge for entering. However, clubs with "No Cover" often require that customers buy a beverage each for every "set " of music (which can be every 20 minutes) so KNOW THE PRICE before you sit down. Clubs do that because some people will sit in the club all evening drinking nothing (clubs only make money from the drinks they sell - not from the music). It is also a good idea to pay for each round of drinks (in clubs on Bourbon Street) as it is delivered so there can't be any confusion at the end of the evening.    An incomplete guide to bars & clubs: www.neworleanscheapdrinks.com    About certain alcoholic beverages: Realize that some famous drinks are VERY potent compared with regular cocktails that have only 1 to 1 ? ounces of alcohol. For example, a Hurricane is basically 3 or 4 ounces of rum in something like red Kool-Aid, and a Hand Grenade has at least 4 ? ounces of Everclear + rum + vodka mixed with melon liquor. They dont necessarily taste like an alcoholic beverage and it is easy to over-indulge.    Hope you have a great time!|`|omp5Rpqqaa	You and 10 other guys?  Expect to have the time of your lives.

Each person has their own opinions but most Americans love it. Many call it the Paris or New York. It is quite grandiose with over 12 million inhabitants. It also has a lot more of a European influence compared to other Latin American Capitals. You can find modern and historic architecture. There are many different neighborhoods so there is something for everyone.     Since you have so many cultures from all over the world, you can find an amazing plethora of foods. There are many great museums and cemeteries to visit as well as some great cafes and parks to relax in.    Buenos Aires is a good distance away from the US but is becoming more and more popular due to its affordable cost of living and lively atmosphere.

DAnHZ4VSaa	Suzieblue87,     Like most hostels, hostels in Japan will most likely provide a pillow and a blanket to sleep on.  I wouldn't worry about bringing your own sleeping bag.  However, due to Japan's culture, I wouldn't expect always to have a matress.  When I was in Japan (a year ago) we stayed in a hostel in Osaka that gave us a thin mat that unrolled onto the floor to sleep on.  They provided us with pillows and blankets, but don't be surprised if you have to sleep on the floor!      All hostels aren't like that, as the hostel we were at in Hiroshima and Tokyo both had normal beds, complete with matresses and pillows and blankets.  Hope that helps--Enjoy your trip!    -Joey P  http://www.vagabondbible.com|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	Japanese YHs provide all the bedding you need at no extra charge.

eFzRQ3hjaa	Hey Jpauker,    The default option in hostels is the dorm room, but nearly all hostels also offer a few private rooms, in case you want some privacy with your wife.  Sometimes the cost of 2 bunk beds in a dorm (they won't let you "share" a bed) will equal close to what a private room would cost, so its better to upgrade.     London is quite expensive, so is Scandanavia. If you are trying to keep costs down, take a look at www.couchsurfing.com to stay with friendly locals.    Cheers,  Greg|`|DAnHZ4VSaa	Jpauker,     Hostels are usually billed by the person, rather than the room.  Depending on what type of hostel you are staying at, you may have your own private quarters, or may have to share with others.  Even if you have your own private quarters, you will most likely still pay by the person.      Hostels are cheap, though, when compared to hotels.  I'd say you can expect to pay between 30-40 USD per night (per person) in the Western part of Europe (England, France, Spain, Germany).  However, if you are going to be traveling to Eastern Europe (Turkey, etc...) you can expect the price to go down significantly--maybe even halving.  It all depends what part of Europe you are staying in.      If you are interested in meeting other travelers, hostels are a great place to stay! If you have never stayed in one, I'd recommend trying it!  Hope that helps.     -Joey P  http://www.vagabondbible.com

Once you have entered  the european Schengen zone you can travel freely within the zone  without problems.|`|p8UAIAisaa	You won't have any issues, no visa is required for England or France for American Citizens    www.traveldocs.com
zBWefnYHaa	In hostels you always book per person, so you will have to book for 2 people.  And only in some hostels there are double beds, if not, you have to have a bed each.  If you are going to stay in a dorm, not always you will be in the same dorm, as some hostels still keep males and females apart.    But there are also hostels where you can book a room for two, either a bunk or a double bed.|`|64IEjXOBaa	If you book a twin room you can stay together.|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	In order to sleep together, you'll need to book a private room (either a twin dorm, or a family room with a double bed). Not all hostels offer these rooms, but the ones that do will state so. You won't be allowed to share a bed in a public dorm, and as another answer states, some hostels still separate male and female by rooms or corridors. When you use a major booking site like hostelworld.com, you don't necessarily know what the case will be beforehand. I was once placed on a separate floor from my ex husband, with no access to each other's rooms due to male/female segregation.    So you will have to pay for both of you, and even then won't be allowed to sleep in the same bed, out of consideration for other backpackers. Hostel beds tend to be smaller than regular singles (80cm, maybe less), which would make the night uncomfortable even for a small couple.     Guest houses or bed and breakfasts are often comparable to a private hostel room in cost, and much nicer. The other option is couchsurfing with a host:  http://couchsurfing.com
