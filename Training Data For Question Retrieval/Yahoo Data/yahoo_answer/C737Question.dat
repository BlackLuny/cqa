I became a vegetarian a little over 6 months ago, and I'm not a fan of the soy milk I buy (I'm Australian, BTW) which is the So Good brand (although I love the cappucino flavoured soy milk) because it tastes like real milk, diluted in water, thrown in a blender with overcooked white rice. Are ther any nicer tasting brands, or should I swap to rice or almond milk? Do they taste alright? Thanks in advance!

"At least 30 companies purchased peanut butter or paste from a facility with a documented link to a nationwide salmonella outbreak," said Marler.

It is just not enough."    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090117/ap_o...    "This was a huge breakdown in the system here.

20090205175910AABIztZ	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	Hospitality questions! About coffee, tea etc.?	Here are some questions from the hospitality food and beverage course I'm doing.      I have already answered some, but if they are wrong please correct them =)      THANKYOU!!!      1. What are the different methods of roasting coffee?   There are simple ways of roasting coffee and there are more technical ways, simple ways are pan/stovetop and oven roasting. In between there are home air-poppers and home drum roasters. More technical ways are the many commercial roasters out there.   2. How do you choose the correct grind for the method of brewing?   If the method of brewing is only a short time in the appliance then the coffee should be grinded very finely so that the flavors release quickly. If the coffee spends more time in the appliance, such as a percolator the coffee needs to be a coarser grind so that the flavors don’t release too quickly.   3. How should coffee be stored?   It should be stored in a cool dry place, like wine. Once the package is open it needs to be stored in an air tight container and used as soon as possible.   4. What equipment is used in coffee making?   There are automatic coffee machines that make the whole coffee at the touch of a button and there are many other pieces of equipment used to manually make coffee;   - Coffee bean grinders   - Percolators   - Boiling water units   - Espresso machines   - Milk frothing jugs   - Milk thermometers   - Filters   - Cups and mugs   - Saucers   - Spoons   5. What are the different ways of brewing coffee?   1. Turkish - Grind: pulverized    2. Percolator – Grind: coarse   3. Regular drip – Grind: medium-course   4. Plunger – Grind: medium-course   5. Vacuum – Grind: course   6. Cold-water – Grind: course   7. Espresso – Grind: fine   6. What are the different ways in which coffee is served?   - Black   - White (with milk)   - With cream   - With or without sugar   - Chocolate or cinnamon added   7. What is a scented tea?   8. What is the difference between tea and tea bags?   9. Why is tea brewed?   10.  How are milk, lemon and sugar used in tea?   11.  How are garnishes used to decorate tea?   12.  How should tea be stored?   13.  How should tea be served?   14.  Why are non-alcoholic drinks gaining in popularity?   15.  What fruit and vegetables (fresh, tinned and frozen) does your establishment use?   16.  What dairy products are used in non-alcoholic drinks?   17.  What cordials and syrups are used in non-alcoholic drinks?   18.  What equipment is used to make non-alcoholic drinks?   19.  What garnishes are used in your establishment?   20.  What glassware is used in your establishment?   21.  Why should equipment be kept clean?   22.  Why should equipment be maintained correctly?

I dont drink seabreezes.

We are all teenage girls but I dont want anything too girlygirly or childish. Also cost effective PLEASE Thankyou    Fast Facts:  20-30 teenage girls  not pamperish, childish or girlygirl-ish  something fun. I want people to remember this party their whole life  not in america or canada  people will bring cameras and phones incase they get stuck and for the memories of photos  I will give people 1 litre of water to drink so they have to stop for loo breaks on the way  will be a whole day thing    sorry its not too general but give me ALL your ideas and that would be brilliant, thanks    xoxoxoxox =]
