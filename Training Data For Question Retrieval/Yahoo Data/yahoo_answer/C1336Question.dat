20081025023729AA6Yiqr	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	One more virginity question-What do you think about this quote?	from: "The New Sexual Deviant," Carson Brown:          Virginity bias tacks a confusing corollary onto historical social opinion about the sexual behavior of women. Not so long ago, a woman had only to hold a nickel between her knees to avoid slut status. Easy enough. But since the sexual revolution, she can also be slapped with the equally damning "prude" label. We've strayed from the original intent of women's liberation and limited women again, trading in the old prescription (sex will ruin a woman) for one that seemed more modern (lack of sex will curdle her).
20081012165928AAqrslx	Social Science;Psychology	Road rage! Can you relate?	It seems like where ever I go, on my bike, or in my car. Some jerk off is always cutting me off. They either cut me off when I'm on my bike, and almost kill me. Or pull out in front of me, and go 10 miles under the speed limit, and hold me up. I swear I wish that I had mini machine guns mounted on the front fender of my Harley, and on the hood of my car for whenever that happens. I get highly agitated whenever this happens. I do however react better to it then I use to. I'm just venting, because it just happened to me about an hour ago.

But she gets really upset when they don't want a relationship with her. I don't understand why she would do this, and for her sake how would I approach her for this? The thing is she comes to me complaining about them how they're being jerks and "playas" and all that crap... but I'm always thinking how she sets herself up for it.

20070314054157AALrSrb	Social Science;Psychology	Que vais-je bien pouvoir faire de mon "fainéant" de fils?	Bonjour! Mon fils, aujourd'hui agé de 24 ans, a brusquement quitté le lycée à l'age de 18 ans en fin de classe seconde, après deux années scolaires assez difficiles. Le prétexte, à l'époque, était qu'il en avait "marre de l'école", et rien n'y personne n'a pu l'en dissuader. Sa vie, depuis, se résume à une longue paresse chez papa et maman (lever à midi, déjeuner, sieste, jeux vidéo, d?ner, re-jeux video et coucher à 4 heures du matin!), émaillée de "coups de gueule" de ma part suivis - pour la forme - de brèves périodes de stages complètement "bidons"!... Aujourd'hui, léger progrès: il ne m'a pas "envoyé promener" quand je lui ai proposé de recommencer à étudier au niveau seconde. Mais il n'a pas suffisamment confiance en sa motivation, pour choisir une formule d'auto-apprentissage de type "CNED".  D'où mes deux questions: 1) existe-t-il des lycées réservés aux ADULTES qui souhaitent avoir une "deuxième chance" dans la vie ? 2) est-ce la solution adaptée au cas de mon fils ?

Okayy... theres this really hott buff rich guy in my school, and supposidley he likes me! the guys have teased him about liking me, and i have caught him looking me right in the eyes for a seccond or two and looking away. Today, i said hi to him and he's like "heyy," with the raising of the eyebrows (flirtacious). Later, with a group of his guy friends, the topic of prom and dancing was brought up. Then this hott buff dude said "I would go to prom with you, but i am gay." Then he kinda winked at me, and was smiling (NOT sarcastic) the whole time when he said this. (I am a juniour, he is a senior, and all of his friends have this PREOCCUPATION with being gay/not gay. For whateva reason guys think it is funny to say they are gay and talk about being gay: even the guys with girlfriends). Soo... do you think this is a sign of him being interested in going to prom?

It's quite an odd one too... I am not quite sure how to explain this, but here goes:   I am taken away by an unknown figure, and wake up in a dark lit room, with a single door that has some sort of sign on it. I remember there being a window on top of the door, and i can see a person dressed in a tuxedo... But not quite, this person or thing is very tall, and i can only catch a glimpse of his tuxedo. Otherwise, there's a dead tree in the room beside the door that seems to still be living. This dream seems very specific, i know that... but moving on: the last thing i remember is taking a bolt that is sticking out, from the locked door. And suddenly i wake up.    I've had this dream a few times before, like i said above... But i just never really took much thought about it until today when i got the dream again. Anyone know if it has any sort of significance?

20090205175323AAC8pli	Social Science;Psychology	If you know about police psychological tests, answer this.?	For a police cadet position, I had to visit a psychologist as one of the last stages in the whole hiring process. During the interview with the psychologist, he brought up the fact that he is going to reccommend to my background officer that my history with underage drinking (which is not TOO extensive) might be an issue of compulsive behavior.       **Mind you that my past alcohol use has already been discussed with my background officer, and I have taken a polygraph, and my friends and references have been interviewed, to validate my answers. And if my drinking history was a serious issue, I wouldnt be this far in the hiring process anyway.      So, after the psychologist told me that he thinks my drinking was an issue, he sort of paused and waited for my response.       If you are a psychologist, is this a tactic that is often used to test somebody's response to an issue like this?      Do you think that the psychologist brought this up, and said that he is going to tell my background officer that it might be an issue, ONLY to see how i responded to the news (in order to test my temper)? OR, do you think he really is concerned that my drinking is indicative of impulsive behavior.

20090205170825AAGBwmm	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Work delima question?	I have a coworker who tends to gossip, by gossip meaning not necessarily about people or coworkers but repeats even general things in a conversation. I feel as though every time I have a conversation with this person I have to say "don't tell anyone" otherwise it will be repeated and I hear it from someone else later in the day. For example I might say (to person a)"I'm going away for the weekend" and then a couple of hours later someone who I hadn't talked to all day would say "you're going away for the weekend?" Knowing for a fact that I didnt say it to the other person. I hope this makes sense. It has happened a multitude of times and I feel as though I can't even have a general conversation without it being repeated. I don't know if I should just have no conversation with this person at all or say something and ask why they do it. Has anyone had this expereince? Any advice would be helpful.

It is very odd and I haven't heard of anyone else doing this. So, please answer this question seriously. Thank you so much in advance!      Well, basically I always feel VERY compelled to do this... everytime I am alone I result to this. I walk frantically around the house and I put on my Ipod on as loud as it can go. For some reason I "daydream" but I am very much awake and I am still walking around the house. I fantasise about many things but I'm either having a lot of fun and with friends or sometimes I fantasise that I am badly injured and my family and  friends are worried and it seems like they really care about me. I sometimes do this for hours and I also do it everyday. I have this weird compulsion to do it and my "conscience daydreaming" (if thats what you call it) seems so vivid and life-like. I have no idea why I do it but it always involves music and me walking back and forth around the house. I look forward to doing that most of the time. I honestly have no idea why I do it or if I am the only one who does. If you can help me in any way to tell me why you think I do it, or help me understand the reason behind why I do it, or how can I stop, I would greatly appreciate it. I know this is a really odd request but I've never asked anyone before I know I'm weird but thank you soo much! :]
20090205171848AAKYBw5	Social Science;Economics	Is humanity going down a downward spiral with greed and living way past their own means?	This is a good question, Ive visited Mexico and researched lots of latin america, india, africa and other various places, we have about 6 Billion humans on this plannet called Earth that God gave to us, from what ive researched we could all fit in the state of Texas with good space for each person. What im confused about is we can put man on the moon, fly from Alaska to Newzealand, fly into space and clone humans, but why do we have child poverty, child prostitution, no clean water, simple illnesses that could be cured? why the economic mess and why people have to starve? why the war? so Im confused because we are the only species that know about the pain we inflict on others, God gave us that ability so why can we not all have enough to eat, drink and shelter? something is not right mabie you can suggest thanks

20090205173107AAL0hQ5	Social Science;Psychology	How to make my boss stop blaming me for another's mistakes?	I am a secretary in a medical setting.  I have been with my boss for 3 1/2 years, but we also worked together for several years at another facility, and he brought me with him to this job.  So we've known each other for a long time.  Last May another secretary was transferred to my office because her clinic was closing and she might lose her job.  I knew her and I "thought" she had her act together, so I agreed to it.  After just a few weeks together I realized what a slacker she is and how many mistakes she makes, not just little errors, BIG goofups that cause us to lose 1000's of dollars.  She is late every day and couldn't care less about the patients, and they complain about her lack of personality...and...OMG....her personal hygiene, or should I say lack of that too.  She plays computer games during the day right in front of my boss when she should be working.  She is on her cell phone like 10 times a day with her husband and daughter.  Her desk is a mess and everything is covered with crumbs and dust balls because she never cleans up after herself.  She even leaves the bathroom a mess (I won't go into detail).  Every so often my boss goes ballistic over this, but *I* am the one who gets blasted about it, even though I am not the one making the mistakes.  I am early to work every day, I go above and beyond the call of duty for our patients, I follow his rules to the letter, I even clean up after her!!!  yet I take the crap for all the problems she causes.  My boss and I have had several arguments about this now.  I have no trouble talking to him because we've known each other a long time, and by the end of the session he is apologizing, saying "I know I keep doing this to you but you've been with me longer and that's just the way it is"...  He seems very reluctant to talk to her or reprimand her, what he does is have "meetings" with both of us and outline every thing that is wrong and what he wants us to do...I continue to do everything he asks and she does whatever she feels like it, and back to square one, I'm the one getting reamed out.  I have talked to him several times about this and I am getting nowhere.  Does anyone have any suggestions for me??      Everyone is pressing him to fire her but he feels sorry for her because her husband is disabled and hers is their only income.  She is in her late 50's and has physical problems and I'm sure she would have a tough time finding another job.  It's good that he's compassionate but at the same time she is wrecking our facility and its good rep.  Which won't be good much longer if she stays there.  You'd think she'd want to do well to make sure she doesn't lose her job, wouldn't you?  But she doesn't care about anything.

20090205171630AAGjfKV	Social Science;Psychology	I hate being introverted but..?	Ok so heres the deal. I am basically a mix of introverted and extroverted. it really depends on who im with, but mostly im very very shy and keep to myself when my friends are not around. In the beginning of the year i made it my goal to be outgoing, and i pulled it off for a week or so, and then, i just couldnt do it anymore, it kinda exhausted me in a way. I think it has to do with self-confidence mostly. I get self-concious because im so tall, and i kinda tower over people, like when i talk to girls that i become friends with. And when i talk to guys, usually its ok, and i can keep the convo going. One thing i hate is that even in classes where im outgoing, people think im quiet, and i dont know how they would see that because i talk a lot in some classes, but in others, i am quiet and talk to some people. So you could say im a mixie of intro-extro. I would like to become extroverted, but it seems a little impossible to me. I love being alone, even at home, and i love my family and everything btw. Being a 15 year old girl is tough, but now  i have to move. I think i can try to re-invent myself, hopefully. Everyone knows me, which is kinda strange since most people dont know the names of shy people -.- though i could be wrong, anyway lots of people come to me for help a lot, and im very nice to everyone. If i was more outgoing i bet i would have lots of friends, i only have like 2 close friends and 2 kinda friends. Are there ways for me to not be so nervous around people, and be able to feel confident? i dont want to change myself completely, but i have been shy all my life. So, tips on how to seem outgoing? or approachable? thanks and sorry this is so long ^_^

20090205173822AAM0Doa	Social Science;Psychology	How does one recover from being abused in childhood?	As I have gotten older, I have realized that the way my mother treated me and still treats me is a result of her own personal issues.      She was and still is verbally and sometimes physically abusive to me even though I am an adult.  I know the only way I can escape her behavior is to move out on my own, but right now I am not financially able to do so.  I work full-time and attend college part-time.      I don't understand how she can call me dysfunctional when she has created the environment for a dysfunctional relationship.      The ability for me to trust or be in romantic relationships is non-existent.  It's even hard for me to make friends.      Does she even have the right to be hurt that I don't tell her "Happy Mother's Day" or wish her a happy birthday?  How can I when we have such a negative relationship?!      How does one recover from such adversity?

20090205172925AA962Yz	Social Science;Psychology	Is it possible that I'm a sociopath and have no conscience?	Lately, I've been really worried that I might be a sociopath.  Maybe my worrying about it proves that I'm not because I guess a true sociopath wouldn't care if they were one or not.  I don't know.          I am a compulsive liar but the only lies I've ever told was to pretty much cover my tail.  Here's some examples:  I've made up excuse-like lies when running late for work so my boss or co-workers don't think I'm a slacker.  I usually say that I had car trouble or my dog was sick or overslept, or whatever excuse would make sense for running late for work.  I did lie to a boy I had a crush on when I was a teenager about who I was to get him to like me because I really liked him.  It went on for a while and when he found out, he was so mad at me and I ended up ruining our relationship and our friendship.  I can't blame him for that.       I try not to act embarrassed in certain situations but I do get embarrassed easily.  I don't like to be joked about.  I can be ignorant on certain things.  I don't think I'm arrogant though.  I can be selfish.  I worry a lot about things.        There's been people who've made me mad enough to where I've literally felt like I could kill them.  However, I've never planned and certainly never carried it out and I've never had the desired temptation to do anything like that either.        I guess I'm capable of loving because I had a really hard time when my grandmother died.  There's times I'll get to missing her and start crying.  I recently been worried about how much my parents smoke cigarrettes.  I get scared about them getting cancer and dying.        I love animals.  I have aggravated them because I can be a pest.  I've never tortured an animal by cutting or maiming one or killing one on purpose.  I can't watch Animal Cops on TV without getting ticked off at people who's neglected, starved or beaten their pets.  Some of those segments make me want to cry.       I've never been comfortable being around people who do drugs and break the law.  I've only had a speeding ticket once.  I've never tried stealing other than a piece of candy when I was a kid because my dad wouldn't buy me any.        I like to watch forensic shows on TV and enjoy reading books about notorious crimes.  But I feel like I'm a sick person for wanting to see autopsy or crime scene photos of people who've died from notorious crimes.  I don't know if that makes me sick or if it's just the fact that I like forensic stuff.        I haven't always taken responsibility for my actions.  I have lied to avoid taking responsibility for things I've done also.          I have really been worried about being a sociopath and I'm scared by past behaviors and mistakes I've made that I might be.  I don't want to be a bad person and I want to do better in my present and future and try hard not to make those mistakes again.      Help!

As I run My legs slowly start to ache and then they collapse.    I try to get up but my legs are too weak, and I end up standing and falling again. I never seem to make it, my legs are always so weak. It's even more weird because the pain is SO realistic and I am not sure if I have actually felt it, or if it is just that vivid in my dream.       A little bit of background is that I am a hurdler, and my legs have collapsed during a race before, but that was 2 years ago, and the dreams still occur.       Any idea what this could mean?
20090205173526AAtamfg	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream about a broken watch? and kittens?	Ok I had a dream last night that really felt like it meant something. First a bit of background on me... I live away at uni away from my family, parents are getting divorced and dads just bought a new house, and ive also just come out of a 2 and a half year relationship (ended on good terms, still heartbroken though).      OK the dream:   Another person moved into my flat in uni, he brought me and all of my flatmates presents, including a box of kittens, which seemed very significant, they were all named after me and my flatmates. The flat then upgraded to a new big house, that was messy but loved. At some point in my dream i noticed that my watch broke, to be specific, the seconds hand broke off, and slipped out of the broken face of the watch, My ex bought me the watch for my last birthday. The house was a happy place, and I wasnt too sad about my watch because it still worked, it was just damaged. And I want a kitten now lol.       Translations anyone??      xx

20090205175033AAoeLjF	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Does modern Feminism benefit anyone except feminists?	All this talk of how feminism is a movement for equality, i have always wondered what has feminism done for me as a black male? what has feminism done for husbands, children, mothers who decide to stay at home etc       Also, do you agree that it could be argued that feminism encourages group think and therefore also oppresses women by telling them how they must think and act to be a good feminist?  (twisty's ******* rant anyone?)      i know its a lot to ask, but can i please have objective fact based answers??
20090205175409AAe45lx	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Would you respect feminists more if...?	if they claimed that their movement was based on attaining fairness between the sexes rather than claiming equality when it suited and fairness when that suited? obviously fairness would be hard to objectify, but at least it would be honest right?

20090205185045AAkkApl	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	GENTLEMEN, Would equal representation in publicly held offices lead to more anti-male legislation...?	(Long Q, please skip if uninterested as there's no requirement to read nor answer this question; there are lots of Qs that need answers out there).      One of the areas that modern Feminists seem dissatisfied with is that there is greater representation by males in Congress.  Now, clearly there's nothing standing in the way of a female being elected into public office.  Additionally, most will agree that everything that can be done on a legislative level has been done to advance Western gender  equality (despite the under-represented Congress).      Modern Feminists, wish to have equal representation in Congress by women who affiliate with modern Feminism (ideally), but they'll settle for an equal number of men & women in Congress.      If we advance artificial measures to ensure this sort of "equal representation," then isn't the only foreseeable purpose to advance more legislation (since that's what Congress does)?      If an equal ratio of ladies to men is the goal, then doesn't that directly translate to more anti-male laws being passed by Congress?  If the current legislation on the books is good enough to ensure gender equality, then what else can artificially increasing the number of Feminists in Congress help to achieve other than Feminist Supremacy?
20090205180417AAVxd3k	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream interpretation?	Last night one of the many dreams I had involved a girl who I know in my waking life.She was picking me up for a school dance,she had rented a limo and all that.While she was at my house she saw how things were and are in my home life but in waking life I keep to myself.During the ride to the dance she actually seems interested in what I have to say about my home life.We get to the dance, and everything is going fine.All of a sudden another girl who I knew in my waking life comes over to us and asks if she could have a dance with me.I say maybe later, I am here with someone or something along those lines.Shortly after that the dream ended. Any ideas?

20090203063013AAA7oJt	Social Science;Economics	Why do Americans see a free market system and capitalism as essential parts of Democracy?	Free markets and capitalism are NOT part of the Constitution. The Constitution simply proscribes the way we choose leaders and make descisions and laws. It does not proscribe what kind of economic system we have....surely we can invent another, better system other than capitalism, communism or socialism....or have we reached the end of economic evolution?

"By far the most comon view of the newborn comes down to us over many centuries of Western culture, namely, that babies are born sinful or as otherwise antisocial beings who are inclined to manipulate their parents... The truth is that all newborns enter the world as optimists about human relationships, adoring their parents,and certain that they are so loveable that they are causing their parents to love caring for them." - Martha/William Pieper      Agree?

20090205184251AABS35T	Social Science;Psychology	I have a serious fear of death?	I have this outrageously serious fear of death and dying.    I will be fine, I'll be sitting at the computer, doing whatever, and I'll hear something on tv about someone dying, and I start to think about the fact that everyone gets older and eventually our lives will end, and this fact absolutely terrifies me. I can't even take it. I start thinking of my own life and how I will eventually get old and then just be gone, and it's unavoidable. I start to feel my throat close up and I can hear my heartbeat in my ears, I feel like I am about to start crying as I write this... I get dizzy and feel like I need to use the bathroom very badly.   Sometimes, I'll be laying in bed and everything starts to spin and get black. I've never passed out... but if I were to, I think that's how it would feel.      I think I am having some sort of panic attack when this happens, I tried to talk to my mom about it today.. but she is very disconnected, and my family isn't very close.   She just brushed it off like it was no big deal.      We don't have much money, and I don't have a job right now, I just got laid off...      Is there anything I can do to get help or to make my mom understand that this is serious?

I've always been told especially by boyfriends and co-workers that my facial expressions are going to get me in trouble. At work it's hard for me to put on that FAKE smile..especially when I know the real deal of crap that's going on...but they want us smiling ALL the time (I work in Disney Land for Senior Citizens)! It's just very hard for me, plus my manager has spoken to me a couple of times.       If I know the real deal about a person I can't just fake it or in my case grin and bear it.      What can you recommend for me to keep a smile on all the time (At work)....what can I do? I'm serious. I love the company I work for, but some of my co-workers PISS me off!

I have really strange dreams like every night, some really scary, some funny.   example, i had a dream once, i was sitting in my room listening to music, and I was feeling paranoid all day, then my phone rang and I knew something was really wrong. I looked at the caller id and it said "betray a plan" which in my dream was a pink floyd song, now technically speaking that isn't even a sentence,  but basically it meant come up with a plan. anyways, i ran and looked out my window, and there was two buses full of slaughterd  people in my driveway and two guys coming in my house with gas masks on, so I ran upstairs to find my whole family dead.      another one was   there were these people ripping open my intestines and eating it with spoons, and it was all green, the next day i had a headache and i was so disgusted i couldnt even eat

20090203065144AA6mXR7	Social Science;Psychology	Emotional dependency or real love?	When I wake up and before I sleep, I think of him.      Whenever I hear any love songs/break up songs, it reminds me of him.      When I feel or see something happy, I wish he's beside me now.      If he's sick/sad or lonely, I'll always be there for him.      I will do his laundry, iron his cloth, can learn how to cook ( just for him )      He just keep lingers on my mind 24/7.      I'll do anything to make him life comfortable.      I do get angry for his nasty habits ( getting drunk ) but I still accept for what he is.      He digs his nose and fart in front of me, I still love him.      I keep reading his IM messages, SMS es over and over again.      The thoughts of him makes me happy and hurt sometimes.      What he said is always very important to me.      Always looking forward to see him or talk to him.      Seeing him sleeping beside me makes me contented.      Likes doing things for him, just for him.      Likes to tidy up his room.            Is this real love for a person?

I had the strangest dream, I could do with a little help interpreting it. I've been married 5 years this year. Last night I dreamt that when we got engaged we'd got a ring but I'd lost it (that never happened). I found it in a slipper and was really excited, I started wearing it with my wedding and other engagement ring. But the stones (blue square ones and round diamonds) kept falling out. My husband and I were very upset about it (in the dream) and kept trying to find them and put them back in.      I'm worried about what this dream could mean, can anyone help?      Thanks

20090205184343AAFf4WA	Social Science;Psychology	Why do i cry when i am frustrated or yelled at?	I cary a lot. When people yell at me i start crying and i have no idea why. It happens all the time to me, and just at home. In school i can listen to the teachers yell at the class and i'll be perfectly fine, but when i get home and someone yells at me i am reduced to tears. The same thing happens to me with frustration, actually i am crying right now because my mom was explaining something to help me with a paper i am writing and i guess i got frustrated and overwhelmed and i am reduced to tears. How do i stop this? It always happens-- at least twice a week!   Thanks!

20090205190419AAoUAVH	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Should I just give up?	So here is my  dilemma.      I am in my early twenties.  I don't own a car, driver's license and I am currently living at home.  For the last six years I have practically begged my mother to help me get a license, but she just absolutely refuses to be of any help.  There is no one in my family or household that could be of any help to me.         What I fail to understand is how I ask her to drive me to or from places, she tells me no.  How can she refuse to help me get a license AND refuse to give me rides?  Well, I know how she can, but why would she?      How can she pretend to worry about my safety and then on the same note refuse to help make sure I get home safely?  I can not comprehend how someone could be so resistant to helping another person move forward and still have the right to tell them what they need to do in life?      How can my mother tell me I need to move out or do this or that, and then turn around and be of no support.  Financial support would be well appreciated, but what I need most is moral, emotional support.      What can I do about this besides the obvious, which is moving out?
20090205190830AAhdNnF	Social Science;Psychology	HELP! Serious self confidence issues?	Hi,      I just started in a new school (college actually - on tuesday lectures started though I arrived 2 weeks ago) and there are a bunch of new people, so everyone is in that whole making friends thing. Yesterday in one of my classes I sat next to this girl (who just joined the class that day) and started talking asking her name, where shes from etc. Then she just got up and went to sit next to this other girl in the row behind me (we were in the front row). That was really weird, she just got up and left. Not even like after an uncomfortable silence, just as soon as she told me where she was from. That kinda really bothered me and I started thinking why that happened, and I thought maybe its because I'm black and a million other things. Ever since I came here nothing bad has happened and people are very friendly, and this one thing happens and its not even that serious but makes me feel really bad. I started thinking about other things and my life in general and I've realized that I'm very insecure and not confident. In fact right now I feel like ****. And had a bad dream that confirms to me that on a deep subconscious level I'm very insecure. How can I fix this and be able to be secure, confident and truly happy, outside and inside. BTW I'm 19
