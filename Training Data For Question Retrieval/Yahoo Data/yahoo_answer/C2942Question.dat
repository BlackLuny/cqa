20090305050023AAoi9nW	Environment;Global Warming	Is "Global Warming" Like the "Gay Gene"?	There is no "Gay Gene".  No one can analyze any DNA and say it's from a gay or straight person however many people, many fine, good and knowledgeable scientists believe it exists.      The primary reason why people believe there is a genetic factor rather than a personal choice is their politics.      As with the "Gay Gene", people who accept "Global Warming" is real are mostly from the left end of the political spectrum.      So in that manner, is "Global Warming" like the "Gay Gene"?

20090305045844AAt74E0	Environment;Green Living	How would I organise a public demonstration?	I want to organise a peaceful public demonstration, calling all green activists and friends of the earth to unite in Kennington Park, South London, and march to Central London, Trafalgar square. It will be a demonstration that will be be pro-green, pro-carbon awareness and will be filmed by Positive TV and other TV news networks and newspapers will be invited. I want to attract as many people as possible to show just how many people care about the future of our planet and are really trying to improve their lifestyles, by recycling, buying fairtrade, growing fruit and veg, thus highlighting the fact that our Govenments must start to change and act now, their lack of consideration for their targeted carbon emissions cut down is monumnetal in illustrating how much many companies and businesses, like Sainsbury's and Tesco's, are unbelievably let off the hook whilst they are contritbuting massively to our emissions and also packaging all their goods in more plastic than ever.       What I would like to know is:    - What kind of license do you need to hold a public event of this kind?    - How would you ensure road safety?     - Who would I need to contact regarding police presence?    - What are the laws about public demonstration? Under what grounds can I lawfully hold this demonstration?       And finally:    - Would you attend a demonstration of this kind?      Thankyou

Please considering in your answer that the cap/trade carbon tax would hit low wage earners the most in the form of jobs and increased prices of everything that is purchased including food, baby food, milk and infant formula.      Please also consider that the CEO of a major US power generation and distribution company said yesterday that their billings would increase 40% across the board to all customers - residential, commercial, and industrial.

20090305085242AAd82i9	Environment;Green Living	At what age are animals slaughtered for meat?	I hope to be moving into the country in the next few years on a mini-farm.  In doing so I have been thinking of growing my own meat.  I know chickens get to live until they are older and can't produce eggs anymore, but what about cows and other animals?  Is there an age that is best or too old to use for meat?  I like the idea of an animal getting to live a nice full happy life instead of in the factories where they are kept in a small, depressing environment. Plus free range is healthier and better for our planet.
