20090203131407AASgB23	Pets;Cats	Has anyone else had this problem with Feline Greenies?	My 7 month old kitten has been getting poop stuck on the fur around her butt (sorry for the grossness). It has happened about 3 or 4 times in the past couple weeks. My best guess is that the soft poop is being caused by giving her Feline Greenies as a treat once in a while. I have another cat who is 5, who never has this problem and eats the same kind of cat food (dry Purina Cat Chow mixed with dry Merrick Before Grain) but does not like the Greenies.       I am going to stop giving her the treats for a while to see if the problem is resolved. My question is, has anyone else had this problem with Feline Greenies, or is it just a messy little kitten thing that happens once in a while?

20090203131302AAnDrXY	Pets;Cats	Question about my cat?	My cat gets really sick every few weeks (vomiting and laying around)   We took her to the vet and he said there was nothing wrong w/ her.    There has to be or she would not be getting sick!! And it is not her food and we do not give her treats and it is not hairballs. Trust me.   She as done this ever since we got her. She started after about 2 weeks when we got her. She was spayed when we got her and front claws were taken out. Her former owners had allergies to her and had to get rid of her. Why does she do this?

Would you recommend a mouse or a hamster instead, and why?      i do not want a guinea pig or a rat because they are too big.

20090203131818AACBslH	Pets;Horses	Searching for a horse?	I loaned a horse named Chai many years ago. I was wondering if anyone can help me locate him? He belonged to a man called Bob Jones who lived in Llangoedmor in Ceredigion, West Wales. Chai is dark brown and has a freeze mark that starts JB. I know its a long shot, but if anyone can help me, I would be eternally gratefull. I had to give him back due to a house move back in 1999 when Chai was between 5 and 7. (The guy I loaned him from was vague about alot of things.) Chai had a tiny amount of white in his mane, that sits just under the saddle. I would love to know how he is....   Last I heard he was in Kent showjumping, but this may not be true. If you know Bob Jones, please get in touch. Thanks.

20090203132623AAs6mSw	Pets;Cats	Cat lovers-Father talks about how he used to light cats' tails on fire as if it were normal,I spoke up,would u?	I diagnosed him with Antisocial Personality Disorder right at the Christmas Table Dinner. He went on about how he used to shoot them with BB guns as well. When I called him out on this abnormal behavior, he said did it as a kid, that doesn't count.       I said in the DSM the criteria is based on those behaviors as a child and how they get worse when the person gets older - as he is clearly getting worse with his psychotic behavior.  - as he is clearly getting worse with his psychotic behavior. He now shoots blue jays and squirrels, and I won't even get into how he torments PEOPLE.      So case in point - he got worse as he got older, he really had no response to this.      What would you do if someone (your father or not!) talked like that as if it were normal behavior at Christmas dinner?      I have administered the SCID diagnosis for ASPD (his disorder) for years, so I know that is a factor.      We are not on the best of terms and he was making jabs at everyone at the table. I refuse to see him except for holidays and birthdays, therefore, there is no appropriate time to do this.      He's been acting completely out of line.
20070514143334AAyt04v	Pets;Dogs	Will being gone this much be bad for my chihuahua?	I got my chihuahua, Toby, last January and I love him to death. I did a bunch of reading and stuff before getting him and learned that they shouldn't be left alone for long periods of time. Now, I'm about to start working at a bank 9-4 Monday through Friday. Since I live alone, I'm afraid he'll be alone too much. Also, lately I've been wanting to be at my boyfriends apartment a lot but I feel guilty staying over there because I know Toby is home alone. Is he going to be okay with this lifestyle? Am I worrying too much or what? What should I do?

20070603171905AAnnqQW	Pets;Dogs	Can a cocker spaniel be trained to not pee when touched?	She is just over a year.  The people I bought her from were abusing her so when they said they wanted to get rid of her I wanted her.  Their methods of getting rid of are questionable.  She is very scared when people touch her not with my family but people who come to the house.  She is very sweet and loves attention but when you touch her she pees always and when people come to the house she whines it kind of sounds like a baby crying.  People always ask what is wrong with her.  i don't understand how they could of hurt her. She is much better than when we got her she was used to being tied up outside by herself or inside in a crate.  The first few days all she did was run and jump everywhere and we though oh no what have we gotten in to but now she is a nice addition is only she wouldn't pee so much.
20070608144720AA5IVbv	Pets;Dogs	Jealous dogs?	I have 2 dogs that I am having jealousy problems with. The first is 5 1/2 and have had her for 5 years, the second turned 1 last month and we have had her for 8 months now. The get along most of the time, unless I try to give them attention at the same time. The younger dog will not come to me if the older dog is near me, she acts afraid to, even though the older dog does not show outward signs of aggression or try to keep her away. When I play with the younger the old will come over to play or get loved on too, and that is usually where the problems start. The younger dog starts shaking and growling at that point and while the older dog doesn't start many of the fights, she will put an end to one if the young dog starts. The young dog no longer wants to share toys, once she gets the toy from the older she growls if the older trying to keep playing with her. What do I do? I give them both equal attention. They are large (100lbs) and I worry they will hurt each other on accident one day

Tuve una mala experiencia de comprar un cachorro poodle a distancia, pues después de la entrega me enteré que "por estrés" era normal que el cachorro tuviera diarrea y moquillo. Y esto lo supe una vez comprado, que impotencia de no poder hacer nada, y la supuesta garantía anunciada por el vendedor te la reduce a "cero" una vez vendido el perro a provincia. Les recomiendo no comprar cachorros a distancia como "ignorantemente" lo hice yo, es hacerles pasar un muy mal rato a los hermosos perritos, mejor compren localmente, veanlos sanos, alegres y sobre todo vivos, porque el mío se murió.

Está un poco larga la historia...hace como mes y medio mi esposo y yo recogimos una gata y 6 hijitos. Los llevamos a la casa donde nos cambiaremos porque donde vivimos ahorita tenemos muchos perros. Esto se nos volvió muy complicado porque teníamos que ir a diario a llevarles de comer, limpiar, etc. y además yo estoy embarazada, entonces en realidad el trabajo era para mi esposo. Estábamos esperando a que crecieran los gatitos para llevarlos a operar, vacunar y darlos en adopción y yo me quería quedar con la mamá.

My betta fish has had slight fin and tail rot for quite a while, but fins looked to be growing back.  I had him in a 1 gallon bowl, no filtration or anything. I moved him into a filtered, non heated, 1.5 gallon tank, and at first he seemed to love it!  I'm not sure why, but a day later, i noticed his fin and tail rot had rapidly increased. I do not know what to do, he is eating fine, his color is still beautiful, and he is moving around quite a bit.  I've been treating him with fungus and bacteria medication for his fin rot, and I've added salt to the tank.  I don't know what else to do, but I love my fish and I want to save him.

Gunner was purchased from a breeder...has a pedigree,insurance,2 year health guarentee and parents are OVC hip and elbow certified....CKC papers. I have noticed when I am walking him...he is a little timid around people....but eventually warms up to them...When he sees another dog he barks and grows continuously....tries to nip. He does this to our poodle mix, with her it is just playing but am not sure what it is with the other dogs?....could it be a fear stage he is going through?...mind the other dogs usually bark back,well the puppies do anyway. I can't tell if it is play or aggressive as he plays like that with my smaller dog? Any Suggestions....He is also in obedience training

20081102022103AAUQOr1	Pets;Dogs	Dog being sick............?	He's not had anything to eat since his regular meal yesterday and has been outside this morning.  A few minutes after he came in he threw up 3 times in about 10mins, and in the last hr or so he's been sick twice more.  Nothing in his sick, just bile, why could he be throwing up, and how should we take care of him.  He has water on offer always, of course, but we haven't offered any food yet.  He's prone to being sensitive to food, and consequently we never change brand and don't ever feed him any treats, aside from raw hide bones, which he had one small one last night to distract him from the fireworks!    Please advise, he does seem fine in himself!   Thank you

20090425183314AAK3jJK	Pets;Birds	BBQ and Birds...Need Help!?	I have a question. This is not a cooking question, as it may seem in the title, but here is what im asking-           WHAT SHOULD I DO? well, i should probably tell you the story before you try to answer that. i have been monitoring the birds in my back yard lately. As it is spring, all the female birds are starting to lay all their eggs, and im always the one to help a fallen chick. My neighbors call when they have a small chick that has fallen from the nest. i see if it needs to go to the vet, or if it should just take some resting. As an animal lover, i help all kinds of animals, not just chicks. but thats not the point.                 so this bird starting making a nest in my BBQ pit about...3 and a half weeks ago. Its about 2 feet wide (the nest) and 9 inches high. Well, i know that its getting hotter, and if i want to BBQ something, then, i dont want to fire up a birdy family! so, i left the door to the BBQ pit open. With the strong winds we have here, it blew it close. so she just kept making that nest of hers. Well, today, i was out gardening, when i heard the familiar sound of her walking around inside the pit. So, i walked over, and knocked on the door ( i dont do this to act like she is going to answer the door and welcome me in or anything, i do it to warn her that the door will be opening, and she can either stay there, or fly) and she flys right out the small whole on the side. So i lifted the door and BAM!!! just like that 5 little blue eggs all lined up around the center. you can tel when eggs have just been laid. they have an odd smell, and a some-what shiny look to them. AND THEY WERE NEW. were talking about this morning, or a couple of hours ago- early.                so what should i do? i am going to need to cook on the BBQ, but i cant move the nest, because i have no where else to put it. The only trees are in my neighbors feilds, and in the woods behind my feilds, and i dont trust myself riding out there with a nest in my lap, bobbing up and down on a golf cart. so, what should i do?                   i dont want to "defect from nature" like my friends say i would do by moving them.        PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!! thank you!

After starting to feed him chicken, he lost all the hair on his legs.  I switched him to Innove Evo Red Meat, which he has done VERY well on, but had soft stools. So, I mixed it with Natural Balance Venison & Brown Rice, but am freaked out after the recall last week.  He does better with a mix.  I am considering adding in a new food.  I like Merrick and the quaility of that food, but even their "Wilderness Blend", their "allergy blend" has chicken liver in.  I found that strange.  I want to know whether this would cause the same effects or if it would be such a minute quantity that he'd be fine.  Any info is appreciated.

20070915131400AAdlQX9	Pets;Other - Pets	What do you think ?	In may my parents gave me the chance to get either a rabbit or a cat. We already have a cat, but we have never had a rabbit. I chose the rabbit. I have had him for 5 months, and have found that he is not the pet for me. About a week after I got him, I knew this, but I have kept him and taken good care of him because I make a commitment to take care of him for the rest of his life, and I wont go back on that. My parents know that I am not particularly fond of my rabbit, and today my mom told me that if I can find a good home for Charlie (my rabbit) then I could get a cat. I want a cat, but even though Charlie is not the pet for me, I love him (but I am not that attached to him), and I would feel like I failed him if I gave him away. I would not put him in a shelter. I volunteer for a shelter, and I know how to pick out the best owner for a pet, so I would make sure that they could take care of him (even do a home visit), but I dont know what to do. Suggestions please.

20070916195700AAChSJ3	Pets;Dogs	Anyone heard of someone coating dog bones in poison?	we have a 6ft privacy fence that our dogs are loose all day long in. recently there was a note taped to our front door saying that one of the dogs barks the entire time we're gone. we've spoken to neighbors and they disagree first of all and second didn't write the note or see anyone leave it. now all of a sudden there are dog bones (ones we didn't give them) showing up in our yard. we're just afraid that whoever wrote the note is upset to the point that they would throw dog bones coated in some sort of poison into our backyard.

20080504042855AA606od	Pets;Rodents	How can I stop the neighbour's cats from coming into our house?	The neighbour on my left has 5 cats, and they pee all over my front lawn, they sit outside the side gate (on the front yard side) so as to drive Shrek (my dog) crazy. On two occassions lately, I've seen their cats running out of my house (through the doggy door) as I came home. Can you give me ideas on what I can do to stop those cats from being on my property? (I've tried the water gun thing, throwing thongs at them....but they keep coming back).
