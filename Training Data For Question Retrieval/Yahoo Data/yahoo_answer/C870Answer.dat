Once at the IRS site on the left hand side of the screen choose more forms and publications then it will give you a different screen and in the middle of the screen under forms and pub choose previous years and you will find the 2006 and 2007 forms.  Once you have completed the tax return mail to IRS, don't forget to sign and date the return.  Also make sure to use your current address (not the address you were on that year)  <br>  If you choose to e-file 2008 you can also visit IRS website www.irs.gov for free e-filing. <br>  good luck, and it is very wise of you to file 2006 and 2007 because if you don't IRS will then hold the 2008 refund until you file.

But if you have not submitted anything then yes they will take the money and then when your case is won they will return the money back to you.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind this will night be no short process.

Have you paid the fee for the tax court?  If you petitioned the tax court maybe you had received an ASFR letter 3219C requesting you to file a tax return from a previously year.  The letter gives you a proposal of how IRS would file and usually shows you would of owe IRS money and that is only because IRS file at a higher tax and files for you as single and not exemptions, no deductions other than standard deduction for that year,  if you didn't respond to the letter within 90 days from the date of the letter then IRS files for you.   <br>  Once you petition the tax court you would not file a return because you already disagreed by petitioning the tax court.  You can't petition and then change your mind an file.  Petitioning the tax court is a long process and you will have to proof why you aren't required to file a tax return, or if you owe IRS why you aren't required to pay,  there really isn't a chance of you winning.<br>  And if your account shows you owe then yes IRS is going to offset your refund.

The best advice I can give is for you to do some serious self-examination. Where have you been slacking off? Where have you been struggling because you don't have the training or skills needed? Are there parts of your job you just hate to do? Are there parts you want to do well but just need more help with?  Make your own list of what you think you could and should be doing better. Then, make a list of what you need in order to do that. Should you spend more time on training? Is there someone who can be a coach or mentor for you to help with other skills? If you go to the meeting prepared with suggestions for how to resolve the performance issues, it may make the conversation go much better. Don't present them in a confrontational or defensive way, but make sure your boss understands that you truly want to do better and you're willing to ask for help in order to do that.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	Why don't you sit down and try to figure out what it is you could be doing "better" in your job?<br>  A little bit late now... you should have done that months ago and either tried different things or just gone to your boss and ask for his help in a specific area that you know you aren't up to par on.<br>  <br>  Obviously I have no idea what you do for a living... but when a Boss doesn't let out any info because you brought up a sore subject that he plans to address on a set date... he is determined to finish whatever it is he has planned... on Tuesday.<br>  <br>  I just hope it will turn out OK for you.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a definitive article from google.com regarding the placement and number of keywords to be placed into SEO metatags.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AnULq1gfaa	Meta keywords should be related to the webpage.  If your home page is about Horses, try to keep the meta keywords in the range of 4-5 keywords.  Search engine wants to see keywords that are related to the web page they are visiting.  If the web page has keywords that are not related to the web page content, you are going to irritate search engines.  Also, it is highly recommended that you optmize every single page on your website.  Every page should have it's own meta keyword and keywords should be related to the content on that page.  <br>  <br>  I recommend using wordpress because wordpress has plugins that will aautomatically optmize every page on your blog with proper description and meta keywords.
AA10349002	I would suggest you go to as many stores websites and under careers look for Management Training Programs. All of the big names will have such a program.  Also you can go to the store and talk to a manager and ask them.
DF22BQ3yaa	To be honest I do not know anything about this but I will advise that you call one of those attorney lines for a free consultation. Ask them what you have just asked us and see if they are trying to pull the wool over your boyfriend's eyes.     Another thing you can do is call the company yourself and ask them these questions posing as an interested canidate for a security guard position.|`|a0b943926ff31dc5ae164f5e71cd6efaaa	sounds fishy, if any place is REALLY interested in hiring him, THEY are the ones that are gonna pay to have him trained.  is this an actual employer (ie, walmart, sears, an actual warehouse security guard) or an employement agency? if its an employment agency, then its 99% likely a scam.  has he looked into working at UPS (theyre always hiring) or as a construction worker? they might be good alternatives and pay MUCH more.  good luck to your BF|`|LlCnUAnFaa	I would run like the dickens. If it's illegal to hire a security guard without being certified, why are they hiring. They are breaking the law. This sounds like a scam to prey upon those that are seeking employment.  The company may actually be paying for these things and the boss is lining his own pockets.  What's next--karate training, fitness classes, CPR?  Beware.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	If the boss is asking him for the money to provide training, then it is a ripoff.    There are jobs that require you to get certified, but you will have several options for where to get training and they will usually not be through the company that is hiring you.  Really?  16 hours of fire extinguiser safety classes?  You realize how dumb that sounds?  Step back for a minute.  This has all the markings of a scam.  They use your hopes against you.

They will put him through all that training at HIS expense and then all they will do is hold his name on a register of people who have completed it and and he MIGHT get a call sometime telling him to go to an interview for a real job, where he will still have to go through the same offical requirements as anyone else.    I'd suggest he asks this guy for references he can contact, of people actually employing those who have been through this programme as well as those who are actually employed via this guy.    If he doesn't get that, tell this dodgy boss man to get lost.|`|NsbGM74iaa	I dont know anything about the security field but if it was me, my gut would tell me that its a scam.    I wouldnt trust a job that would make you pay something to start working for them.  If they really wanted to hire you, then they would front the costs.
8xDOEr63aa	They don't, really. You can't make it work long term.    The majority of Americans making minimum wage are teenagers who still live with their parents and receive food, transportion, lodging and health care through their parents.    Because the math is so prohibitive and there is a decent supply of better paying jobs for non-skilled persons (even in this economy), minimum wage earners don't stay at minimum wage for long.    Look around for other opportunities, you can do better.|`|CW7Sej2uaa	Who works for minimum wage?  Even McDonald's pays above minmum wage.  Minimum wage is not intended to be a living wage, it is simply to prevent gross abuse of young and underqualified workers that was present in the US industrial revolution.|`|NsbGM74iaa	When I made minimum wage in college I was practically rich.  Then again I had no expenses cause I lived in moms basement :(|`|WXExyAlWaa	Yeah it's tough. :/ Right now I'm on a sickness benefit which is NZ$147 a week (just over US$70) and even though I am living with my parents to pay very little in rent, I don't have a lot of money left over.    You have to have a budget, and follow it. Groceries is the place for the biggest variance. Never go shopping when you're hungry, check fliers for sales before you go so you can decide whether it's worth it and not impulse buy. Rice and pasta go a long way. Mince and sausages are cheaper meat than steak and things. Bring a calculator to check prices in relation to how much you're getting, and keep a running total of about how much you're buying as you go through the store so you don't get a nasty surprise at the checkout.    Instead of going to movies, hire videos and have a night in with friends. Don't drink in bars, buy alcohol from the store instead. It's tough to start with, but once you get the hang of it it gets a lot easier.|`|T8f8C3Tfaa	There was a documentary about this by the same person who did the McDonald's documentary and its just so said to see it.  Its impossible to do this.  I think if you were in the south were the cost of living is cheaper but in big cities like Chicago, LA, NY there is no way that you can live off of it.|`|Hs62xbSbaa	It can be done, if you have the right support programs in place.  For instance, Social Services programs such as food, medical insurance, and rental assistance all affect a persons ability to survive.  Many people who do not make a lot of money learn to live that way: paying cash for old cars, recycling cans for money, doing what they need to.      On July 24, 2009 unemployment will be raised to $7.25/hr.  I wonder what this will do to the jobs that people are working now.  When the minimum wage goes up, everyone who makes less than $7.25/hr would go up $7.25/hr.  More info here:  http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/flsa/    Also, some states have laws regarding minimum wage.  However, the larger of the two laws (federal or state) has jurisprudence.  So if a state law says that a worker making minimum wage is going to make $6.65 per hour but the Fed says $7.25, the $7.25/hour prevails.
MU9iqThfaa	In the past when I applied for jobs online, I found it took them a long time to download the actual applications, actually a few months in one instance.   You could call the companies and tell them you submitted an application electronically. You could also go to their business and get the old fashioned paper app and fill it out and drop it back off with your resume.   As fancy as some companies are getting, with their bells and whistle websites full of fancy schmancy e-forms, that doesn't mean the people working in the office are paying complete attention to it. Like my doctor's office had this request appointment online form that I filled out.. I ended up calling them 2 weeks later and got an appointment well before they ever checked the online form.   Enjoy your time without a job. When else are going to get to sleep in, stay up late, and have no responsibilities other than school?

w4OGnyn8aa	There are a ton of apartments here. You can find one bedrooms from 425-700 depending on what amenities you want. The average is around 500-550. There are a ton of bars here. The best ones to work at are Bailey's, Rookies, Bar Knoxville, etc. They are the most popular. The cost of living is not bad here at all. One of the lowest. My friend lives in a one bedroom for 425 which is pretty much the cheapest in town. In the nicer areas your going to want to stay in the West Knox area and it will be more like 550.
cLtzGveRaa	That's not enough information.  The loans company will look at many things including length of time at job, credit score, debt to income ratio, value of the car, etc.    So, typically they like to see a debt to income ratio of less than 40%.  Their "debt" definition is the minimum payment on your card if it is maxed out, your rent, your heat, and your other debt payments.  If that takes up more than 40% you will not likely get a loan from the bank.
qWaYbxcxaa	You will need to apply to find out.    credit card balance is very high? How high?    What are your expenses?    That $8000 car is prob really worth $3000.00 negotiate on the car to get a lower loan amount. Very few people are buying cars. It's a buyer's market.|`|8xDOEr63aa	Get yourself an older model car and pay cash for it. Make car payments to your existing debt or pay yourself and buy a nicer car when you can pay cash for it. Or Invest the car payment you would have been making in growth stock mutual funds.    Car payments are for the broke.|`|Hs62xbSbaa	Not too bad.  What is your rent amount?  If you are living at home that will be a plus.  Why the high credit card debt?  Ahhhh, to be young again.    OK, start by taking the bulk of the money you have free each month and pay down those credit cards.  If you can, see if you can transfer the balance of all cards onto one card (the one with the lowest interest rate hopefully).  Then close out your other credit card accounts.  This will have the added benefit of being marked paid on your credit report.    That is the biggest thing any loan company, whether a bank or credit union, will look for:  how much debt you currently have.  Your income is fine, so long as your rent isn't high.    If you do not pay those credit card debts now, I think you will find yourself further in the hole a lot quicker due to interest.  Your credit score, although not terrible is not the best either.  It could be because you have NO credit.  In which case if you follow my suggestion above you will have more points added to your score for paying down debt.  Good luck mate.|`|ReQyHq4Baa	It depends on the bank.  Most because of the tight lending standards (due to the economy) would say that your score has to be 620, 650 or over.  Another bank may lend to you, but the interest rate will be high because they may consider you high-risk with a score of 600.  Your score is not horrible - there are much worse - it's not good, either.      This is just me but I'd take my tax return and get a used car until my FICO score went up a little higher.

I recommend to get such agreement thru credit repair agency, for example this one - freecreditreport.sinfree.net|`|cLtzGveRaa	Take out a secured credit card.

Pay it faithfully.|`|ek8gDEaMaa	You could use simple credit repair to remove any negatives or late pays; it's your right.  Some sort of seasoned tradeline program with a perfect pay history would help as well.  Good luck.
qBCGH52haa	Dividends vary by company.  Not all stock pays dividends.  You only need one share to get a dividend.  For example, if you owned one share of IBM stock, the dividend is $.50 and you would get $.50 divided into 4 payment of 12.5 cent a quarter.  Multiply the dividend by the number of shares to get an investors total pay out.|`|I3CNklLKaa	The dividends are declared and then shared amongst the equity shareholders - so yes you would get a dividend on 1 share. As to how much that would be? - Not much. Dividends depend on the performance of the company, how much of the profits they need to retain for growth and a whole bunch of other factors.|`|AA10010182	I have 1 share of GM and I've been getting a tiny check every quarter for years. It would cost more to sell the share; actually I don't even know where it's being held, now that I think about it.|`|qWaYbxcxaa	If a dividend is declared, then you would get a dividend if you owned the stock one day before the "ex dividend date."    If you buy a stock on the "ex dividend date" WHEN there is a declared dividend, one would NOT be entitled to the dividend.    Ex Div Date  http://www.sec.gov/answers/dividen.htm    Note: Just because a stock has a dividend, doesn't mean it is a stock that is any better buy than one that has no dividend.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	If a dividend is declared, then you get a dividend per share.    It might only be 20 cents per share.    Every company is different and it's based on their profit for the year.

5BmnSiqUaa	Strictly speaking, none.  A recent TV story featured a very respectable millionaire gentleman approximately 56 years old.  He was featured because he finally admitted illiteracy.  How did he manage?  His employees are literate.    That's one extreme.  On the other end are those business school graduates of very prestigious, very established and very expensive universities.    Folks in the middle should take some basic business courses in economics, accounting, finance and of course, business law.    One very, very good resource are the talents within score.org, a volunteer organization comprised of retired business executives specializing in educating and assisting entrepreneurs.  These business veterans will share actual insights from their own experience.  In short, valuable knowledge you're not likely to find in textbooks or classroom situations.  If available, they may even assign you a mentor.  Majority of their services are free.  If you choose to attend one of their traveling seminars, they do incur costs so those are not free but priced very reasonably.    Hope this helps.    Good Luck.

That doesn't include groceries. Plus, there is also your rent and you should get renters insurance. (If there was a leak or fire, the apartment complex does NOT pay for replacement of your things) You also need to take into consideration your phone bills, car payments and insurance, and entertainment money.

qWaYbxcxaa	One never should accept assets such as property until they know it is unencumbered.    The probate court can order the home to be sold or you can see if you can get a equity loan out of the house once in your name for the $75k due and use that to pay off the creditors. This would prevent the selling of the home.     I assume the house is worth a lot more than $75k and IS not  paid in full? And there are no equity lines of credit or other debt outstanding?    The creditors can attach the debts to the estate and demand payment before you see a dime. You might want to best go get some legal advice when dealing with this asset from a probate lawyer.|`|AA11206283	You'll never see title to the house.

However the bad news is that before you get anything from the estate, the debts must be paid. That means everything must be sold, including the house if necessary, to get the money to pay the debts.     As the beneficiary of the estate, you get what is left over after all the debts are paid.     If there is not enough to pay all the debts, then everything will be sold to pay as much debt as possible. The remaining debt is canceled and you get nothing from the estate.|`|4MypYVHYaa	I don't know what the dollar amount in your state is on going through probate, but if you are in that range then you will have to go through probate.     Going through probate will normally require an attorney. He will place an ad of the probate in a local newspaper indicating that anyone with claims against the estate should step up and make their claims through this probate that is now open.    Anyone that step up will be paid, others that don't step up prior to the probate closing will be out of luck They will lose and can not come back to request any payment after probate has closed.    I have found out that most credit cards do not respond to the ad. Let the system work and not volunteer any information to anyone. Credit card companies have a way of writing off bad debt.    Once the court close the probate all is closed.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"|`|qBCGH52haa	In order for the house to be transferred to you, the estate must work through/clear probate.  Debt payment comes before inheritance and if the remainder of the estate is not enough to cover the debt, the house will be sold, the proceeds used to pay the debt and you will get what is left over.  Check with the probate court and/or the executor to see what stage the probate is and what the odds are of the debt being paid out of other assets.

That is, the company/post office or bank that you bought the money order through.  That sounds a bit fishy to me.  Normally, if you happen to be charged twice they usually put back on the money. It is possible that that person is trying to rip you off that is why you were charged twice initially and then she said that she was not able to cash the MO.|`|6tSTMFOoaa	I work at a place that sells money orders and I am almost 98% sure there is no way to stop payment on a money order.

1498434f366a56b1b0b7643757ab51b3aa	I say be as honest as possible.  The answer you just gave was terrific!      Be open and honest about it, let them know that it was a big mistake that you have regretted since then and you have worked very hard to change and overcome your mistake.  Everyone was young once and realize the naivete of a young person.  Don't talk about it too much, you don't want it to overcome the interview.  Just mention it and move on.  I'm sure your credentials since then speak for themselves.    Good luck to you.|`|46uiaxPUaa	Be as honest as possible and you might want to consider having your record expunged, call a couple of attorneys. It may be pricey but it'll save you a lot of headaches|`|ATbSIpNbaa	If they ask about it then just tell them what happened. I think if you are honest about it and don't beat around the bush, they may look past it. But be sure to point out that you were young and dumb...LOL     Good Luck!
fz2woMMTaa	ask the post office if they can give you a phone no. if they can't then ask for the details of the current Premium Bonds and call them, they should be able to help.
pCEA7Pu8aa	In August or September of 2008 Bush signed a bill that stated if it was your primary residence then you would not be taxed on that 1099.    If it was a investment property than you took the risk and have to deal with the loss.    Most people have enough losses this year to offset their 1099 though.    The best advice is of course to speak with you accountant your tax advisor.    Good luck|`|UQWusO1waa	i remember hearing that is was no longer applicable(last year) ,or  maybe that bill did not pass yet and is still in the works. Why dont you google it on some tax info site.
qWaYbxcxaa	Yes. Been doing this for some 20 years in Bull and Bear Markets. I see no reason to leave an industry which I love being in.    I would prob fire the hubbie from any further financial/ investment advice. Gold was not the best call either, but a better call between the two.    Have extensive and quite an accurate post history that discusses the markets and basic strategy and events and what to watch out for over the last 2 years on Y!A (add me to view post history - it's free).|`|5WzklgiBaa	If you are serious to invest, you can consider HSFX Asset Management and start making consistent profit. You can google about them in search engine.|`|ww12lItvaa	Yes, It has made me very rich. The hardest part is selling at the highs. Everybody gets the "buy low" but most refuse to sell at the highs and they are wrong. You "almost" did.     You are saying you are getting scared out of the market now near the bottom. That is just as backwards as refusing to sell at the tops.     I love when the market falls as I usually have most or all of my money out.    I get worried and a little scared when we are hitting new highs, knowing it is more likely to fall.  You don't get hurt much falling from the bottom of the cliff.      I like hearing you are giving up on the market because they say bottoms don't occur until most people don't want to own stocks.|`|AA10259042	If you think that 1/2 million loss is bad, you do not want to open a business at this time.  You could loose everything.  I too have lost a bunch but that is part of the game of investing.  Hopefully, things will recover--hopefully.  I must say though that so far Mr. Obama has been a disappointment.  I sort of wonder whether he knows anyone that is not a crook or anyone who actually pays their taxes.|`|ONRpcM82aa	I feel your pain. I lost alot of money too but there is still hope for stock market investing.  When the crisis end, i'll be right there.  However, thats a good idea to start your own business.  It seems to be the best alternative for someone who can afford to do that.  Have you considered currency trading.  I am new to it and I like the fact that you can make money quicker than the stock market.  It is also open 24hrs a day for 5 days out of the week.|`|WgT5l14baa	Sure.  Shares are cheap now!  Five years from now this will look like a pothole in the rear view mirror.  I've been through too many crisis to get worked up over one more.|`|AA10010182	They always say the market is cyclical, but this is very hard to take. There are other investments, but so many mutual funds and other vehicles are equity-based that it's almost hard to stay out of the market completely. I got out for a short period but I'm back in now and treading water. Looking for value stocks, not home runs.|`|AA10409832	You would've lost with gold too.  I've lost a lot too, but it's staying right where it is.    Eventually, the market will rebound.  The mistake you made was not spreading your investments out.  My investments are spread out over a lot of different things.  You should have had some bonds, mutual funds, stocks, etc.  Really, you should have gone to a financial investor that you trust and let him invest your money for you.  Actually, now is the time to invest.  There are a lot of bargains out there that will eventually grow.  Coke, and Walmart, are two, for example, that aren't going anywhere.  They will always be around, and when they start to grow, you'll be in the chips.  But don't just bank on these two.  Go talk to someone who knows what they are doing.  By the way, you should be mad at YOURSELF for taking your husband's advice, unless he is a professional broker.  Doing things that you don't know about, without contacting someone who does is courting disaster.  Good luck|`|Lu1pTwRHaa	Of course I will. People from the Great Depression probably asked that same question. In a bear market like this one you have to have a strong knowledge in finance and economics to invest. I made well over 400% when I bought Wachovia for 80 cents per share. I also did a similar thing with Morgan Stanley in October when it took a huge hit. I made about 110% from that.|`|ldfT52GVaa	the young guys/gals should be investing in the market.. you can ride out all these highs and lows...   I personally love to buy when everyone is saying "dont buy"...
HJcIKFOPaa	NO don't close the account it will only make the problem worse. 61 is not old. Are you retired? Even if you are...how old do you hope to live...should we go with 90 or 100...I mean plan for the longest time and figure you have another 30 or 40 years of income and investing in your future.     The worst thing to do is pull out...listen to all the advisors they say don't do it...don't pull out. Your money will eventually rebuild itself. You might want to redistribute your funds if they were all in aggressive funds that might not be wise. Maybe a lower percentage needs to be in the aggressive funds.     The one thing advisors are suggesting is to reevelatue the distribution of your money. because if you money was 75% aggressive and 25% conservitive with the recent fluctuation you may find it is at 50 and 50% and that you may need to shift the money around.    PLEASE DONT CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT|`|2N6oTOLQaa	No, if you close the account you will realize your loss which means you make it permanent.     If I were in your situation, I would take out the bare minimum that I need to survive on and leave the rest invested so that it will recover as the market recovers.     If you are in good health at 61 years old, you have 20 years or more to live, this recession isn't going to last for 20 years.|`|qiYUZ4i8aa	Maybe you could edit your question and supply additional information such as what the asset allocation is on this IRA.  I think I could better help you with that information.
AA10263406	1) Having the thermostat set to around 40 should keep you out of trouble. If you want to have it on a timer, and go to 40 overnight, and let the sunshine warm the place during the day, leave some water dripping at each faucet to be safe.    2) Whenever the outside temperature is consistently above freezing.    3) The heater will shut off if the temperature is over what it's supposed to be.|`|90a00bd8dcb35ddbddaaa418559978e1aa	If it is going to be vacant for an extended amount of time you should turn the water off at the meter and drain the water out of the system. Then leave all the faucets open and you should be fine with low or no heat.
2175f344667eb899883377df39a243faaa	Because of the current economic climate.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Credit is so ridiculous right now, we applied for a home equity line where the equity in our home was four times the equity line we asked for, and we applied with the same bank that holds our mortgage, which we have been paying off without fail for over 6 years now on a 15 year loan.  They said they wouldn't give us an equity line for any amount.  Unbelieveable!  First they lend money to high risk people and need a government bailout for being greedy, then they won't lend money to people that actually pay back what they borrowed.  We had no late payments, no bad credit report, continuous employment, and they still wouldn't give us a line of credit.      We then applied to a credit union for the equity line and got it.  So, don't give up, some lending institutions haven't totally freaked and will still lend money.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	A loan for you is an investment for the person giving you the loan.     If you were making an investment you would carefully consider risk verses reward. The person or company giving you the loan does the same thing.    If the risk of loosing their money is too high or the reward is too low they won't make the investment. Usually companies are willing to offset higher risk by charging bigger fees and higher interest rates to generate a bigger return.     However if the risk is too big companies will just say no. Sometimes the risk is just so high that no amount of return makes it worth while. Other times, the law puts limits on how much they can charge you, so they can't legally charge you enough to make it worth it to them.     The bottom line is that the company decide you were too high of a risk. It might be because of a low credit score, low income, other outstanding unpaid debts, or any number of other things that make you high risk.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Lack of min credit requirements to be a safe risk|`|ReQyHq4Baa	If you have a student loan in default or a low FICO (credit) score, they won't approve you.  If you're talking about the 1-2 day loan for getting your tax return early, that's the reason someplace like H&R Block or Jackson-Hewitt won't approve you.|`|Hs62xbSbaa	You must have tried to get your income tax rebate.  I wondered the same thing.  I have been going to H & R Block for the past 11 years, and this year is the first time I have not gotten the early loan!    When I asked my tax advisor, she said that even though life changes, such as having a child, getting married, or switching to self employment, can affect the decision a lot of it has to do with the economy.  Could it be that the bigwigs at H & R Block and other companies think the government is going to go belly-up?  I mean, we are talking about income tax refunds here, they are virtually guaranteed once the tax forms are filed.

This could be because the new broker is charging you more than your previous broker was.  <br>  <br>  All that aside $2300 is not bad because it really is only $1430 for your closing.

Pjm9pg7iaa	Wait.  There is a good chance that the President will lower interest rates to 3.5% for 30 year fixed mortgages if the economy does not get better by summer. A super-low interest rate for home loans would get the economy booming (even tho many people might argue that it would be a false boom). Do not take money out of your stocks unless you have lots of extra money.|`|6vZKp5XCaa	Definitely do it.
BXwv4dBvaa	Yeah, this is kind of a tough question to answer.  There really aren't many people who choose this direction; it's more like you branch into (or luck into) some sort of an entrepreneurial venture after getting some real-world experience under your belt (or while you still are working and have something to fall back on as most ventures will not bear fruit).<br>  <br>  Really, an entrepreneur can be considered a small business owner, and you will get out what you put into whatever it is you do.  Attached is a pretty good article on the traits that most successful entrepreneurs share.  Pay attention to number eight.  It suggests perseverance, determination and learning from failures will outweigh a formal education.  Having said that, my recommendation would still be for you to actually go to b-school.  Most programs do have specializations in entrepreneurial studies.<br>  <br>  Now, my crystal ball is a bit blurry right now for what will boom in the future.  Honestly, if anyone actually knew, they wouldn't be that willing to share.  This is where experience comes in:  When you are working in a specific industry, you are on the front lines as far as innovation and what will be the next 'big thing'.  For a generic, played-out answer, anything green seems to be a compelling sale these days -- but everyone is aware of this current/impending paradigm shift.<br>  <br>  As for something interesting if you are considering something different in the future; a somewhat-related field may be a venture capitalist, where you would fund thos entrepreneurs who you feel have the next 'big thing', through either your own firm's funds, those of investors or a combination of both -- very exciting, and an interesting twist on your current ambition.  Again, you would need b-school and some significant experience under your belt to succeed in this industry.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|Ru8njhNcaa	Saying that you decided to be an entrepreneur is kind of like saying you decided you want to make millions a year. Yea, sure you do, and so does every one else.<br>  <br>  By the very definition is someone who knows how to make money (or has ideas) if you don't have any ideas, and can't come up with anything, well, not the best way to start off.<br>  <br>  As for what degree you should get or what industry to go into, that's your choice, choose something you enjoy and make it work.

Try a pawn shop or other place that will take your jewelry on commission.  When you ship something to a "cash for gold" outfit, you're pretty well stuck with what they pay you.

aUQ1ridmaa	Yes, you can and most likely will get less on your tax returns if you file Married Filing Separately.  A lot of credits are not allowed if you file Separate returns.<br>  <br>  If you are legally married, living together and have no current pending divorce papers, then you have to file either Married Filing Joint or Married Filing Separate.<br>  <br>  But there are other options. <br>  <br>  You can get information from the IRS or employers and file those back tax returns. (However anything from before 2004 they may not pay a refund or ask for the balance due).  (The IRS may at some point ask for these. I have seen requests for multiple years of tax returns to be completed and sent in to the IRS).<br>  <br>  You can file a Married Filing Joint tax return, but just in case (And if you meet all the rules) file a Form 8379, Injured Spouse form, that would break down the whole tax return to show what income, expenses, credit belong to you and your husband. That way they could, if properly calculated and all rules apply, keep just his part of any refund.<br>  <br>  Injured Spouse form:<br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8379.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8379.pdf</a> <br>  <br>  Injured Spouse Information starts on page 3:<br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p504.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p504.pdf</a> <br>  <br>  Shannon C|`|7iIh5QmOaa	the best thing to do is file with injured spouse clause so your refund due wont be subjected to his past debt. if u file separate you wont get all of the credits you normally would and thats extra money in your pocket.

The sister and brother-in-law have certainly not acted like family in this situation--all they've done is take advantage of and lie to their sister and mother. Maybe they shouldn't be taken to court, but they definitely shouldn't be given more money. Although the OP loves her sister, she can't keep continuing to give her money while she is struggling herself. It's not benefiting her sister, either--what is she learning from all this? That she can treat her family badly and profit from it?

Im sorry but thats how I see it. (And why hasnt she sold the horse?!?)|`|gvPXYXQFaa	It seems like there is a lot left unspoken between you& Mum, and Michelle& Dan. It seems like court is a very drastic move when it seems as though you haven't really had open lines of communication about the money. Speak to her plainly and ask her if she intends to pay you back? Remind her that the money was a loan, and that the original expectation was to be paid back. If she is struggling, discuss a payment plan with her - say, could she pay back $50 a week? Have a good, open discussion about it. Stress to her that family and relationship is what is most important to you, and that you are trying to settle the matter in a way that preserves relationship. It seems that once the lines of communication are open, you will find out her intentions and will be able to solve it. If not, perhaps sitting down to a meeting with a mediator present would be helpful. Court should really be the last option - taking your sister to court would most likely destroy your relationships, and trust me, over the span of a lifetime, relationship is more important than money.

If you need your W-2, contact your employer.

Your AGI is required as it will serve as your electronic signature. If you do not have access to last years return you can ask the IRS agent for your AGI from '07 tax year.<br>  <br>  I recommend taxslayer.com $9.95 for both fed & state e-file.<br>  <br>  Here is the  phone number for the IRS: 1-800-829-1040 7am-10pm (your local time)<br>  <br>  You can find your tax board phone number in the white pages or online.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	You may want to call whomever you were employed by some company's offer them online so that you maybe able to download them yourself.

You never know who will really get that email, or if you've even emailed the actual store (or whatever) or their corporate office.  If you wanna know whether they're hiring or not, the best thing to do is to either go up to an employee and ask them (though sometimes, they might be very judgemental of you at first sight and tell you no just because they don't want to work with you, I've seen this happen) or you can call the place and ask them. If anything, it's usually better to speak to a manager. <br>  <br>  I think calling is the best option because in most places, the people that are designated to answer phones are not just "regular employees" but people with better knowledge and power, overall, if not managers that would definitely be glad to help you with your inquiry.

iXgZHsXsaa	While many of us will recognize a good, well-thought-out marketing campaign when we see one, the single, basic truth about world-class marketing campaign development is that it is easy to say, but hard to do. It is hard to do because we all like to take short-cuts. I hear the lament all too often: "I'm over-worked don't have the time to think strategically" or "Planning is overrated. I just need to get these projects done." As a result, we take short-cuts like "ready, fire, aim." Lack of planning is the slippery slope that leads to wasteful marketing. Then one day we get the call from the corner office to come and explain why our marketing efforts did not produce the desired results.<br>  <br>  Luckily, architecting world-class campaigns is achievable for any marketing team. Successful marketing requires following a disciplined, systematic approach to working cross-functionally and cross-regionally in order to prioritize marketing objectives, design a customer-engaging go-to-market strategy, and execute the plan.

You will be a dependent of your husband, and he will be the one claiming you as a dependent. If neither parent is claiming you now, and you work and only claim yourself, you'll want to look into either filing jointly as a married couple, or filing separately but as a married couple.<br>  <br>  Look, you're 20 years old.

kho74FORaa	The ole bait and switch strikes again! Okay, so you were told one thing but find out later that what you though was ok is now not ok. Did you look at the lease and make any mention about a cat when you signed? If you did and he said yes, then what you have is a verbal contract. If someone else was with you when you signed the lease and mentioned this, that is even better for you. Best bet is to bring up the matter with the person that you heard that a cat was ok to have. Nobody else!! Just that person. You then can play on his sympathy and tell him that you thought his word was good and assumed without reservation that the need for the mention of pets was understood and not needed in the contract, But, bottom line is this: you signed a contract that probably said nothing about pets. If that is the case, then your rights are more toward your favor as if there is no pet policy mentioned in the lease, then you have a strong argument in your favor. If there is a pet policy in the lease then shame on you for not reading before you signed such a important item. Don't ever do this again without making sure that what you talked about and agreed to outside any contract, is then written in the contract. This is just good business practice and no renter or business person will think ill about asking that it be put in writing. It protects both parties. Good Luck!|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	As a college student, my advice is to forget the cat until you graduate and get a place of your own that is more permanent.<br>  <br>  As a landlord, I can write a book on how much damage pets cause and a $500 deposit isn't going to replace $3K in carpet or $6K in hardwood floors...sure, you can sue the tenant, but you'll never recover that kind of money.<br>  <br>  I have been in ONE house in my entire life where they had a cat and you wouldn't know it the second you walked in the door...the person that I couldn't tell actually had an OCD behavior and cleaned out the litter box up to 10x per day.<br>  <br>  If your lease says no, then the answer is no.<br>  <br>  90% of landlord's won't take pets...don't make things harder on yourself by burdening yourself with an animal.<br>  <br>  College is hard enough.|`|vCePK8gMaa	If the lease you signed does not allow pets, then you cannot get a cat.

9XCc0Q7oaa	Ok, now. <br>  <br>  Social Worker, Psychologist, Psychiatrist are jobs of the same nature. Among the three of them, I would chose Psychology and I explain why:<br>  - Social workers make less money than psychologists and psychiatrists<br>  - Becoming a psychiatrist means that you need to study medicine first, which requires many years of studies. Psychiatrists also deal with more "severe" mental cases, which can be hard on you and your emotional state and generaly have a hard impact on your every day life if you are an emotional person.<br>  - Taking into consideration your love for kids, you can be a child psychologist, or something relevant, such a speech therapist (someone who helps young children with speech disorders and learning disability, often associated to mental or physical problems).<br>  <br>  I would not suggest becoming a politician, unless you have a very hard stomach :). This is a very harsh thing to do. Anyway, if you decide that at any point of your life that you are interested in politics, you can become a politician regardless of your profession.<br>  <br>  You also need to estimate your skills and talents. Are you a good communicator? Do you like theoretical couses? Do you like speaking in public? Would you enjoy having to wear a suit every day? If the answer is "yes", then becoming a lawyer or judge could be the answer. You can join a debate team and find out more about your skills...<br>  <br>  I would also suggest a career in urban/city/community planning, if you enjoy everyday and more casual communication with people. It is also more suitable for you if you have an artistic nature and you like math, economics and sociology. It is a very rewarding occupation, because you design places with the vision of creating a better environment for people to live, making schools, public buildings, roads etc, and all this actually becomes a reality (for more info check <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos057.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos057.htm</a> ).

Some contracts have you make no payments..some have a minimum of payments..but there is a time frame..let's say it's a 5 year balloon.  That means in 5 years the balance of the loan is due.  It is called a balloon because typically it is a HUGE amount of money to come up with at one time.  You can make tiny payments..but then you owe this one big payment. Usually these are found in creative real estate deals where the buyer has to refinance or find another way to finance the property at the end of the balloon term.  My parents had one in the 1980's.

PxoKseAiaa	Was your house foreclosed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac? There are some new things in place, where they will let you rent your house until it is sold.  Also, the realtor should have offered you an *incentive* (some money) to vacate if you left the place broom clean.  <br>  <br>  If you continue to stay there without those two options above, expect the realty company or whomever owns the house now to file formal eviction papers.  This process could take a month maybe a bit longer, but you will be forced to move regardless of your inability to finance a move.

Once bankruptcy is declared the common shares will go to zero at some point. An example is Kmart. A few years ago they went bankrupt. Once they emerged from reorganization, the common shares became worthless and they issued new common shares. The new shares surged to over $100 but those holding the original shares got nothing.

SohrsIBoaa	when your an EMT, you are considered BLS. Basic Life Support. They teach you cpr, how to use an AED, they teach you how to bandage wounds, stop bleeding. How to document your paperwork. how to splint, immobilize body parts, including the spine and neck. They teach you how to treat gun shots, stabs, or objects inpaled in the eyes. All different kinds of stuff. I did it not being too interested in it, and now i love it. Its a life changing experience. Down part is, you do see a lot of death. You learn to live with it though, you learn that death is a part a life, a very sad part, but a part indeed. I loved being an EMT-B so much, I'm now an EMT-P. I live in jersey, trust me on this, its completely worth it. join a volunteer squad and have them pay for your classes.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	EMT is low-man on the totem pole, but it's where you have to start. (ECA's are lower but you can skip that).  EMT's are considered to be on a basic level so you learn nothing but the basics.  You learn how to apply emergency dressings, stop arterial bleeding,  do CPR, splint broken bones, when and when not to use oxygen, and mainly serve as assistant to the Paramedic.  EMT-Intermediate (or whatever it's called nowadays) is the next class you can take but you have to be an EMT first for a length of time.  Technically (unless things have changed) you can also skip this class and jump right into Paramedic, but it would make your Paramedic training a lot easier if you went ahead and took the EMT-I first.  In EMT-I, you learn how to start IV's, how to intubate, how to triage a patient, you learn some pharmacology, how to defibrillate, and some basic EKG rhythm interpretations.  The next step is Paramedic where you learn how to decompress a pneumothorax, perform an emergency cricothyroidotomy, push drugs, interpret EKG readings, start IV's (both the regular way, and in the jugulars), defibrillation and cardioversion.....and the list goes on.  Before taking the EMT class, it would be wise to go ahead and familiarize yourself with the things I listed above (the ones that are specific for EMT's) by reading up on it.  At this point in your training, you wont need any math or pharmacology skills.  The rest of it is hands-on training and will have to be done in the class room.  As part of your EMT training, you will have to do an "internship" on an ambulance but the school will set all that up for you.  It's extremely frightening to be strapped in the back seat of an ambulance racing to your very first call....you have NO idea what to expect and your mind goes blank.  Yes, you will see a lot of death during your ambulance career, and a lot of visions that will give you nightmares but, in all honesty, probably only one in about every 20 calls is a "bad" one.  Living in New York however, those odds may increase since the crime rate and traffic congestion is higher there than where I live.  My very first call was a fatality where a guy drove into the back of a lumber truck and ended up with a 2x4 through his head.  I was scared 1/2 to death, but I did OK.  Everyone was barking out orders and the scene was pretty chaotic so I just kept my head and did what I was told.  If I can give you ONE very valuable piece of information, it would be to DEFINATELY rummage all through that ambulance on your first day, and EVERY day, until you know exactly where everything is located.  You WILL be the go-fer, and everyone will depend on you to find what they need quickly.  Even as a student, no one is going to get upset if you rummage around in the ambualnce.  In fact, it may show them that you actually care enough to take the initiative, and are smart enough to know what you'll be responsible for knowing.  Dont be bashful about it.  It will be your job to know.

h8l1H4N4aa	No, you can give it on any date but be aware, most landlords will probably charge you for the remainder of the month.  If you give notice on the 15th of march and move out the 15th of april, he/she could legally have you pay off the two remaining weeks.  Even if you do this on the 26th day of each month, they can ask for the three or four days worth of rent.  One of our landlords figured out our remainder when we left 8 days before the end of the month!  Another let us slide when we moved out on the 10th of the month.  Depends on the landlord and how detailed your lease is.|`|SohrsIBoaa	anytime. have a written one signed just in case!|`|eulMjLtPaa	You can give it at any time, unless the language of the lease is different.|`|vCePK8gMaa	It depends on the state in which the rental is located.<br>  <br>  Laws vary.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most states require the notice include one full rental month notice. The notice must coincide with the end of a rental month. <br>  <br>  EX: If the landlord or tenant give notice on February 15, the notice is not effective until March 1st and the tenant is liable for the rent until March 31st.<br>  In this case, the tenant is liable for the full month of rent through the termination date.<br>  <br>  California (and a few other states) allow the 30 day notice to be given on any day of the month. If the landlord or tenant give notice on February 15th, the tenant would be liable for the prorated rent for the next 30 days - until February 17th.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Typically, it has to be a calendar month; ie: given on the first of the month to move on the first of the following month or the 30/31st of a month in order to move by the end of the month.  Gotta be careful giving it on the 10th or 15th and then thinking you can get away with not paying rent for the following month.  Let's say you gave notice Feb 15 that you would be out March 15 ( oh the Ides of March! LOL ) the chances that the landlord would say you still owe rent for the entire term of March are pretty great.  Try to give your notice on the last day of a month or first day.  Do it in writing (certified mail works great) so that you have a paper trail.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	It doesn't matter that the lease is a standard beginning to end of month. The landlord/tenant may give a 30 day notice at any time because the 30 days will follow no matter what time of month the notice is given.<br>  <br>  If notice is given mid-month, either a partial rent payment can be negotiated or a refund given by the landlord if they prefer the full amt be paid. I personally prefer to negotiate a pro-rated rent & only pay for actual time in the property.|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	30 days means 30 days
Ns6I7MmBaa	If do not have a lease (or lease expired) and you pay monthly, you are typically considered a month to month tenant and rent for a full month is due the same day every month.<br>  <br>  Whether you get anything back if you move out before the end of the month may depend upon state/local landlord tenant laws, or how nice your landlord is.|`|JiRa3lgkaa	if that happens/d<br>  will usually leave by the end of that month, so they won't pay for the other month|`|eVYhqaXDaa	You will need to check the law in your state but, <br>  1. In month-to-month arrangements, accepting payment of rent is considered leasing for the month. That is, if the landlord accepts a full month's rent on the 1st, he is agreeing to allow the tenant to stay the entire month regardless of any notice to vacate. <br>  2. Even on month-to-month arrangements, the landlord is usually required to give advance warning of changes in terms. So the landlord is probably not allowed to say on the 15th, "I'm only going to rent to you for two weeks next month.<br>  <br>  So unless the state is very tenant unfriendly/landlord friendly, if a landlord gave notice on 2/15 that he wanted you to vacate, you are probably safe until 3/31. 2/15 is most likely not adequate notice to change the terms for March. Once he accepts payment for March, you cannot be made to move before the end of the month.<br>  <br>  But once again, look up leasing laws in your state.|`|tTCBTqVfaa	You have to give your landlord a months notice that YOU'RE moving, so a month after you tell him, you're in the clear..Regardless if you pay him or not.|`|nf6aqR1Haa	Yes the tenant would still have to pay for the other 15 days.

Ch9TedMcaa	Yes, its called the manager.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	No, it is not necessarily true that one person makes a decision such as this.<br>  <br>  Even Mom and Pop operations have two people ready to bicker about every little business decision.<br>  <br>  If it is a franchise operation, then that would be decided by the owners. If it is a corporation, the decision would be made by the CEO, who would probably have to confer with the Board of Directors -- they represent the owners. <br>  <br>  Certainly no business is going to want to shut down if money can be made, unless the owners generally agree to observe a sabbath of some sort or have a day in the week that produces losing gross sales.

Banks will generally only consider you if your score is around 680 or higher, and you cant have any debts that are currently in collections.  Some mortgage companies will loan you money regardless of your past but they are what's called "predatory lenders".  Their home loans, in the long run, will end up costing you about double the actual amount you bought the house for because their interest rates are much higher.  And a lot of them want you to sign on for an Adjustable Rate Mortgage and will try to make you believe it will be easier for you.  Once you sign the bottom line, they couldnt care less what happens to you or your family, as long as they get thier commision.  Read up on it.....get one of those "Dummies" books, like "Buying a house for Dummies", and find out what you'll need to know.  There are different types of loans, different steps you can take to make the process cheaper for yourself, and about a million ways you can be screwed if you dont know what you're doing.|`|ycJhCP2haa	looking to get a home loan for you...don't worry its better for you to try for an online loan.i think that the below website will help you to find right solution.

Fill out and mail your application by the closing date (even if you mail it on the closing date, that's acceptable).<br>  <br>  Depending on how many people respond, you'll get a notice as to when to take a test and it's location. If you pass, you'll be put on a list and when/if there's an opening, called for an interview. Again, depending on the state, some lists are active for a few years, i.e. 3 or 4.<br>  <br>  Appointeds are interviewed and if accepted, hired. Keep in mind with this classification, if there are layoffs, appointeds are usually the first to go, followed by "last in, first out" with Competitives (or depending on the union's bylaws or state agency).<br>  <br>  Good luck

A starting point is 25%-but I have seen 80% when it was paid in one payment.|`|AA10047588	Depends on your income too.  I cant speak for for-profit institutions, but community hospitals have charity care accounts where they write off some or all of a patient's bill depending on their financial status.  eg. for someone who's making twice the poverty limit, they may write off 100% of charges, and one who is making 3 times may get a 75% discount.<br>  <br>  They also generally have "quick pay" and other such discounts for people who pay out of their pocket because (barring copays, deductibles) hospitals only get a very small percentage of what they bill from the insurance companies.  It's not uncommon that they get only 30 cents on the dollar, so their fee structures are inherently inflated, and they will be willing to settle for less than 100%.<br>  One other thought - most hospitals also accept a payment plan, and again, while not typical, it's not unheard of for someone who owes $5 grand to be on a plan where they pay $25/month, with no interest accumulating.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	You can negotiate any such bill downwards to a level which the hospital would normally accept from one or more insurers.  As well, some charges are 'more negotiable' than are others.  Contact the hospital billing department and inquire as to what they would accept.  However, be prepared to pay the negotiated amount either in full, or in two quick payments.  The hospital will not negotiate much if you want to pay $200 a month until it's paid off.<br>  <br>  If you can't make an acceptable arrangement and do not pay the bills, expect legal action by the hospital to collect what is owed.|`|5aKUV5afaa	I see no point in paying medical bills.

c9a3d9dca5392c96cefc139c2c2ceaddaa	If you study hard you can make money in stocks, or if you just get really really lucky.|`|qxkk9xX4aa	Buffet simply found great companies. Bought them at fair prices. <br>  <br>  I make huge returns, bigger than the 20% Warren earns year average. I make roughly 10-15% a month. Take it I've only done it 2 years. It's not about being great with numbers, it's about understanding a business. A successful hot dog vendor isn't great at numbers but his business is easy to understand. Find something you can understand and learn the ins and outs of reading financial statements. Make your decisions based on the actions of the company, not what you hear. <br>  <br>  Times like this are the biggest opportunities to make money.<br>  <br>  Warren simply did it through compounding his earnings/interest over the course of a long time.<br>  <br>  BTW. I do covered calls on stocks I like to own. Look into it. You can average 10-15% return on your money every month in these volatiles markets if you do it right.|`|lhhgXNxRaa	Well, yes you can hope to make good money but there is no guarantee for it. Stock market, like many other investment vehicles, may lose its value completely. Do not play with stock market if you're afraid to lose the money, since you can lose money in stock market. However, you can also make money from stock market. With the wild swing in stock market these days, you can make or lose a lot of money in hours or days. <br>  I once lost a lot, and make a lot, and lost it again. You just have to know when to stop, and when to start buying again. If not, you'll end up losing your shirts.<br>  The other thing you should note is that the amount of money you gain will be a percentage of the amount you're investing. If you invest $500 only, you cannot expect to make $1 million in a month or so, but you can make at least 20-30% if you play it carefully. And you could play it again and double the amount easily. Remember, buy low sell high, do not buy high sell low.<br>  Well, it's easier said than done of course.
MKuDawP7aa	I would defintaly look him up. This is the website I use (in source) Also try to consult a lawyer and before you do anything let him set-up a good contract.|`|dcb0c032d3b6c037f3cfdb4dac72663eaa	Check to see if there any lawsuits against him. Ask to see his tax returns for the last couple of years.  See if he would mind if you have a look at his (hopefully certified) financial statements.  The goal of all this is to see if he is actually clearing enough profit to pay you a salary and contribute the employers share of social security tax (if you're in the US).  It's fine that he's highly regarded but with the current downturn, will he be keeping his contracts? All the best to you both!! I love success stoies.
zFsTSrOcaa	It's a scam.<br>  <br>  The "certified check" is fake.  The scammer wants you to deposit the check and send the extra amount to the "shipper" (himself).  When the check is found to be bogus, you're still out the money that went to the "shipper."<br>  <br>  I'll bet he wanted the "shipper" to be paid via Western Union or MoneyGram, too, since it's much harder to undo the transaction.|`|71fdc65a048e11ac79a34e44367969e5aa	When you get the "check" take it to the police!

1TpNDufAaa	nothing is ever certain but the PO hasn't laid anyone off yet. Could you be excessed? That's more likely. Are you willing to take a job in another station? How far away? When they do excess they try to keep it within 50 miles of your current station or home to avoid relocation costs I believe.<br>  <br>  You don't say where in the country you live and work. That could also play a part in what happens.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	Rumors are just that: rumors. Nothing factual or concrete and in this day and age, rumors like that cause people to freak out. <br>  <br>  The only concrete "truth" if you will is by talking to your manager or talking with HR. More than likely there's no rhyme or reason on who gets laid off. Sometimes it the low-paid jobs that go first, sometimes its the supervisor/manager positions. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a "recession-proof" job, turn the hospital. The baby-boomers are reaching the age where they will be flooding the hospitals and increasing workload more.|`|5OH4XPaIaa	I would say start looking for another job just in case, so you have a plan B. And you might want to talk to your boss about this rumor going around.
qxkk9xX4aa	Okay, wow... 100% isn't hard. I average 10% a month. Compounded it comes out to almost 3 X in one year which is 300%.<br>  <br>  Formula is...<br>  <br>  8,000 X 1.10(110%)^12(to the power of 12 months)= 25,120<br>  <br>  Look into selling covered calls. It's options. Basically you buy and own the stock. Sell an option for someone else to buy your stock. Like a renter would pay extra for the right to buy the house after X amount of time.<br>  <br>  In these times, you can get 10%+ for every covered call. It gives you money for owning the stock and it protects a good chunk of your downside.<br>  <br>  There is always risk, but it's only a gamble when you don't assess your risk. Do your homework. Learn about covered calls. It's my bread and butter.|`|xkz8Logfaa	I suspect all credit card rates will be at least on 14%. We can see some credit card companies already doing that like Capital One, Citigroup  and others.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you invest in other used cars? You have a better chance of getting that amount of return by buying and selling products yourself.|`|QKT7GrwYaa	I would immediately put half towards your credit card debt.  Actually I would put about 80% towards debt, and 20% in the market.  If you think you are going to double your money, you will probably end up losing most of it.  Invest in a company that makes the products that you know and love and can't live without - even in a terrible economy.  That will be a good investment.  Good luck.

t2pMn6Mtaa	Frankly, your bank's directors and executives need to come down from their 'Eiffel Tower' into the real world. It is ridiculous to set such arbitary targets. If the order to ' come up with an idea, once a month, to either save costs, improve efficiency, or improve service' was theirs it reflects their thinking - cost saving ahead of improved (customer) service. This will then permit larger salary packages, bonuses and perks for them.    A well trained, happy workforce is a company's most valuable asset. Surprisingly it never appears on a balance sheet. If the workforce did appear there, those in the 'Eiffel Tower' may give them more consideration.  With proper training, encouragement, and rewards workers could be looking for ways to improve what is done, and how it is done as a matter of course.      One of the best ways to improve customer service is to empower the people who take the calls. Many years ago, this was done in a large telecommunications company.     The new managing director decided that when a customer telephoned with a problem that the person taking the call would be the one to fix it. A further requirement was that the matter should be resolved to the customer's satisfaction at the time of the call. His personnel were trained to do this and given the power to make decisions on the spot. The matter did not have to be referred up the 'chain of command'.      That company's performance and growth improved dramatically over the next few years. Sadly, this situation changed when the managing director moved to another company.
AbEH0uOLaa	The IRS typically says 3 weeks.  However, in prior years, it only took about 10 - 15 days.  This year, there seem to have been some delays and it seems to be taking closer to the 3 weeks to get the refund back.
