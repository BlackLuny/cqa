uctxzjIIaa	SquareSoft was the American branch of Square Co. Ltd., the Japanese company responsible for the Final Fantasy franchise.<br>  <br>  However, Square fell on hard financial times about 5 years ago, largely due to the movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Enix, Square's main competition and creator fo the Dragon Quest (or as it was known outside Japan for a long time for legal reasons, Dragon Warrior) franchise, took the opportunity to offer a "merger". Considering the terms of the deal, it was more a buyout than a merger, but in business (particularly in Japan), appearances mean a lot, so they called it a merger. After some negotiating of the terms, Square managed to get their shareholders to agree, and the two companies became one, called SquareEnix.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I'm pretty sure that "SquareSoft" was the old name and that they changed it to "Square Enix".|`|eGnNEmmyaa	well square enix was just called square at a point but then they bot bought over and changed to square enix

bKEQMaNDaa	Here's five easy (and TOS-compliant) ways to rake in the moolah. <br>  1. Get some greedy professions. If I could tell people two things about professions, I would say: always take First Aid asap, and, if you want to make money, get herbalism and skinning. Those two, skinning especially, are your best bet at making tons of cash on the Auction House. Leather is used by almost all the professions (not just leather workers), and as any alchemist will tell you, even though Silverleaf literally grows on trees, there's never enough of it around to make the potions you need. Some people will say enchanting or mining, but for the first, I'd rather auction my green items off seperately, and in the second case, well, maybe that's just my personal taste. Mining seems to sell well on the AH, too. And speaking of the AH,<br>  <br>  2. Get real familiar with the Auction House. Don't ever sell anything to a vendor unless you really, really need the space in your bags, because even stuff that seems worthless to you can usually find a buyer on the AH. Twinkers are looking for good low level items all the time, and even fish scales are used by Shamans as reagents. If you're serious about making gold, you've probably already done this by now, but make yourself a level one alt, get him or her to a city with an auction house, and park them there, then mail things to them from your other characters. One more note about the Auction House...<br>  <br>  3. Get Auctioneer. This is a no brainer-- if you haven't heard of this wonderful addon yet, then it's no wonder you don't have your mount. Once you've installed it, run to the nearest AH, let it do a scan, and boom, you've got all the AH prices cached on your computer. Then, when you're out in the world, you've got exactly what every single item in the game should sell for. Plus, when you have things to sell, Auctioneer will tell you the best price to put your items at so they'll sell and you'll make money. Usually, you can sell a little higher than the price Auctioneer puts your items at (especially in the high levels, this can squeeze you a few more gold), but there's nothing easier than just throwing all your extra stuff on the AH, and letting Auctioneer set them up for you. And having Auctioneer around will help you...<br>  <a href="http://www.usfine.com/World-of-Warcraft-USA-c-51.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usfine.com/World-of-Warcraft-...</a><br>  4. Look for deals everywhere. Don't ninja anything, but there's no shame in casually announcing, as your party makes their way to SM, that you're saving for your mount, and so you'll be rolling on everything that no one needs. When you get quest rewards, most of that stuff is soulbound, so if you're offered a choice of two things you can't use as a reward, always take the most expensive item. And watch vendor prices, too-- every once in a while, Traveling Salesman Antonio Perelli (or any of the other NPC vendors) will be selling a potion that's selling for a few gold more on the AH.<br>  <br>  5. Play! Finally, the best way to conjure up more gold also happens to be the best way to conjure up experience-- get out there and kill stuff. Any looting at all is better than standing around Orgimmar telling Chuck Norris jokes. Of course, you should choose where you're killing stuff, too. If you're just grinding for XP, pick humanoid mobs-- they drop much more money, and usually better items. And if you can get a group together, an instance run is (literally) a goldmine for hard-to-find items.<br>  <br>  But above all, the best way to make a lot of gold quickly is just to have fun playing the game. Do what you want, enjoy it, and before you'll know it, you'll have the epic mount you so desperately desire. Just in time to start saving for flying mounts...
cB5aBE0Eaa	Well, if your a big fan of the Halo games, then yes. In my opinion, the game isn't that good, but if you have money to spare you might want to buy or at least rent it.|`|UVdRnx8Faa	It doesn't matter f your a fan of the Halo Games it is nothing like the other games...the demo was crappy it is a complete different games than the old ones.

nLQhosrSaa	If you're talking about trading it to Gamestop or EB, they'll probably give you $60 tops for that.  I'd just keep the PS2.  Also, only the older PS3's can play PS2 games.  The newer ones can't.  To be honest I'd just buy a 360, its half the price.<br>  <br>  And think about it.  Why would they give you a brand new $400 system for an old $100 system?  That would be bad business.|`|ppeZ1CO8aa	no.and i don't think you can trade it it for a ps3.|`|yimJgNfcaa	I dont know about the trad-in thing, but the backwards compatability is depending on the model:<br>  <br>  The older Ps3 had a processer that took more power and was louder, but it had backwards compatibility<br>  <br>  the newer one take about a third of the power (i think) and is quieter, but no backward compatibility..|`|UVdRnx8Faa	No you cant they are two different models and the os2 is old you will get like 60 for it.

To be honest with you, with the cost that repair is going to be, you would be better off getting a brand new one.  system alone it isn't THAT far over that amount, and you'd be starting with a brand new warranty and everything.

jK1JfOehaa	Do this, my friend taught me this trick.  Open the CD while it's in the drive, explore it.  Find the install file and copy it, then paste it into the Starcraft folder in your hard drive.  Then go to Control Panel, click folder options, and uncheck Hide extensions for known file types in the View tab.  Rename the install file in your hard drive to Starcraft.mpq, then play!  You can do this with Brood War too, just rename the install file to BroodWar.mpq.|`|lfWRmBAkaa	She's wrong.

ysiE6IDjaa	Where did you get the Warlokk body mesh from? I'm a bit confused as to whether its a clothing mesh or a mesh needed for the skin tone. Were there specific installation instructions on the download page?<br>  <br>  As far as skin tones go, it is possible to change the skin tones of existing Sims but it is fairly tricky.<br>  <br>  One way is to use SimPE's Sim Surgery option. Clone the sim whose skin you want to change. Change the skin tone on the cloned sim in Body Shop and make a new copy. Then go into the game, create that copy, and exit. Use SimSurgery to apply the skin tone from the new copy to the old sim.

Ditch Taillow and catch a zubat which can be found in cave on dewford island. It is much better and has higher speed. Hard to level up at first but worth it. 2. Lotad is not a bug pokemon its a grass Pokemon but he's pretty good though. 3. Congratulations you caught a Ralts it will help you dominate the Elite four if used properly. 4. Good water type would be Staryu which you can catch when you get to Lilycove City by fishing. As far as you poocheyna you ARE wasting your time it sucks. I think you should put time into raising slakoth because it evolves into an INSANELY powerful Pokemon despite the fact that it can only attack every other turn. Hope I helped.|`|NHD989kvaa	one really good bird is your Taillow let it evolve & it'll grow to be strong<br>  <br>  for Psychc you should also raise your Ralts because it eventually evolves into Gardeviour & you should get your hands on a Abra! <br>  <br>  also let Torchic evolve into Blazekin! it'll rock then! one pokemon you must get is a Sableye! that thing is worth raising! <br>  a few other good ones are Aron, Meditite, & Geodude!<br>  and about Poochyena, it's pretty good so I think you are doing the right thing, and Slakoth same thing<br>  <br>  this are  just recommendations, i hope this helps you :)

BUT if you have a Johto starter on an Emerald/Ruby/Sapphire game, then yes, you can migrate them over. To do this you need to have defeated the Elite 4 and have the National Pokedex, thus activiating a small place in the bottom left of the map where you can catch the pokemon you migrated over. But FYI, once you migrate a pokemon over from RSE can't ever get it back. So choose carefully! ;)|`|CJLyWr9jaa	go to <a href="http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-dp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-dp/</a> and it should tell you how to get the pokemon you want. it helps me a ton.|`|nZynoCVKaa	put the game in the ds and on the home screen it should say transfer

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  Halo wars is seriously one of the most pathetic RTS I have seen developed. The lack of detail in environments was astoundingly sad..The combat looked increaing repetitive when I watched real gameplay footage..the type of warships and units where dull in appearance, lacking variety...Overall it looked like a piece of [profanity].  After many companies reviews,  7.5 seemed to be the average, which is by no means a perfect game.. The "depth" of the storyline is strikingly shallow and boring. Generally, any console RTS is destined to be a failure. Microsoft is relying on the idiotic 'Halo market' to adopt this game as one of the classic series, even though it deserves no such position. I'm sure if you download te demo you'll be thoroughly disappointed. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Empire: Total War has received fully positive feedback, with the lowest review ranking stated as 9/10. The campaign map has massive improvements both in the size of the globe, and building options. Naval battles have finally been introduced with fantastic impressions - the realism with wind direction and boat movement is phenomenal. Cannon fire is also awesome, along with the ability to board ships. Land battles have been redefined hugely - ranged and melee combat are now equally important....Plus, believe it or not..the AI actually employs tactics! Graphical changes are among the most noticeable - there's complex and breathtaking surroundings in battle mode. A tech tree has been created, where you research technologies, giving you access to unique training units or social/economic benefits. If you want to try the "Empire: Total War" demo out, you'll need to download it from Steam - I bet you it will be great.<br>  <br>  I could continue typing for ages, but I want to give you a concise summary. My recommendation is to purchase Empire: Total War over Halo Wars with no exception.<br>  ______________________________________...|`|gTDzR23jaa	I think the guy in my sources sums it up perfectly:|`|FbJvbjHyaa	If you have played halo before and you like civilization games, than i recommend halo wars, if not, go ahead and get empire total war ;)|`|BXOOnxXgaa	If you like Sci-fi RTS  Halo Wars<br>  If you like revolutionary RTS, then Empire: Total War|`|nZynoCVKaa	if u have played halo b4 then u should know 2 get it again|`|J0p6r3r0aa	dont get halo wars its gay|`|MHPZrRK6aa	You probably should get Halo Wars if you like startegy games kind of like chess but alot funner.

CYmGQZxUaa	If you want to improve your time, you should go through the level a few times. Then, once you have memorized the level, and know whats coming, you can run the Speed Run challenge. While you are in the challenge, try to sprint as much as possible, and to keep on sprinting, don't make really tight turns, keep it smooth. Also, the memmorization of the level will stimulate your brain and will help you know what is coming. Don't not know what is coming.

ER3DRi1Raa	Well... I actually was going to suggest Halo 3... and I think I might have actually said Gears of War 2 also! But besides that, I suggest checking out Rock Band 2, great game for nearly everyone in my opinion. Large variety of songs and enjoyable alone, with friends, and online. I also like to play an XBOX 360 download called, "Castle Crashers." Not sure if they are their types of games, so here are some links:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Crashers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Cras...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/c/castlecrashersxboxlivearcade/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/c/castle...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rockband.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockband.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hope they have a great time like I've had playing them.<br>  <br>  Edit: I've noticed someone said Guitar Hero Metallica. Thing is, the last Guitar Hero game made by the company wasn't very good, Rock Band 2 (which was made by another company) was much better. I was severly disappointed with the GHWT set. I've heard the drums were junk, my guitar from the set broke in about a week and the song list is short and sucks. I also want to say that the lag was terrible, couldn't even finish a song I beat on RB2 which was on that game.<br>  <br>  ........and yes, Call of Duty World at War is great, but as far as I can tell, they don't want an FPS (First Person Shooter.)|`|iCEsvmOXaa	awww halo is awesome... But do you know what kind of game she might like?

d3XtExfyaa	UPDATE 3<br>  There is a patch out for HAWX as of 9:00 PM Central Time.  Access the software and you will be prompted to download the update.<br>  UPDATE 3<br>  <br>  UPDATE 2<br>  New communication with Ubisoft:<br>  Jack,<br>  <br>  This is a known issue that the developers are aware of. We expect an update for the game to become available tonight or early tomorrow to correct the problem.<br>  UPDATE 2<br>  <br>  UPDATE!!!!!!!<br>  I just contacted Ubisoft.  They are aware of the connection problems with the HAWX game for Ps3 and are working with Sony to correct the problem.  The person I spoke to on the phone was very short and didn't really want to talk all she said is they are aware of the problem and did not know when or how the problem would be fixed.  When asked what I should do to check for solution she said "Just keep trying to connect."  Wow, what a relief.  That really helps.  Sorry I can't give you more but at least they now know there is a serious problem.<br>  UPDATE!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Me too.  I have tried setting up a static ip address on my Ps3 then set up port forwarding on my router and even setting the Ps3 ip address to DMZ through my router.  Nothing is working.  The HAWX game says Playstation Network available but it just keeps searching for games without ever finding any.  I contacted Ubisoft and they said I should do what I had already done and that it is Sony's problem to deal with.  I will update with anything I find out please do the same.<br>  <br>  Here is what communication I have so far with Ubisoft:<br>  <br>  Jack,<br>  <br>  You will need to contact Sony directly for any questions or problems with the PS3's online service. Sony can be reached at 1-800-352-7669.<br>  <br>  Most network connection problems are not related to a problem with the game, but are caused by different possible network configurations. First, you will need to find out what style NAT (Network Address Translation) the PS3 believes that you are using.<br>  <br>  To check what NAT you are using:<br>  <br>  In the system software, go to: Settings -> Network Settings -> Settings and Connection Status List and the last line on the screen will list the type of NAT you have beside the line, "NAT type".<br>  <br>  - If the NAT type is NAT1, you are directly connect to Internet (which means there is no firewall present)<br>  - If the NAT type is NAT2, your router or firewall is probably correctly configured, more on this below.<br>  - If the NAT type is NAT3, your router or firewall is incorrectly configured for use with the PS3, and you will need to contact your ISP or router/firewall manufacturer for additional assistance.<br>  <br>  If your NAT type is NAT2 or NAT3, we have compiled some general information and links to get you started, but it's still a good idea to contact your ISP or router/firewall manufacturer for additional assistance if you are experiencing problems with network connectivity.<br>  <br>  - From official PS3 online manual: <a href="http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/index_network.html" rel="nofollow">http://manuals.playstation.net/document/...</a><br>  <br>  - If you routinely have problems connecting to other PS3 systems, or with voice chat:<br>  <a href="http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/connecttest.html" rel="nofollow">http://manuals.playstation.net/document/...</a><br>  <br>  - From the PS3 support website<br>  <a href="http://playstation.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/playstation.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=241" rel="nofollow">http://playstation.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/...</a><br>  <br>  - Here a guide made by a user on Sony’s forum for people having NAT3 and using a router<br>  <a href="http://boardsus.playstation.com/playstation/board/message?board.id=psnetwork&thread.id=116102" rel="nofollow">http://boardsus.playstation.com/playstat...</a><br>   <br>   Customer (Jack Price) 03/04/2009 10:51 PM <br>  Also it does say "Playstation Network Available"<br>   <br>   Customer (Jack Price) 03/04/2009 10:28 PM <br>  I am unable to connect to online matches with Hawx. I have given my Ps3 a unique ip address already and can play other games online without problems. Whenever I try to "Join Online Games" the COOP Games window comes up and continues to say "Searching." I have a good connection to the internet and play other games without issue. I even accessed my router settings and set the Ps3 ip to DMZ. I even attempted port forwarding of ports 7790 and 7788 and this did not fix the problem.|`|3JSygw2jaa	Ive downloaded the demo on the PS3 and i cant get online with it either. Shame coz i really like the demo. Bit easy though, i wanted to see if i was good compared to other ppl.

eSevvdnraa	Okay first of all you should go to steam.com get it and if you already have it good. then buy half life 2 because it has most of the data you need since garrys mod is kinda like a mod for HL2. So you say you just want to play it bye yourself, well you can do that but if you get bored of single player, online multiplayer can get really fun. You dont have to be connected all the time, in the garrys mod menu there is the option to play single player, so you can run it independently. Good building fellow gamer!!
D4BVISmCaa	None believes in 13 to be a bad, unlucky number but it is known.

WUQ9dNVbaa	Gameplay, story, characters, multiplayer, replay value, controls. Any game can have good graphics, but sometimes the gameplay is terrible or the replay value isn't great, just depends on the person. As long as the game is challenging in any way then it's a good game. World of Goo is a very interesting game, it's simple, but challenging.|`|Zvv9yc4taa	good graphics and an interesting plot!<br>  Just the fact that the game looks so realistic and the plot is amazing makes you feel so cool that you believe youre IN the game!<br>  <br>  I love my Wii cuz of the grapics and interaction.<br>  And my DS-ditto<br>  AND Sims2 games cuz you can customize (getting even MORE personal-SO fun!)<br>  <br>  I dont know what other type of game that ISNT out there to create!|`|JWjKSg3Zaa	realistic graphics, nice story, violence|`|AhKhQquEaa	great online play and community|`|H7KEJ0Fjaa	A good video game first and foremost consists of good graphics.<br>  <br>  Good graphics are the most important element to any great video game. This also incorporates user friendly controls. For example, Call of Duty is a great game because the controls are basic and anyone can get the hang of it. Whereas other less well known FPSs have more difficult controls, typically where aiming and movement is concerned.<br>  <br>  The second most important element is storyline. Every good video game has a decent storyline to follow. People like uniform chaos. Meaning, I want to run around wildly and blow people's heads off with a purpose.<br>  <br>  The third most important element is uniqueness. The game has to stand out from any other game like it or it will just be another overpriced piece of software on the shelf.|`|Hd4vt5Xgaa	Games with outstanding graphics (Halo 3 or Gears of War 2).<br>  Great Online Gameplay (Halo 2 or Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare).<br>  Intriguing Plot (Halo Trilogy or Gears of War)<br>  Good Cutscenes (Halo Wars or Gears of War)<br>  Strategy a.k.a. smart AI with learning ability (Halo Wars or Starcraft or Warcraft or Command and Conquer)<br>  Co-op with four players (Halo 3) and different gameplays for each person (Gears of War 2) and join and drop out anytime without quitting (Lego Star Wars)<br>  Great Music! (Halo Trilogy, Gears of War Dualogy soon Trilogy!)|`|JkIKYtC9aa	It has to be a game you enjoy playing and will give you a lot of replay value, like online shooters like Call of Duty, Battlefield or like World of Warcraft. When I was little I will look at the packaging and buy it based on that, but now days, I look for video game reviews on different websites to make sure I get the most for my money.|`|9HX04GjSaa	One thing that matters most to me is a damn good story line, decent graphics, and good controls.Mostly it's the story line that makes me wanna buy it.Like Ace combat 5 The Unsung War, I absolutely love that game the story line is so amazing!|`|eMUSTCQfaa	The replay value and the advertising.

Although LimeWire is fairly safe (since I've been using it for over 3 years and I've had no problems) it still can cause viruses, so be aware.|`|AA12328571	I'll give you a great tip<br>  Dont Download It.<br>  <br>  Once you download it, you compromise the security of the computer through viruses,spyware, malware. When you download something, it may not even be what you wanted or a corrupt version  The risks are too high. Take my advice Dont download it.|`|NNDTEv6Oaa	uuum don't that place is full of viruses it's the std of downloaders + there are so many others that are (a tad) cleaner e-mule, ares and a ton of torrent downloaders like utorrent and bittorrent i think i would go with winmx b4 i went with limewire|`|2yJU8wqCaa	Basically make sure that fi your downloading<br>  a music file, make sure its a music file,<br>  ALSO dont download a file that doesnt have bitrate,<br>  and hosts, and make sure that<br>  the file size is on the normal side,<br>  if you follow those,<br>  youll be safe.|`|eSevvdnraa	Be very careful with lime wire because a lot of files have viruses and Trojans, also government is starting to get mental about music right and there cracking down a bit and the internet provider you have could report you if someone says somthing. good luck|`|yVUkHGuoaa	Just be careful. You can pick up alot of spyware and malware if your not careful. You just gotta know what to look for. Like if you are downloading a song, look first off that it is mp3 or wma format. No song should be .exe format. A song is an average of 3,000 kb. So don't download something that is like 15 kb. The more people that have it the better. But usually when you search the first result says something about a girl having an orgasm. DON'T CLICK IT!!!!  Its a virus. So yeah limewire is good but you just gotta be careful. Make sure your fiirewall is running and your antivirus is up to date|`|669bRlkuaa	Two things, make sure you spell the song or file correctly, and two, scan the song or file with your anti virus when you download.  You don't have to scan each individual file, just the "saved file".  Do that before you put them on and ipod or something; malware can harm it.

ZNeadVNXaa	wow, this is a tricky one, but I'm sure I got it. <br>  <br>  First, we have 4 State-Based Triggers, they go onto the stack at the very beginning of your upkeep. They actually resolve LIFO, so ABCD goes on, DCBA resolves in that order. But that's semantics. Assuming you have a sacrifice machine, like Atog or Myr Enforcer, this changes things: <br>  <br>  Each Myr Servitor that returns is treated as a brand new Myr Servitor, with no memory of it's SBT. Also, we're past the point where their ability would trigger again, so no finite loop there. When the other triggers resolve, they fail and do nothing. The max you can get out of your own graveyard is 3. <br>  <br>   I'm a DCI certified Judge and have been for a very very long time.

8f7690c5a71b77159e085fc28935729faa	It's probably because the controller is not recognized by the xbox 360 yet. on top of the controller, by the little thing where you can plug something in on and the left button, there should be a little button that looks like a little antenna is coming out of it. press that, wait for a little bit, and continue to do it until it works. if it doesn't, i can't help you. u should not have to do this every time u turn the xbox 360 on, so from now on it should be connected to that specific xbox 360. (you can use it for another xbox 360 but u will have to do the same process again)

It can play bluray, has a built-in web browser,  and you can even install another operating system on it. You should also keep in mind that Xbox 360s are more likely to break down (red ring). PS3 has full backwards compatibilty (all PS1/2 games work), while a 360 can only play certain Xbox games. Keep in mind that some PS3 models do not have backwards compatibility at all (40GB and the new 80GB models, I believe).<br>  Looking at exclusive titles, PS3 has LittleBigPlanet, Killzone 2, Metal Gear Solid 4, Ratchet and Clank series, and the Resistance games, while 360 has Halo, Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, Beautiful Katamari, and Fable 2 to name a few.<br>  The 360 is cheaper than the PS3.|`|I0M3INjYaa	Go with the xbox 360...maybe I'm a little biased, that thing is like my child! ;-)  The system itself is cheaper, which is nice, yeah you have to pay to play online, but it's only 50 dollars for 13 months, I don't think that's too bad. The xbox live marketplace is pretty cool and all the arcade games you can buy/download. I don't know I just prefer xbox. The plus of getting the PS3, it's practically the best blu-ray dvd player out right now. I don't know, buy one now, get the other later, best of both worlds!|`|jz7HlR3Gaa	ps3|`|9K1Qopmsaa	ps3 all the way buddy its so much better free online and **** <br>  <br>  i hav an xbox360 elite and my bro has a ps3,ps3s are better|`|iOgncguFaa	you have good things and bad things on both<br>  first xbox 360 u cant play the old xbox games trust me i tried it wont let me, then if u dont play it for a long time or play it 2 much it can shut down and then u might have to buy another 1 and have to restart everything, but there is a good thing about it cheaper, fable 2 is good for it, u can do achievements, not free online(that part kind of sucks), good to move around alot bc ps3 is super heavy its like picking up a fat Elephant (na jk  if it was that heavy i wont be here right now or even be typing).<br>  then u got ps3 good games, free online, alot of money but it wont crash like xbox 360, and ur able to save ur ps1, ps2 game on it with out them memory card well i still dont know how to save the ps1 games yet but i do know u can save it on the ps3. to tell u the truth i dont even think there is any bad sides on the ps3 other then it being super heavy but that tells u its a hardcore console =P<br>  <br>  my vote would be ps3 after all u dont have to worry about having it crash on u and u get free online. hope that helps u decide.|`|Tp5r6KF2aa	i am sick of seeing all these which console should i buy questions. all you are trying to do is stir up animosity between those who favor the ps3 vs the 360 or vice versa. everyone has their own preference and their bias is clearly evident in their responses. if you really want an honest answer u are going to hav to do your own research online. i recommend cnet.com because they seem to be pretty fair with their reviews unlike some other sites. come on guys, stop posting these questions where there is no right answer.|`|sT6zG7iYaa	if your all game go with 360<br>  <br>  if you want something a little bit more limitless go with playstation|`|z7lTBWkYaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q7MH1aPTEQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q7MH1aPT...</a>

9RIUENtsaa	The algorithms randomize the languages too much, so one word in Orcish can translate to a thousand different ones in Common, and vice versa. There are certain words, however, that will always translate the same way in both languages, but they're pretty much gibberish and, so thus, can't really be used to say anything (unless you plan it out with the other person, like a type of code). I forget which website I read that at, but, basically, it's useless to try.<br>  However, some words, with the lettering spaced properly, can actually spell it out. I can't count how many times I've seen "I L O V E Y O U" in Orcish. Makes my skin crawl.|`|djNeNEOuaa	Horde / Alliance translators are against Blizzard's EULA and ToU.<br>  <br>  At one time there were translators but blizzard changed the algorithm that was dependent on languages. making it so you can't really translate opposing factions speech anymore. The reason for this is there are thousands of 4 letter english words, while there are only 7-8 4 letter orcish words, meaning kill, flag, stun, fire, move, and them would all show up as uruk.<br>  <br>  There may be a way to do it by editing the warcraft/data file.

88L1UHVZaa	1) MP40. It's shorter range but it's so strong, and has a huge clip.  Use it with aperture if you aim bad with the iron sights. If not then round drum. Bandolier, stopping power, and steady aim<br>  <br>  2) I'd say SVT-40. The Gewehr is accurate but kills in 3-4 hits from full health. SVT-40 is also pretty accurate but kills in 2-3 hits. Aperture or scope (up to you) with whatever you want for perk 1, stopping power or juggernaut, then whatever for perk 3<br>  <br>  3) Trench Gun with bayonet. It's a little less strong but it's longer range by a little and it has more rounds in a clip. The DB shotgun has 2 bullets then you have to reload, which takes a long time. The trench gun doesn't take long at all to reload. Use it with whatever for perk 1, sleight of hand or juggernaut for perk 2, and martyrdom for perk 3<br>  <br>  4) Browning with bandolier, sleight of hand, and probably either steady aim or second chance<br>  <br>  Other classes) FG42 with scope, and bandolier, stopping power, and deep impact.<br>  Also BAR with whatever for perk 1, stopping power or double tap for perk 2, and deep impact for perk 3.

By the look of your team, it seems like you like to be all-out offensive. So I suggest Metagross to replace Magneton, because it is great at attacking but can also be switched into many attacks because of its high defenses. Since your team doesn't fear ice or rock, I suggest a Salamence in the last slot. It looks like most of your team is physical, so Blaziken should have special attacks or be mixed in case you ever run into a physical wall like skarmory.<br>  <br>  I'm not very familiar with the 3rd gen's metagame, so sorry I wasn't more helpful >.>'

eNHGiEvGaa	There is absolutely no such system, and there can be no such system.  You're hunting a chimera.<br>  <br>  This comment is clearly self contradictory: "I KNOW there is no 100% winning system. I'm talking about one that simply hits profits with enough turns - every time."  That is the very definition of a 100% winning system.  It doesn't exist, and you should know it.<br>  <br>  If you can accept and understand a few basic premises, then you'll have to see why this is true.<br>  <br>  1) The spins are random, and therefore unpredictable.<br>  2) The payoff odds are structured to give you a negative expectation on every spin.<br>  3) Your expectation, after any number of spins (n), is equal to that number times the expectation for one spin (e).  Expectation = ne.  e is always negative.  n is always positive.  You must expect to lose over ANY period of time.<br>  <br>  In fact, you must rationally realize that the more you play, the more you lose, period.  How can you expect to find a system to "profit every session," when you actually are expected to LOSE EVERY SESSION.  It's like trying to find a series of negative numbers with a positive sum!|`|y822j5h5aa	NO!<br>  <br>  And if they did the casinos would simply change the rules to prevent it from working or ban it from use, as they have done with Blackajck and Craps in the past.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Dude, you say that you KNOW there is no 100% winning system.  But that's what you are asking about.  One that hits profits with enough spins... that's called a winning system, and you seem to know there is no such thing, yet are asking about one.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	sure.    as you begin to win a few sessions due to variance and then read a book about gambling and learn you can't and then quit the game forever then it is possible.....got it|`|u2slnVCoaa	There is no system like that and no winning systems for roulette|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	no.. but i think roulette as you know has high odds...but no to your question.. and i think the wheels are changed every 24 hours.. not sure in some places|`|f61dd5a82fc41168ba85abfc8bc94b71aa	The only system 'guaranteed' to win every time is the Martingale<br>  where,after every losing bet,you double your stake until you hit a winning bet,in which case you win 1 unit.(which will eventually<br>  occur).<br>  The only flaw with this system is that with a long losing run(30 plus<br>  have been known to occur) the stake required can run into HUNDREDS<br>  of BILLIONS of units in order to win just 1 unit profit,so it's not a practical solution to your question.|`|1GnMZc0Maa	The only way to win money at a game of chance like roulette is to get lucky early on, then quit while you're ahead.<br>  <br>  The more spins you play, the greater the mathematical certainty is that you will lose everything.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	If such a system existed, it would not be sold anywhere since the person who invented said system would have tens of millions of dollars in their bank account from fleecing the casinos. <br>  <br>  But no, no such system does, or could ever, exist.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	Every single spin of the wheel you have a negative expected value so there is absolutely no way that you can win in the long run with roulette unless you were cheating somehow.|`|nQcmAFnyaa	There is no system who will let you win every spin.

Also add in more twin headed behemoths, add a couple double costons, add Tribute doll, drop Swing of memories, add more ancient rules, Also add in more compulsory evacuation devices, and drop trap hole, for bottomless trap hole. Also drop Luster Dragon #2 . Also drop dragon's gunfire.|`|RCUWRan2aa	I'm giving it 6.8/10 for theme's sake. If you're planning a Red-Eyes Black Dragon deck, then it follows you should focus on Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, the most powerful form of Red-Eyes available. A good side is synchro monsters and the extremely powerful Five-God Dragon.<br>  <br>  Monsters (24):<br>  3 x Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon<br>  2 x Prime Material Dragon<br>  3 x Luster Dragon<br>  3 x Red-Eyes Wyvern<br>  3 x Magna Drago<br>  1 x Twin-Headed Behemoth<br>  3 x Masked Dragon<br>  3 x Troop Dragon<br>  2 x Totem Dragon (get it while it's cheap, I'm telling you there's a good chance it may get more expensive in this format)<br>  1 x Morphing Jar<br>  <br>  Spells/Traps (16):<br>  3 x Dust Tornado<br>  1 x Mystical Space Typhoon<br>  3 x Stamping Destruction<br>  1 x Heavy Storm<br>  1 x Giant Trunade<br>  1 x Monster Reborn<br>  1 x Future Fusion<br>  2 x Dragon's Mirror<br>  1 x Torrential Tribute<br>  1 x Lightning Vortex<br>  1 x Mirror Force<br>  <br>  Extra Deck (15):<br>  3 x Five God Dragon<br>  3 x Stardust Dragon<br>  2 x Black Rose Dragon<br>  2 x Red Dragon Archfiend<br>  1 x Goyo Guardian<br>  1 x Thought Ruler Archfiend<br>  3 x Iron Chain Dragon<br>  <br>  Explanation: <br>  <br>  Red-Eyes Black Dragon is powerful (with its support cards, per se) but it's effect counterpart Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon is with no doubt far more powerful, has an easier summoning condition and has an ability to summon any dragon except itself not only from your hand, but also from your graveyard (take that Flute Of Summoning Dragon)<br>  <br>  Red-Eyes Black Wyvern has the ability to revive any "Red-Eyes" monster except itself from the graveyard for the cost of your Normal Summon, not to mention a level 4, 1800 ATK Beatstick.<br>  <br>  Five-God Dragon, let's face it you're not 100% sure that Red-Eyes would hit the field every time, so this 5000 ATK behemoth and with "this card cannot be destroyed by battle except by LIGHT monsters" would surely be a pain of your opponent's head. With Future Fusion and Dragon's Mirror, this card is as easy to summon as Stardust Dragon.<br>  <br>  Morphing Jar, at first glance, Morphing Jar wouldn't fit, I mean it's a rock type and not a dragon. Let me give you a refresher then, Morphing Jar is there for it's draw power and not for it's type, remember that Card Destruction and Magical Mallet would cost you 1 card in your hand no matter where you look like it while Morphing Jar gives you as much as 5 new cards, if played properly.<br>  <br>  Stardust Dragon and the other synchro monsters, If you like Prime Material Dragon's effect, you'll surely love Stardust's it protects your cards from destruction (Spell, Trap and Monsters) by sacrificing itself and returning to the field at the end of turn. This is like an upgraded version of Prime Material Dragon, without the cost and with the spell/trap card protection. The other synchro's are there just in cast you'll need a Defense destroyer (Red Dragon Archfiend), Dark Hole + Heavy Storm combo (Black Rose Dragon) and a super beat stick with the ability to revive your opponent's monsters (Goyo Guardian).<br>  <br>  Ways to easily summon Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon<br>  <br>  1. Activate Future Fusion selecting Five-God Dragon. The fusion materials with at least 1 "Red-Eyes Wyvern" and "Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon". Do not perform a normal summon or set this turn and you can special summon "Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon" at the end of your turn. You can also send 2 "Red-Eyes Wyvern" and 2 "Red-eyes Darkness Metal Dragon" so you can special summon 2 at the end of your turn.<br>  <br>  2. Normal Summon a monster, activate "Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon's" special summoning effect by removing the monster you summoned and placing him immediately on the field (you now have a 2800 ATK beatstick). Activate his second effect to special summon another dragon type monster from your hand or graveyard.<br>  <br>  3. Special summon Totem Dragon from your graveyard and Normal Summon "Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon" from your hand since Totem Dragon can be used as 2 tributes for a dragon type monster.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped

At Disneyland it is considered an "Attraction" and you can get on/off inside the park.  At Disney World is it considered Transportation and all stations are outside of the parks.|`|3N3IXFfhaa	The rides that DisneyLand has That are at Magic Kindom are:<br>  Mad Tea Party <br>  Big Thunder Mountain Railroad<br>  Space Mountain<br>  Splash Mountain<br>  Tom Sawyer Island <br>  Astro Orbitor<br>  Frontierland Shootin' Exposition<br>  Haunted Mansion<br>  Jungle Cruise<br>  Pirates of the Caribbean <br>  Snow White's Scary Adventures<br>  Dumbo the Flying Elephant <br>  "it's a small world"<br>  The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh<br>  Peter Pan's Flight <br>  <br>  The show that Disneyland has at Epcot is: <br>  "Honey, I Shrunk the Audience,"<br>  <br>  Epcot has not rides that Disneyland has, however they also have a finding nemo ride too but it is different than the one at Disneyland. So I would skip it or ride it last after you've gotten a chance to see everything else. Just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Hollywood Studios has:<br>  Star Tours<br>  <br>  I do think this ride is corny anyway.<br>  <br>  Animal Kingdom has:<br>  Enchanted Tiki Room<br>  <br>  which is awesome i love this. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here are some tips to give to you:<br>  I would make a list of all the things the disneyworld parks do have that disneyland does not. then from that list make another list of the top most favorite things you really want to see. because i dont think you'll be able to see everything in Epcot. Magic Kingdom I think you should be able to see everything there since that is the park that has most rides disneyland has. Animal kingdom is 3x bigger than Magic Kingdom. We went here once for the whole entire day. and we werent able to see half of what they had there. so i would definatly make a top list of things to do there for sure. Must sees/dos at animal kindom are: The 3D show It's tough to be a bug. Expedition Everest is amazing, and Primeval Whirl is awesome. Kali River Rapids is very fun bumpy aznd wet. its  a very refreshing cool down from all day in the hot sun. you will get very wet if not soaked. <br>  <br>  <br>  And at Hollywood Studios you must do Toy Story Mania 3D awesomeness,  The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, and most definatly Rockin Roller coaster starring aerosmith. They are the best rides there. <br>  <br>  But yeah tips; get to the park as early as you can to see most. and when you get there earliest as possible do the attractions that are at the back of the park first. there will be hardly anyone there so you'll have super short lines if any at all. and as soon as you get there your park ticket is a fast pass use it first before anything for the most packed attraction example in hollywood studios use it for the rockin roller coaster and tower of terror number one. they are the longest lines and very hard to get a second ride on without fastpass. also fastpass machines run out after so many times. and they closed them down. so use it, its free. also if your staying at a disney hotel/resort you can get extra magic hours, so you can get in before normal park hours and stay later than normal park hours too. and you can get discounts on food as well, usually. and if you want to save some money you are allowed to pack lunches. well i hope i have helped have a magical vacation!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and i almost forgot, the Fantasmic show at hollywood studios is phenomenal. the only thing that sucks about this is you have to get there like 2 hours early to get good seats. or a seat at all. and your not allowed to stand up anywhere good. they have a standing section waaaaaay in the back and you cant really see anything of it.|`|92HR06J2aa	i dont know them all but some that r the same are hollywood tower of terro, pirates of the carribean, haunted mansion thats all im pretty sure about.|`|vpnUTPq8aa	NEVAH!!NEVAH!!NEVAH!!NEVAH!!|`|d60972a141a0ece3ed840882b5123229aa	although there are some similar rides (same names but different ride) there are a few that are the same.<br>  <br>  Muppet's in 3d<br>  Star Tours<br>  Tikki Room<br>  Honey I Shrunk the Audience<br>  Soarin' over california (just called Soarin' now)<br>  Toy Story Midway Mania<br>  It's Tough to be a bug<br>  Jungle Cruise<br>  <br>  Rides that have the same name but have differences<br>  Space Mountain (california is a two by two car *two people sitting next to each other* and florida is a single line. like the matter horn)<br>  Splash Mountain (California is single line and florida is two by two)<br>  Winnie the pooh (different story line, que line)<br>  Haunted Mansion (different order of the scenes)<br>  Pirates (california is longer and has more of a story)<br>  Its a Small World (california just got a face lift with new characters)<br>  Big Thunder Mountain Railroad (they are two different tracks and train styles.<br>  Tower of Terror.(different design. three elevator shoots instead of two. not sure if they have the Random drops)

lbXC4rkEaa	You did it right, and you got the file (the ISO). Each file is just a small piece of the large 3GB file, so when you extract the first one it starts extracting the first piece, then the second piece, then the third piece and so forth. I think the main issue is what to do with the ISO. An ISO is a virtual image of a CD or DVD that needs to be read by a program such as Alcohol.|`|HQl6Smqxaa	Nope. U are not required to extract the other files. The 3gb iso file is actually split up into many many rar files, for the ease of downloading.

xQ8uWheEaa	ok your team is ok...<br>  not that great but you do have some nice pokemon ideas.<br>  <br>  staraptor is a nice pokemon to have in the beginning but when you train it to lv 100, the stats compared to some other birds, like skarmory, just isnt that great. but keeping staraptor is ok. it has great speed and attack, so it can do some damage<br>  <br>  empoleon... umm i am a fan of fire starters but empoleon isnt bad i guess. no starter is "better" than other starters, so you'd do just fine with empoleon.<br>  <br>  ok this is your legendary palkia. palkia has very nice stats and can learn a variety of moves. this is a good pokemon to have. <br>  <br>  umm azlef is not a good pokemon to have. id trade it right away for something else like an eevee evolution. you need a good grass type pokemon so try to get an leafeon, one of eevee's evolutions (evolve by leveling up near a mossy rock)<br>  <br>  umm uxie is the worst pokemon to add in. i know it is one of the three but it has horrible stats and the moves it learns are like torment and punish and wish. they are al attacks that either lower attack or increase stats. not a good pokemon to have in a battling team. if you want a psychic pokemon, go for the old fashion abra and train it to an alakazam. alakazams have very high speed (allows you to go first) and very high special attack (can ko othr pokemon in one hit).<br>  <br>  for the last pokemon i advise you add in an electric or a fire pokemon. you need some variety so you always have a super effective pokemon to in battle<br>  <br>  hope this help kinda :D|`|MFAVIW1waa	Yeah it's alright but i'm guessing you haven't finished the game yet so it's okay to have a team like that.

She had me start by sewing doll clothes for my nieces doll. From there I went on to clothing for myself, my children after I got married & taught my daughter how to sew. My youngest daughter had no interest in it but after she got marrried, she taught herself just by buying a pattern & following the directions. Most patterns I've used have very clear directions. There are plenty of sewing books out on the market that can help you for more difficult things once you advance & the people at your local fabric stores are usually very helpful if you have a question. The only class I ever took was one in tailoring when I got brave enough to attempt making my husband a suit, which turned out great. Start out small & simple & go from there. Good luck & happy sewing|`|q5fqP31taa	Here is a site that has free lessons - <a href="http://sewing.about.com/od/beginner1/bb/sewing101.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sewing.about.com/od/beginner1/bb/...</a><br>  <br>  Here is another site that will teach you (free) how to take accurate measurements and how to read a pattern and pattern envelope  & more  - <a href="http://www.simplicity.com/index.cfm?page=section/classroom/sewingLessons/sewing101part2.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplicity.com/index.cfm?page...</a>|`|lSQsYpBvaa	hello, yes you can learn by yourself, this site have books and free Tutorials you can learn from.<br>  once you have common sense and the ability to read and understand  you can learn .<br>  good luck

5mCm2XTLaa	You apply the base color which in this case it the lightest shade. Then you airbrush in the darker colors. You always apply the color that covers the largest areas first. <br>  <br>  If you don't have an airbrush that you can adjust to spray a fine enough pattern use news paper and masking tape to mask painted areas and stencil out the different color patterns. It will take some practice to get that fuzzy effect between colors. Best way is to cut out the paper pattern and fold up bits of masking tape to make it double sided. Place tape near the edges of the paper so that a little mist gets under for that airbrushed appearance. <br>  <br>  Practice on toilet paper rolls and cardboard cutouts until you get the desired effects.<br>  <br>  If you're into any kind of modeling get an airbrush kit, they don't cost that much and after a little practice you'll be amazed at what you can do with them.|`|e64iph1Caa	Um... yeah that dude pretty much covered it

RKIt9zSIaa	University is known to be difficult to get to install.  I'm not sure why.  But there are a couple of things you can try.<br>  <br>  First of all, you say the autorun won't initiate when you put the disk in?  That's how I'm understanding what you are saying about 'it won't even open'.   In this case, you can simply browse to the disk in Windoze Explorer and double-click the file manually (either click the autorun file or, better yet, the install.exe).  The autorun not booting is a fairly common thing with a lot of programmes.  It's nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  If you are still having problems, you can do a manual installation.  This always works unless the disk really is damaged or you don't follow the instructions properly.  The instructions for this are on the EA Games site (not the main sims site).<br>  <br>  1. Go to EA Games. <br>  2. Go to the Technical Help section.<br>  3. Search for 'maunal installation sims university' - or something like that.<br>  4. Several thread links will pop up.  Make sure you choose the one for University - not any of the other EPs or the base game.<br>  5. Follow the instructions carefully.  It's not complicated to do but you need to get it right.  <br>  <br>  When I reinstalled the game on my new computer, I had to manually install Nightlife because the disk was playing up.  It was fine.<br>  <br>  PS you don't have to install the EPs in order - they are designed to be installed in any order.  So don't bother with uninstalling/reinstalling.|`|5frOVAgSaa	hey u jsut have to install the games in order they were released so in order to play university, uninstall the whole sims 2 and expansions and install them in order. i don't remember the right order but sims university was the first expansion that came out for sims 2|`|9PE8tV8vaa	I too am a SIMS 2 fanatic.

RCUWRan2aa	A very good build a 8.6/10, I must say but If you won't mind I'll give a few deck suggestions. First, remove Grandora and Blue-Eyes exchange them for another Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon (dragon decks just can't have enough of this card) and Dark Horus (far better than Blue-Eyes). Next Remove Mirage Dragon and 1 x Twin Headed Behemoth and replace them with 2 x Totem Dragon (this would be a lot better). Your spell and trap cards are fine but use Black Horn of Heaven only as a side deck, add Mirror Force and Giant Trunade instead. and Finally, fill up your extra deck to the maximum (there's no harm in triplicating Stardust right? it still fits the 15-card limitation. just add another Black Rose, Red Dragon and maybe 1 Goyo Guardian, you will never know but a second Stardust would come it handy, right?)|`|6yamK94iaa	<a href="http://answersall.yim.cn" rel="nofollow">http://answersall.yim.cn</a><br>  it<br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in websi|`|VLwIt0Nfaa	maby you could use assault modes??|`|VaEaAEI8aa	Max out your Prime Material Dragon and add in 3 Mausoleum of the Emperor,<br>  Remove Luster Dragon, Exploder Dragon, Gandora and Blue Eyes.<br>  Add in Red Eyes Darkness Dragon.<br>  Don't think you need Dragonic Knight.<br>  Max Mirage Dragon (you could choose not to though...)<br>  Foolish Burial, Decoy Dragon may also be useful...<br>  Swords of Revealing, Dragon's Mirror and Future Fusion actually is not needed as Fusions are not as strong as they are before as a Mirror Force, Sakuretsu or even bottomless could make your efforts all gone...<br>  Remove Black Horn of Heaven and Sidedeck Royal Oppression.<br>  Choose either Bottomless or Sakuretsu, remove the other and max out card of your choice.|`|FMTB2lw6aa	Monsters (23)<br>  <br>  3x Armed Dragon LV 3<br>  3x Armed Dragon LV 5<br>  3x Masked Dragon<br>  3x Troop Dragon<br>  3x Divine Dragon Ragnarok<br>  2x Armed Dragon LV 7<br>  2x Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6<br>  2x Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8<br>  2x Lord of D<br>  <br>  Spells (14)<br>  <br>  2x Cost Down<br>  2x Level Modulation<br>  2x Level Up!!<br>  2x The Flute of Summoning Dragon<br>  2x Dragon's Mirror<br>  1x Swords of Revealing Light<br>  1x Heavy Storm<br>  1x Smashing Ground<br>  1x Super Rejuvenation<br>  <br>  Traps (3)<br>  <br>  3x Royal Decree<br>  <br>  Fusions<br>  <br>  King Dragoon<br>  5-God Dragon|`|stYO4Q1Haa	here are some ideas that you might want to follow.<br>  <br>  remove blue eyes white dragon, mirage dragon, and grandora the dragon of destruction. add to the deck 2 horus the black dragon LV6 and 1 horus the black flame dragon LV8 for control. the reason behind it is so you can negate you opponents spell cards. use it with either a jinzo or a royal decree to completely lock down you opponent. i do it all the time and they really hate.<br>  <br>   but i like shutting down my opponents spell and trap cards. you should try it. it is cool.<br>  <br>  EDIT: add cyber dragon for speed and power due to the fact you can special summon this card from you hand if you opponent has a monster when you have no monsters

fub5QVFfaa	Simple answer. Don't. <br>  Its against the rules of the game to use bots to give yourself an unfair advantage, and your IP can be blocked by using a bot and being caught. This means all your and your bot's effort goes down the drain. And its annoying having to find all your friends again and awkward to explain that you lost your account due to cheating. And all that only occurs if you don't get IP banned.<br>  And don't think "I won't be" because players report bots. It destroys the economy of the game and makes money making by fair ways impossible. Plus they are annoying, taking what other player could. Players do anything to get an advantage, even report one another.<br>  Plus, bots are often just programs to steal passwords off your computer or install viruses. No matter how "reputable" a site is, bots are not trustworthy programs.<br>  So, although it may stink, just do what most players do and level the correct way.

They say its ment to be that way. They might change it, not positive. Has no co-op, no party system to group with friends. Maybe rent it first. I myself am a big CoD4 fan.

Learn to make websites or stuff like that. It'll help out later when you need to use computers even more like in college and what not. Also a lot of options open up if you end up being good at it.<br>  <br>  A lot of hobbies don't really help later. If you don't like computers try to find something that has the potential to open doors or impress people. If you play sports, get better in your free time. If you like to write, do it more and get better. Pick up an instrument because it only gets harder to find time later on. Some hobbies are just time consumers despite how much fun they may be. The tougher ones pay off so if you find you're good at something, just try to get better at it and it'll become more fun and maybe help you out.<br>  <br>  I used to play a lot of sports and getting better got me into college. I also used to write a lot and now I'm considering a career in it.|`|ZfRnC4rAaa	If you have a hand held GPS, you can try geocaching.

1G3XPiq3aa	No, you don't need to delete your character. If a GM told you it needed changed, it will give you a prompt next time you try to log in to change your name before entering. If other people have told you to change your name, you can pay $10 for a paid name change. You log into your account at the main page <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml</a> to change your name. <br>  <br>  If it's just other people telling you to change your name, and you don't want to pay, you could just start a new character. You can have about 8 on a server, and there's no point deleting yours for no reason. You'll just have to start from scratch again anyway.|`|fub5QVFfaa	Deleting or just abandoning would work, but it would be shattering to watch all that time leveling wasted. If you can find a way, changing name would be fine to others. But unless its a GM telling you to change, there isn't much point. Players will get used to you EVENTUALLY. They won't like it, but they will. Would they rather have a high level with a wierd name or a newbie with a low level and a good name?<br>  However, if you choose to delete the character, it would be perfectly fine. Just remember to tell your friends your new name.

AA10248312	It's kind of a variation on the "Nim" family of mathematical strategy games, in which the object is either to remove the last piece from a pile, or force your opponent to do so.  You can remove up to "x" number of pieces from the pile on each turn.<br>  <br>  I don't know what the specific game is called that you're referring to, but the principles are exactly the same.|`|HQl6Smqxaa	There are lots of names for the game.

G7cYqWvIaa	Discipline and patience. It also helps to know the odds of making certain hands so not to get caught chasing straights and flushes every other hand. I know a lot of people don't like him, but Phil Hellmuth has a book that gives great tips on how to win online and live. It's a tiny book and only takes a day or two to read.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	three-of-a-kind is very tempting, id wait until i see the river before going all in...but be carefull of an opponant bluffing?|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Why you start to worry?  You got him where you wanted, although I would not push all with trip 6s right away.  Your opponent could have pocket 8s or 9s.   But think this way:  you did all you can and you have no regrets.  If the same situation occurs, you will do the same thing again and again.  That's all you can do in poker or in life.|`|9f620dc33e39ca62a6ae0cec49b5c7deaa	First mistake never go all in when the flop is called. Raise generous amounts to make it seem like you are bluffing. By the time the last card is called out, there will a big pot depending on the range/ amount you have put in. <br>  This way you are playing the person till the end. And only if he bets till the end, then your chances of winning are less( coz 50% time the river would favor him). Obviously if you have an exceptional hand go ahead and bet all-in if you can win.<br>  <br>  if you follow this technique there are 3 possibilities<br>  1. He folds before the river. you win<br>  2. He calls at the end of the river and you have ok hand. he wins<br>  3. you have a decent hand and you make him call at the end of river by pretending to bluff. You win<br>  <br>  cheers:) Keep the straight face|`|y822j5h5aa	You must try to think positively! <br>  <br>  Here is a link to an article about positive thinking in Poker. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thedoverpro.com/poker-attitude.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedoverpro.com/poker-attitud...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11711847	Stop playing on pokerstars!|`|asKSciQCaa	Think positive and keep your head up, you are not jinxing yourself bad beats happen.<br>  <br>   Trips are good but with two cards left going all in left you open to a bad beat, bet to the river making it less viable to get called and keeping your chip stack protected. If you get re-raised on the river call if you have a good read on your opponent or fold.|`|yhlt8jppaa	Based on your example, if he calls an all-in with pocket queens, his chance of catching another queen to win by the river is about 9%, so if he is willing to call, it is a tremendous, positive equity play so don't worry about it--the other 91% of the time you'll stack him.<br>  <br>  If this player is a fish (bad player), I might make your all-in play if I can put him on an overpair.  The best case scenerio for him is that he has a seven or a flush draw.  You're still way ahead, he'll only complete his hand 32%-36% of the time and if you have a bit more chips than are in the pot, you're giving him improper odds.  Even if he wins, he loses in the long term.  And you made the winning play that will profit 64%-68% of the time.<br>  <br>  If you're facing a reasonable player who would be scared off by an all-in, I still would definitely bet on this board.  The board is "straightening" and you need to protect  your hand and give improper drawing odds.  I would bet about the size of the pot.  You are in great shape, a lot of second best hands will come along for the ride: Top pair, 2-pair, overpairs.  If you slowplay, you are giving free cards & that is the worst thing you can do in this situation.<br>  <br>  As for jinxing, it doesn't exist.  Poker is straight probability.  Everyone runs bad & is susceptible to the high variance nature of the game.  The situation you gave above, if no straights or flushes are possible, have a 9% chance of losing.  The probability of it happening twice in a row are about .81%, still possible.  The probability of it happening five times in a row are .00059%, unlikely, but could happen someday.<br>  <br>  Poker is about making the best equity decision, not the results.  If you consistently make the best decisions based on all the complex factors that is poker, you will be a winning player.<br>  <br>  Also: <br>  <br>  -Don't worry about him having a set of nines or eights.  There is only a 1 in 100 chance of that occuring.  It's not something to worry about.<br>  <br>  -The large online sites are not rigged.  They make their money by everyone paying a rake.  They make over 1/2 million a day in rakes.  You see a lot of hands online in a short time, and you are going to see a lot of crazy, depressing things eventually.<br>  <br>  -Humans tend to remember the bad things and forget the good things.  It's easy to remember all the times an idiot sucked out on us, but its harder to remember the times when our hands held up or when we sucked out on other players.  Human nature.

All you have to do is find a certain cube (sorry, I forgot the name of it) and put your spectrobe in the incubator (you can find the incubator in the lab system) then there is a button in the incubator that looks like a claw. Then just push that button and it will show you the spectrobe and the custom part. Use your sylus to drag the custom part to the spectrobe (by the way, the spectrobe has to be either adult or evolved form) and hit the enter button when it pops up. Then you have to break the enhancing with the stylus. There is your new spectrobe right in front of you! Hoped this info helped!|`|AA12072104	Yea what he said

e63CjxWlaa	There are no helicopters in GTA 3 except for the police ones, they cannot be jacked only shot out of the sky. Vice City introduced the flyable helicopters.<br>  <br>  Here's how you fly the Dodo.<br>  <br>  Take your Dodo to the end of the runway, as you're beginning I recommend facing it away from Staunton Island,<br>  <br>  Hold down on the D-Pad and accelerate, wait until you see sparks fly from the underside of the Dodo and let go of the D-pad. The dodo will then shoot into the sky. Hold L2 or R2 to view the side view of Dodo, then tap down on the D-pad as required to keep the Dodo nose level.<br>  <br>  If the Dodo starts to descend at this point, don't panic, it will regain it's altitude on it's own.<br>  <br>  Now the Dodo will start gaining altitude. Be sure to keep away from buildings and if you need to turn, tap the D-pad as required in the direction of the turn. Never hold the D-pad down to make a turn as you will over steer causing the Dodo to go into an unrecoverable spin.<br>  <br>  It gets easier to control the Dodo once it is at it's maximum height (around the same height as the top of Callahan Bridge) The easiest way to gain altitude is to keep it level and let it gain on its own.<br>  <br>  Once you have mastered the Dodo, you can fly through the hills at the far end of the map (hollow) and visit ghost town, or just enjoy the sights of Liberty City from the air. Be sure you know where your unique jumps are, if you go over them the unique jump cutscene starts and will not stop until the Dodo crashes.<br>  <br>  <br>  One last piece of advice. Watch a youtube clip of someone mastering the Dodo. It will help you better visualise what you need to do to get that funny old bird into the air and keep it there.|`|Un9dKfM4aa	there isn't one in three, they first appear in vice city.  Sorry

63eVsSXhaa	i agree to the guy above|`|vY0ScgeXaa	cell, molecures, atoms?<br>  <br>  well fungi is a life form, micro biotics, anti-biotics works effectively on them, you dont want a fungi infection, its gonna cause crazy problems.|`|Qq2so2H7aa	fungus (pronounced /?f??g?s/) is a eukaryotic organism that is a member of the kingdom Fungi (pronounced /?f?nd?a?/). The fungi are a monophyletic group, also called the Eumycota ("true fungi" or eumycetes), that is phylogenetically distinct from the morphologically similar slime molds (myxomycetes) and water molds (oomycetes). The fungi are heterotrophic organisms possessing a chitinous cell wall, with the majority of fungal species growing as multicellular filaments called hyphae forming a mycelium; some fungal species also grow as single cells. Sexual and asexual reproduction of the fungi is commonly via spores, often produced on specialized structures or in fruiting bodies. Some species have lost the ability to form reproductive structures, and propagate solely by vegetative growth. Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are examples of fungi. The fungi are more closely related to animals than plants, yet the discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi, known as mycology, often falls under a branch of botany

The thing I like about 6 Samurai is different variations in build. They can incorporate different themes and monsters quite easily.<br>  With RotA limited you could add 2x Cunning of the Six Samurai in their place, it's good for bringing back Spirits, and Grandmaster, and with burden on the field, or any 6 of your 7 trap cards set, you should have a field presence advantage.<br>  The same applies to TWRA, though it doesn't Special Summon which is not as good for the deck.<br>  Breaker is a "walking MST" and good for most decks, I don't know how it would fit in here (maybe drop a Grandmaster?) though.<br>  Thanks!

daq5ySEPaa	Nintendo Wii, it just is|`|WleS3Bugaa	PS3 all the way - plus it has Killzone 2, Metal Gear Solid 4 and Little Big Planet as PS3 exclusives!!|`|cTGyUE8uaa	if money is not an option id say ps3 because online gaming is much better on it and HOME is expanding(sims like application)|`|ASMzLyGEaa	get an xbox360 with call of duty 4|`|amZnWUZnaa	They are almost the same in terms of power. The PS3 has a faster fsb as I recall but that is only to support the cell technology they love raving about. The Xbox360 is built more like a computer and, as developers have demonstrated thus far, is a better platform for detailed graphics.<br>  <br>  The choice really comes down to games and seeing as how the 360 is cheaper and has more games than the PS3, I would suggest the 360.|`|OjERIM3Paa	I guess they are both good in their own ways. I have heard that the ps3 is better for sport games and it will have better games come out in the future. <br>  <br>  I own a Xbox 360 and i think it is really good. It has some games which are only xbox 360 compatible such as fable II which is probably the main reason i bought the xbox 360, it is also good for many other games and i don't get bored of it. It is also good for online gaming.|`|saiGER0eaa	Xbox 360<br>  <br>  Pros: <br>  <br>  Better online<br>  <br>  More games<br>  <br>  Better controller<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  <br>  Possibility of getting the RROD, though with the new Jasper chipset the chance is lower<br>  <br>  Paying for online<br>  <br>  <br>  PS3<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  <br>  SIXAXIS<br>  <br>  Free online<br>  <br>  Blu-Ray player<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  <br>  Less exclusives than the 360<br>  <br>  PSN has less DLC than Xbox Live|`|gu3x37Muaa	It depends of what you like.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 has more games like PCs ones and has better graphics in some games. It also costs less than the PS3.<br>  <br>  However, the PS3 can also play Blu-Ray discs and almost all the games on this console are more violent.|`|E4ZH6i3Laa	The ps3 has free internet and the graphics but, the 360 had better games more online play and most games that are comein out on ps3 will come out on xbxo 360. i personaly have both but i just play my 360. as it is much better and and the games are more social online|`|N6jS2MjLaa	I would go for the 360. It has better games then the PS3 and it's a lot more affordable. The down fall to the 360 is that microsoft charges for EVERYTHING. The PS3 has free online gaming.

7QMMqUKlaa	Aiming is the same gameplay is the same online modes are the same.<br>  My advice unless you already pay for XBox Live then get the PS3 version as the online is free|`|837xgMwLaa	They are both very similar, there is aim assist on xbox 360 & PS3 so there is hardly any difference between them, apart from you have to pay to play on xbox live.<br>  Get it on PC it's the proper version, no aim assist & up to 48 players per server.

The clay colors vary slightly from city to city and nation to nation.  I built a number of buildings for "Stalingrad" and they were much grayer than bricks in London or Berlin.<br>  <br>  I would do a Google search for "Brick Building" & the city in question, and then buy or mix the appropriate color for your "bricks".<br>  <br>  I typically keep several bottles of Testors Model Master: Rust, Brown, Leather, Burnt and Raw Sienna and Umber, British Crimson, and of course Black, White, and Grey.  <a href="http://www.testors.com/category/135243/American_FS_Enamel_Paint" rel="nofollow">http://www.testors.com/category/135243/A...</a><br>  <br>  On a brick wall (plaster casting or styrene sheet), I typically mix the color of the mortar, spray the whole sheet with that and then mix my base brick color.  I spray the sheet with the base brick color, then mix a little black, white, and or grey into that color to create several shades lighter and darker than the base color and randomly paint a few bricks... since it's not common for all the bricks to be the exact same shade.<br>  <br>  I THEN take a scribing tool, and carefully scrape the brick color out of the mortar lines.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK and Happy Modeling

As of right now, you can't install custom firmware on the PSP 3000, just the PSP 2000. Datel, the people who make Action Replay, apparently found a way; you have to buy their product to use homebrew on a PSP 3000. It's not worth it. It's $30 and doesn't work very well at all.<br>  <br>  Until someone finds a way to hack the 3000, the only way to install custom firmware on a PSP 3000 is to have the game Gripshift in it. I don't know how exactly it works, but it does. You can get a copy of Gripshift off of e-bay for around $30-$40.
qYkDqyaJaa	Fly fishing salmon and trout is very fast, however not great money. The best place to do this is in shilo village however if you are f2p is best to do in barbarian village.<br>  <br>  The best technique available is Barbarian fishing, in which you use a knife with the fish you catch and use the offcuts as bait. This also gives you strength, agility and cooking experience. This is p2p. To start talk to Otto next to the whirlpool.|`|sX8SD7N9aa	Fish for tuna and swordfish at Karamja or any other convenient place. Tuna gives 80 xp and swordfish gives 100 xp. <br>  <br>  To make money out of this if you're fishing in Karamja, sell the tuna at the store in Karamja. Take the swordfish to Falador and store in the bank. After a while, you will build up a good quantity. Then sell the swordfish at the Grand Exchange for average price. Don't cook the fish, it will fall in value.<br>  <br>  If you can find a place where you can fish these two near a bank then that would be better.

Rather, you'll have to go catch a Snorunt and evolve it.<br>  <br>  Snorunt can be found in the Shoal Cave, which is the small cave north of Mossdeep City.  You'll note that the tide changes in Shoal Cave, so you can only access certain parts of the cave depending on the tide.  To get Snorunt, you have to go during low tide when you can reach the deepest part of the cave; to make things that much more difficult, wild Snorunt only appear at 6 o'clock in that part of the cave.<br>  <br>  To catch Snorunt, you'll want to go to Shoal Cave before 6 to give yourself time to get to Snorunt's location.  There are Zubat, Golbat, and lots of Spheal so bring appropriate Pokemon.  You'll also need a Pokemon with the move Strength.  The cave is pretty linear (in that there is only one way to go) so just follow the path until you reach a boulder--move it and take that path.

There are a few puzzles that require sliding around on ice to solve, but nothing too difficult.  If you are in this part of Shoal Cave right around 6 o'clock, you should encounter a Snorunt.  Capture it, raise it to level 40 and it will evolve into a Glalie, which is a pretty balanced Ice-type that would be handy taking out Drake and his Dragon-type Pokemon in the Elite Four.|`|640499317e3001a128b65237f83c99a1aa	during low tide there is an "ice" part of the shoal cave. snorunt shows up there along with spheals and zubats|`|8cc3bfca482d997e4bbd43d436bef1ecaa	no you must evolve a snourunt|`|91308a0eae479c330cba077c651bbb1baa	u cant find a glalie but u can find its pre-form in shoal cave|`|a207ccaf104c7fec38088bdd304f3294aa	try cheatdemon.com the answer is in there.

You have flying, fighting, fire, ice, water, ground, rock, grass and psychic... you NEED an electric type. Somewhere. And you also need to level up considerably, because every time you win against the Elite Four, they level up. Which is MOST irritating.

Make sure you have the move Surf (and defeated Koga in Fuschia City to use it outside of battle) and lots of Pokeballs.<br>  <br>  If you used the Pokemon Center outside of the Rock Tunnel, you can Fly there and head north until you see water.  Use Surf and follow the water-way East, then South until you see the Power Plant--you can't miss it.<br>  <br>  Electabuzz are relatively rare and you might have to wander around a bit to encounter one.  Also, at the very end of the Power Plant you'll encounter Zapdos--one of the legendary Bird Pokemon.

Dead Rising is much harder to beat and you can only play by yourself.|`|181be37647b0104dc43e4e4c51ac07eeaa	They both have their up and downs. Both are sandbox games and both have unique acheivment. Crackdown is a litttle short on the single player but running around with you friends is super cool. So it all depends, if just want to play by yourself then get Dead Rising but it your into the open sandbox concept and wnat to play with freinds then Crackdown. Also if you haven't got into the Halo3 beta, you should buy Crackdown. Good game and a good incentive.

PtmPkeDXaa	so you want a Darkrai...so does like every pokemon gamer. Well "events" are really nintendo events. A nintendo event, is a kind of a promo that nintendo does so you can get cool out of the ordinary pokemon. So far, i have not heard of any nintendo events for diamond/pearl. Mystery gift is gotten from a person in the jubilife tv station. I think that man is on the third  floor. Talk to an interviewer and e'll ask you questions, regardless of what he askes, put in, Happy everyone( or everyone happy, or enjoy everyone, most likely happy everyone though.)  and wifi connection for the next question. THen save, and the next time you turn on your game, on the menu mystery gift will be one of the options, as will continue and new game. To get Darkrai, you can get an item in the future using mystergift over wifi, this item will allow you to cath a Darkrai, along with an itme to catch Arceus and the hedgehog(not sure about it's name, i think it's shaymin)|`|J06hSbciaa	well events are activated by items.....so is wat you have to have is that item so u have to get the mystery gift.  sorry but i dont know how to get that. but is what happens the people sent the item over the mystery gift (wifi is needed) and you get that item that enables that event.|`|cxWWioNyaa	hmmmm....|`|ZV4nhNgJaa	i think you surf through a door at the pokemon leage, and that lets you got to an island were you can catch them (if you are talking about the glitch)

I understand your situation more then you could imagine because I was sucked in at one time into the world of myspace thankfully I came to my senses and realized it was a waste of presious time and There was no benefit or purpose for me to continue to be on the site.<br>  <br>  I declare Myspace officially overrated and wasteful.<br>  <br>  Videogames on the other hand can have purpose and benefit. It relieves the mind off stress and engages it into the "left brain" which is the creative side of your brain. Also VGs help improve hand-eye cordination. <br>  <br>  I would suggest console games over net games since net games tend to get to addicting for your own good (and my own good for that matter) <br>  <br>  The key to making VGs beneficial is play a diverse lineup of games or ones that are beyond the norm. Take for example Okami, The Legend of Zelda, The Final Fantasy Series. Heck, your being forced to read in these games so they cant be as bad as some say they might be...<br>  <br>  But most importantly your having an enjoyable experience and thats what matters most.<br>  <br>  Please do yourself a huge favor and delete the Myspace acccount. It is a curse of addiction that will not go away and that is your only choice.<br>  <br>  We must curve bad habits and turn them into good ones. Play VGs for enjoyment, Play ones that challenge you, that have puzzles, that really make you think these are the ones that can help greatly.<br>  <br>  PS, the best time to start is NOW there is no tommorow. Its now or never.|`|2nsXLGeWaa	if your a geek  find a way to hide it and hang out with your friends|`|yHuLEd3Qaa	try to stay away from the comp for a day or two that might help (delete the myspace account)|`|hnwpNaH5aa	I would much rather be a computer "geek" than be in the "cool" group.

Computer geeks are the ones who will get the great jobs with LOTS of money. UNless you just play games and stop worrying about your grades. If it's something you love to do, keep with it. If it keeps you out of trouble then do it. Just keep up the grades and maybe slow down the gaming to 2-4 hours. That's more reasonable and lets you have time for friends.
