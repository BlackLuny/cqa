Mas n?o sei qual seria o sistema para entrar na universidade uma vez que vc  brasileira e residente no Brasil.

EUeJtEI9aa	Situata sulle rive dellincantevole Lago di Ginevra ai piedi delle maestose Alpi Svizzere, Ginevra si presenta come una delle pi affascinanti citt europee. Quartiere generale delle Nazioni Unite, Ginevra ha alle sue spalle una storia di tolleranza e individualismo che inizia con la Riforma della Chiesa Protestante.  Oggigiorno, sebbene sia famosa in Italia principalmente per lannuale salone auto (salone di Ginevra), la citt  fulcro di cultura e divertimento, e ovviamente di ristoranti raffinati e trendy.  Il Jet d'eau  il monumento pi famoso della citt ed anche la fontana pi alta del mondo. Il centro storico di Ginevra  letteralmente una passeggiata nel ricco passato della citt, allietata dalla presenza di oltre trenta gallerie e musei, tra i quali citiamo il Museo dArte Moderna e Contemporanea (MAMCO) e il Museo Internazionale della Croce Rossa.  Agli amanti del relax consigliamo una crociera sul lago o una passeggiata nei parchi, oasi verdi che si affacciano sulle sue rive.    Non deve di certo mancare una visita alla famosa via del mercato: il classico orologio svizzero come souvenir o le mille altre vetrine da scoprire, Ginevra offre opportunit per tutti, cos come hotel e alberghi dal rinomato servizio e situati nei pressi delle attrazioni principali della citt  Le 10 attrazioni di Ginevra da non perdere  Il Lago   il capolavoro naturale della citt: relax sulle sue passeggiate e nei parchi per assaporarne latmosfera, una crociera da due ore per una prospettiva unica di Ginevra e un romantico intermezzo.    Il centro storico (citt vecchia)  Con limponente cattedrale di S. Pietro e le caratteristiche vie lastricate, il centro di Ginevra si presenta come uno scrigno ricco di segreti. La casa pi vecchia  la Maison Tavel, sede del Museo dArte e Storia. I numerosi negozi dantiquariato faranno felici collezionisti e curiosi.    Ledificio delle Nazioni Unite e il Museo della Croce Rossa  Disponibile un tour guidato al quartier generale delle Nazioni Unite ed al Museo della Croce Rossa che vi si trova proprio di fronte.     Carouge  Il borgo dal sapore bohemien sul fiume LArve, costruito su modello di Nizza, con le sue botteghe dartigiani e i caff dartisti. Meta ideale per il dopo cena degli amanti della musica Jazz.    Parco dei Bastioni e Piazza Nuova  Relax nel verde, una visita omaggio al Muro della Riforma, una partita a scacchi con la scacchiera a grandezza naturale o un drink nei suoi caf prima di visitare Piazza Nuova, sulla quale si affacciano musei e gallerie.    Shopping  Rue de Rive e Rue du Rhone rappresentano due delle vie pi trendy di Ginevra e pi stravaganti per quel che riguarda moda e gioielli. Per un drink in caff di classe consigliamo Place du Molard e Place de la Fusterie.    Paquis e Les Grottes  Ecco il quartiere pi etnico della citt, situato a nord est di Gare Cornavin: ristoranti di tutti i tipi e altrettanti negozi. Shopping e gusto estetico si confondono nelledificio Schtrumpfs in Rue Louis-Favre 23-29 (in Les Grottes), una delle icone architettoniche di Ginevra.    Mercatino di Plainpalais  Famoso mercatino delle pulci che si svolge ogni Martedi, Venerd e Domenica dalle 08:00 alle 17:00: antichit, vecchi vinili, libri, abbigliamento vintage e curiosit.    Il monte Saleve  Una gita in funivia sul monte Saleve, che fa da sfondo alla citt. Panorami da brivido e numerosi sentieri guidati per gli appassionati di trekking.

E' la pi grande citt della Svizzera ed il 22 agosto 1864 vi viene sottoscritta la nota Convenzione di Ginevra con cui nasce il movimento internazionale di Croce Rossa.

OtLdkhyvaa	non ho mai fatto l'animatore ma ho frequentato parecchi villaggi e conosciuto parecchi animatori ed animatrici,  da quello che ho potuto capire ci sono molti lati positivi in questo lavoro, sopratutto x una persona come te che dice di faticare a relazionarti con gli altri penso che possa essere un esperienza costruttiva e molto positiva perch potrai vedere posti nuovi e conoscere un sacco di persone e in specifico nel tuo caso anche molti bambini e non solo, alla sera potrai partecipare attivamente agli spettacoli, molto divertenti, fatti da voi dell' animazione del villaggio x intrattenere gli ospiti.. Tutto questo per richieder da parte tua un po' di  fatica dovuta all' impiego di molte ore giornaliere nello svolgere il lavoro, ma se troverai una equipe giusta la fatica non la sentirai.. buon lavoro!!|`|fQIYbt1caa	probabilmente ti piaceranno i bambini...per ti consiglio di prendere quest' esperienza come vacanza e non come lavoro!cerca di conoscere pi gente possibile...apriti...lascia da parte la timidezza!sei giovane quindi anche se i carichi di lavoro sono pesanti in quanto lavori si pu dire tutta la giornata...e di notte si fanno le prove di cabaret!insomma  stancante...pero se sei single...ti vuoi divertire...ti vuoi relazionare con la gente  un buon lavoro!soprattutto divertente!ma se sei fidanzata seriamente...se sei in difficolt a relazionarti e quindi ti imbarazzi lascia stare!per quei pochi soldi che ti danno e per le tante ore di lavoro ti conviene rimanere a casa!che troverai altre offerte di lavoro molto pi redditizie|`|406a7959d41514c6e3edcec5ca1390c1aa	Ciao io ho gi fatto un resperienza da animatore turistico e la consiglio a tutti.

Per se fai il miniclub sei pi fortunata (dipende dai punti di vista) nel senso che ti occupi dei bambini durante il giorno ma alla sera sei pi libera mentre altri colleghi fanno dal risveglio muscolare fino all'animazione in tarda serata. Anche io ero a Sharm sei fortunata perch ci sono soprattutto italiani e quindi nn hai problema di lingua. Ciao e cerca di divertirti il pi possibile

9aff14d586e9eee0fce7d131dcab1258aa	ciao, visto che sei di Milano ti consiglio di fare un salto dalle mie parti: Varese, se vuoi portarla nella natura e farti 4 passi in un luogo splendido puoi sfruttare la pista ciclabile + lunga d'italia attorno al lago, tra prati, boschetti (e col miglior gelataio alla Schiranna)  facilissimo godersela perch non c' un metro di salita e ha un sacco di accessi e punti panoramici e aree di sosta, inoltre  pure ben servita dai mezzi pubblici. Lideale  uscire dalla A8 a Azzate-Buguggiate, prosegui x 3-4 km verso varese e trovi l'area di parcheggio alla schiranna (dove si tiene la fiera) l c' anche una bella piscina, se ti va, poi da l ti puoi muovere verso Est o Ovest, ma se vuoi semplicemente fare 4 passi ti consiglio di fare il tratto verso azzate e Galliate l.,  + bellno. Ultimo consiglio: portala a Inarzo alla fattoria del sole Pasqu: centinaia di cuccioli di ogni tipo di animale (dai maialini , agnellini,conigli, lama, asini ecc..) da poter accarezzare, nutrire e con cui giocare, inoltre c' la possibilit di fermarsi a mangiare (divinamente) con 2 soldi. Il posto  da favola: boschi, prati, e area attrezzata con giochi x bimbi, organizzano passeggiate a cavallo e giochi x bambini, oltre a far vedere i lavori della campagna ( come fare il formaggio ecc..) Non perdere l'occasione: Stessa uscita della A8, alla rotonda di Capolago giri a sx verso Bodio, prosegui x 10km fino ad arrivare ala rotonda di Bodio Lomnago,  giri a sx x Inarzo-Bernate e trovi le indicazioni x la fattoria Pasqu-casale Litta, fammi sapere|`|KOALMzQ7aa	Al parco delle Cornelle|`|wqos9OUraa	oasi di sant'alessio. provincia di pv. se cerchi su internet trovi tutte le indicazioni. ci sono anche aree pic nic. in alternativa lungo il ticino ci sono un sacco di siti carini, verdi, anche questi attrezzati x pic nic, ad abbiategrasso x esempio. oppure andando verso lodi.  a dire il vero basta seguire qualsiasi statale, uscendo da milano x trovare posti carini, verdi, puliti.|`|58JT6Ibuaa	Vai  in un bel Agriturismo cerca verso Varese, oppure recati al Sacromonte con lei c'e' da camminare ciaoooo|`|bJStiZaUaa	A piona a visitare l'abbazia o a bellano a visitare "l'orrido" sono sul lago di lecco...

The old port itself is an interesting mix of tourist souvenir shops, great restaurants, quaint old buildings and cobblestone streets worth checking out.    Take a ride on the subway (called the Metro) and go see the Olympic Stadium, the Biodome, the Insectarium, or the Botanical Gardens.    Visit Chinatown and grab some excellent meals whether it is dim sum, Cantonese, or Szechuan, or other specialties.    Go to the Casino de Montreal on the island in the river.    Visit a museum.

I just might add that in terms of places to stay, it is by far most convenient to stay downtown, and the cost of doing so is pretty reasonable compared to other cities.  My girlfriend's family always stays at the Sheraton Four Points on Sherbrooke Street; a bit cheaper is probably the Days Inn on Guy Street or the Novotel on Rene-Levesque Street.  If you look on a map, the downtown is roughly bordered by Rene-Levesque Street to the south, Sherbrooke Street to the north, Guy street to the west, and St-Denis street to the east.  Anywhere in that zone or a few blocks from it should be fine.|`|sOnK0FQBaa	u should stay at the sofitel it is a beautiful hotel and canada is  very cold in the winter it is below zero sometimes -20 degress and celcius is used for weaher in canada not farenheit so dont get confused but it will get only a little warmer in april|`|ztb1F35Xaa	rains in april stay somewhere downtown its a little expensive but better than taking a taxi everywhere so it balances out

If you are walking to take photo's, you should be fine.  You can always walk along the beach and get beautilful shots. Old San Juan is very interesting and picturesque and has nice buses.  I would not go there at night alone though, it seems a little scary and easy to get lost.  And the traffic/streets are really horrible.  I was so thankful I had someone familiar with the area to drive us.  As far as things to do - your group should go to the east coast to Fajardo (about a 45min drive) and take a catamaran sailboat trip to the smaller islands.  We went out on the Salty Dog and it was, truly, one of the most enjoyable days of my life.  Sailing, snorkeling, lunch, snacks, & unlimited drinks were all included and the crew was great.  It really made the vacation memorable.   Also, many people told us to visit the Rain Forest, but we didn't get time.  I hear it has beautiful waterfalls.
sUTU3F5Saa	How did you come to this misconception?    Period. . .We(Foreigners under USA umbrella) don't trust him and think his Muslim roots are going to create more problems for USA.  Secondly he is trying very hard to implement a Socialist government into USA and run it accordingly.  Thirdly, the world or the Americans are not in love with him.  He was elected by the majority of people who never voted before, however since he was black, almost 90% of blacks voted for him.  **** EDIT ****  I should also add that he is pushing a bill through Congress for $800 Billion that will give taxpayers money to everybody, even those who never paid taxes before.  How do you think Americans feel about that, I really sympathize with them.  Additionally he scrapped the Missile Defense System in Northern Europe and is now saying the USA will negotiate a peace treaty with Hamas in Palestine while not getting the Israelis involved. . .I would say this man is stepping on thin ice.

Guinea  7. Guinea-Bissau  8. Democratic Republic of the Congo  9. Zambia  10. Lesotho  11. Swaziland  12. Cameroon  13. Somalia  14. Madagascar  15. Mozambique  16. Togo  17. Benin  18.

It is a country that many people do not know or care about but an interesting country nonetheless due to the situation of the country (many Sierra Leonians fled to Guinea during the "blood diamond" era), the way they utilize (or do not utilize) natural resources to help people.  Their history is amazing - the first french colonial country in Africa to tell France that they wanted their independence and that has really affected them due to the way the French handled this (tore down much of the infrastructure).

The country was formed by freed American slaves. It's capital is named after an American president, it's second largest city is also named after a different American president.  Until 1980, the ruling party chiefly were decedents of the freed American slaves.  More recently, it had a civil war and child warriors.  It's former president is on trial in The Hague.

Because of my parents work I lived there with my family for 2 years. They have got a really rich culture, especially when it comes to music with famous musicians like Amadou et Mariam, Salif Keita and a few more. Although still one of the poorer nations in africa they are also enjoying success in democratic governance and got a steadily growing economy over the last years.    Of course a lot of african nations are still struck by poverty, but if u have to present ur project to others it could be a good opportunity to break down some of the typical african stereotypes which often seem to be quite distorted. At least for Mali i can say that it is very safe and its amazing to see people living in poverty and yet being so friendly, warm hearted and helpful like the Malians!    Guess other countries that might be interesting are:  Gabon, Ghana and South Africa as african success stories or Sudan, Sierra Leone, D.R. Congo and Zimbabwe if you want to focus more on actual problems involving africa.

High pressure over the Pacific, and low pressure inland means that the fog and coastal clouds hang around for some or most of the day, especially near the coast. Inland valleys stay warm.|`|cvU3MOqMaa	Most likely yes.

lebBrVoGaa	Similar situation! My Mum is from Wilesden & my Dad Hampstead, we used to live in Amersham, now it isnt London, just out of the M25 in Buckinhamshire, Amersham has an underground link and within 35min you are in Central London. The majority of my family are from North London, but we are also in Balham and Kent aswell.  I have a great passion for London, I think about it everyday, and I can only see myself being happy there!    Nearly 9 years ago we moved to Northamptonshire, and I am called a Londoner eventhough Amersham isn't in London, I keep on saying this and they don't listen. I would love to call myself a Londoner.    As I am down there every week meeting family or doing whatever, and I know London like the back of my own hand, I know it better than Northampton Town (which is 20min away) or any other place. For these reasons and more I believe apart of me is a Londoner!    I always get this off people, it makes me laugh, them calling me posh boy as I pronounce my a's and going "Barth" instead of "Bath", They constantly go "cos he's a jolly Londoner"  It isnt bullying as they are my friends and even if it was I wouldnt care as it means that much to me.    To answer your question, You are what you believe you are, If you wanna be a Londoner be a Londoner. If you think otherwise then say I'm not a Londoner!  It's up to you and your beliefs!

wVJ1jAyJaa	Turkish really is more compatible with Latin script and Atatrk knew that.  It was a known fact even before Atatrk.  There were many Ottoman writers who supported that thesis. (Like ?inasi or Abdullah Cevdet)  Some linguists during the late Ottoman times were studying about a transition. However due to WW1, nothing happened.  But having said that, if Atatrk also had other things on mind like you said, that doesn't bother me, I'm totally comfortable with it.    Edit:  Hi, Momo, please don't get offended.  If you knew Turkish, you would agree with me, too.  Regular Ottoman Turks faced many difficulties with the Arabic Alphabet. There were many illeterate people just because of the hardness of the old alphabet. even the ones who knew it couldn't always understand every word because of the abscence of vowels.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	I think because of both reasons.    If you consider his other reforms, it wouldn't have made any sense to keep the Arabic alphabet.|`|HiHQvqodaa	He probably did it for several reasons, including curtailment of Arabic/Islamic influence in Turkey and cutting off cultural ties with the Ottoman past. Being the pragmatist that he is, I think his main goal in adopting the Latin script was to drastically raise the literacy rate in the country by making it simpler for ordinary Turks to learn how to read and write. He certainly achieved that goal. An unfortunate consequence of his alphabet reform is that modern Turks cannot read anything that was printed in Turkey prior to 1928. That's a pity because understanding the cultural/ideological atmosphere of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is crucial for understanding modern Turkey.|`|dbAw3SEdaa	Whatever the reason was, good or bad you owe it to an Armenian:    HAGOP MARTAIAN    Ataturk invited him to Turkey (he was in Bulgaria at the time), and appointed him to the First Turkish Language Convention. Around that time, a statute making surnames mandatory was at the legislature. Ataturk was very impressed by the expertise of Hagop Martayan, and suggested that he take the last name Dila?ar, meaning "tongue opener", which Martayan accepted.    After the Turkish Language Convention, Mr. Dila?ar became the Head Expert in the Turkish Language Association. Later, he taught languages at the universities and high schools.    Thanks for reading!    http://www.kerala.com/wiki-Turkish_langu...|`|AA10604976	Well, the Latin alphabet is really easier than the Arabic alphabet.    Besides, Ottomans affected Arabs politically, not vice versa. Too bad the effect didn't last. Gone the tolerance of Ottomans, entered Western supported puppet dictators. I would dearly love to see independent, secular, open and modern societies in the Middle East.|`|7vD4dBK4aa	well it is more compatible with a Latin script but i belive the main reason was to purge arap inf. as it was arap inf. that destroyed the ottoman empire and to increas nationalist feeling in turkish citizens not to increas islamic pride.|`|hXQ7QEHmaa	Haifa, why do you use a picture of someone else?    Keyser, I hope Ataturk didnt do it for purging Arabic influence, because that would be like racism...Arabs were very backward in the 20s, and unfortunately they are still backward today ( because they use Islam for political purposes and because they dont respect democracy)    Something interesting is that Khazaks ( Turkic too) use the Russian alphabet, Slovenians use the Latin alphabet, Vietnamese use the Latin alphabet, Iranians use the Arabic alphabet,etc...Very strange...    Turks are not Arabs, of course, but they are not Europeans either...Dont forget that you ruled lands and nations in BOTH continents, Europe AND Asia-Middle-East...And North- Africa as well, which is also a part of Orient too...  So Turks, dont be quick always in turning your back to the Middle-East...Dont forget that you belong to BOTH  worlds...|`|f5772527c1bdb988f613cb36fe20d4eaaa	I would think that he did it so Turkey could become more unified with the world.  Most modern countries use the latin alphabet.  It's also much easier for foreigners to understand when visiting a country.  How difficult would it be to come from a European country and see Turkish traffic signs in arabic?|`|vfFjBJi0aa	Although it has yet to be enunciated the way the hat and clothing reforms have been, you can advocate this perspective to a certain extend, and I am pretty sure some commentators must have already correlated them with each other the way you suggest.    However, the development process of the two countries are not on a par with each other since Japan was already an industrialized nation by WWII. Considering that, such a process has nothing to do with the difficulty of reading and writing the letters of an alphabet, let it be Kanji or Arabic letters.|`|09a99abaf4d7de10668fc440ef5838e1aa	To learn Arabic alphabet you need to learn more than 200 letters. Latin is 63 . .|`|AA11854330	I think his main goal was to increase people who read and write by changing the alphabet. Purging Eastern influence can be the 2nd. Or I mean if the main goal of Ataturk's all revolutions is to reach the level of European countries, he knew that it won't happen if Eastern countries affect Turkey which is already affected by religion, clothing etc. But most important is education. So he increased the education level by changing the alphabet which was under Arabian effect.
5f37c1ca843baed941347175d05ad20eaa	I don't think Palisade does short-term rentals.  It's mostly a residence.  How upscale are we talking?  You want posh--good luck.  If you just want something clean and nice, try Casa del Mar or Victorian Inn and Suites, or Escapes.  Again, they're not upscale, just nice.  You might run into problems trying to book this early though, because most places are still full of displaced Ike victims. If those places aren't up to your standards, your best bet might be to rent a really nice beach house.  Some of them survived Ike, but you'll have to call around to find out which ones.  Here's a website to get you started: http://www.galveston.com/resortrentals/.   You just have to call around and get a feel for what kinds of houses are available.

AA12299134	Yes, you will be fine.  Hong Kong is safe, ordered and prosperous.  It is a lovely mixture of the familiar (British) and the exotic (Chinese) and since it used to be a UK colony, lots of things there work very efficiently, and people speak English well.    I have been there twice on my own and enjoyed myself both times.  I went in the autumn (October) when the humidity was lower but you can still count of good hot, sunny days.    I loved finding unfamilar and newly-experienced things, mixed with the familiar British entities.  The main part is Hong Kong island where the skyscrapers and the stunning waterfront can be found.  Be sure to explore around the convention centre and the lovely Hong Kong Park, and get photos of all of the striking buildings.  Take a ride on the tram for some authenticity.    Then there is Kowloon which is on the mainland, home to a great shopping experience along the bustling Nathan Road, and some very quirky and eccentric markets around the Yau Ma Tei (birds, flowers, goldfish, jade and a night market).    You can also take a daytrip to Lantau Island if the pace of life in the city get a bit too much; where you will find pleasant rurality and the stunning golden statue of the buddha - it is huge.  East of Kowloon is the lovely Sai Kung peninsula with lovely colonial towns; and on the south side of Hong Kong island is the peaceful Shek O beach.    Best experiences are riding to the top of Victoria Peak on the tram with sideways views of the city, and the nightime view of the Central skyline from Kowloon waterfront.    People there are friendly and helpful, but watch out for certain 'ethnic' businesses such as internet cafes which may try to rip off tourists, but these really are in the minority.  Helpful books include the Rough Guide to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong and Macau Directions (also published by Rough Guides).  Very detailed and helpful.    My tips toyou are definitely to go there by yourself and take along an open mind - you won't regret it and there is plenty to do in the territory to fill up a very interesting week.  Take plenty of photos too.  Solo travel is excellent because you only have yourself to please, and be pleased you will.|`|NiKEWiymaa	Hong Kong is said to be the city where East meets West. You may find it to be a very crowded place compared to other cities- has one of the highest pop. densities in the world.     An excellent shopping experience and most items are very cheap. People live in skyscrapers and there are some of the world's tallest buildings. The vast majority of signs have English translations.    The public transport is very convenient- there is a very efficient metro system. The city has a very warm climate -about 15C in winter to 30-35C in summer. Western food is common.    It is a very safe city but as with all cities, be aware of pickpockets as foreign people are more likely to be targeted. Police regularly conduct patrols in the streets of Hong Kong.

Second will be taxi - and you should get an octopus card which works like the London oyster card - top up pay.  -Most people won't speak any english at all, or if they do it will be very, very poor.  -The food, if to your taste, is some of the best in the world - try not to eat all westernized food and take in the traditional stuff.  -Hong Kong airport is superb, the best I have ever been to.

Cockney accent? all northerners class everybody south of watford as a cockney... have you really ever met one? you saying that about Londoners is the same as me thinking all northerners don't have a dress sense and eat chips and gravy.. in your case the chips from your shoulders.  edit : i just wondered if you've met a cockney or was they just from london|`|mxA0tYppaa	Have to agree withyou Kitty.....the southern accent is nowhere near as good as our accent....and i don't for the life of me know why they look down on us....  ps....it's taking a long time to park that bus..lol|`|I3CNklLKaa	Righto let's explain.    I don't hate Northerners - what I hate is what you do to the English Language. I know you're lovely people (in the main) but all this "ay oop lad tis reet chilly oot" is just ridiculous. I mean you do know that's awful don't you?    And you don't NEED to do it do you? You've got the BBC, you can hear how English is supposed to be spoken and copy it - then we'd all be friends - celebrating with lashings of Black Pudding and the Newcastle Brown Ale flowing like water.    Edit - you're missing the point of cockney - it belongs to London's East End only and was devised in a poor community as the only thing that they had for themselves - it is full of irony, wit and humour and reflects the sharp minds of the cockney people. The phrase above would translate to "Right me ol' currant it's taters out" this is more than just an accent, it's a code not an abuse of pronounciation - surely you can see that?|`|b1znvwnJaa	You're just irritating.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	They feel themselves.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I think the key word here is 'seem'. It's your interpretation. I was born in London and have lived here all my life. I haven't got a cockney accent as i am not from the East End of London. I have a standard English accent which you would probably call 'posh'. I have nothing against any part of the country. I have been to the north many times, and my favourite place is Liverpool. I am always made to feel welcome wherever I go, but I think that comes from my attitude. People can usually detect if you have a chip on your shoulder.|`|df7e0a98adad7376c2265d7ad4d45e2faa	Ridiculous assumption. How old are you?

In Liverpool everybody seems to talk to everybody else. my daughter-in-law was very surprised when she came here and stayed for the first time how open everyone was to a chat. I have only known one quiet and crowded bus journey with no-one speaking to one another and that was the Monday after the Hllsborough  disaster. The bus driver had to shout that we where at the end of the journey. No one moved.|`|AA12299134	Bit of a sweeping generalisation that one - you probably wouldn't like all northern people to be generalised in stereotypical ways, and it is not the same with Londoners.  Maybe you were in the wrong place at the wrong time or something.      I go into London (centre and suburbs) all the time, and I don't have that kind of trouble.  I have met friendly people in pubs and on trains.  I have been served by cheerful people in shops.  I have had complete strangers come up to me and start conversations, for no other reason than the liking of a good conversation.  The reason: I guess it's because I have something of a Polyanna attitude to human nature.    Contrary to northern belief, London is not just one big over-priced smog hole.  There are charming urban villages everywhere you go which have distinct community feels and where people do talk to the neighbours.  I do appreciate that northern people are very friendly (I know that from experience) but you get that down south too.  It's not an endemic north-south thing, it is a human nature thing.  Wherever you go, people will want to be friendly and be loved.  It's a much nicer feeling than being grumpy and resentful all the time.    It's not because you have a disease, but it might be because you have an attitude and mindset whereby you expect southerners to be rude and unfriendly; and this will be your experience.  Attitudes come across as a vibrational thing, and people can pick up 'vibes' off others without them even knowing.    Just like the ignorant southerner who thinks that the north is provinical and backward (I do recognise that those people exist too) - you can pick this up a mile off, and so can we down here.  They have no grounds for having that attitude because northern Britain is just as fun, colourful, characterful and cultured as anywhere else in the world.  Look at all of the 'rewards' which northern cities have earned for their development in recent years (UEFA Cup and Champions League Finals, art galleries, waterfront developments, successful bids for the European city of culture).    Change around your expectations, have a Polyanna attitude.  From now on, expect southerners and Londoners to be open, friendly, helpful, charming and warm, and this (after a bit of practice) will be your experience too.|`|W1BGqz9Faa	Northerners are very often illiterate and thuggish people.|`|aCdya2qkaa	lolz mate.

Sorry...|`|FI4Z0jYcaa	If someone was to ask me what they should see when they get to London, it's that they shouldn't see London as a tourist, but as a local and leave the attractions alone and go to look at the outskirt areas.    The "north/south" attitude is more coming from the impression that each side gets of each other through the media and comedy.  If you have experienced it personally, maybe wrong areas being visited? Or wrong time?    BUT London appears more as a business hub (rush, rush... must do everything now) rather than a community hub due to the variety of people working and living there. There is little cohesion between boroughs and sometimes walking over a boundary can feel like a totally different town/city!|`|P3kIkuyVaa	Nobody talks to anyone in London.

Worry about kanji later.  It will come.  You'll realize it's necessary at some point.    There are a few celebrities in Japan from foreign countries who speak Japanese fluently but who can't read or write.  You're not going to be like them though because once your Japanese is fairly conversational, you'll study kanji.|`|3xwFPL4naa	The basic difference in learning reading/writing vs. spoken language is that reading/writing can be learned pretty much entirely from textbooks and self-study.  It just depends on how quickly you can memorize things.  Whereas acquiring spoken language ability requires verbal interaction and thus depends on social skills and time spent immersed in the foreign language.  Grammar and vocabulary are somewhere in between.  You can learn them from a textbook but you will find it much quicker and easier if you are immersed and forced to communicate with them.    Learning the basics of Japanese politeness levels is pretty easy, however to master all of the intricacies to a near-native level would take a lifetime.  In fact many Japanese people say that even if a Japanese person spends a few years abroad during their childhood, they will never be able to fully re-integrate with Japanese society and will always be seen as something of an outsider.

PA0bGBtCaa	None....It all depends on the airline how they choose to set up their cabins. The seats aren't necessairly going to be larger in a 747. They will just have more people crammed into coach. Bathrooms are usually the same size, just more in a 747.    The main difference between the 74 and 77 are the amount of middle seats in the middle section. You'll probably have two less seats on most carriers on the 777 as it is a bit more narrow than the 747.    The huge benefit goes to the airline. It's cheaper to operate the 777. Yes because of fuel. They can have a lower CASM and a higher RASM if they have a plane that consumes less fuel. Since the plane burns less fuel, then you don't need as high a load factor to make money on a certain route. If you can find that happy medium, then you can take some seats out the plane and make ever seat have more legroom.

I'll come back and edit!    :D|`|AA11902619	I , too, was horrified at the thought until it was explained to me in a different way. Percentage wise, not an awful lot of working class people go on to third level education - even when there are no fees. On the other hand, most of the middle and upper classes do, whether there are fees charged or not.  So, the people who are saving on this are the ones who can well afford to pay for an education. If they pay, there will be a lot more money available for grants for people who cannot afford fees. That, of course, depends on whether our scabby Government puts the money gained back into education. They may well use it to give themselves an increase in pay.  But, to answer your original question, Im sure fees will be introduced again.

I on't think there is any confusion as to who attacked Gaza and no,I don't want to hear about the kassems and whether they are responses or aggression; that who-threw-the-first-stone business was more than clarified when the izzies ended the truce last year with a November 4 attack that left six people dead.|`|t58rc9tCaa	Jimmy Carter is a looney bird. No one listens to what he says. What do you expect when he tells the US to "trust Hamas"?

I read your display messages.    A Christian who commits a crime or a murder does not do it in the name of Christianity, and that cannot be blamed on the religion. When Muslims destroy the World Trade Center and you hear 19 men on the cockpit recordings screaming "ALLAHU AKBAR," we can deduce that it is in the name of Islam.

They have killed many Palestinian terrorists without their populus incurring any collateral damage.

f434a964a9112c76af410074c8ceb684aa	I live in the desert ( tucson, az )  I love it !  It gets hot in the the summer but, it's real dry. No humidity. In winter it can get cold at night but, it warms up during the day nicely.  If the wind blows, it gets very dusty because everything is so dry.  We don't have normal grass, it's more like weeds that look like grass.|`|bHaAFcoPaa	I have lived in New Mexico for just over 10 years, either in Gallup or in Albuquerque. It doesn't get that hot in the summer. Usually in the 90's. Some times it will get above 100 in Albuquerque. It is dry most of the time. During the monsoon seasons we usually get a little rain in the afternoons. In the winter, it is dry and a little cold. Gallup is higher in altitude so it gets colder, some times getting down to -20 F at night.  But we have spectacular sunsets and sunrises. The food is really good and there is a lot of variety in Albuquerque. The people here are really nice.
IstwJtBraa	Go to Cabarete on the North Coast.  Fly into Puerto Plata (CODE POP) which is a half hour away.     Young sportsminded crowd that parties all night on the beach.  Boca Chica is the land of the living dead and they have ten tons of FUGLY Hookers there along with the dregs that feed on tourists and Punta Cana is only all inclusives catering mostly to families.    Don't stay at an all inclusive!  Institutional style food and not the best.|`|ZYT6f1qVaa	LOL, i would recomend any resort in Santo Domingo they have the best and the only malls, the resorts are great and they are not very expensive i would recoment to stay there for a week since there going to be alot of things to do that you laidies wouldn't like to miss  resorts to recoment   - Juan Dolio Beach Resort All - inclusive  - Grand oasis  -Gran bahia principe in puerto plata|`|k80lCQo9aa	A lot of different places. Just like other countries the DR has good and bad places but Its A LOT of fun. You should go to Juan Dolio or Boca Chica. It has great resorts on beach , pools, fun and most are all inclusive so all the food and drinks that you can want! they have shows at night and a dance club. alot of fun. if you go to punta cana the resorts are amazing to. but since punta cana does not really have alot of dominicans(mostly haitians tat just work then go bck haiti , venezueleans)and its really poor and outside of the resorts and beaches it aint all that great outside! its knda ugly lookn compared to other parts lol but the resort and fun is well worth it;; if you go to santo domingo (the capital) you get taste of lalot and good history; but for now to relax and its you girls just go to juan dolio or boca chica;; you wont reqret it  [:    MAKE SURE ITS ALL INCLUSIVE RESORTS!

pyhglHaSaa	We should try not to.  If economic recession causes us to lose our job, all the more we should have a clear head so we can do what we have to do.  Worrying will not solve anything.  Keeping sleepless nights is not helping either.  Both are counterproductive.  Instead we need to focus our energies on job hunting and cost saving efforts.    If sleeplessness becomes a persistent problem, we might as well apply for jobs that have graveyard shifts.|`|QYC6cjwEaa	Through observation, it does. Someone I know got laid off because of the recession and she couldn't get a good nights sleep because she kept thinking about the family she has to feed and the bills that had to be paid.    Solution is to stop worrying and get well rested. Get up early and look for a job. If you have a job now, make sure you have back up funds and a good insurance.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	it does... especially when you lost your job and you think about how are you going to feed your family... that's sad...|`|50pKPrHxaa	Yes it could if you worry about it too much. Sleeplessness sometimes hides another problem so it would be better to find ways on how to solve the underlying problem. If in this case recession, which is quite global find ways on how you will not be affected by recession.look for other possible ways on how to get bigger income.|`|iTktGWWtaa	Recession, recession.

One of the manifestations of stress is waking up in the middle of the night or inability to get a good night's sleep.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	Those deeply affected by economic recession do.  Who could sleep when one is overly anxious, extremely scared and duly uncertain of his future?  Especially if the house amortizations and utility bills are piling up and there is no one to ask for financial assistance .  To make matters worse, the investments you made which you hoped would have matured and helped you to tide over the difficult times have been stolen by the very people you trusted.    I think there is no solution to this kind of problem.  In fact, insomnia sometimes start from thinking too much of one's problems you don't want to sleep until you have a solution in mind.  Sigh...I sometimes suffer from sleepless nights...for another reason.|`|VaqM2usFaa	if you self made billionare like mark go, then you no lose sleep. i not knowing if you not billionare. i no talk to piople who eat a socks for dinner|`|JEb2Kqd4aa	yes,after realizing that you`re now jobless.  i think the only solution is by chemical intakes, like valium,etc.

Just beside it is a blue pen uncapped, both lying down on a piece of white paper with scribbles, lines forming to what looks like a building.

W1IpL3Syaa	I don't care as far is it's good and cheap|`|MPX0f5jzaa	There's two men at our local farmer's market that sell their own hummus and pita.  One's pita is better than the other's, so that's a no-brainer.  The trouble is that the best humus comes from the other fellow who's a self-desribed "Palestinian" and a Muslim besides.      A Palestinian and/or a Muslim isn't a bad thing, millions live alongside the Jews in peace.  He bristles a little bit when we approach his booth and my boyfriend does a little of the same tough-guy act around him.  This was even before the conflict, then we boycotted him altogether.    The truth, however, is this:  His product is indeed the best (well, next to me making it at home).  He's a Palestinian, he's a Muslim.  Never did he say hey, all the money I make at the Farmer's Market I send to Hamas.  That would be a ridiculous presumption if we were to believe that.    So we relaxed and we began buying from him again.  It's like during the Cold War, we were taught to hate Russians.  The same Russian government that even the Russians themselves came to hate!  It was so silly!|`|FcH2ZEkqaa	If it bothers you, buy Israeli and pay 100$ or so more.

Syria sells nothing of value.  Dear girl there is nothing made here you would want.|`|t58rc9tCaa	More and more, Arabs on the governmental level are willing to do business with Israel.    Israel has trade relations with Qatar, which does not recognize the Jewish state.    During the Iran-Iraq war, even the Iranians bought weapons from Israel to use against Saddam.    Today a court in Egypt struck down a decision to halt the sale of natural gas to the Israelis. We will provide Israel with 1.7 billion cubic meters of natural gas over the next ten years.    Business is a universal language. No one can stop that.    As far as the boycott goes, it has little or no effect on the Israeli economy whatsoever. Israel remains the richest country in the Middle East, with a per capita income that is greater than the UK's. Muslims have been boycotting Israeli products since 1948 - what has it done?    You know a telephone survey of 1,000 Egyptians was carried out here in 2006, and on top of 92% of said Israel was an enemy state - 60% said that Denmark was an enemy state, based on the fact that an independent Danish newspaper printed a few cartoons like Arabs do about Jews every single ****ing minute.    The grocery stores and supermarkets had signs that read, "These are not Danish products, they are blah blah blah products."    How many Egyptians can even find Denmark on a map?    I have always believed that the solution to the Muslim boycott affecting business in Europe is simply to fire all the company's Muslim employees and give their jobs to native citizens. There are at least 20 million Muslim immigrants in the EU alone! Muslim immigrants are absolutely flooding Europe - all the embassies and consulates have lines for miles. Muslims hate European politics and Western values, yet on an international level, probably 70% of them would like to leave and live abroad.    We can hurt them a lot more than they hurt us - we just suffer from a disease, liberalism.    The tolerance experiment has been a grandiose failure, folks - without insulting anyone, let's just pull American and British troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan and the Gulf and evacuate however many European and North American expatriates there are in Saudi Arabia and Dubai - and deport 40 million+ Muslim immigrants leeching off of kaffir societies and abusing Western hospitality and law to expand politically and religiously.    Even this "Muslimah (moroccan girl)" sharmuta, if you look at her profile, is a "British" Muslim.    Just get out of their countries and get them out of yours. The whole developing world is booming with immigrant-wannabes, why need Muslims? And they have much more to lose.    Dot: Israel is verifiably the richest country in the Middle East, with a per capita income of $31,767, while the UK's is $27,700.    Dot: My source is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). You should really find a better souce than the CIA Factbook. Why not just give me Encarta World Atlas 97 while you're at it?    The countries of the Gulf are not traditionally considered part of the Middle East. There you just have oil that was accidentally struck by the kaffir Standard Oil Company of California 70 years ago and helps to curtail the effects of MASSIVE social medievalism. Not to mention that the Gulf is completely dependent on kaffirs for labor - non-Muslims outnumber Muslims 8 to 1 in Dubai, which will explain its character.    Israel has the highest business freedoms in the Middle East. It never went through a socialist phase like Arab countries.    Israel as it is is far richer than Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, or even Lebanon can dream at the moment.|`|d9PdhBvMaa	I will if I come across anything. I would hate to think I was funding Hamas through purchasing goods from Iran and Syria.|`|AlbJmy7aaa	No, all kinds of things from Syria are around.. hookas and such.    There are food products that are NOT sold in Israel for whatever reason. Mostly sweets and stuff like Mt Dew that is popular in Jordan and Palestine but not popular in Israel. They don't have the taste for it.    I used to go to Jordan for the weekend and fill a suitcase full of cool groceries... some from Syria (a thing called Choco Twist I remember).    This isn't a boycott its just certain products are sold there commonly (with emphasis on kosher but not everything.. there is plenty not kosher)    In fact, I once called the Choco Twist hotline from Israel into Damascus and asked if the snack was kosher.. it was awkward!

htI1vYHsaa	Well I love living here but maybe that's just me.     the only thing is the weather is pathetic.   and the new reports are mainly wrong.   and your almost guarantied rain but neaver snow!

We go about 5 times a year to stay there and I always dream about living there permenantly one day.
VyJC1MNiaa	To learn japanese, I suggest you to start by memorizing all the hiraganas and katakanas. After you've mastered those, start the basic grammar. When you've got a good idea of the sentence structure, then start learning kanji. While you're doing all that, you can go through some of the simple greetings and expressions, like "delicious"! (oishii) or "amazing"! (sugoi) etc.    Also, watching Japanese dramas and anime really do help. (I speak from experience)    Hope this helps!|`|MGEkKSclaa	http://www.freejapaneselessons.com/        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K89FQIiEE...|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Have you visit livemocha.com?

If you get yourself into a course, it may be easier than trying to self-study. But if you can't afford a course, I'd suggest you get yourself a good textbook, like Genki, and a beginners dictionary and start with basic vocab and grammar. If you want to learn reading and writing Japanese, start by learning Katakana and Hiragana.    Livemocha is great! There are also some good lessons on www.thejapanesepage.com  Check it out!|`|E2aN3ZBaaa	good luck with that

1Vih78dZaa	I'm pleased to tell you that your BS detector is functioning correctly. For anyone who knows anything about Venice, the ending of Casino Royale was just stupid in the extreme.    The buildings in Venice (and everything else that's dry land  streets, bridges, piazzas, etc.) are not actually built on "dry land" in the normal sense, but they're definitely never held up by inflatables.    Venice is built on some very low-lying marshy islands in the lagoon it sits in. More modern structures (like the huge parking lot outside the city proper) are built on concrete pilings driven into the bed of the lagoon, but all the old buildings are constructed on top of thousands of pilings made of alder wood, on top of which were placed oak planks and then slabs of rock. All this formed the foundation for buildings made in the more conventional way with brick or stone.    Your BS detector was also right when it caused you to wonder about the depth of the Venetian canals. According to Wikipedia, the average depth of the Grand Canal is 5 metres. The hundreds of minor canals will be a lot less deep that that.|`|sagxWL01aa	There were bombs all around it. I love it.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	check wikipedia.com

Posso assicurarti che vengono presi dei provvedimenti di sicurezza unici, anche se ogni tanto commettono delle leggerezze incredibili.   Se devi partire fallo semplificandoti al massimo tutto il percorso che parte dall'aereoporto e termina con l'arrivo. Non  difficile. Svuota tutte le tasche, metti tutto nel bagaglio che sigillerai con pochi pochi euri. Evita cinture che devi togliere e mettere . Magari evita anche l'orologio . Ne comprerai uno di pochi euri l. Ti assicuro che se arrivi all'aereoporto cos leggero, visto che  anche estate, l'unico disagio (non da poco ) che dovrai superare sono le code prorpio per i controlli.

Bidet in francese  l'equivalente di "pony" (infatti nel francese antico "bider" significa trottare). Questa sembra l'antica derivazione del nome dello strumento che noi utilizziamo per rinfrescare le nostre parti intime, proprio perch per utilizzarlo dobbiamo stare a gambe divaricate, proprio come se stessimo montando un cavallo.  Il precursore del bidet, il bidoaille, fu inventato nel tardo medioevo durante le Crociate, e consisteva in una tazza che poteva essere usata sia dagli uomini che dalle donne per facilitare il lavaggio delle parti intime. Il vero e proprio bidet sembra quasi sicuramente una invenzione dei francesi nel diciassettesimo secolo, anche se non conosciamo la data esatta e il suo inventore: le prime notizie sul bidet risalgono al 1710. Il primo bidet che fosse qualcosa di pi di una semplice tazza su un piedistallo fu il bidet a getto che fu inventato nel 1750: veniva messo in funzione manualmente e produceva un getto regolabile d'acqua. Con la Rivoluzione Industriale il bidet divenne uno "status symbol" della nuova borghesia.   Come potete notare non  che il "bidet" sia proprio una moderna invenzione italiana, il fatto che in molte nazioni non trovi uso  probabilmente un retaggio del passato, cmq grazie agli italiani si stanno evolvendo anche loro|`|15e8222fa5b98f9fbb113b874df6665baa	di che nazione parli per curiosit...e poi magari si fanno direttamente la doccia o no?|`|f9005fa8f9c840ef3fbe26bf60472d62aa	si fanno la doccia...piu veloce e maggior pulizia!|`|fd88c811723813a4df24367726f50ef2aa	si faranno direttamente la doccia...ke ne so...e poi di ke nazione parli scusa?|`|04ee3021ea481475cb7ba4f3b40e3126aa	Solo in italia abbiamo il bidet.

IMKORLNUaa	Ich besuche ein Gymnasium nur fr M?dchen. Es hei?t AGGS und befindet sich in der Stadtmitte, nicht weit von den Gesch?ften. Das gef?llt mir, weil die Stadt wirklich sch?n ist. Auch finde ich es sehr praktisch, weil ich in der Stadtmitte wohne. Es gibt 1500 Schlerinnen und 80 Lehrerinnen; das hat mir nicht so gut gefallen, weil das ein bisschen zu gro? fr mich ist. Aber AGGS ist ziemlich alt und wurde 1901 gegrndet; das gef?llt mir, weil es historisch ist. Meine Schule beginnt um sieben Uhr und endet um halb vier. Ich finde, dass es nicht so schlecht ist, weil ich gern zur Schule gehe, aber meine ideale Schule wrde um 10 Uhr beginnen und um 14 Uhr enden. Es g?be weniger Hausaufgaben, weil ich zu wenig Zeit fr Hobbys habe. Jedoch verstehe ich mich gut mit den Lehrern und meinen Klassenkameraden, denn sie sind freundlich und lieb. Ich finde es auch gut, dass es viele gute AGs nach dem Unterricht gibt; man kann alles machen: Musik, Theater, Kunst, Sport und viel mehr!    Frher gab es eine furchtbare Turnhalle. Sie hat mir gar nicht gefallen, denn sie war zu klein und alt. Auch gab es ein gro?es, aber schmutziges Schwimmbad.

Es hei?t AGGSund befindet sich in der Stadtmitte, nicht weit von den Geschaeften; das gef?llt mir, weil die Stadt echt sch?n ist. Auch finde ich das ist sehr praktisch, weil ich in der Stadtmitte wohnen. Es gibt 1500 Schlerinnen und 80 Lehrerinnen; das hat mir nicht so gut gefallen, weil das ein bisschen zu gro? fr mich ist. Aber die AGGS ist ziemlich altmodisch und sie wurde in 1901 gegrndet. Ich glaube, dass sie wirklich alt ist und das gef?llt mir, weil sie historisch ist. Meine Schule beginnt um sieben Uhr und endet um halb vier Uhr. Ich finde, dass es nicht so schlecht ist, weil ich gern zur Schule gehe, aber meine ideale Schule wrde um 10 Uhr beginnen und um 2 Uhr enden. Es gaebe weniger Hausaufgaben, weil ich zu wenig zeit fr Hobbys habe. Jedoch verstehe ich mich gut mit den Lehrern und meinen Klassenkameraden, denn sie sind freundlich und lieb.   Ich finde  es auch gut, dass es viele gute AGs nach dem Unterricht gibt; man kann alles machen: Musik, Theater, Kunst, Sport und viel mehr!    Frher gab es eine furchtbar Turnhalle. Die hat mir gar nicht gefallen, denn sie war zu klein und alt. Auch gab es ein gro?es aber schmutziges Schwimmbad.

Nc8Pmw73aa	Tell them you accept Islam and you will be OK.|`|aVJyU3Tjaa	Don't fall in a panic! If your fianc is laid-back about it, his family probably are too.    I'm in a similar situation. I met a Turkish guy when I was studying in France last summer, and I'm planning to visit Istanbul this summer and meet him and some other Turkish friends I made while I was studying abroad, and he suggested I stay with him and his family. We were sort of together when we were in France, I'm not totally sure what the situation is, but we are friends at the very least and meeting his parents will be an important event! Especially as I am taking advantage of their hospitality. As I said, they live in Istanbul, a huge city where Europe and Asia meet. He's very Westernised, his family aren't Muslim and his attitude was relatively liberal and open-minded.     However, Turkey is 99% Muslim (UN figures) so its likely that his family will be, so certain rules should apply (dress etc). But then most Brits are supposed to be Christians, but nobody seems to practise Christianity! It really depends where his family's from. If they're from a big city, I would behave the same as I would as if they were from anywhere else. But, of course, they are his parents, so politeness would be important!     As somebody said above, Turks are generally patriotic. Praising their country and their people will always be appreciated. I have a bunch of Turkish friends, and, in my experience, they tend to spend a lot of time persuading Europeans that they are Westernised. Just try to appreciate them for who they are.    Sorry I couldn't give you advice on how to behave if they are more of a traditional Turkish family. One tip is to buy a Lonely Planet guidebook, as it has great tips on cultural differences depending on the area in Turkey, advice on dress etc. Best of luck, relax and enjoy visiting this beautiful country.|`|x79VCZsNaa	? will tell you my view as a foreigner married with a Turkish:  Please be natural, and do not bloff about your self, and something very important be respectfull towards all the family and their costums, if you act snobish they will inmediatly refuse you, in general Turkish people are proud of their culture and they will love to hear that you like their culture. ? do not know what kind of familly are you going to visit but wheter it be modest people conservative people or "white western turkish familly (i can not believe that there is stupid people using this kind of racist terms here in y/a) the rules are almost the same, you have to respect the home and would not be nice for the familly seeing you guys hugging and kissing each other in front of them if you are not engaged or officially married so if you see that your boyfriend acts little bit cool in his home do not get scared is just that in his home he has to respect rules...from the first meeting will depend the aceptation of their parents (specially) so just try to act natural and respectfull, listen them and as it is said above if they ask you things then talk, and offer your help to his mother, you will be guest but believe me it would be wonderfull for them to see that you are always in the position to help them, if the guy is rich and there is service at home well it would be nice if you treat the home service polite but if there is not maid at home it would be ok a that you show your offerment and insist to help the mother and sisters in the dinner time (you may also learn how to prepare turkish food) the point is to let them know that you really want to interact with them, other think is that you try to eat everything they serve to you and if you are full show your apretiations towards the people who prepare it and say that you are full other ways they will keep insisting and insisting....do not forget that when you marry a turkish or middle east men you are not just marry him but also his familly....good luck to you.  Read ?pek old answer posted by serkan it will help you alot!|`|6kvyXUNWaa	Don't wear really revealing clothes. I assume you'd be wearing jeans and a jumper/long top anyway cause it's going to be cold :)    I think you should just be polite and courteous towards them, engage in conversation and don't be too over the top. It'd probably help to learn some Turkish too - it shows you are willing to adapt to your fiances way of life. His parents may also not speak much English, so it will be useful in this aspect too :)    Good luck with it! :D|`|0fc71d93282bf1baaa4cd5f250fd7a07aa	lol just RELAX you are NOT going to Mars are you? and ignore the answers above me....you'll play the part that you won't need rehearsing all u have to do is ACT NATURALLY :) if it's really hard for them to accept yourself the way you are then tell 'em to go to hell|`|vbTG3a4Zaa	its ok you shouldnt be petrified,you'll do fine :))  here let me give you this...i asked this 3 months ago same question as yours i think Ipek gave me a really good answer you should read it,it helps alot    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|gm9QYLjIaa	Alright don't listen to the answerer above me, what you will wear will depend on the socio-economic situation of your fiance's family and he's the only one who can tell you what to wear. A white-Turkish (Westernized, European) family will on the contrary not appreciate it if you wear long pants with turtle-necks in summer. Ask him what you should wear, and he'll most probably tell you and help you dress. How you will act will also depend on this, is he wealthy (not necessary though), well educated, open-minded, not so different from other man in your country? Then he may belong to a westernized family. Did you feel like you were cultures apart and you couldn't understand his ways at first when you were together? Is he a worker? Then he may belong to a traditional Turkish family in which case you will need to be properly dressed and very respecting of family customs but he is the only one who will be able to help you with that, there are different traditions in Turkey. This is kind a important but you can easily guess what the family is like by the offspring they have produced (sorry, this is kinda grude but true) and it's hard to pin-point a single type of family in Turkey. Honestly if they're letting you stay at their house with your fiancee (even more if in the same room) the first time you meet them then basically they probably won't be all that different than any other in-laws not to mention the fact that they trust their son, so they'll probably trust you too.     As a general rule, be smiling, be bright, don't be overly excited and joyful still maintain a sense of seriousness. Let them do all the talking, unless an awkward silence occurs then ask them about business and praise them, praise Turkey explain to them how much you liked the country and the people (Turks like to hear this). When they ask you a question try to be as thorough as you can, remember you are being investigated! ;) Try to help with the cooking or at least offer a hand (show them you can be a good wife for their son). If they start a conversation, argument your strong views on a certain topic, show them that you're not just a pretty face and you have opinions as well. But don't disrespect them, this is a very important thing, do not disrespect them in anyway, be cordial. If they ask you something embarrassing, giggle, be surprised (but not chocked).     The father may directly like you but it may be harder to get the mother's affection. But I guess it's always like that.     Good luck but don't worry too much I'm sure they'll love you!    PS: Oh and a very very important thing! Accept every food and drink they offer you, at least try it and if you don't like it explain that you are full or you have allergies. It's considered very rude not to accept food and drink.    Arpsy: Assuming the racist remark was towards me, I'd like to clearify that it's not a racist since "white" doesn't have to be a positive thing first of all. The white-Turks, beyaz turkler, is a popular term in Turkey usually used to make fun of the wannabe-european families (Orhan Pamuk's books usually illustrate this type of family), it's not about the color of the skin, it's about the way of life, they usually prefer to call themselves "Europeans". And hey my family is part of this, and auto-critic is the best way to evolve. Hehe, yeah though I'm sorry I didn't realize how it could sound to a foreigner :/|`|rEELErf5aa	smile even though you are nervous and take the attitude that they will like you and you will like them and everything will be fine.    Also help mother with anything and everything she is doing.    I don't know your personality but be a bit calm.    Keep your belongings neat and don't leave your things lying around, make your bed.    Don't wear your shoes in the house.    Never contradict or criticize your boyfriend in front of his parents.    Never eat with your hands, blow your nose in the bathroom and keep your feet on the floor when you sit in the presence of his parents, and if you smoke, do not smoke in front of them.    If your boyfriend tells you to kiss their hands, do it.|`|q7z7Ni3Daa	=) I'm guessing that if he is relaxed, you should be too. Turkish families love their children so much. For example, my husband is 6 years younger than me, and I don't cook at all, but they loved me because he loved me, and it was obvious I made him happy. If he is taking you there to his family, I'm sure his love will be obvious to them, and it will work out perfectly    There are so many things you could think about doing. I will say only a couple of things that caught me off guard or I messed up. Little things =) since the other posters are covering everything else lol. So here's the fun/silly stuff.    1. Buy new socks. You'll have to take your shoes off every time you enter someone's house, so be prepared. Even a little hole can be embarrassing.    2. Put no more than half as much food as you think you can possibly eat on your plate. They will double the amount on your plate anyway, so you will end up full, but not bursting if you halve it at the beginning.    3. Practice the both-sides-of-the-face kissing. It seems simple, but bumping noses with your soon-to-be relatives can be awkward.    4. Let people worry about you being cold even if you are not, and let them put sweaters around you. It makes them happy.    5. Do not put toilet paper in the toilets. The toilet will stop up, and they will know it was you. Been there. Done that. =)      Have a great trip. Turkey can be so much fun =).|`|ez4wgyETaa	That generation of turks have the backwards mindset all those oldies possess everywhere. Thankfully we've stepped out of that phase now.

65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	Your best bet is to ask the local newspaper if they need any delivery boys in your area. The Ottawa Citizen or the Ottawa Sun may hire people your age to help deliver their papers.    However, keep in mind that a paper route is a big responsibility. People expect their papers delivered every day and before a certain time. If you do a good job, you get rewards like good tips and presents on holidays. If you do a bad job, you get angry people and could have the route taken away from you. Plus, you have to do it in the snow, in the rain, when you aren't feeling well.    You may want to find something that has a little less pressure on you. Mowing lawns, raking leaves, shovelling snow from walkways are all good moneymakers for young kids.     So is dog-walking as so many people have pets these days but no time to give them exercise. If you are good with dogs, I'd recommend that. You get exercise, can play with the dog, and you get paid for it! The only bad part is having to pick up doggy poo every once in a while, but that is part of society today.

The recession has hit California harder than most other states.  Jobs are almost nonexistent here. You will find it extremely difficult to find any job, let alone one that will pay enough to live on.  Rent for a tiny 1 bedroom will START in the $1100-1200 range and require 3 times that amount just to move in (first, last & security).  That doesn't include anything for utilities, transportation, food, clothing,  entertainment, etc.     Remember too that you will be paying out of state tuition, roughly 2 1/2 time what a resident (or illegal alien) is charged. Add to that that enrollments are being restricted because of California's budget problems. The state has suspended grants to college student for that reason. Welcome to California, I hope you bought round trip tickets.    I'm not being rude. I'm telling you the facts that you must face the moment you step off the plane.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Ummm.. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS $500/MO. HERE!!    As of right now, because of the economy, a job opening in Los Angeles is almost non existent. With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City (soon to be), it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult.    You will also need about $10,000 to start off.    Decent prices start at $1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $550 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.    Bottom Line: Look elsewhere, in 3 months you will probably be back in New York with no improvement whatsoever.|`|lzEuuseJaa	Even renting a room is likely going to cost you more than $1000 a month, it has for many years in places like Santa Monica (in safe, good neighborhoods). You will need to find a less expensive place to live, like North Hollywood or Van Nuys. Lots of young college students rent out there. It may not be the most glamorous place, but it's relatively freeway close (by LA standards) to Santa Monica. (And if you're coming out here to act, there are lots of great classes in NoHo.) You also might try Culver City, which is close to Santa Monica, but likely it will be over $1000 for a one bedroom in a safe neighborhood, pretty much everywhere will be. : (  A lot of landlords won't rent a single to more than one person in good neighborhoods.    Please be careful with craigslist and don't send any money! You must see the rental in person and be sure you are handing money to the right person. There have been lots of scams, people renting places out for great prices, taking the deposit, but they don't really own the place. They take off with lots of peoples' *deposits*. If it sounds too good.... Also, even places like Santa Monica have dangerous neighborhoods, you really have to look in LA before renting.     Here is some housing info from SMC's website: http://www.smc.edu/apps/pub.asp?Q=125    You may have a tough time finding a waiter job out here. We have zillions of *professional* waiters -- mostly actors who have been serving for years. The job market here sucks and will probably be even worse next year. Restaurants are really slow right now, no one is eating out. Lots of people in retail are being *laid-off* right now, too. Do your parents have any friends out here that might be able to help you secure a job? Any relatives out here? Try to line something up before you get out here, or it could be a long time before you're employed and $4000 won't last long. You have time to work on it, it's smart to plan so far in advance!    Also, before you come out here you need to make sure you will have a place at SMC. The community college system is having a really rough time right now, the fees are too low, too many students, it's really close to crashing. I wouldn't be surprised if they stopped taking out-of-state applicants at some point. The Cal States stopped taking local applications early this year -- before the cut-off date! Too many students, not enough $$. And now they may be changing it so CA residents will likely have to attend a Cal State close to them, not any Cal State. So coming from out of state, you will likely be hit hardest on things like transferring to a UC. I'm sure you already know, but transferring to UCLA is not part of a guaranteed program like to Cal State.     CA Community Colleges LA Times article from this week:  http://www.latimes.com/news/education/la...    Anyway, sorry for all the bad news. If you have a dream, you do need to go for it while you're young! (I went to Paris on a whim when I was very young, and ended up living and working there for a year.) But, you have to be smart about it, it's best to have real information, so now you have time to plan and figure everything out.     Good luck!|`|bNBpwCEOaa	Wow, thats a tough one.  Being from the Los Angeles area, and having graduated from UCLA, I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment in Westwood (right down the street from UCLA) with 3 other people and still paid about $800 a month.      Honestly, you aren't going to find a room to rent in a decent area for the money you are talking about.  You might be able to find a room to share with your friend in a house for $900.  Santa Monica has its good and shaky areas....You picked a very expensive side of town.  If you still want to come to Cali and go to a junior college like Santa Monica, then you should consider a cheaper area, the college system is pretty much the same.  Try Long Beach city college, Cerritos college, or Pasadena college.  Near Long Beach city college, you can rent a one bedroom apt for around $1100.00, in a decent area.  Then once you have established yourself and are ready to go to UCLA, move up there and rent with some additional friends or students.    I'm not sure what part of NY you are from, but guys/people in LA should be pretty similar.  Just watch out for each other, don't trust anyone, and have fun.  Good luck getting into UCLA.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Think about it: What landlord is going to want to rent out something 6 months from now? If he has tenants, he's going to want to keep them. If he has a vacancy, he's going to want to fill it immediately, not wait for someone who may or may not come in 6 months. Think, girl!    Check out roommates.com, westsiderentals.com, and rent.com.    Just so you know, the average price for a 1BR in LA is $1200 in a decent neighborhood. For that small amount of money, you're going to have to settle for a room rental, or an undesirable location.    Not being rude, just telling it like it is. (Being from NY, you should be used to that).    Just so you know, signing an agreement for a place sight unseen is foolish and dangerous. You might want to look into staying at a hostel for a couple weeks when you first move here. And having a fixed date of Aug 5 isn't good, because landlords like to rent starting the first of the month. You may have to wait for a place, so a hostel would be a good idea.

If you have any more questions on Quebec , feel free to email me|`|7QERhhRJaa	While hot spots like Rio and New Orleans come to mind when one thinks of Carnaval, Quebec City is a destination that draws more than 60,000 people every year. Rather than hiding from the biting cold, Quebecois embrace and celebrate it.   The French-Canadian city comes to life in the winter. With snow-covered cobblestone streets, outdoor ice skating rinks, beautiful European architecture and friendly residents, the city puts out the welcome mat for everyone during Carnaval.   The festival runs from January 29 through February 14. It includes all kinds of activities that people of all ages can watch or take part in throughout the city.   At the beginning of the festival, Bonhomme Carnaval returns to Quebec and is given the keys to the city by the mayor. Bonhomme, or "happy man," is a cheerful-looking snowman and the symbol of Carnaval. Throughout the city there are signs and pictures of him in most every store and restaurant.  During Carnaval, Bonhomme reigns supreme from his ice castle which is across the street from the Quebec parliament building in the Place Loto-Quebec. Colored lights shine through the walls of this ice structure creating a magical effect at night. Dance parties are held at the castle, which is also open for tours.   At the Place Desjardins, there is the International Snow Sculpture show. Just around the corner is the Canadian igloo exhibit which houses traditional crafts from native Canadian tribes.|`|AA10982716	Bonhomme Carnaval!  He's the snowman guy with a classic Quebecois belt and a red touque.|`|65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	The mascot is known as "Bonhomme Carnaval" as a few others have mentioned. He is the giant snowman with the sash and toque that are traditional represntations of the French trappers from the region.    I would suggest for more information, you simply check the Carnaval d'Hiver du Quebec website.    http://www.carnaval.qc.ca/home.html
rU8tgqKaaa	The average high is 66 and the average low is 55. You will most likely have sunshine.    The weather is hit or miss this time of year. The worst would be daytime  highs in the upper 50s and rain. However, it can easily be in the 80s and sunshine.    There is a slightly greater chance of rain farther north of San Diego in areas like Carlsbad and Oceanside, and thus slightly cooler temperatures. There is also a chance for cooler temperatures along the coastline (west of highway I-5).    For more details, visit http://thebestplacesinsandiego.com/how-t...    In case the weather is bad when you visit, here are ideas on what you can do: http://thebestplacesinsandiego.com/trave...    Have a great trip!|`|FGCjgc8Raa	59 t0 70 % no it does not get warmer further south.|`|1ZuRzD5Faa	no. right now its 54 dgs and raining. and in feb. its pretty much like that the whole month.|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	It can be anything from low 60's to the 80's. It's usually the beginning of spring, but there can be the odd late winter rainstorm. This year has been dry so it should be sunny and in the 70's. Any further south and you'll be in Mexico, which, do to the drug war going on, is dangerous to your health.|`|9vRL7yWKaa	Hard to say.  Last weekend was in the 80s and this weekend will be in the low 60s.  Best bet would be a sunny low 70s.  The farther from the coast, the warmer.  Stay can stay inland and travel to the coast if it is really warm.
xSHRJw46aa	We have family that winters in Phoenix, and we have traveled to visit them for Spring Break about 8 times.  During that time we have driven around the area quite a bit.  We have been to Sedona, Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, Vegas, San Diego, and are planning for Tucson this year.    I would say Vegas is out.  My wife an I like to go there, but it really is not a family destination.  Sedona is beautiful, but it is a place to visit art and pottery shops.  (I am an old fashion guy.  If a business has 'shop' or 'shoppe' in the name, there better be ice cream involved).  I also think the Grand Canyon is beautiful and recommend people see it if they get the chance.  However, your kids are small and you will probably worry that they will fall in.  It does happen.  There are places right at the main village area where you are on a path with only a knee high wall separating you from a whole lot of empty space.  I would wait for the kids to grow a bit so you don't spend all your time worrying about them.    I recommend San Diego.  The zoo there is great for kids.  Lego Land would be ok for your kids, but be warned it is an amusement park for little kids.  There is nothing there for adults or older children.  The area along the bay is nice.  There are some ships anchored there, including an aircraft carrier that you can tour.  Instead of taking a harbor cruise, you can ride the ferry across and back.  You still see the bay, and the city from the bay, but there is less time for the kids to get impatient, and the cost is less.  You can drive to the beach from San Diego.  You can see the light house at Point Lomma.    I'm sure there is more that I forgot.    Good luck, and have fun.|`|AA10067514	I like Justin D.s  answer.  I lived in San Diego for over 40 years and have recently moved to west Phoenix.  You have beaches, bays, Sea World, the San Diego Z00, Wild Animal Park, Balboa Park, the USS Midway aircraft carrier museum, harbor cruises, fishing and also the Childrens pool in La Jolla that full of sea lions for the kids to watch.  My wife made a video for you tube.  Check it out.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2-pggut2...    Hope this helps and good luck on whatever you decide to do.|`|AvYycLOTaa	California has alot to offer such as, Disneyland, the beach, etc. But, I would reccomend southern Utah. The red rocks are beautiful, take your family to Bryce Canyon. There are lots of parks in that area for your family to hang out and have a picnic.|`|R46f2nn9aa	VEGAS!!!    or even California, there's six flags there or Disneyland|`|ryjnt3dhaa	Six Flags in Mesa?  Salt River tubing is fun, too.  The Apache Trail up to the Hoover Dam is a nice site seeing trip.|`|Jso4seaVaa	Head north and drive through Sedona and take the back way to the Grand Canyon.  You can make stops in Flagstaff and Jerome which are pretty neat places.  Those are all good places to hike but you can still enjoy them driving around and just taking in the sites since you got the young ones.  Pretty much take a look at an AZ map and plan a route up north.  (also, you can take the drive from Jerome to Prescott which is very pretty).  Have fun!|`|gxblnBLraa	WOW. yeah. Vegas, with infants. There's an intelligent response.    WOW. yeah. Tubing, in February. The answers just keep getting better.|`|oMTsDcNBaa	Actually, Graywolf, the weather in Arizona is really warm already so I don't think tubing would be a problem.    You could go to California and go to Disneyland and etc. or Flagstaff or Prescott to see some snow.     And Las Vegas? With young kids? Right.......
ryjnt3dhaa	Uh, nope.  Dude, there's like at least a few million people in Atlanta.  You may want to narrow the scope of your question a little.  Like, what neighborhood does he live in or where does he work?|`|ewd9n2lRaa	Nope.|`|H6N3IPYmaa	Sorry I don't but you can do a people search in your search engine.
KS2OHXCRaa	For Disneyland Paris, it'll be alright re the accommodation as your boyfriend is over 18 and therefore can legally book both of you in to the hotel. It's fine that you're under 18. Think of situation of say, siblings going to Disneyland without their parents. The eldest may be 18 and the younger siblings under 18. They'll still be allowed there.     As for the ticket to Disneyland, anyone over 11 has to pay full price adult ticket anyway. So there is no need to pretend anything.    Ps: sorry can't tell you re accommodation situation in Florida but for the entrance ticket, it's the same. In fact, in Florida, if you're over 10, you'll have to pay the full price adult ticket.|`|OugNf0x6aa	I think it's okay, but I'm not quite sure. Have fun at Paris. Do Space Mountain: Mission 2!

OJcWrMADaa	depending on the country but in yemen its about 5 bucks really cheap|`|diaSqz8laa	cooked? frozen? fresh? alive? The prices of food products in the Middle East are relatively lower than North America. Even with the rise in food costs, it is still relatively cheaper. Especially if you calculate the exchange rate. A chicken costs 10sr to about 12sr frozen. now do the math: 10sr divided by 3.75 to get that dollar amount. And at a local Middle eastern restaurant you can get a family meal (whole chicken and rice) for less than 20sr. Again, do the math!|`|vtafeEIJaa	Inflation at the moment could not let you have the fix price..just hold on till the war ended in the middle east
5G9WGH0Baa	This is north of the Northern Quarter - or Cardroom and Ancoats as they used to call it. I think these days they have reverted to an older name for the area, New Islington.     If you've been through the neighbourhood, you will have spotted a huge amount of building works going on. Lots of new flats are going in and most of the old warehouses and mills are being renovated. It still looks like a building site and there aren't many shops going in yet, plus most of the old local pubs have shut. Also, work has stopped on some of the developments because their funding has dried up or the developer has fled the country (serious).    I think the canal basin developments will be lovely once they are done, but in the meantime the flats going up look isolated with few local amenities aside from a new GP surgery.    It's a bit of a trail from the city centre as well, but there is more car parking space and even some bits of greenery compared to the Northern Quarter.    If you can find a good deal on buying a flat here then go for it, because in 5 years when the economy is turned around things will be looking up in this area.    But if you're wanting a better quality of life, closer to the city centre with more local amenities then have a look around the Northern Quarter proper.|`|ZxY0Z8pfaa	Manchester is the European Capital of Gun Crime, I would avoid the place at all costs!|`|lyDzjMfcaa	North Manchester is sh8t.  At least live in Bolton (it's reasonably quiet up there)     South Manchester is much better.      Sorry.|`|4786d32b584fcb26c69f4fab5c440db6aa	This area would win no prizes for beauty, but it isn't that bad.    There are some council flats that have character and the old Royal Mail sorting office has been made into swish apartments. It is very handy for the city centre, but it is busy with traffic.    Off the Rochdale road, there is a good old fashioned boozer that sells real ale at reasonable prices.     The area has potential if the incompetent council spends some money on it.

m7DU6i6jaa	go to Aqua World.... they specialize in all kinds of water activities and also parasailing.  they are the safest place to go if you want to parasail.|`|zJzUjYeTaa	On the beach behind Grande Caribe Real Resort, I believe that is how you spell it. There is a tiki hut that says parasailing. you give them your name and money  and then there you go... hehe. thats what I did.|`|sUTU3F5Saa	I know you asked about para sailing, sounds like fun, however did you know that Hurricane season starts in May and that there were several during that period exactly where you are heading.  Just good advice|`|HzqK9Q3waa	First off, watch the parasailers first. In Mexico, it's unregulated. I went one morning, early, before there were any others out. One came up and our lines got crossed...jerked straight down into the ocean, screaming the entire time. The guys jumped off the boat, grabbed the sail first, then pulled me in. They had me get out behind the shore break...so I had to swim in!     We've been going to Mexico for years. Once every few years we see a pretty major accident...one lady slammed into the side of a building, broken legs from bad landings, etc.    Take all this with a grain of salt, however, since my folks, my siblings and thousands of people go up every year with no incidents at all.
cxNLOPHNaa	They are excellent! I have used them many times without any problems. I also find that their prices are often a few dollars cheaper than other sites.    Besides booking the hotels. Vegas.com is also reliable for shows and even restaurant bookings. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.|`|urHPuzMsaa	Vegas.com is the premiere Vegas site. Some deals are limited and sell out fast Now if the hotel website says it's sold out but vegas.com still has it available that means that vegas.com was given so many of the deals to sell and still has them. It is safe to book with them. Your reservation and price are guaranteed.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	You can make hotel reservations on that website, since they offer some good deals. There are many similar websites that does the same thing though.|`|1zy9ckbzaa	Yes, i have made a couple of hotel reservations on their website and never had a problem.|`|AA11536773	It's totally legit. It actually books airfare thru USAirways. What happens is that they get a certain number of rooms or whatever to sell at a certain rate - even if the hotel is essentially sold out directly.
DAnHZ4VSaa	Angie D,      If you are flying, you can bring one carry on, one personal item, as well as check two bags not exceeding 50 LBS.      Chances are your cab driver will help you get your bags in and out of the car, but when you are moving around you will be mostly on your own with your things.  If you can't carry everything you are bringing--I'd say you are bringing too much.      You can find some travel tips in regards to packing here: http://www.vagabondbible.com/articles/cp...     Those should help you lose some of that extra weight in your bags and solve your problem of having more than you can carry.  Enjoy Equador--it's a beautiful country.     -Joey P  http:www.vagabondbible.com|`|R4jDg5Ksaa	I think it generally depends on the airline but from my extensive travel experience it's always been one carryon (fairly small sized) , one personal item, and you can check in two suitcases not to exceed 50ibs or you have to pay a fine and have to pay a fine for any more than that.

DTNlqnOEaa	For 350 you will be living in one room, and sharing the bathroom and kitchen with at least  3 other people.

pXRsAWMfaa	If you hated the Blue Streak, you are most likely not going to like Gemini, Millenium Force, or Magnum.  Your friend is right...the Corkscrew is probably the next tamest ride, with the exception of maybe the Wildcat.  The Mine Ride is pretty tame, but it is really rough (it has gotten really rough over the years and it now makes my neck and back hurt).  My recommendation would be to try the Corkscrew...when I first rode it, I closed my eyes during the corkscrews (upside down parts...I think there are three), and I was less afraid.  If you are terrified of going upside down, try the Wildcat.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i liked the X-flight (its not so bad)  the villain is the scariest one i thought because its an old wooden one|`|912184e16e910db90a6979b2d6ebeeb9aa	Millenium Force.

The Villian and Knight Flight are Geauga Lake rides you idiot, she is talking about Cedar Point.    The best coaster there by far would be the Maverick.  It isn't the highest or the fastest, but the best.  It is long, uses new compressor technology to shoot you off, and spins you in several angles (not upsidown) and after you get off you are shocked that the ride was only 105 feet tall.    Millenium Force is good, but gets old and the only good part is the first hill really.  The Top Thrill Dragster is the 2nd tallest and 3rd fastest coaster in the world, but it is only a 20 second ride for a 1-2 hour wait.|`|AA10464425	I've known some persons that are afraid of the other roller coasters, but who just love the Raptor.  Once you ride it, it's addictive, which is why the lines are so long.  It's so smooth, you'll actually feel like a bird.  It's very different than the positive G/negative G coasters.  Of course, you have to ride it the first time in order to treasure the experience.  Personally, I don't consider the Raptor any scarier than the Iron Dragon, just much better.    I've also known some persons that wouldn't ride other coasters that fell in love with the Gemini, and rode it over and over, especially at night, when often there is no waiting line.    I also know some persons that won't set foot on even the mine ride or the Iron Dragon.  They love the flying swings!    One friend who loves the Raptor won't ride the Corkscrew because it bangs around her head too much.    BTW, are you afraid to fly ("BIG FAST THINGS?")?

From trains to Taxi's and choaches to public buses and of course a hire car.     So why not arrive in Belfast of Dublin and go explore, if your looking for true irish culture you have to experience both the North and the South.     The North with 6 counties is said to be something like the 10th most geographical country in the world and is the smallest with the most from The Giants causeway in co.airtime to the marble arches in Co.Germana no to much lots of green grass and little villages with only one corner shop and a church. There the people are friendly but at the same time still very secretive about there lives.     then tthreesthe South and Donegall where the other 26 counties are. There you will find out loads more about the people and there still more irish culture. it's what you will expect ireland to be like. it's more Historical than Geographical. What more can i say.     sorry if i break your bubble but ireland has few thatched cottages, there are no lepacons but there are lots of people with red hair.     have a great time when you go

cWmROVe1aa	oh that must be so frustrating for her! and for you...im planning on moving to australia for a year (on a working holiday visa) and im really afraid i will fall in love with it! Sadly, Australia has very strict laws on immigration.

SiniSj1eaa	Well let me tell you. I just moved to Seattle from Kansas City a little over a year ago..so I can give you some insight on what changes you can really expect.    Seattle is about 100% more liberal then the midwest. It is also about 100% more yuppy. Its also a LOT more expensive than the midwest. The lifestyle out here is different but I cant really put my finger on it. People are just different..      The whether is a lot different than the midwest too. The winters arent as cold, but it does rain a lot more than in the middle of the country and honestly if your not from here it can take some getting used to at first...One thing you will love is that the summers arent non stop 90 degrees with 100% humidity.     It can be a change moving from a small town to Seattle. Traffic will make you want to blow your head off and like I said its just a different feel..    If your liberal, love music, the arts, the outdoors, meeting diverse people, and drinking beer than I think you will like Seattle. (WA has the most beer drinkers per capita in the US...I just learned this on a pub tour. which is another thing...lots of pubs in WA..and winerys..)  It def seems like there is a ton more to do out here. Plus its way prettier than the midwe    Oh an be prepared to wait two hours at the licensing burro...    If your really looking for change than def move..you will get it : )|`|1pQK1u6daa	The whole "rain" thing is overblown.  I have lived there for 6 years and yes it does rain but not to the extent that Seattle has gotten a reputation of.|`|XnrMRQxHaa	it's fun. it's still a smalltown because most of it doesn't see tourists|`|9JHf7vsQaa	Ok first of all, i live in seattle, and i love it.

LOVE seattle.  MOVE THERE!!!!!|`|pgFD4n1Caa	The weather is not that bad. You get used to the rain. What I don't ever get used to is the many days of no sunshine but really our summers make up for it. Summer is Seattle is amazing.    It's a fairly liberal town with loads of environmentally conscious, educated and well read citizens.    Lots of personality especially in all the little neighborhoods like on the AVE, Ballard, Fremont, Wallingford, Phinney, West Seattle/Alki, Greenwood, Queen Anne etc..    I think the neighborhoods make a small community feel but this is definately a city with hustle and bustle.  Seattle (especially downtown and the local neighborhoods within are really starting to hunker down and frequent neighborhood markets and small privately owned shops.  We (for the most part)shy away from the strip malls of suburbia.

70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Egyptian astronomers could roughly predict what time of year it would flood based on the appearance of the star Sirius in the eastern morning sky, however, the accuracy of the day was always dependant on the rains in the eastern central highlands to the south.  As such, when the Nile did flood, it was usually very violent and the people, animals, and buildings in the flood plain were often casualties of the onslaught of water.|`|679I210Yaa	Piranas|`|0KR4wyoQaa	with the floods|`|496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	The amount of rain that had fallen in the Ethiopian and Ugandan mountain which are the source of the Nile river could not be estimated therefore until the inundation reached the region of the third cataract the Egyptians had no way of knowing whether that years inundation would bring enough water or too much.   They knew withing a few day of the expected arrival of the flood waters by the helical rising of the star Sothis or Sirius as we know it,  Then by a system of nilometers places that were constructed at regular intervals along the Nile, the height and intensity of the inundation could be measured correctly,recorded and those down river alerted if a flood was imminent.  The ancient Egyptians never knew the source of the Nile or the real reason for the annual inundation pattern. According to their mythology it sprang from a sacred spring that was located somewhere in the inhospitable South West regions,
urHPuzMsaa	The Hilton Grand Vacations is a really nice looking place but not a great location even though it is on the strip. You could always take a bus or even the trolly. It isn't that far for a cab to charge only a few bucks.It is in the middle of nowhere with a lot of construction going on around it.     Summer Bay resorts is in a seedy area. They did clear out the drug area on the corner there but I would not want to walk around there at night. However I do believe they have a shuttle that runs constantly to and from the strip. I would not walk it with a shady little one room motels along there.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Its pretty safe to walk in Las Vegas if you know where your at. Usually on the strip there are many People that cruise along by the strip. It should be safe.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	I love the Summer Bay resorts, i recommend them all the time...yes it is a safe walk, i last stayed there for 5 nights over martin luther weekend and was absolutely fine--never even had a concern and this was at ALL hours of the night (most nights i was walking home between 4-5am)...its only about a 4 minute walk from Imperial Casino so you're never walking into no mans land per se...the suites are  amazing at summer bay too    fyi, a cab was only about $6 from harrahs right to summer bay, in case you felt nervous with some cash on you..but i really never saw any potential problems the whole time i was there..use common sense and you'll be fine|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Yes, indeed, take a CAB!  I could not figure out why on earth you said you  would "have" to walk back to your hotel.  If you have that kind of money, you can certainly afford a cab.  Another thought...do NOT carry large amounts of money like that in your pocket or wallet.  Carry smaller amounts and use your  ATM card when needed. Also, never put ALL your cash in your wallet...use a money belt or put it in other places on your person....so if someone ever gets your wallet, or you lose it, not all your money is gone.|`|KGgPtU8zaa	I definately wouldnt walk. Are you sure neither of those hotels have shuttles to the strip? I stayed at the Gold Coast which is off the strip and they had shuttles.|`|boWDjT9Gaa	Although there is plenty of neon to light your paths, be safe and rent a car or use public transportation (bus or cab or casino shuttle) at night. If you like to walk, choose the place that is closest to the Strip (no more than one or two blocks) and stay in the well lit areas with the most traffic.|`|C4ULrvnKaa	Any walk around Vegas at that time is not the safest alone, so I would say the shortest walk would be the best. This depends on where you like to play. I'm going to assume mid-strip here, so I'd go with the Summer Bay Resorts.    However, I would just hop a $5 cab to avoid this altogether. Seems to me a $5 investment ($10 MAX) is worth it to avoid the risk of losing $500 - $2K.    Good luck at the tables!|`|8VrlRUfhaa	If you have that much in your pocket...take a cab. Safer...much safer. People can and will follow you out of a casino if they see you are a winner.

HziXc5Ovaa	I haven't been there, but have been to Cayo Coco. The Cayos are beautiful.   However, I do have a couple of friends who went to Melia Cayo Santa Maria. They loved it there.     As for jellyfish, they are everywhere in Cuba but are not usually a problem. If there has been a big storm though and the waves are rough, there may be more of a tendancy to find them closer to shore the next day.    But don't worry too much about jellyfish. The odds of being stung are not that high. And if it does happen, just go to the restaurant on the beach and get vinegar for the sting (IF anything happens). Everything'll be just fine.    I'm sure you'll love it there. And being a Sol Melia resort, you'll be ensured excellent quality and service.    Have a great time.|`|RhkKGsipaa	I have never been there however friends have and they loved it.  Check trip advisor reviews below.  You may find out about jelly fish.

A large close hotel to Busch Gardens with an indoor pool is the Comfort Inn. You can also stay at the La Quinta and the Best Western.   I suggest you stay in Lake Buena Vista to be close to Disney World as you will spend more time there than the other places. Do be sure to go to Universal Studios Islands of Adventure. The college kids go there. If you are staying that long you might want to rent a time share direct from an owner that is near Disney. Go to www.redweek.com, www.tug2.com or http://www.timeshareownerscommunity.com/  You can go to www.tripadvisor.com to get information about the place.

If you're in the market for a car, I'm sure you can wheel and deal, seeing as how not too many people are buying right now.|`|wFBVuBOkaa	My stepdad and I have each bought cars from Phil Long Ford in Denver. The salesman was Derrick Brown, and he was awesome. He's very concerned with getting people into the right car, and when I proposed a more expensive car within my budget he actually said that he didn't think I needed it and the next step down would be perfectly fine. He also waited for several months until the timing was just right, both for my budget and for the right car to come along instead of one they just had to get rid of. My stepdad's had his car for several months, and he's thrilled; I've been taking my old car there for service for two years and have been very happy, and I've had the new car for two days.    My husband and I bought two cars earlier from Burt Ford. The salesman we had first was awesome, but he got promoted. Within a year the sales staff and the service department got HORRIBLE all of a sudden, lying about repairs or equipment they hadn't even checked on the second car we bought (which we nearly returned under the Lemon Laws), putting us off, and the last straw was when they failed to replace a fluid just before we were taking a major road trip and we found out about 1500 miles away in the middle of nowhere. It's a shame because we liked Burt at first, but once the staff changed it got so I couldn't trust my own safety while driving.

It is a visitors visa that would necessitate a trip to Seoul to switch to a work visa. The one thing you cannot do is obtain a working holiday visa outside your own country-you need to go to the London embassy.|`|DAnHZ4VSaa	Makoto M,     Japan has a very beaurocratic system when it comes to alien paperwork.  Obtaining a holiday visa is easy, all you have to do is show up in Japan with a valid passport and they will give you a 90 day visitor visa.      Due to my experience, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your holiday visa changed to a work visa once you are already in the country, unless you have a connection.  If you plan on working, I'd suggest trying to get a work visa before you go over there.  If you are really dead set on working there, then you can just get a holiday visa and take your chances.  Hope that helps.      -Joey P  http://www.vagabondbible.com|`|5ZtSR0IQaa	A British citizen gets a Japanese working holiday visa that is good for 1 year. It cannot get extended, and you can only get a working holiday visa once.    It's theoretically possible to get a work visa from a job you get on a working holiday visa, but the requirements are the same as getting a work visa from scratch. You would need a college degree that relates to the field or equivalent experience.    Citizens of Australia, New Zealand and Canada get a working holiday visa for 6 months that may be extended for another 6 months, so everyone gets a working holiday for a maximum of 1 year and no longer.
VxtSO8BGaa	"Hi" ...If you have 2 full days one of the things you should get is a "Transit Pass" which is good on the buses,the Sky Train, and the Sea Bus ( inexpensive harbour tour to North Vancouver)....this gives you access to to Grouse Mountain which is a must see ! Snowball fights are allowed ! *lol*    With a transit pass you can also visit via the sky train and all of the outlying areas ( Burnaby, New Westrminster etc etc.) and even taking public transportation all the way to Victoria on Vancouver Island which if you can you should see as it is our Provincial Capital and quite beautiful also.!     Going to Victoria is a full day however and probably not worth it with your limited schedule.    Greyhound goes to Whistler (Home for the 2010 winter Olympics) from Vancouver and that's certainly worth a look at...the Sea to Sky Highway is quite spectacular and rather interesting at certain moments ! lol   Again however a full day is required!    Now as concerns beautiful downtown Vancouver itself there is a varity of things to do, from Granville Island, to Gas Town,Robson St., China Town, Stanley Park, Vancouver Art Gallery, the Lookout, Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver Museum and Observatory, Imax Theatre and great shopping and lots of Pubs and great multinational "food" places ! *lol     I'd suggest you "Yahoo" some of the places I mentioned and you'll be pleasantly surprised as thay are all easy to get to. You'll find when you are here that Vancouver that is a safe city and one can walk around and just enjoy the many facets it has to offer quite easily !     The spectacular views of ocean and mountain are complimentary of course ! *lol*    I'm not sure if this is your idea of etertainment but one of the things that you may very well enjoy is the "Antropology Museum" at U.B.C...it is world class actually and explains B.C. from it's earliest days ( Ice Age )and has one of the best "First Nations" exhibits, bar none, anywhere in the world...seriously !    If there is a hockey game at the "Garage" you must promise me that you will go...that's required by Canadian law actually ! ( Just kidding lol)    Anyway there is tons to do and you won't be bored !    Here's some interactive maps...for navigation purposes and a good web site as regards Vancouver......  http://www.tourismvancouver.com/visitors...

1e8abd4777bb514fbe2fb7062f56e90daa	Due to the economy...yes. I am subscribed to a lot of emailing lists for the hotels because  I like Vegas. And I've been getting like 2-3 emails a day from a random big casino offering new deals all the time now. And before it was only for slow nights that werent during the weekend...and now weekends are even included in their deals. It is definitely due to the economy. People either a) don't have jobs and therefore dont have money for vacation or b) have jobs but have no idea how long they may have it for so they are saving money and also therefore not spending it on vacation.    So yes all things vacation related, flights, hotels, etc...are starting to drop in price to attract customers. Supply and Demand. The demand is low and therefore Vegas can no longer rip off it's customers as badly as 6-8 months ago. Take advantage of it if you can. Sadly I am one of those who cannot...I'm person B lol.        ~G|`|QRnVLT6laa	Absolutely..I know somebody who just booked a hotel in the Palms for under $100/night.  Ridiculously awesome.|`|urHPuzMsaa	They have really bottomed out. I have not seen them this low in over 15 years. Just price them out on this site.    http://www.sidestep.com/hotels|`|KGgPtU8zaa	YES! They are very cheap right now!!|`|mAV5MJQnaa	I don't think the prices will drop. My predicament is that it will probably be the same, even if the economy changes, it just depends on the revenues and price.|`|AA10240904	Yes, there are great deals due to the economy but you need to deal directly with the hotel-casino and not one of those travel sites.  Example the RJ newspaper said rooms at Encore (brand new) are $200 a night but there are lots of other deals|`|yvPA8FSsaa	You can find very reasonable rates if your dates are flexible.  If you avoid Friday and Saturday nights expecially.  Some hotels list the prices of each day on their rates calendars.  As you can see, they can vary with demand.  If there is a very popular event or series of events going on or large conventions, the rooms prices spike up.  If not they can go way down.     *|`|AA11778996	Yes they are dropping and I have not seen them this desperate since I have lived here... The locals are getting even better deals!!
oh3m8LvZaa	Your frequent flier   is assigned to you when you create an account with the airline.  When you fly or use certain credit cards, points are deposited into your account.  You can then redeem these points for flights.      If you're just trying to book a flight, you might be in the wrong section.  Go to the home page and start over.      However, if you're trying to use your frequent flier points, you may need to call the airline and see if you have the correct number.

18dfc839b17ffa85da787eba58285f05aa	I've lived on the eastside of Palmdale since 2003.  We do have some crime in this area, but no worse than I would expect in any other moderately sized city.  If you are planning to move here, you might want to consider living on the west side of town; they tend to have fewer problems with gangs and so forth.  Our crime rate does tend to be higher than the national average, but it has gone down over the past several years.  I've posted a link to city data; hopefully it will help you in the decision-making process.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Palmdale is as hot as Hades in the summer and the coldest place in LA County in the winter. It is crime ridden and the furthest away place from the stuff in LA you want to go to.

It has changed allot because of all the affordable housing.  It grew awfully fast in the 90's.  Too much too soon.  It got the rep of being crime ridden, not true.  They only reference it had to go on was the rural country it was in the 70's and 80's.  Granted we DO lock our doors and are aware when we are out and about, but its not any worse than any other city.     I actually have not a one friend who I can say who has been burgled or had a car etc. stolen.  If it were as crime ridden as some would have you believe I would at least know one person don't you think?     Here is a link to our local paper. http://www.avpress.com/  this should give you some insight too.

EDIT...thanks for the thumbs down by the way.....very strange..|`|oCMrcnu0aa	A bit harsh, my friend!  I have to agree that it sends the wrong sort of signal when schools and offices can be closed by a few inches of snow and when we find it acceptable that public transport is suspended.  It does make me ashamed to be British.  Have we really fallen so far?  That is beyond disappointing and tells the rest of the world all they need to know about the state of Britain today.|`|62RKtkOhaa	It's not people all over the UK that skive when it snows. The people of Scotland get on with it, as do the Welsh and Northern Irish - who does that leave? Oh yes...the English, THAT'S who skives!|`|u8CFwtyMaa	You are right, the UK seems to be surprised when it snows in the winter. I think the schools problem is that they don't want to be sued by some parent because their little child fell over in the playground.  In this last week, local authorities have been running out of salt, which is understandable, I mean it's only been one year since they last had a winter, and had to use it.|`|dDhA7RX6aa	Because the roads are dangerous and its better to have the children alive than to miss a few days of school. Plus snow is educational in iteself! Its fun!|`|a15Qozf9aa	I think it is due to lack of committment, any excuse to skive. Most people who tend to skive and use snow as an excuse are salaried staff and they get paid regardless. If they were hourly paid they would make a greater effort.   In Germany where I come from we had longer and more severe winters in the 50's and 60's and I do not recall a missed school day due to snow. It was our responsibility to get to school despite a 2 mile walk along icy pavements. We just had to allow for it and leave the house earlier.|`|0h8z20cAaa	Well I was off school today because of the snow that fell overnight. We don't skive though, the school will be closed because the site is too dangerous or not enough teachers can make it in (some of them live quite far away) etc. It is too dangerous too bring us in because there is the risk of injuries etc. It would be the schools fault then if one of us was hurt. I love snow days, they're fantastic. We don't get much snow in England, especially not where I live in the East Midlands so it isn't like the school is closed a lot of the time.|`|Tjp1ewFRaa	Dangerous!!! We finally got sent to school today and some one fractured their ankle on the ice.|`|B60DqKCRaa	Where I live in London we had 13inches of snow Monday morning. The roads were not clear there was no public transport. Bad government planning? Maybe but when we're just not used to having so much snow (and are unlikely to have it again anytime soon) the government are unlikely to invest more than the little they have done.    I don't think that the teachers are too lazy to go to work, it just wasn't possible for them to reach the schools due to the road and transport situation. Even if they had been able to reach, would there have been enough teachers who could make it for the correct teacher to pupil ratio? Maybe not, and if some incident had happened, maybe a kid fell over, broke a leg etc etc then there would've been uproar that there was not adequate supervision.    All in all personally I don't think you can blame the teachers, or the parents, or even the children. Blame the culture which means people sue others for injuries to claim compensation and the government for not having the resources to handle with out of the ordinary weather conditions.    Also you sound so angry - chill out!

Your need a four year degree to work in Japan. I never heard of a "mater degree". The main job is teaching English. You must have a good command of English to teach English.Other jobs are few and far between. Unless you have a special skill a Japanese doesn't have, chances of finding work are near zero.You need a solid job offer to qualify for a work visa.There are many young Japanese out of work right now. And jobs will always go to them first. Sorry.
gQBJhuxLaa	Most likely some herbal Raki.  After food diggester.|`|94b8KImYaa	Most likely ouzo. How did it taste ?|`|FaX8awk1aa	probably ouzo|`|S1uPEgbTaa	Not possible to be ouzo.  The only post-shot I have served is liquor.    I don't know what kind of though|`|gVIcEoNRaa	It is unheard of ouzo being served after lunch, as a drink to help digestion.  Even tsipouro or raki (or tsikoudia) which are very similar in taste and in terms of.... strength are not usually served afterwards.    Both ouzo and tsipouro (raki as well) are intented to be consumed in small sips and definitely not as shots (unless you wish to get drunk in 0.68 seconds...)    Ouzo has a more... sweet taste.. hmmmm.. more like a sweet burn taste, compared to tsipouro and raki and leaves an aftertaste in your mouth. Plus, ouzo "plays" with your nose as well...  Tsiouro and raki have a more... burning taste down the throat and are less playful with the nostrils.    In either case, what matters the most is if you enjoyed your drink :-)|`|YU471WSsaa	well the only thing i know that gets bought to your table by the waiter is in a measure of spirits..which wine is usally pored in to mostly the house wine in most resturant the measure is called a betoni..i think? but now that you said that its meant to help digest your food... how ver this is not like water..its yellow to .pee..colour...and its  RETZINA... horrible stuff i call it PAINT STIPPER... some know it as hock wine..its distilled from the vine of the grapes... and is drunk by many a greek but not by this one..,,YUCKKKKKK... i do use it as apaint stripper..lol..iam sure that would help u digest any thing..|`|2dWlUEimaa	I don't think it was ouzo, as Greeks don't typically do shots of ouzo. Usually ouzo is brought to you in the bottle along with a tall glass and a bucket of ice (so that you can drink it on the rocks as is most commonly done) and is sipped. Also, I've personally never seen or heard of ouzo-shots being offered in any restaurant, or bar for that matter.    My guess is it was raki (or possibly tsipouro, but much more likely raki), which is a Cretan spirit which in its pure form is akin to vodka in appearance and taste. Sometimes raki is sweetened or spiced before being served. Depending on the restaurant, at the end of your meal a shot glass of raki may be brought for each person at the table - this happens especially in restaurants that are owned/operated by Cretans. Just because it comes in a shot glass doesn't mean you actually have to shoot it, however, as many Greeks sip even strong spirits like raki, tsipouro, etc.    *****  for Min: You're crazy - retsina is great! :-)|`|wOkQYp7Laa	fish heads                    i think ................. idk|`|zZEHB2WIaa	It could be anything if it was free.

RpWxB3ASaa	Depending on the crossing, there may or may not be a building still standing.  You are still required to slow down, as the police may still be running a checkpoint for the trucks, but normal cars are not stopped.    As stated before, this is because of the Schengen Agreement, which allows free passage between the member countries.  Please note:  this does not waive the requirement to still have your passport.    http://www.axa-schengen.com/english/sche...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Ag...|`|94b8KImYaa	No, they don't. You have to slow down at the actual border and the place is abandoned.   Saying this, police could still be on either side of the border and feel like stopping you - but in general no.|`|Jm3vMKx3aa	There are no regular passport controls on internal Schengen borders.  The Czech Republic has started to adopt the Schengen rules and become a full member of the Schengen zone on December 21, 2007. Therefore you still have seen those previous customs and border protection buildings which have not yet been demolished.  Regular border controls have been abolished between France and Germany already in 1995.

If you fly into Dublin, a bus called the Aircoach runs from Dublin airport to Cork every other hour between 7am and 7pm (but you have to change buses in Dublin city).

AA10662056	I don't exactly know what you mean by pleasure drink. But I guess the answer is yes.    Addition:  In Japan, tea as well as green tea are sold in PET. And people put it in a fridge. So I think the answer is yes, after all.|`|AA11664474	In the '70s soda was as popular as tea in Japan.  Everywhere you went you saw the Coca-Cola logo.  Things may be have swung back the other way now.  Oh, and Nehi drinks were also popular.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	Yeah, you should move to Japan.    Even the "tea" that you get in American supermarkets, Walgreens, convenience stores, etc. isn't really what Japanese would consider tea.  It's more like sugar-water flavoured with a bit of tea or artificial tea flavour.    Japanese like their tea.  That goes for highschool kids too.  "Sweet" isn't necessarily "good" in Japan.  A nice cold oolong tea hits the spot and can be found just about anywhere, even in a vending machine amongst the rice fields in the countryside.    There are many varieties of tea, hot or cold.    Soda is popular with kids in Japan, but it's rare to find people who drink it regularly.  There are less kinds and the bottles are smaller than in the U.S.  There isn't really a preference for Coke or Pepsi.  Both are just called "Cola".  Nobody's going to get mad if one is substituted for the other.  Melon soda is popular with kids.|`|3xwFPL4naa	In the US when you look at a vending machine or a supermarket or convenience store drink isle, you see hundreds of sodas and maybe a couple tea-flavored drinks, most of which have a lot of sugar and artificial flavoring added.    In Japan, it's the opposite.  They have dozens of teas (most having no sugar or additives), and a few sodas.  Coca-cola is everywhere but other than that, don't count on your favorite soda being available in Japan.  Especially root beer and Dr. Pepper.  For some reason, almost all Japanese people are absolutely disgusted by root beer and Dr. Pepper.|`|dbAWPWzraa	we drink them to enjoy the taste, replace the water we lost.

t58rc9tCaa	First, learn this.  Radical Islam = Mainstream Islam  Why? Because hating infidels, stoning adulterers to death, killing apostates, cutting off the hands of thieves, flogging fornicators and alcoholics, and making war on non-Muslims until they accept the life of a second-class "dhimmi" citizen under an Islamic government and "feel themselves subdued", among many other things, ARE Islam. They are in the commands of Islam's most authoritative sacred literature: The Holy Qur'an, from Allah, and the Sahih (or authentic) Hadith of Muhammad, in the most rigorous collections of Bukhari, Muslim, Sunan ibn Dawood, etc.    "Moderate" Islam is an invention of Muslims living in the West. It began with the first attempts to introduce Islam to Westerners in this century. For example, if you speak Arabic and read Yusuf Ali's translation of the Qur'an for the English (dating back to the 1930s), you can see in the infamous verse in Surat an Nisa' allowing men to beat their wives, he translates, "...beat them [lightly]..." when there is nothing in the original Arabic to suggest "light beating."    There is no difference between moderate and mainstream Islam. Muslims in Europe who portray their religion in colors welcoming to a Western audience, i.e. "human rights," "women's rights," "freedom of religion," etc, are mainstream Muslim expansionists. They still hate Jews, support all the barbaric practices of the Sharee'ah, and everything else. They just know how to hide it.    Like who? Like Cat Stevens, who converted to Islam and renamed himself Yusuf Islam, and in the 1980s expressed support for the Salman Rushdie death fatwa.  Or like New Zealand's first Muslim MP, who admitted that he did not think stoning to death should be rejected in Muslim society.  Or like the head of the Council of American Islamic Relations, who said that Islam should be the dominant religion in America and the Qur'an its constitution.  Or like the head of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, who said that any Muslim who dies fighting Israel will go to heaven.  Like 36 percent of "moderate" young British Muslims who agree that the punishment for leaving Islam should be death.    "Secular" Islam is something else. Secular Islam is not an invention of Muslim expansionists or apologists. Secular Islam is a genuine solution developed by people who are sick and tired of Sharee'ah and medieval barbarity but do not want to hate anyone and look for a constructive solution. Remember Muslims in the West want to populate Western countries and spread the influence of their religion--they have no reason to back secularism. Some Muslim politicians were progressive and wanted their new countries to be secular, like Mustafa Kemal Ataturk or Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Some Muslims lose faith in Islam because of how it's practiced, and then come back and try to promote a secular image for it, like Michael Muhammad Knight.    There is no way you can practice the Sharee'ah or many Islamic beliefs on other religions and be civilized. The only solution to the Muslim problem is to secularize Islam. Islam is the last religion on earth that has not been separated from politics, and that's why Muslims are living in the Middle Ages.|`|DenLZAL1aa	Fundamentalist Islam ia a religion rooted in seventh century teachings that are fundamentally opposed to democracy and equality.     Radical Islamists are utterly contemptuous of all "infidels" (non-Muslims) and regard them as enemies worthy of death.    Mandrassas in America and Canada  are increasing in number and they are one part of a growing radical Islamic army on Canadian and US soil.    Radical Islam exploits the US legal system and America's protection of religion to spread the hatred for western values.    This declaration of war has not come from nationals of a particular country. Thet owe allegiance only to Mohammed's original idealogy. They represent no country. They do not wear the uniform of a country's armed forces. Radical Islamists consider all people, in or out of uniform , who do not believe in the original Islam if Mohammed, to be the enemy untill they convert or subject to Islamic Law.    Even so-called "moderate" Muslims, who don't agree with these jihadists' devotion to the purest form of Islam or their terror tactics, respect their passion and commitment. Some moderates support these efforts with money.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	real muslims respect other religions, are peaceful, love their children, and are good citizens of their countries.    fanatical muslims want to kill members of other religions, think that war is the only solution to their problems, are happy to see their children die in war, and don't care what happens to fellow citizens.    i think there are a couple real ones in india. or so i've heard.|`|qzsDSsoWaa	the same as fanatical Jews and regulr Jews, the same as Fanatical Christian and regular Christian, what did you discover.  Another wise question, .... you know you remind me another YA user....LOL  He knows who I'm tralking about.|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	Same difference as Zionist Jews and Regular Jews...|`|B5Y46XBoaa	Yes there is a difference, but that difference lies only in what they are called to do in their struggle (jihad) to make Islam the global government and only accepted religion. This is all spelled out in the Qur'an and hadith. While some are called to serve in areas such as politics, education and science, others are called to infiltrate non-Muslim countries, spread propaganda to sell Islam as peaceful or by doing damage control. (We see a lot of that here at Y/A)  In the case of the so-called "fanatics", they simply serve as the military or fighting wing of Islam.     If you look closely you will see that there is very little difference in how Islam is organized and how countries such as Russia and Cuba operate, with the one exception that all the agencies involved answer to the religious leaders. And those religious leaders only barely speak disapprovingly about the mujahideen when talking to the media in the west. Behind the scenes they are highly revered, supported and supplied by the very people who claim they don't represent Islam and aren't following Islam.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	"Fanatical Islam" has been exported from Saudi Arabia by the Wahhabi sect for many years.  They are the ones responsible for all the terrorist attacks that have occured all over the world for the last 20 years.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism|`|74RNHyxHaa	Try to understand, ok?   A Muslim going around killing non-Muslims is NOT following Islam. Because he/she does this in the name of Islam does NOT mean it is a part of Islam.   There is no such thing as fanatical Islam. The propoganda that you see is giving you a distorted image of Islam.   If Islam did condone terror, then why don't all Muslims grab a gun or strap a bomb onto themselves and go kill "infidels"? The reality is, most Muslims are peaceful, and the ones that do commit acts of terror are shown over and over again in the media, to make it look like we all are terrorists.   There is no such thing as fanatical Islam.|`|KMmtEoPjaa	i do think there is a difference, unfortunatly, radical islam has a lot of money and amunition, and thye are the ones who make the news|`|kKswtGMwaa	Well regular muslims don't very often condemn the actions of fanatical muslims and in the way they speak and act towards  Jews there is no difference.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	As I often say.  There may be moderate Muslims but Islam is not moderate.  Where do you think the people like Ha mas and HEXBO and all the others get the money and weapons if not from the so called peaceful and productive Muslims.  Islam is based on the premise that all non believers must die and Islam rule the world.  That is glory to die in the fight.  You get paradise if you stand still and die for the cause.  Why are all the Muslim's crying foul?  They get what they want.  If your little speech was common or popular then Islam would police it's criminals instead of sending them money and building base camps in Pakistan to train murderers.  If Islam can't control it's lunatic Jihadist than it is indeed warlike and every bit as evil as the world cast it.  I'm Christian.  If you don't want to convert me or kill me you aren't a true Muslim and are just making your own religion against the Koran.  Only God can save the world from Islamic ignorance and savagery.
AlbJmy7aaa	There isn't really a blockade on the Rafah side because they smuggle in weapons and people in and out all the time.    Jordan isn't exactly a blockade either because they allow people to cross in (I've seen it at the King Hussein Bridge).    Also Israel isn't really a blockade because they aren't stopping anything but weapons and items used for weapons in.  Its just security, plain and simple.    They have greatly reduced suicide bombings.    Unfortunately, they can't stop giving them things like Israeli made fertilizer because this is "needed" for crops, but it is a key ingredient in the Quassam.    They did find a solution with the fuel though, and started supplying them with 65% of their electricity vs letting them have the fuel for power.    So there really isn't any blockades.. you've just been led to believe there was.|`|Fb519XJgaa	It is an Israeli Blockade not an Arab Blockades.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Their governments (along with Israel's), are only out for their own self-interests.|`|74RNHyxHaa	The Egypt and Jordan governments only care about Palestinians in words. When it comes to actually helping them, they have to ask Israels' permission first. In the Middle East, Israel rules all.|`|MHkx2kRTaa	The reality is that the Palestinians are not popular in the Middle East and are seen to be a destabilizing force that is upsetting peace in the region.    Except for Iran and Syria the people of Gaza have little underlying support from their neighbors.    Egypt has blockaded the border between Gaza and Egypt and only allows humanitarian crossings.    Egypt does not want Hamas militia in their country from where they could continue to attack Israel.    Jordan takes a similar view, however the West Bank under Fatah is relatively peaceful at the moment. They also do not want to be plunged into war with Israel.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	Why after all these decades would you assume they care?  They just have to show their Muslim brothers unity in the area.  Not play a part in stopping the radicalism.  Jordan has nothing to praise their refugees for.  They ruined their chances at being Jordanian and haven't done one thing that is peaceful or productive since.  Egypt refuses to be responsible for Gaza because they already have enough trouble makers and can't afford a war.  Jordon and Egypt are both as dependent on tourism as Israel and you can't have tourism with Jihadist running loose.
AA11349530	from Victoria coach station walk along the road to Victoria rail station ... get bus 436 from Stop: F towards Lewisham / The Lewisham Centre ... this will take you to Camberwell Church Street    I got this information from the journey planner on the Transport for London website  http://www.tfl.gov.uk/|`|4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	It depends what part of Camberwell you are going to.  There is a train station called Denmark Hill which is right near Kings College Hospital.      You can catch this from Victoria train station.  You'll need to buy a ticket from a machine or the ticket booth before you travel.  It takes 13 minutes.    www.nationalrail.co.uk for train times.  This is your best bet if you don't know London well.  If you are going further down the hill into Camberwell itself you can catch a bus from outside the hospital going that way - the 68 a and the 468 both go that way (towards Euston and Elephant and Castle respectively).      www.tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner for more info on buses.    If you were to use the tube, I would recommend going to Elephant and Castle and catching a bus from there as this is as far as the tube line goes in that direction.  You can catch both the 68 and the 468 (towards West Norwood and South Croydon respectively).  from the station (there are other buses so use journeyplanner to find out the numbers of them).  Don't be afraid to ask people if you get lost, us Londoners are not that scary you know.

I learnt the irish accent when i managed to repeat one of the yellow pages adverts with david nesbitt in it and then just kept speaking and voila =)|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Living in wales won't always do it, I know scottish, irish and english people who have lived here for years, and never lost their accent.    Watching welsh programmes is unlikely to help unless you are actually learning the language. POBOL Y CWM is a welsh language drama (Eastenders in welsh, with lost of mountains, rain and sheep!)    Learning the language won't help you pick up the accent either.    Depending on how much you want to "teach" yourself the accent (as Actors and actresses do when in vocal training) you would need to watch a variety of people who have welsh accents to pick it up.    Charlotte Church and Little Britain are fine examples.     Althought depending on what words you want to know, try these    All Right butt -  Awrite butt  How are you doing - Howz you dooing butt    Sounds silly but we do talk like that, without realising.

65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	Just to be clear...if you are in the USA and trying to send a STANDARD size letter to your cousin in Canada by first-class US mail, it should only cost you 72 cents.    If you did not buy a stamp from the post office for "international" mail, you can just put two regular stamps on it. That will end up costing 84 cents (two 42c stamps) but it will get there.    But if you are already IN CANADA and trying to send a letter to your cousin who is ALSO in Canada, then do not use US postage! Canada Post would have to handle that letter, and they will expect you to use Canadian stamps. That would only require one Canadian stamp of CAD$ 0.54 plus tax.    I wanted to clarify because you said that you learned that "...American stamps do work for Canada..." which is true, but they are only acceptable if you are sending a letter starting from USA.|`|jQglJiMhaa	it would depend on where you live in the states    From 72 cents to $31.95 depending on how quickly you want to ship it and the size of what you're shipping    The post office will tell you how much you need|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	A normal sized one ounce letter sent first class needs 72 cents postage.

5f37c1ca843baed941347175d05ad20eaa	Of course the beach is open.  It's been open since a couple of weeks after Ike.  Most of the restaurants and businesses along seawall are open also.  Some of the downtown businesses are open, but a lot remained closed.  More and more of them open every day though.  Come down and spread the word.  Apparently, everyone thinks Galveston was wiped out by Ike.  You'll be surprised how normal everything looks down here (well, except the trees are still dead).  Just be careful on the beaches because debris might still be buried in the sand.  Oh, and they're doing beach restoration right now, so they're trucking loads of sand and dumping it along the beach.  This has made a sand-cliff on a good stretch of seawall.  It's pretty neat.  But, even all of that is still open.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	yup, its open, but there are still damages to the beach|`|CRVi3YsOaa	If you are talking about east/stewart beach they are not open for cars to drive on.

ycwpFNWFaa	GPS works in Cyprus. You are able to find your latitude and longitude and altitude with no difficulties; that is what the Global Positioning System means. However, this is not much use when there is no accurate maps (like the UK Ordnance Survey maps). The best they can be used for would be to trace back a route the way you came.     Without an accurate map, no one can write the software for automatic street/map display.     This is what happens when you live in a country that is partly occupied by a foreign army (Turkey).  You can't even get a decent map or make a proper land survey :((
496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	By any definition it is theft and an attempt to exert control as Hamas was a democratically elected political party ~even the israeli's recognize this fact.  As an individual there is a legal amount of money in cash that can be taken out of the country and most countries have this same law,   But this was a legal representative of a legally elected and internationally recognized political party entitled by the Geneva convention to diplomatic immunity to this law.  Once again our president and his cohorts have shown their disregard for the situation in Palestine,public opinion and basic human rights.  Anyone who thinks Egyptians are living in a democracy is either a fool or somehow benefiting from the Mubarak regime.  The views of this government by no means reflect the opinion of the general population,nor does the Mubarak regime care.   For anyone who stands against them is publicly discredited by a trumped up charge and sentenced to a gaol term.|`|r6SL1pJaaa	You want my honest opinion? maybe he was taking the money to himself and they found out about it.|`|Lw9hX3A8aa	momken tewadda7 what actually the government should have done?|`|AA12365543	It is a good thing.

Hamas dont want peace, they think peace means humiliation, instead of teaching their kids to YES have dignity and so on but also to strive for peace they Arm the kids and teach them that death and destruction is the only way..    I myself have helped Gaza, but i sure as hell would never ever Help Hamas FOR THE SAKE OF THE PALESTINIANS! Hamas talk big then can't protect their people and look at the result...Hamas when the got elected pretty much split palestine into Gaza & the west bank..this is a disaster for the Palestinian cause..they are Radicals and Israel will only be happy to have the excuse that they are fighthing against radicals..as israel's goverment themselves are radicals!    This is probably the only time you will see me praise Mubarak and our goverment, we did the correct thing  100% from the begining...more Egyptians have died and given and given and given and we WARNED HAMAS to cool things down, but they refuse!      The money was transferred illegaly and will only be used for rockets and so on which in the end will END UP HURTING THE PALESTINIANS THEMSELVES! Plus Egypt has sent more money to the Palestnians than anyone else, believe me they got alot...this particlar parcel was from the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood which are illegal, and i even as a Muslim Hate them and consider them against Egypt!    and for those that say Abbas is an agent, they are just uneducated idiots, Abbas is hated because he is trying to make PEACE..and the only way the palestinians will get their land back is by PEACE..and peace doesn't mean SUBMITTING OR HUMILIATION EITHER!

I mean thieves, also a president who's been ruling us for about 28 years and then they tell us in school books and the governmental newspapers Egypt is a good example of democracy!! What do you think they will do with the money?? Of course they're gonna take it for themselves as they take our money. The incident is not about the way the money was gonna pass is illegal coz if it were going to Abbas they would have let it go, but why will they need to send it to Abbas that way, they can give it to the legal president (as they say) officially.

lcj1AKt1aa	Barbados is the best place any day or time.  Read a little about Barbados that I have compiled.    Information on Barbados    Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.    When you visit Barbados, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the Barbados coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean Island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only in Barbados.    Barbados Expectation  Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere. But what makes Barbados even more special, and the reason why so many visitors keep returning to the island year after year, is the people. Barbadians, called Bajans, are warm and friendly souls, always ready to greet you with a sincere smile. Barbadians make you feel welcome and special, in this lovely Caribbean Island. You will feel its your home and will want to come back again and again to Barbados: A unique Caribbean paradise, surprisingly sophisticated, friendly, fun and always Naturally Charming!    http://barbados.org/  Some all-inclusive resorts here including Almond Casuarina which is very near to the night life (St. Lawrence Gap).

A unique attraction to the Canaries is its volcanic scenery, with craters and lava fields to be seen in Lanzarote. A slightly more adventurous option, the Canary Islands add a bit of fire to what would already be a brilliant trip.     Th maldives may be  little different though...The Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean, about 435 miles South-West of Sri Lanka. It is a popular tourist destination because of the astoundingly beautiful resorts and scenery. In most cases you can stay in a private villa which sits out in the middle of the water - connected to the mainland by a small walkway. If you want to go somewhere to relax - this is the place to do it. The official language of the Maldives is Dhivehi, which is very closely related to Sinhala, the language of Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, you will have no problems speaking English in the tourist spots.     Sydney australia is a perfect destination for some nightlife and some good shopping as well as the beach! Wy don't you go on a nighttime habour cruise or even lots of funky bars and nightclubs    Venice in Italy is also a great place to visit, with the famous pizza and pasta and some wonderful river cruises. Venice is partly underwater which would be a great idea for anyone to visit nd explore.    I really hope I helped, i spent a bit of time on this!  Have a great holidya wherever you go!|`|GPWmMDXsaa	Go to the usa all the way!! :)|`|ykVpyqAOaa	Australia, Sydney!    so many museums, excellent travel, good services..|`|VUL3pW0raa	Gran Canaria any day!

urHPuzMsaa	All that matters is the birth date. If you are 21 your are 21.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	It just matters on how old you are, DOB is your date of birth.|`|hEZ16rpAaa	Well if they make that big of a deal about it, tell them to check the DOB. I don't think that in this economy they would deny your business over something that inane.
xif22nwoaa	Wait until 21 - at 18, you can't gamble, hang out on the casino floors, enter the clubs, drink, etc.  There are plenty of other things to do, but you won't get the full Vegas experience if you're under 21.|`|urHPuzMsaa	At least at 21 you can do anything here. At 18 you can't gamble, drink and in some cases you can't rent a hotel room. You have to be 21 to enter a club so if you have the patience ... wait until you are 21.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	If your at least 21, you can pretty much do anything you want in Las Vegas. If your past 18 you can do anything you want but there are some restrictions.|`|KGgPtU8zaa	21. why risk getting busted for underage drinking & gambling?|`|AA10240904	Wait until 21 because you cannot do much at 18.  Only those 21 can gamble, drink, see many shows, go to the night clubs, etc.|`|AA11536773	21 because then you can partake of EVERYTHING Vegas has to offer.|`|1e8abd4777bb514fbe2fb7062f56e90daa	21. The only things you can do at age 18 in Vegas you could have done since age 12...other than smoke some cigs and buy porn..and that you can do anywhere else.  The whole thing about going to Vegas is being able to drink up and down the strip, gambling, hanging in the casinos, and visiting the strip clubs and clubs. Pretty much all the (GOOD) clubs and strip clubs serve alcohol...so therefore 21+ and security is tight..    Casinos also serve alcohol and therefore you cannot gamble or even hang out on the gambling floor unless you are 21+. And casino security is also very tight. So save it for when you're 21. My little bro went to Vegas at age 19 with us when everyone else was 21+...he didn't have much fun. The rest of us had the time of our lives, but he left much richer than the rest of us lol.      ~G|`|c7dbd15c3f22e6fd215ebdd9e569125caa	21 for sure!! i went when i was 19 and it sucked i couldn't drink, gamble, go to clubs, all the things that we take for granted in Australia. So i am going back there for my 21st birthday this November. Truly hyped, the wait will be worth it!|`|boWDjT9Gaa	21 for sure. You will have the most fun and the best time. Keep saving your money until then.
e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	There is always turnover, so there are always openings even during the downturns. The reality is that some firms prefer fresh blood recruited overseas over experienced people already in Japan. Therefore you are just as likely to get a job as some guy who has been in Japan for years and just got laid off. That's not fair, but that's how it is. You are wise to pay down debt now, at the usual 250000 yen a month it is tough to have much left over at the end of the month given the usual temptations. If you are going to go to Japan, do it because you want to be in Japan and just enjoy. Don't let negative people discourage you. Subscribe to gaijinpot.com and you can see for yourself what is out there.|`|OTnSwNwZaa	If you really are Black, you don't have an ice cube's chance in Vulcan's forge of getting a job in japan. I'm sorry.|`|J83rL9SJaa	mate depends or where you are planning to work. there are plenty of opportunities in japan to teach english as it is taught as the second language there. i am sure that the international schools will let you in if your qualifications are put to standard. if it no where near as bad as america or the uk. + its fun anyways
AA10551570	Approx 2 kilometers. The best way is to take one day's Dubai city tour..|`|hMTL2AV7aa	Dubai airport is within the city of Deira, but Deira is the eastern side of the greater Dubai. Dubai encompasses 4 cities stitched together : Deira is the eastern one (east of the creek), Bur Dubai is the middle one (west of the creek, but central to Dubai as a whole), and Jumeirah 1~6 +Satwa+SZR/"New Dubai" would make the western one. Jebel Ali is the 4th but its mostly industrial/port or tourist facilities.     The Mall is called "Deira City Centre" , which is not far from airport , less than 10 minutes drive but this mall is usually crowded unless you visit in the morning time. There is also the traffic lights delay and that area has lots of traffic lights.    The center of Dubai would be Bur Dubai but I can't give you a travel time , however he closest part to airport is 20 minutes , usually 30 minutes is average to reach central places like Burjuman mall.|`|EfVsE6Braa	Do you mean the shopping mall " city center" or the center of the city? The shopping mall is about a 15 minute taxi ride from the airport. There is also a shopping area called " festival city" close to the airport that would take you around 15~20 minutes by taxi from the airport. If you want to see the indoor ski slope, it is also in a mall called " Mall of Emirates" .  Mall of Emirates has the most shops and more interesting things to do out of the 3 places. But, it would take you about 30 ~ 45 minutes from the airport, and could even take more depending on the traffic. If you don't have that much time, I would recommend festival city.
lys5kB9Daa	well my parents brought me on 1 to 2 great vacations a year growing up, so traveling is very important to me!! i have been to 20 countries and 4 continents and dying to go see more. when i was in college though, i had a part time job not making very much and when i finally did save money for a trip none of my friends has any money to come. so i always flew across the country to visit my friend for winter break & summer break. it was less than the global travels i would have liked but on a college budget i at least got to get away from home and feel like i was on a vacation :)  i think students should take every opportunity to travel, like semester at sea, or semester abroad, or anything. it really opens you up to how different the world is from your little bubble.
lcj1AKt1aa	It can be very expensive.  First you have to get the money for the air fare if flying. You need departure tax in some countries.  You have to look for hotel accommodation, taxi to and from the hotel as well as general travel.  You have to buy food if it is not all-inclusive.You might need to shop and this is where the majority of my money go as I buy for friends for birthdays and Christmas. You might want to buy souvenirs, jewelry, perfume and t-shirts of friends.  You might want to go sightseeing as well as do different activities.    if you go on a cruise you will pay up-front and if you do not want to spend anymore money on the cruise you do not have to.  People that drink will have to pay for alcoholic beverages.  Excursions can be very expensive especially with the ship so it is advisable to go and bargain with the taxi drivers in the different ports.  As you go on a cruise you will be visiting different islands so will want something from each island. Additionally    You can get some last minute deals on cruises like with Carnival.  They have some cheap cruises so you can take a look.  All you will have to do is not to buy any sodas. It is best if the cruise leaves from your port or one nearest to you. Have a look at some cruises.  http://www.carnival.com/find_a_cruise/Se...|`|taboL1hbaa	It depends. If you're traveling by bus, it's a lot cheaper than traveling by plane, but it also takes more time. Traveling by car isn't so bad now that gas prices have gone down, but all that money can add up. One easy way to save money and travel (short distances if weather allows) is to bike. Carpooling is also a green and cheap idea. Hope I helped! :)
2r5LyDYlaa	Good advice about the Guide book, for younger ppl there is MTV Europe book that is awesome! Your going to love Germany, you have to take a little day trip to see Neuschwanstein Castle. The castle ins't great but the view there is nothing I've ever seen before. If he is Army you have to have him take you to Edelweiss lodge and resort. Its a Military Resort and it is perfect for traveling trips and spas.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	BUY a friggin' GUIDE BOOK... You people spend all that money to take a trip and you are TOO CHEAP to BUY A GUIDE BOOK... I would suggest Fodor's EUROPE... it will give you ALL the answers you can NOT get here on Answers from a bunch of people who have never been outside the State where they were born.
puyAEPZyaa	For an amazing Las Vegas vacation, here are my recommendations:    Accommodations: Caesars Palace, Ballys, or Paris, but be sure to check online for reduced room prices.    Eating - Wynn's Buffet, Bellagio's Buffet, Nine Steakhouse at Palms, or MIX at Mandalay Bay    Dessert - The Pastry Shop or the Crepe Shop at Paris, the Chocolate Shop at Wynn, the Chocolate Shop at Bellagio, or the Chocolate Shop at Caesars Palace    Shopping - Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, Grand Canal Shoppes at Venetian, and Fashion Show Mall    Shows - Cirque du Soleil "O" at Bellagio, Cirque du Soleil "Believe" at Luxor, or Blue Man Group at Venetian    Other things - Madame Tussauds Wax Museum at Venetian, the Coke and M&M Stores, and the newly redone Volcano Eruption at Mirage    Sightseeing - Take a trip to the top of the Stratosphere or to the top of the Eiffel Tower at Paris (try and time it on the hour so you can watch the bellagio fountains go off while you are at the top). If you want to spend the money, you could also take a Maverick Helicopter Tour of the Strip.    Spas - Canyon Ranch Spa at Venetian or Qua Baths and Spa at Caesars Palace    Las Vegas has unlimited opportunities for fun and excitement, so you might just want to explore the Strip and try anything that catches your eye.    Good luck and I hope you enjoy your trip!|`|mAV5MJQnaa	There are lots of good nightclubs and restaurants. You can look up information on a local Las Vegas directory on what shows they offer, and the restaurants they have.|`|6e0PG4YWaa	There is soo much to do in Las Vegas.  To start, two of my favorite restaurants are in the Palms.. N9Ne Steakhouse and Nove Italiano, both have amazing food.  As for the nightclubs.. you have to check out Rain.. most incredible place.  Two other awesome clubs are Moon and Ghostbar.  I promise you a good time in these clubs!|`|NRa5MJ3Paa	Go to http://www.vegas.com/ that site can hook you up with anything ;)
0ZfZulnzaa	You would not need your passport to fly with in the US, it is only when you want to fly internationally that you would require it, so if you cross via land into the US and fly from say as an example Buffalo NY to Miami FL you would only need government issued photo id (and you should have that as well as your original birth certificate as you would have used it to cross the border)    Having said that though, there have been instances where a Canadian was not permitted to board a domestic flight with in the US with out a passport it was a huge fight to prove they did not need it to fly with in the US(and missing their flight), so to be safe and to guarantee you would have no problems I would just use a passport, it will be required as of June 1, 2009 anyways.|`|HQrMEkm0aa	Yes, they can fly within the USA without passports b/c they've already been checked on thoroughly at the border.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Passports are only needed for crossing borders.  If a Canadian can enter the US by vehicle without one (for now at least) then once they are in they are free to fly within the country without one, the same as any US citizen can and does.
ovQ9lgVgaa	Looking at your tight schedule, best thing you can do is to take the city tour (Hop-on and Hop-off bus). Bus is every thirty minutes from Railway station (Luxembourg Gare). I guess the ticket price is 12 euros and tour time is 2 hours.    Once the tour is over then you can spend time in Luxembourg Center (Hamilius), you can find many restaurants and shops for evening shopping. Shops usually close at 6 pm, but restaurants are open till 10 pm. Sunday almost all shops are closed, but restaurants are open.    Incase shopping and meal is over, and if you still have time, you can explore some local pubs in center (Hamilius) or if you are a movie lover then visit a movie hall - Utopolis at kirchberg (www.utopolis.lu).    You can visit all these places by bus (depending upon your hotel location). Bus journey costs 1.5 euros for a single trip or day ticket is available for 4 or 5 euros.    Cheers!!  Pranav
z0S8syYGaa	Halifax, Manchester, York    i think york is the most attractive, but it's small compared to manchester  i would say your best bet is manchester    hope this helps!|`|7ymCQYxMaa	Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Glasgow, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast are all great cities, less expensive, more friendly, more welcoming. Great shopping at the Trafford Centre and Liverpool One. Liverpool also has lots of Beatles museums, the Slavery Museum, the Maritime Museum and probably the best Georgian builings in England. Manchester has the Manchester Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry and the largest city centre shopping mall in the country. If you are in Manchester you must,must catch a football game at the world famous Manchester United ground, Old Trafford. Birmingham has Think Tank and the Bullring, it is also near Warwickshire, so you can visit the home of Shakespeare, in Stratford-Upon-Avon. For nightlife, definitely Manchester and Liverpool. Both these cities are within a couple of hours of the Peak District and Lake District for some stunning scenery.

PSiNv7gUaa	Your best bet is to call the airline/airport beforehand and ask them.  I would hate for you to take someone's advice saying "yes" on here and then have your stuff confiscated at the security checkpoint.  None of that sounds threatening, but airport security is weird now.|`|AA10994550	I know that small scissors are allowed onto the carry-on.

x5bVBKdTaa	Woodburn, Oregon, Willamina, Oregon, McMinnville, Oregon, and Silverton, Oregon may be a choice that you should consider. It gets very little snow in the winter but does rain instead of snow. For example it was 60 degrees for the last 3 days and we haven't had snow in a few weeks. Spring is really pretty because you have roses blooming all the time, rains just a little bit less, and the temperatures are reaching the higher 60s. Summer is just beautiful, no rain, and there are a ton of things going on like festivals and fairs. Fall is just beautiful with all the colors and it starts to rain again. The fall colors stick around till late November. Oregon is a green state so there are so many trees and flowers. So it is basically green all year because of the evergreens, the grass stays green, and the flowers continue to bloom. They are all close to the mountains, the ocean, and wine country about an hour to all. Seattle and Portland are all close too.|`|grgRkv5Maa	Wisconsin!

And, you don't need to live by the cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) to have a good time in Minnesota!  Minnesota also has all four seasons.  Spring is full of life, flowers blooming and birds chirping.  Summer is nice and hot, and everyone spends it going to the lakes and swimming or fishing or doing anything there.  Fall is sweatshirt weather (in the beginning), Stillwater has the most AMAZING leaves in the fall, and we are on the route for the Monarch butterflies' migration, so there are a bunch of them late summer/early fall.  It is absolutely beautiful to see them!  And lastly, I'm sure everyone knows that we have a real winter with snow.  People spend their time in the winter skiing, ice skating, snowboarding, snowmobiling, etc.  It's the perfect place to live!  In addition, there are lots of parks and bike paths.  And you can always take a trip to the cities and have fun exploring there.  Let's not forget the cherry and spoon bridge!

50ba9dbb26b71c7ae00921a624a4d0b5aa	The Lady Luck has been closed for several years...    FSE website  http://www.vegasexperience.com    The best late night eats in downtown are the "graveyard" specials at the California's Market Street Cafe 11pm-9am - NY steak dinner for $4 -     The .99c shrimp cocktail from the Golden Gate is a Las Vegas legend. This one has been served for around 60 years with only one price increase. The only difference is, now you have to sign up for their slot club to get the .99c price...The slot club booth is located just inside the front door...    The Triple 7 restaurant & brew pub at Main Street Station serves a great prime rib dinner($7) starting at 4pm, they don't close at 10pm on the contrary they begin serving $1 house brews at Midnight. Yes you can certainly take advantage of both...    Roberta's at the El Cortez serves a very good steak at reasonable prices, this is quite possible the best value steakhouse in all of Las Vegas..    Binions steakhouse is also a good one.    Hugo's Cellar as previously mentioned is a very good restaurant, though a bit on the expensive side...Same goes for Vic & Anthony's at the Golden Nugget..    IMO the buffet at Main Street Station is the best value buffet in LV. Lunch is an especially good deal....The FSE coupons** generally contain a 2-4-1 coupons for the MSS buffet.    **The FSE office is located at 425 Fremont Street, 2nd floor of the parking garage, next to Walgreens. Show an out of state ID for a very nice sheet of coupons...    The seafood buffet(Sun/Tue/Fri) at the Fremont is a bargain, but no lobster...    There are a few bars on or near Fremont Street...    On weekends the FSE generally has live entertainment...    Sightseeing - downtown  Antiques, Artifacts, Artwork - Main Street Station   Shark Tank, Gold Nugget Collection, lobby - Golden Nugget  Sports Memorabilia - Vegas Club  WSOP "Wall of Fame" - Binion's  Golden Arm Club(craps) - California  Copper Mine(penny slots) - Gold Spike*    *These are honest to goodness, real, drop one penny in at a time penny slots, not penny slots with a $3 max bet...They had 30 or so the last time we were in, but that's been a while, and you never know when things will change in LV.     ~Jack~|`|sagxWL01aa	go to beach|`|mAV5MJQnaa	If your in downtown Las Vegas, your best bet is to check out the Fremont Street Experience during the night.

We are surrounded by beach although some might be a bit too rough for bathing.  http://thecrane.com/  http://www.barbados.org/crane.htm    These are some other all-inclusive  http://www.barbados.org/allinclusive_vac...  Read a little about our nightlife especially in St Lawrence Gap.  There are many clubs including ship In and Jumbies.  http://www.barbados.org/stlaw.htm  http://www.barbadosvillavacations.com/ba...  You should also a trip to a popular fishing village (Oistins) on a Friday night where you can get some grill fish, grill potatoes and tartar sauce.  Afterward, you can go and see the locals and visitors dancing in the open air to some vintage oldies.  This is a sight to behold.  There is also craft sold at this location.  http://travel.aol.com/travel-guide/Oisti...    On the west coast namely Holetown is very popular for entertainment also popular.  On Sundays 1st Street Holetown comes alive and the atmosphere is great.  There is also Harbour Lights as well as the Boatyard on Bay Street.    We have the regular activities but you should visit Harrison's cave which is a natural underground cave.

Aruba has nightclubs, shopping, casinos, and restaurants in walking distance or short cab rides from many of the resorts. It is also safe to walk around the island and to leave the resorts. Jamaica has many wonderful tours available, dunns river falls, bob sleds through the rain forest and many other wonderful tours. Jamaica is not as safe to leave the resort at night as  Aruba, but cabs are the best way to get around.  I have been a travel agent for over 20 years and have alot of experience sending people all over the world.

I think the only thing you are allowed to bring with you of liquid is small containers of a max of 100 ml, which is pretty much NOTHING. So you will have to bring that alcohol in the main luggage.

Lucky you're a teen - the drinks are expensive!  http://www.fox10tv.com/dpp/news/Passenge...|`|AA11134471	the holiday is a very old ship (I think its carnivals oldest), and it isnt very big.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	No, you don't take the Red Line. You take METROLINK.     As you enter the terminal, there are signs directing you to Metrolink trains, which are white and blue. You have two choices: The Metrolink "Riverside Line", and the Metrolink "91 Line". Both take different routes, but end up in Riverside. Follow the link below, and you will find the 91 line is blue, and the Riverside Line is Purple: http://www.metrolinktrains.com/documents...    As I said, once you enter the station and go to the area where you have the Metrolink trains, there are signs above your head which state which track to get on, and when the next trains leave:    Riverside- 5:42 Track 3  Riverside/91 Line- 5:25 PM Track 8    (These are just examples)    Finally, when you look on the side of the train, there is an electronic sign which says where the train is going.     Really, it's not difficult. If in doubt, just ask a conductor on the platform. They are very helpful.
e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	Buying and selling women in Japan continued until the occupation authorities found out it about, so the 1950s rings true. There are two issues here.     One is that there used to be a much finer line between geisha and prostitutes. It's still the same today with onsen geisha-one can say they are not real geisha but that's semantics. The clear distinction between geisha and out and out prostitutes was something created during the occupation so that Americans didn't have to feel shame about attending geisha parties. Prior to 1956 prostitution was legal and accepted in Japan, so obviously Japanese people didn't have to go around insisting that geisha were not prostitutes prior to the Americans showing up and telling them there was something wrong with being a prostitute. Therefore we can assume that situations took place back in the day that would not be acceptable in a respectable okiya nowadays.     The other issue is that obviously a 13 year old girl who has been sold didn't really have all that much choice in the matter. The egalitarian Japan of today was created by the occupation. Previous to that Japan was a very class based society, and the peasants sometimes really did have to sell their daughters. It is safe to say that the people who purchased them figured their virginity would be worth something.     Therefore I am inclined to agree with the wikipedia article given that there are obviously men with money and a taste for that. I imagine there was often fraud involved with mizuage given that it is possible to sugically restore a hymen. This is depicted in the 1996 Shoei Imamura film "The Pornographers"-although in that film the girl in question is not a maiko.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Where did you see that? I just read the entire wikipedia article and there's not mention of mizuage in the entire thing, at least not that I saw.    Anyway, that said, it's wikipedia. Wikipedia is a good place to start research but should definitely not be used as a definitive source. If you want real accuracy, try some books, like those by Liza Dalby, Lesley Downer, or Mineko Iwasaki.|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	Yes and No. Geisha's were forbidden to write down or speak of their life in any way. So one Geisha's house may have been practicing such a tradition while the one in the next Valley over Forbade it.     I think Like any Lifestyle Geisha's had more than one tier of Geisha. Geisha was not originally born of a sexual Relationship but of a public companion necessity. Japan Strictly segregated their wives from public contact. Prostitutes were too. If one was a prostitute she had to stay behind the wall of her house with her sister prostitutes errand boys and older women did errands that required public appearance.      So, married men when out doing business are not just going to hang out with each other and Were forbidden and therefore it would have been dishonorable, even an insult to bring a prostitute in the company of his colleagues. It would have been unseemly for and Ordinary single Women. But with a class of women who were "permitted" to keep the company of married men under an extremely strict set of rules.    People see the painted face of the Geisha and they see a lovely women who is essentially a work of Art. What they don't realize is the paint, the Kimono's the calligraphy, literature, elocution, was all a way to set them apart as women who do not endeavor to be wives. You see a proper Japanese girl of the time Would have been taught, how to please a husband and run a household.     A geisha was taught to exaggerate everything feminine to entertain a room of Men if needed. nothing about children or cooking, or cleaning. Nothing. they were taught, that as a Geisha, the menial tasks would be beneath them. It was also Taught that Sex was beneath them, but it doe sn;t mean it didn't happen.    So that brings us to lower level tier Geisha's. The Japanese are a very  pragmatic and Shrewd culture. So in all likelihood The justification snuck in regarding sex. If they're going to do it, it is best to A. control it  and B. Make money off of it. Of course the reputation of such a house would have been tarnished and It is very likely upper level politicians, Royalty and Dynastic families of Wealth would have shunned such Houses in favor of The houses with unblemished reputations.     So in answer to you question, Yes it is true and no it is not.|`|k5KuYkkKaa	You should check out this site. It explains a lot about Geisha's, and the Mizuage, or ceremonial deflowering, that allowed a Maiko to become a Geisha.  http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photo...|`|UiQ6V377aa	I've heard that it is true and that it is not.    Once person told me that it was "symbolic" of "giving" themselves and not actually giving someone their virginity.    Others say it is true.    The problem is geisha are like "code red" in the military. Only those in the group know,and they don't talk outside the group.If they violate this(like the character in the book is based of off.She is a real person,but the author embellished her tales a little bit and inferred things as well.)then the other Geisha decide to deny deny deny and excommunicate the one who talked. It's a hush-hush situation.    So hard to say if it is true or not.

I flew into Boston on my trip, spent a few days there, then headed to New Hampshire.  It's a beautiful, clean state with friendly people and so many great attractions.  Not all the hustle and bustle of Boston and other big cities.  It's not as expensive as the Cape or Maine, either.  The White Mountains are spectacular.  I took a tour to the top of Mt. Washington.  What a beautifull view!  Also, took a moose tour one evening, and it was a fantastic wildlife experience.  I took the tour with Gorham Moose Tours.  The Cannon Mountain Aerial Tram at Franconia Notch State Park offers excellent views of four states and Canada.  The Flume Gorge is a great attraction, too, at Franconia Notch State Park.  I highly recommend New Hampshire for a vacation.    For more information, visit:  http://visitnh.gov

NGBOFUARaa	Doctors who work the IMMS public health care system make about half what a doctor in a military or VA hospital in the states makes. Doctor in private practice can do very well if they have private patients who subsidize there practice.  Specialists can earn a good income. The cost of living here is lower than in the states, that's true. But so is the costs of insurance for doctors. And since continuing education is required, it is subsidized for the doctors who work in the public system.  If, as one of the others has suggested, thinking about coming to Mexico to practice, think again. It is very difficult to get a work visa as a doctor because you would be taking a job away from a Mexican.|`|H9RTbhKYaa	I guess this explains why we have so many Mexican doctors in the United States...|`|hX7wGgjjaa	whatever it is, it's in pesos currency. and they are sure short in their country because most doctors trying to get here even they start as a nurse or lower pay (they'll still make more money than working as a doctor from their country)so i don't understand why you are trying to go there.you might want to learn the currency evaluation first.|`|rqqA8gq9aa	Well, I don't know any figures, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume they aren't very good, as the cost of living down there, as we know, is very low and the cost of living effects everyone's wages.

496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	On a day to day level,to me that is just rational thinking. If you don't rationalise something objectively,think about the alternatives and outcomes then you are just acting on impulse and from experience that can lead you into deep waters.  Most of the time we do this almost subconsciously and therefore have no need to sit and ponder over our response or reaction.   There are times when we may "feel" something is just not what is seems to be,this is when we have to use our heads as well as our hearts.   If something just doesn't "feel" right, then that is your life experience as well as your intellect giving you clear signals to analyse the situation before you make a definite response or judgement.   There are people who naturally have this sense fine-tuned, some call a sixth sense or insight,but most of us just have to rely on our logical mind.  I am not suggesting that we should doubt everything,there are some things such as faith and love that defy all logical analysis.  But at the same time it is far better to doubt and question than to just accept something is right and true because others say it is so.  If it "feels" wrong then at some level it most likely is.|`|LwqM7EHVaa	We must think about everything.. we only live once, so we must make the right choices, or else you're wasting your time by deciding not to "think" about it..|`|0047572b741498da2d839902d6863185aa	"Our doubts are traitors   And makes us lose the good we oft might win"__WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE|`|QdEoNhwUaa	Of course, we must think carefully before making decisions in order not to regret when it is too late.

Colorado is not really ghetto, tho u will see ur occasional hobo on parker.    as for DU, its the most expensive school u can go to in the metro area and its private, so its not a scary place at all.|`|w6mZZcQmaa	Aurora is not a bad place to live... you just have be look at the place you are moving into before you do... there are only a couple bad spots... but a smart girl like you wont have a problem getting into a good place!...|`|Lin7jEGCaa	Well i live in Aurora, and it's not ghetto at all!  I have seen some places that are ghetto but they are mostly closer to Denver.... So some places in Denver are... but no where in Aurora that i have ever seen and i have lived here my whole life... :) so i would know lol. i have been here 15 years!  SO let me know how it goes:)  have fun in amazing Colorado! the mountains are breath taking! :) see ya round!|`|8IK8f2gkaa	Aurora runs along the east of Denver. South Aurora has some pretty nice neighborhoods, while north Aurora has pockets of gangs and prostitution mixed with neighborhoods that have declined over the years. For a safer area with RTB bus routes near by without breaking the bank, go west to the Lakewood area. Willows Lakeshore Apartments or Mountain Vista, both in the low $500s like Hickory Ridge, but much lower crime rate.

Most flights arrive in Heathrow and depending on when you want to fly and at what time of day it can cost anything from 435 (if you are willing to change in Philadelpha) up to 1000.    I used www.expedia.com to find these prices.    Croydon is in South London so ideally you want to fly to Gatwick as the train from Gatwick to East Croydon runs frequently and takes only a few minutes.    If you come into Heathrow, you will need to take the Heathrow Express to London Paddington then take the underground to London Victoria station and the train from there to West or East Croydon.    The Jury's Inn in Croydon is central and next to the shopping centre.  It costs between 60 - 80 a night.    To find more croydon hotels try www.laterooms.com, www.hotels.com www.lastminute.com and www.expedia.co.uk or www.opodo.com|`|RWpSVJtlaa	If you look for flights on the internet you will get a ballpark.    Id say around 1000 (Pounds).  Could be less but youd have to book in advance, get a deal etc.
AA11700517	I love China's 5000+ years culture and civilization. China has amazing and diverse culture. For example, the Traditional costume, calligraphy, philosophy/morals, tea, PANDA, ancient building, dances, martial arts, silk, porcelain, herbs, lantern style, design, food, art, music, etc. But I love Chinese history/civilization as well. China has an enthralling history that involves the Imperial Palace, the emperor, etc.     Chinese Costumes/silk:  http://yw2004xp.blog.bokee.net/bloggermo...  http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_495e35970...    Chinese architecture:  http://www.iho-ohi.org/wp-content/hong-k...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shangh...  http://webby.com/humor/i/ChineseLanternF...

(I would love to post more things, but the limited website is 10, so these are the ten websites I picked.)    In addition, China impacted the world the most with its invention and culture. For example, the Chinese invented paper, calligraphy, ink, lanterns, noodle, printing, fireworks, compass, tea, oriental architecture, pottery, ancient technology/science, chopstick, sword, herbs, silk, martial arts, oriental artwork, chess, ink, kite,  etc. Sorry, there's way too much things to list. You can search it up in wikipedia. But the bottom line is, these inventions effected our world and lives a lot.|`|5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	The people are so nice and friendly. Sometimes too much so.     I have been invited to so many people's houses for dinner, sometimes the first time I met them.

I really like Chinese food.|`|34SAe5k6aa	Well, I am a guy. So you know what my favorite thing is. But I like the history and the traditional music almost as much. I also like the modern architecture and following the new developments. I like the mountains, lakes, and rivers. I also like to learn about the infrastructure projects like subway expansions and high speed trains that connect cities. Traditional architecture is a plus, too. And then of course there is Buddhism in Tibet/Chengdu/etc., which is also fascinating. And then there is tea, in all its variety. I like talking to people (especially wise elders and people of all ages who have common interests) and learning about their culture. It would be great to learn Mandarin well enough to drink tea and play Mahjong with elders, and maybe do Tai Chi with them in the park or public square. And of course, being a guy, I would like to have some male Chinese or foreign friends to hang out with on the weekends.|`|WnEJdeAGaa	in china you can do any thing wrong and be free.cheap money and u can open a factory there and make sure west goes bankrupt.wait they already did it.|`|LZJPMl8raa	Girls man!!|`|SBikhIzBaa	hi,glad to answer,i'm a native chinese.U know Shopping is a important part of dailylife in our country.Some years ago,we did shopping  in stores in reality,but now we can shopping online,i think this change impact us much,Taobao is a biggest online auction platform in the Asia, we could buy everythings on it like newest clothes, Mobiles,foods and so on.And the things are much more cheaper than in reality, So i love taobao.com about mordern china.

Because in EVERY single war against Israel....Israel acts as if all of Bierut is a huge Hezbollah base, and they carpet bomb it all.    During the Civil war...ALOT  the civil war left us with old airplanes (because we couldn't upgrade anything during the war)     thousands and thousands of houses left in rubble    During the 2006 war:    AGAIN....alot  I was actually there  Israel just bombed EVERYTHING again  they even bombed one of my families apartment building  the israelis bombed one building which was holding many children for shelter.....you get the point|`|4sHJMnLXaa	I'm not as concerned about infrastructural damage as much as I'm concerned over the psychological effects of the war (s)...    Otherwise, Israeli attacks during the 34-day war resulted in $2 billion worth of damage to airports, ports, utilities, TV stations, broadcasting antennas, gas stations, bridges, roads, factories, homes, and villages. The gov ernment of Lebanon has stated, and the United Nations has   accepted, that 32 vital points were destroyed, including water and  sewage treatment facilities and electric power plants.    In total, the Lebanese government says, 15 electric power plants, 331 water distribution facilities (dams, reservoirs, pumping stations), and 159 sewage and wastewater treatment facilities were damaged.    The government of Lebanon, as well as specialist international organizations, state that 142 industrial enterprises suffered complete and/or partial destruction, and that over 900 medium-sized enterprises  (including factories and farms) and 2,800 small enterprises  suffered extensive damage. Of these, at least 31 major factories  in south Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and the Beirut suburbs are  reported as having been completely or partially destroyed.....    That about sums it up....    But Like I said, I'm more worried about the long term and emotional effects of such tragedies...

urHPuzMsaa	There is quite a bit of difference from a strip club and a show. This is a musical show for adult audiences. There is no touching of the girls by the audience. It is a show. Read a review of it here and you will feel better about it.    http://shop.vegas.com/shows/showtimes2.j...|`|mAV5MJQnaa	If you heard if the show was good, then its good. Most of the Las Vegas shows are awarded by the "best of Las Vegas" If your new to the show. Then you can try it. I am pretty sure its a decent show.|`|AA10240904	Never heard of BITE as a casino show so it must be a strip show.  We went to one on our honeymoon and it was okay.  But I think there are much better shows at the standard casino-hotels on The Strip you both would enjoy more.  Try Zoomanity the cirque show|`|JkNMxdlDaa	Yes, as others have said...it's a musical adult show.  Which means some (or most) of the people on stage will be topless.    Not a big deal, unless if he likes it you are going to be angry.    I recently saw the Beatles/Cirque Love show.  I've been to every Cirque in the last 15 years and this was by far the best.  It's amazing, fun and moving.  You'll sing your heart out and have a fantastic time and no worries about nudity!|`|EJHRTkS6aa	Zumanity would be a much better show for a couple to see. It is very romantic and you can get a lovers couch in the front row with chocolate covered strawberries. Much better for a newlywed couple than Bite! This is more of a guys night out show.|`|7w0C6YgLaa	I completely agree with the last post.. Try ZUMANITY..It is also an dult show and you do get to see some skin but it's more romantic and tasteful than Bite.  My fiancee and I went and loved it.

cP3J2FNPaa	Depending on what time of year you're coming there's a wide variety: If you want to stay in Denver, Downtown has some nice spots. It's very "walking" friendly. 16th Street has all the conveniences, such as restaurants and shopping. We have museums (just like every other state) although we have a newer art museum that is pretty fun. There is also the performing arts complex, the Brown Palace, Denver Aquarium, and most of the sports venues (Coors Field: Baseball, Invesco Field: Football, and Pepsi Center: Hockey & Basketball). if you enjoy the outdoors, weather permitting, you should head North West, towards Boulder and go hiking. Boulder is also a fun town to hang out in (it's a college town, home to CU). We also have lots of other suburbs around that are cool to visit and hang out in. Golden was once Colorado's capital. It has an old-world/western style to parts of it, and has some awesome areas to go hiking. The Coors Brewery is also there, and you can take a tour and sample some tasty drinks. Hope this gives you a few ideas.|`|AA10216571	The art Museum is cool, Walk the 16th street mall.|`|dMgc5QY2aa	http://www.denver.org/metro/features/den...

You can check these fares yourself on Expedia, Orbitz or even Northwest Airlines.    http://www.britishairways.com/travel/fx/...|`|eulMjLtPaa	A quick look at Expedia shows economy class around that date would be about $1000.|`|hwToTu0saa	June/July is normally peak period and flying will cost you more. It could be around 800-1000$ roundtrip. I have my trip coming up to London from Feb 19 to Feb 23 and British Airways direct flight cost me roundtrip 531$ only. So flying in off-peak period will really help on saving some bucks.     Abhijit    PS: Book tickets on www.ba.com only.

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	You will find the distances between some of these locations further than you think.  Death Valley might have to be scratched off your list.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Sounds good to me. Check the other forums about other cities. I can give you some tips on LA:    There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of must sees. Visit as many as you have time for.:    Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors cant be wrong.  1 Destination in SoCal.  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour.  2 Destination  Even if you dont visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And theyre free to visit.     Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors.     Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.    Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste.     Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies.     Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings.     Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.    Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.    Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.    TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go.     Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.    Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.    Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.    Places to eat:  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.  Pinks Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.  Tommys Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.  Canters Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.  Phillippes: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, its hot.  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.    Places to Stay:  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame.   In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.    Places to Shop:  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica  The Grove, Los Angeles  Americana @ Brand, Glendale  Beverly Center, Los Angeles  Citadel Outlets, Commerce  Brea Mall, Brea  The Block at Orange, Orange  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  Fashion Island, Newport Beach  Santee Alley, Los Angeles
7cPuHxaqaa	i agree with yellowstone, copacabana is a really cool, touristy town, and seeing the old inca ruins on the two islands is fun.. the death road is really scary.. but fun.. its supposed to be the most dangerous road in the world.. like 200-300 people are killed each year on it.. the chapare is pretty cool.. its part of the amazon jungle basin, tihuanacu are some really awesome ruins. theres also toro toro.. which is where there are dinosaur tracks everywhere, and you can go inside these caves, and theres parts where you have to crawl.. and then theres the salt flats in uyuni, they're the bigggest salt flats in the world  hope that helped!|`|AA10619794	Places that are must visits are the ruins at Tihuanaco, the salares de yuni which is the world's largest salt flat, Copacabana and the Islands of the Sun and Moon in late Titicaca, and the city of Potosi (the source of much of Spain's riches).  If you like hiking, treking in the Cordillera Real is awesome, and riding a bicycle on the old highway of death from the cumbre to Corioco is an adrenalin rush.  There is also the Madidi park in the Amazon.

Ad esempio per l'escursione a tulum compresa la gita in catamarano l'avevo pagata un paio d'anni fa 150 euro per due persone,sui 200 euro sempre per due persone chichen itza (tra l'altro  una bella sfacchinata perch si parte prestissimo al mattino e si torna la sera tardi)mentre tulum  a una ventina di km dal viva maya.

PA0bGBtCaa	Unfortunately Southwest has done away with formal paper tickets. You just need your six digit reservation number when you buy your ticket. If you don't have the internet to print your boarding pass when you are ready to fly, then you can punch in that reservation number on a kiosk, or an agent can check you in and give you a boarding pass. Only other airline employees flying for free on Southwest are issued paper tickets these days.|`|KDUwFiBPaa	No.  And I don't think it is really a ticket anymore just an itinerary.  You can also check in and print your boarding pass before you get there.  Most companies don't do formal tickets anymore unless you through a travel agent.

nHuMeLtyaa	Now I get it.  Athough the international community has recognized the Palestinians as a singular people deserved of their own state, most Israelis consider them Arabs like any other and that they belong in Jordan and Egypt respectively.  It's ironic that they take this position against the international perception since if it wasn't for the UN, there would be no Israel.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	As far as I know, most Israelis and Zionists do want a state of Palestine to exist; they just want it to refrain from bombing Israel and Israelis.  If you look into history, the fact is that there never has been a country called Palestine, ever. There has been a region called Palestine, yes, but it has never been an independent nation.  In the 1500s even the name Palestine disappeared from the map when the Ottoman Turks took over.  It didn't appear on the map again until after WWI when Britain was assigned to govern the region temporarily, and they called it The British Mandate of Palestine.    Now, the fact that there hasn't been a state of Palestine doesn't mean there can never be one.  Israel has tried continuously to encourage the Palestinians to develop a stable and civilized government, with very limited success.    The reason people keep bringing up that there has never been a Palestinian state is that Palestinians continually say that there was a Palestinian state and that Israel's land rightly belongs to them, and they use this as justification for daily bombings of Israel.  I think many of them are actually ignorant, and don't understand that the British Mandate didn't constitute an independent Palestinian nation, and that there was no official Palestine at all under Ottoman rule.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	When I'm asked where I am from I say Texas.  Assuming that anyone asking has heard of Texas and I'm usually right.  Also assuming they understand that's good old USA.  Even though we were once and could again be a free self sustaining nation of our own.  I say that because I was born in the land from people that were born on the land. As well as their parents.  The very few Assyrians that left Israel and ran away from the land in 48 shouldn't call themselves Palestinians because there is no Palestine and never was.  The majority having Arab and Persian backgrounds most certainly have no claim just because their grandfathers said lets go get us some free land and join the Jihad.  Lets all move to Jordan and join in overthrowing that government.  They make be stuck in what they choose to call Palestine but they aren't Palestinian anymore than I would be if I moved there.  My people have an old saying.  If the white man would just go back where he came from and take his slaves with him  we could handle the Mexicans.  Racist?  Yes but with some truth in it.  If the Arabs and Persians would all go home Israel could make peace with the remaining Assyrians.  Then there could be a Palestine.  Unfortunately the blood is so mixed up now this can't happen .  With the imported Muslim Jihad there can never be peace.
AA10799058	of course you can do that.  Now why you are willing to change your life Style e ? if you are living in Europe or North america, you will not like their life style in occupied Palestine.  Be wise and do not liquidate all your belongings because at a certain time you will want to go back.  G.Luck anyway|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	You can go there as a gentile to study abroad, but unless you're Jewish you cannot immigrate. Also, the living wage there is quite low. Apartments are expensive, and the buildings are not built like ours.   No closets, concrete, cold, and you get a lot of mold in the winter.   Also, there is the language barrier. The running joke is, How do become a millionaire in Israel? Go there with a billion.     It's expensive.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Yes you can.  It would help you a great deal if you learned Hebrew though.  You will gain/lose respect from Israelis depending on your proficiency in the language.  (Being fluent in Hebrew shows that you are serious.)  Decide which city you want to live in, go there, rent an apartment (at least $500/mo.).  I recommend you visit as a tourist first, come back and then make your final decision.  You will probably have to make great sacrifices in order to live there and not have a nervous breakdown.  Even in peace time, Israel is an extremely stressful place to live.  Just dealing with Israelis on a day to day basis can take its toll on the average American.|`|aI3WsnnEaa	Yes you can. No Hebrew needed.    All you need is "to already have a job"    Be willing to leave the country every 3 months or more (for visa renewal).    No problem! Its illegal, but I did it and it was no sweat (cept for some uncomfortable situations at the border but that was due to some photos i took and my leaving very often for Arab countries)

tvNkizDraa	If Seychelles is what I think it is, you really should ask nicely.  The Brits already laid claim to the largest island in the chain, dislocating the native people.  At one point, the indigenous people were close to winning their case to be allowed to return, but the ruling was overturned at the last minute on a technicality.  Literally, the boat was sitting there and they weren't allowed to board.  I think that was the point where the Brits offered it to the US on a long-term lease.

Cause you need other things in a relationship to make a marriage work  These (and im not trying to be rude or prejudiced, this is my future im thinking about).. I wouldnt marry these men even if I was desparately in love with them...   a non muslim or someone without faith  a man with a fatal contractable disease  a man with thousands of dollars worth of debt already  a man that is not working and no means of support for me  a man that does not have family values or loves children  a man that cannot or is not willing to talk and have a good communication with me and value my input into the partnership  plus a whole list of more reasons why just love only isnt enough|`|cypZ0ykXaa	no! i dont think so. love develops once u get married. atleast for a typical muslim women, who sees her husband only after marriage falls in love with her hubby & the relation keeps getting stronger and stronger. many think arrange marriage dont exists.but,mine was an arranged marriage & i'm happily married with lots of luv in our relation.Alhamdulillah!!|`|uvx3cnkJaa	Definitely|`|FpT7x2VVaa	it's a good contributing factor, but should not be the only one.   especially if you plan to marry into a different culture and live in another country.  temper this with rational thinking - future economics, common goals, how well are you matched, outlook in life, political, religion etc.    love will grow stronger over time, especially if there was some at the beginning - the trick is not to mistake a raging storm of hormones for love.|`|nINIHF8baa	No, if you don't love someone when you marry them, you sure arent going to learn to love them as the years pass.  You ARE going to accept your fate, try to put a good spin on it all, and try to make the best you can out of a bad situation, but you aren't going to love them.|`|UhnvXXxjaa	do you think the absence of love between a married couple is a good reason to divorce?     ps: absence of love doesn't mean hate|`|s02JBtvDaa	No .     they're many things Love is a Factor ..    As we know LOVE is Blind and we Know how Blind guys choose :)      i hope my Point is clear|`|dp2Rocjraa	well my answer was yes , untill i saw mintee's answer . lol .|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Yes, it is the best reason to do so...|`|1EzSAU5Haa	For boys yes, for girls I doubt!    Fable:  "Boy: I'm not rich like John, I don't have a Mercedes like John, I don't have a big mansion like John, but I love you.  Girl: I love you too, ...but tell me more about John!"

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of must sees. Visit as many as you have time for.:    Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors cant be wrong.  1 Destination in SoCal.  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour.  2 Destination  Even if you dont visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And theyre free to visit.     Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors.     Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.    Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste.     Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies.     Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings.     Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.    Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.    Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.    TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go.     Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.    Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.    Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.    Places to eat:  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.  Pinks Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.  Tommys Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.  Canters Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.  Phillippes: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, its hot.  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.    Places to Stay:  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame.   In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.    Places to Shop:  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica  The Grove, Los Angeles  Americana @ Brand, Glendale  Beverly Center, Los Angeles  Citadel Outlets, Commerce  Brea Mall, Brea  The Block at Orange, Orange  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  Fashion Island, Newport Beach  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|DhFEDEwIaa	That guy with the long answer said it all!!!        ESPECIALLY DISNEYLAND!|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	The metropolital Los Angeles area is roughly 50 miles wide, and 110 miles long.  We could give you a much better answer if you could narrow down which part you are going to, and what things you would like to see.    For example: If you would like to go to Disneyland you would stay in the Anaheim-Buena Park area. That would be central to the many attractions in that area.     PS: It's rare to see celebrities out in public. Don't be disappointed if you don't see any.

Come le migliori riviere italiane e francesi, ma quando ti fermi e compri da mangiare i prezzi sono ben piu' bassi, e lo stile piu' casalingo;    5) Le scogliere di Moher e le isole Aran, nella baia di Galway: panorami mozzafiato, e i maglioni fatti con la lana delle pecore di Aran sono ... sufficienti a riparare danni d'amore, sia che li indossi tu, sia che li regali alla persona amata.

89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	a me  piaciuta tantissimo.  molto "europea" rispetto alle altre citt americane. c' un misto di architettura antica e moderna.  relativamente piccola e il centro si gira tranquillamente a piedi. si respira un'aria anglosassone, ci sono tantissimi iralandesi e di conseguenza tantissimi pub. la zona del mercato  carinissima, tanti ristorantini e locali vari. l'unica cosa  che non  consigliabile visitarla d'inverno,  molto molto fredda e ci sono spessissimo bufere di neve colossali.   sede di famosissime universit tipo harvard, il MIT e molte altre scuole x cui ci sono tanti giovani un p da tutto il mondo.  io la consiglio vivamente.|`|48019b04789aa0ac279078db6dcd184daa	Beh direi che sia una bella citt, soprattutto in confronto con la media delle alte citt americane.

VxtSO8BGaa	Dolphinwebkinzgirl and lyrna........*lol*...there is great skiing in Australia !     Now to the question....I'd suggest you call the Air Cargo companies at YVR and stay away from Shipping lines !    It's the distance that's the problem and Air Cargo would be best !    If you yourself are flying then check it in.    Glad to help ! *S* (Michael C...)|`|jQglJiMhaa	if you're flying there, check it in with your baggage.  It doesn't cost anything extra to check sporting equipment.  As long as you have a bag for it it would be fine doing it that way    Other than that, why would you send it there    Actually im aware of the riding that can be done there, i ment other than you flying why would you just send, as in if he was sending it to someone, or something along that line.  I didn't mean why as in heres not snow, i know there is.  Thanks for the info!|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Why? There's like no snow ever in Australia, I was just there and they  said the last time they got snow they can't remember why do you want to bring a snowboard there.|`|FpT7x2VVaa	checked luggage - best way  air-freight - expensive  ocean freight - find a consolidator in your home town. they're also called Freight Forwarders.    or find a company which routinely exports to Australia and see if they'd stick it into one of their containers - this would be cheapest and cost them nothing either. talk to your friends, someone may know someone who knows someone else .......
dbde6801c809eded3bdc23fa3208e8f4aa	Considering that dropping into the teens causes people to panic about the cold and an inch or two of snow shuts down the city...I'd bet it's preferable to whatever you're trying to get away from in Boston.

zBWefnYHaa	A few days across the border will not help.  You have a visa for the Schengen countries now, I assume, and or more likely a visa waiver stamp. For both there is the same rule, you can stay in the Schengen agreement area for at most 90 days out of each 180 days.    To leave that area you can go to the UK, or Ireland, or several countries in the east, but not to Norway and Switzerland as both participate at in the agreement at this time.    So your best option would be to go to England/UK or Ireland or one of the other countries not participating in the Schengen agreement area and stay there for at least 90 days or to go home.  An other possibility, I am not sure if it is going to work though, would be to apply for a visa to extend your stay in France.    If you overstay you get a mark in your passport, but also in the system, that you can not get a visa or a visa waiver stamp for any of the Schengen countries, and other countries will not allow you to come either if you are known to overstay visa.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I think Switzerland is still non-EU, but check that out.

lcj1AKt1aa	Well, today it did not rain but it rained for a short period yesterday.  In spite of the fact that it rains sometimes the sun still comes out.  At times during the month of January and February it rains and affect the crop. I do not know if it will rain everyday but I know the sun will shine everyday.   It mostly falls at night and clears up during the day. You still have time to go to the beach and enjoy our lovely water.Stop bothering about the rain and come and enjoy yourself.

Sometimes you get the odd shower, but that clears up quickly.  For the ending of last week and beginning of this one, it's has only rained once.

qZr8Fp6jaa	I travel internationally for my job and my advice is to forget about being fashionable.  You need to focus on comfort because long trips like that are exhausting, uncomfortable, and generally un-glamorous, unless you are flying first class.  A backpack is the best carry-on.  A tote is fine if you put very little in it.  You'll need to pack snacks for the plane, a travel pillow (the NAP travel pillow at Brookstone is the best), noise-canceling headphones, and a power adapter/converter.  Jet lag is horrible the first time you experience it, so bring sleeping pills and a white noise generator / sleep machine.  Don't expect to sleep much on the plane, but do force yourself to stay awake all day long when you land in Greece.  Otherwise you'll be totally messed up.  Have fun and good luck!|`|yDBYP5aJaa	I normally use a tote. And what to pack? Tissues, pen, paper, magazines, snacks, hand sanitizer! And just things to do like crossword puzzles, sodoku...Camera! You will want to take pictures from the plane! And I ususally buy snacks at the airport. And you may want to bring a blanket, comfortable shoes, and etc., etc.    Hopefully I helped you! Hope your travel is safe and fun!|`|dYuK4JPEaa	A backpack!  Its easy to carry through the air ports.  If you have a laptop, get a laptop case with wheels!  I always have a book to read.   Your battery wont last that long on a laptop so make sure you have other things to do. If you have long hair, take a hair tie because after that long of a flight your going to want to pull it up.  Something to freshen up your face...My face feels gross in less than 10 hours :)  Good Luck!
pm2EeEgiaa	Philippines is one of the countries in the world with a mixed heritage, particularly Malay, Spanish, Chinese, and American. Their primary staple is rice, as well as noodles.

Thanks to the Chinese.     And desserts referred to as Kakanin or food which are usually made of glutinous rice flour, sugar and coconut milk are also served. Commonly, grilled meat and/ fish is served too.    Round fruits are also served because it is said to bring people good fortune.

(From anywhere else, you just apply for a visa).    From the US, as mentioned, many people ignore the rules and travel illegally via third countries (Canada, Mexico). As long as you don't take back anything Cuban, you are unlikely to have a problem.    But if you want to be legal, you would have to comply with OFAC rules to be legal. You may be eligible under the family visits - if you have relatives in Cuba (see the OFAC website). Alternatively, you can travel under another form of OFAC licence (for example a church's humanitarian licence).|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Can't get there legally from here. You'd have to first fly to the U.K. or something. And I don't know how you go about all the entry and stuff, just that I wouldn't go back if I were you.|`|HziXc5Ovaa	First, where are you flying from? If you presently residing in the US, then you would need to obtain a travel licence from the OFAC. If you have immediate family living in Cuba, then you'll qualifty for a travel licence for visiting family.  http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement...    However, if you not from the US, it's an easier procedure. Obviously you are aware that Cuba does not recognize dual citizenship. Cuban-Canadians must enter Cuba on their Cuban passport. They must also show a valid Canadian passport in order to return to Canada. Under Cuban law, the Government of Canada cannot provide consular services to Canadian nationals or to permanent residents of Canada with Cuban citizenship. Travellers born in Cuba (regardless of current citizenship) should contact a Cuban government office in Canada to ensure compliance with Cuban regulations. Failure to do so may result in being refused entry into Cuba, detention upon entry or being refused departure by Cuban immigration authorities.  http://www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/r...    The same procedure may be followed from other non-US countries.

VlhmbHGGaa	When you buy a ticket it will have a set of rules attached. The rules regulate what you can do with the ticket, for example:    If you can refund it  If you can change it, and if yes to what cost    So it is difficult to answer your question without knowing the specific rules attached to your ticket. Easiest is to phone the airline and ask for a change, they will tell you if it's possible and the cost.    Websites like www.expertflyer.com will let you read your ticket rules but the site costs money. So phoning the airline is probably your best bet.|`|7toznquyaa	Most airlines charge $100 to change the ticket, plus the difference in price between the 2 flights.    This can get a little pricey.  It's doable.. no problem.  but is it really worth it??|`|PA0bGBtCaa	Sure, but be prepared as the airline will charge you a change fee and a difference in air fare.

In fact our first constitution was patterned after the USA constitution.    English literacy here is 83%. So English is a "normal" language around here.|`|7ONAv4vYaa	It is because English is the international language and the Philippines is the third largest English speaking country. The blog is not only intended for a Filipino reader but to the world. If you can read the blog then that is not a problem.    Unlike the other countries that you have mentioned, mostly their citizens does not know English. That is why it is written in their tongue.    So we should be proud we can communicate to the world. Speaking in English should not be a negative trait, but it should mean that Filipinos are intelligent and competitive. Learning another tongue is not that easy but for us Filipinos we are gifted. No wonder why we made trade to other countries in Asia before Spanish era, and no wonder why the Spaniards landed on the Philippine isles. I think because Filipinos can communicate.|`|QYC6cjwEaa	Interesting. In my opinion, the reason that the blog is written in English is for the purpose of sharing. English is the Philippines second language or third to some who know a local dialect or two. So, most Filipino's who may be reading the blog will most likely understand it.|`|tcmaLqWFaa	Contrary to popular belief, this is NOT a Filipino web site.

But while we are at this point, we can also ask why is the Yahoo Philippines Website in itself not in Tagalog? Much like Yahoo Argentina, Yahoo Brazil, Yahoo France, Yahoo Italy, Yahoo Japan, Yahoo India, etc. etc. are in their native language.    And as far as I know it is only Yahoo Malaysia, Yahoo Singapore & Yahoo Philippines which are the only Yahoo International Sites in English of course aside from Yahoo UK, Yahoo New Zealand & Yahoo Australia, which have English as their native language.    Your guess is as good as mine. Although the only thing I could think of is that Malaysia, Singapore & the Philippines are unique in the sense that they are small enough to have English as their national language together with their native language & the people who do speak their main native language also speaks English. India should have been included in this select if not unique group but they are just too big, population wise.|`|PgvwnEpMaa	do you mean this webpage? thats the rule here.. english only for all to understand.

1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Barbizon is a total scam.  First, you will sit through about an hour long presentation where someone tells you how they came to Barbizon when they were a teenager and how successful they became and how it changed their life.  You will also hear about how selective Barbizon is and how they only work with the teens they feel have true potential.  After that, you fill out some papers and wait to be interviewed with everyone else in the room.  After that, you wait some more while they "decide" on who they are going to "offer" to work with.  When they tell you they are interested in taking you on, they make it sound like you are the greatest thing since Cindy Crawford.  What they don't tell you is that they are "offering" the same deal to everyone else in the room.  The bottom line is that Barbizon has a modeling school where they teach teens about makeup, hair, clothing, self-confidence, etc.  They also represent a limited number of teens as an actual agent.  Their modeling school costs around $2000, but they don't charge you anything to represent you.  Just because they are "offering" you the modeling school doesn't mean they want to represent you.  The modeling school and the agency have nothing to do with each other.    One of my friend's daughters went through the Barbizon agency ... not the modeling school ... and became a very successful teen model.  She didn't pay a penny for anything ... no modeling school, no headshots, nothing.  Barbizon picked it all up because they wanted to represent her and they did.      Another friend's daughter went to the Barbizon interview and was "offered" the modeling school.  She was told she'd have to pay the $2000 fee for the school and there was no guarantee the agency would want to represent her.  After my friend did some checking and found out that they make this offer to everyone who goes to an interview, they declined it.  That was two years ago.  Barbizon still occasionally calls them to try to get them to sign up for their modeling school, much like a telemarketer.    Go to the interview, but at the first mention of money, pick yourself up, thank them for their time and LEAVE.
LfAYsTd1aa	You can arrange a multiple entry visa in advance but they are just that MULTIPLE ENTRY. You can not use a multiple entry visa to stay in the Philippines for 5 months.     Multiple entry visas are available in 6 and 12 months terms. What that means is that you can come and go as many times as you like within the 6 or 12 month period but each time you enter the Philippines, you are only allowed to stay a maximum of 59 days, unless you arrange an extension.    What I suggest you arrange in advance is a single entry, 59 day visa. On any Philippines embassy website, it will say it is a 3 months visa. What that means is that you have 3 months from the date of issue to enter the Philippines. Once you enter the Philippines, you are only allowed to stay 59 days, unless you arrange an extension.    If you don't want to arrange a 59 day visa before you leave the USA, as a US citizem you will be granted a 21 day visa waiver on arrival in the Philippines, so long as you are not blacklisted, have 6 months validity in your passport and have a return ticket to the USA or an onward ticket to any other country.    Before the 21 days expires, you can arrange an extension. The first extension will be a 38 day visa waiver extension. This will take you up to the 59 days you could have arranged in advance.     After that, extensions are 2 months at a time until you have been in the Philippines for 16 months.    After the 16 months, you can take a shopping trip to Hong Kong or take a short visit to any nearby country, come back to the Philippines and start your 16 months all over again.      You do not have to arrange your extension in Manila. There are offices of the Bureau of Immigration all over the Philippines. Check here for offices near where you will be staying  http://immigration.gov.ph//index.php?opt...    Alternatively, you could use an agent. Check travel agents near where you will be staying to see how much they charge to arrange an extension. I even have a friend in Cebu City with a visa extension business who will come to you so you don't even have to leave home to arrange your extension.     If you stay in the Philippines for more than 6 months, you will require permission to leave the Philippines in the form of an Emigration Clearance Certificate. No Emigration Clearance Certificate when you arrive at the airport and they will not let you on the plane to go home. Emigration Clearance Certificate can be arranged at the Bureau of Immigration.    For more information about tourist visa's and the visa extension process, check this page of my website.  http://www.bigjimsphilippinesexperience....      Regards: Jim Sibbick|`|Rh2th9zqaa	You get 21 days when you enter. You can then go to the Philippine immigration office in Intramuros, Manila and get a 2 month extension for $75.00. you can do this multiple times up to 1 year from date of entry. You must leave before the year is out or you will get fined for overstay.|`|tcmaLqWFaa	Since you have the time.  Get a one year, multiple entry visa from the Philippine Embassy in Washington DC.  It costs about $90 and it will save you tons of aggravation and additional expenses for extensions while your here.  You don't have to have that but its worth it.|`|AA10903224	Hi,    I am guessing you are a US citizen in which case you DO NOT need a multiple entry visa for your visits. You are allowed to enter Visa free for 21 days. This can be extended by 38 days at the Philippine airport of entry (Manila or Cebu) for a small fee. All legal & above board with no stress. You can get much more info on your options at Live and Retire in the Philippines:    http://retirephilippines.wetpaint.com/pa...    Included are the costs & even a link to the RP Immigration website should you need it.    Enjoy your visits.    Uzi.|`|AA12116844	The guy above is right. Come in on a 21 days stay and extend monthly.    You need not have to through all the hassle at Intramurous office (real hassle and break your b**ls). There are lots of travel agencies who will undertake the extension for you and legally.    You may also like to land in Clarke airport instead, immigration officers there are more 'friendly' and will offer you a 6 month entry stamp for a fee.    Last note, try not to stay beyond six months as you are required to obtain an exit permit. Can only be done in Intramurous and this one will really break your b**ls, coz you will need to get a NBI clearance first hand in an other part of the city. NBI clearance is 6 stations of and sweltering in your sweat for a whole day.

CyP7VMHHaa	It depends. Some hotel chains offer specially discounted, nonrefundable rates. These are charged at the time that you make the reservation.    For most rates, you pay when you check out. The website will tell you if you are charged immediately.    Even if you are not charged immediately, they will want a credit card number if you want to guarantee your room for late arrival. This holds your room regardless of when you arrive. If you don't show up and fail to cancel by the hotel's deadline, then you will be charged for the first night. If you don't guarantee the room and you don't show up by the deadline, they can give your room away with no compensation to you.|`|TRuOa7AVaa	you pay at Hilton's for your service the second you accept the terms.Then you will-be re billed after one 24 hour period.

pCLfOOGQaa	Well depending on your financial situation and idea of what you want to do in a university would help you decide where exactly in North America to go. As for prepping for it, I will forewarn you, people here are ObSeSSed with fashion, tabloids, drama, television, (any new kind of electronics really....ipod, flat screens, cell phones), people are also obsessed with materialistic things, trends, fads.  Such as the latest style (leggings, mini skirts, and tunics for girls or jeans and blazers for guys).  Some places are worse than others. (Such as New York, California, etc.)  I guess if you want to have the best experience you really have to have an idea of what you're looking for.  Do you want something laid back and relaxing but exciting or do you want something that's non-stop go and a social life beyond belief? You obviously have internet where you are so google "life in new york" or "life in tennessee" kind of stuff and see what attracts you the most. Google search USA's best universities or USA's best cities to live in and make some ideas. Don't worry about what everyone else here in America is into, you do what you're in to! That's why there's a china town and an indian stand at local fairs. People get to stick to their ethnic roots but enjoy our ways of living. So search around and see what grabs you the most. And good luck!|`|fd747af047fac4ce6b0786a13d942ae6aa	You have to go through proper channels.  You will have to get accepted first.  Try to pick a school that fits your needs.  Try to pick a school in a part of the country where you will be comfortable living.  This is a big country, with all types of climates.  Do you want to be in a city or out in the country?  Do you want a big campus or small campus?   Are you getting my drift?  You will have to apply for a student visa.  It may limit how much you can work.  American colleges are generally very expensive.  Start doing your research now.  You have a lot of work to do.  Good Luck!

qq5nceCXaa	Depends on what you want as a traveler.    Both have spectacular scenery, especially on the west coast.  Both are well developed with reasonable links between places, maybe Norway's better for public transport in the rural areas, but Ireland is possibly easier on tourists as the language issue can be greater in rural Norway, as can the accommodation and expenses.    I wouldn't say either is nicer, they're just different.  Ireland's likely to be the cheaper option though|`|YMHsibG8aa	norway|`|rCLULlhIaa	i would suggest going to norway cuz u spelled ireland wrong and u may offned people there... lol|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Norway is more dramatic and breathtaking (especially the west coast fjords), but both have nice scenery. Both countries are also expensive for a holiday (Norway moreso). Dublin is a nicer capital than Oslo though. The beautiful parts of both countries are outside the capitals.    If you like wintry weather, Norway would definitely be the better choice. Both countries get a lot of rain. Both countries have beautiful summers.     If you want to see some Norwegian landscapes, do a search for Lofoten, Geiranger fjord and Sognefjord.|`|PN4JMhsNaa	Screw both go to Japan man they know how to treat a man!|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Landscape-wise: Norway  Music/culture/history-wise: Ireland

But here are some suggestions from me, for what it's worth:    - Dubai, fun place to go for 4 nights and you can take advantage of the over-night flights too? Go wadi-bashing, camel riding, chill at the beach, go to bazaars and shop till you drop, try great cuisine etc.etc.    - Cairo - especially if you like museums/history, very cosmopolitan city  - NY or Washington - close enough to LON to be only 6-7 hour flight, tons of things to do!   - Rio - yes I know a long flight (13 hours I think) but boy is it worth it. One of the coolest cities on the planet. Beach/tram ride/rain forest in city/Ipanema/look where great British train robbers lived etc.  - Cape Town - again long way to go but fab. place. Mountains/wineries/scenery/food/whale watching/boating.....  - I know it's European but have you considered Reykjavik? Just went there for 3 nights last year, Blue Lagoon was wonderful.  Singapore - v. diff.to Hong Kong, but I prefer it any day - food absolute delight and easily fill 3-4 days    Finally:  - Marrakesh - haven't been, but friends have and loved it   - Same with Doha - meant to be the 'Dubai' of 10 years ago    Hope that helps you a little...enjoy. I tried to pick places that as a UK citizen and Passport holder you won't need a visa for either :)|`|660e88a15a0776f31a8a4261d00568f9aa	Seeing that you're looking beyond Europe, and presumably beyond possible danger zones, the next closest area would be the Americas.  A trip to the Carribean, possibly a cruise, provides some contrast to the chilly winter.  Of course, between the U.S., Mexico, and the Carribean, you're sure to find somewhere interesting.      I would suggest Canada, but unless you like Siberian weather, this might not be the right time of the year.

Does your state have only one zip code?     I just looked up the postal codes for Rhode Island, which was the smallest state I can think of, and they had nearly 100 zip codes!  http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/zip_codes_...    So based on that, why would you think that the province of Ontario in Canada would only have one?    If you want to know a postal code (they are not called zip codes here) for someplace in Ontario, just go to the Canada Post website and fill in the address, street name, city, and province. That will give you the correct postal code.  http://www.canadapost.ca/Personal/Tools/...    Here in Canada, the postal codes use both letters and numbers, in the format "A9A 9A9". The "A" will be any valid letter, and the "9" a number from 0-9.    The postal code you are looking for in Ontario will start with a letter K, L, M, N, or P (The letter "O" is not used so as not to get it confused with a zero).|`|2wyDALHgaa	There is about 420,000 of them just in Ontario alone.  Which one do you want.  Groups of homes in the same cities share a postal code.  It's not done by town.

9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	...Check out the places you want First.Some of the Hotels and Condos are abiding by some new laws that will only rent to people 25 and over,(the owners association that mine is in has voted not to rent to anyone under 21 for spring break,several units heavily damaged last year by a group of 18 and 19 year olds).   So check age limits first before you go so you can have a place to stay.   There are still motels and hotels within walking distance that will rent to the age group you have mentioned,but there is a limit of 4 per room in some of them.You need to check that out  also,this is an insurance code on the number per room.   I'm sure you can locate a decent place but look for prices from 99 to 200 dollars a night,depending on location.|`|JIATcwW6aa	Club La Vila is a hot spot for teenagers.  There are many reasonable condos and hotels around.  You can get a great place for that price each.  Some of the newer condos are located to the west end of PCB.

Majestic Beach Towers is a nice, newer condo that my daughter stayed at last summer for cheerleading camp.|`|GjLmdDU4aa	There are many wonderful beach front condo/resorts in PCB    And Spinnakers seems to be the hot spot year round in PCB.    Shipwreck Island water park is also a blast!|`|svkzsQmYaa	check out www.thebeachloversbeach.com for info on the properties on the beach.  As mentioned before most places only rent to 25 and older.  With a little digging you can find a place.  Most important is that you don't want to misrepresent yourself by having a parent rent the room/condo for you.  Without someone over 25 present most will evict you or won't let you check in and there are no refunds at nearly all properties.  Not only that chances are motels/hotels will all be sold out.      Also check out www.vrbo.com    You'll find a lot of condo owners who rent their places out without any regard to their home owner's association's policies.    Add an additional 10.6% for lodging taxes.  If you do go the condo route you should know it is not like a hotel.  You supply your own toilet paper/soap/shampoo, etc.  Pretty much all the amenities other than sheets and towels.  They have full kitchens so you can save a lot of money pooling a grocery trip and cooking most meals at the condo.    Club La Vela is your best bet at that age.  Keep in mind the later in the night it is the higher the cover charge; up to $30 some nights.

Plus there's bocci courts down the end, even if you don't play it's the most fun you'll have walking around.|`|pn2QRgAJaa	go around areas like fanuel hall and the quincy market. or there's a place i think it's called washington street. it's safe and fun. it's high end shopping and it's very nice. there are nice restaurants around there too!|`|iDjp5eKGaa	Tea at the Ritz is fun and fairly reasonable. You would be served little tea sandwiches, cookies, pastries, and of course, tea. I remember going to the Ritz for a friend's 16th birthday celebration. It was fun.    It runs about $32 a piece.|`|8ilHQMq5aa	fire and ice.   it is right off the green line at the arlington t stop on the green line  safe fun inexpensive.|`|AA12161154	If you want to get dressed up you can go to Newbury St but that's going to be on the expensive side. There are a lot of restaurants all up and down the road. You can also go to the North End, it's not exclusively a dressy area but i've definitely dressed up to go out to dinner there. Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market has a lot of restaurants but again, not exclusively dressy unless you're going to certain bars late at night (which you won't be able to do anyways). There are a couple places in the South End that are on the dressy side. You just have to be careful about where you're going and at what time. I know there are a lot of restaurants that change to 21+ at a certain time and the times are different on the weekends and when the Red Sox are playing. For instance, Cask N Flagan is 21+ all day when there is a Red Sox game. So unless you're with your parents . . they're not going to let you in.

AA10250756	All those jobs are taken. There are no openings and people who used to do that work are laid off. I suggest you contact the Community College and find out how you can get a Pell grant and go to school for two years and get a skill so you can be hired. The regular school system in Pinellas County has a free program to train adults for jobs that are in demand at the PTEC schools-one in St. Pete and one in Clearwater.  One thing there are always lots of openings for are certified nurses assistants. That's a short course (just a few months) and you can go online to find lots of schools who offer that. The school can help you get a grant to pay for it.|`|TG2LrbJSaa	i just moved from tampa fl to boston and to be honest there are hardly any jobs in that area Tampa has the 4th highest unemployment of all the cities in the US. Not to mention that the Day Labor jobs that are available people literally fight over them because they pay cash daily and the people who got laid off run to these places (my brother was laid off from a moving company making 17 an hour and went to day labor cuz he could not find a job else where and he had to fight with the others just like him for 6.50 an hour.)

YvNCOYZZaa	Because it's going to be in August, I recommend doing the Northern route (I-80) instead of the Southern Route.  It will be cooler and less stress on the car.      I've done that trip a few times and some things I would love to do (or have done) would include:    Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (Cleveland)  Cubs Game at Wrigley Field (Chicago)  Baseball Hall of Fame (Cooperstown)  Cheyenne, Wyoming  Sundance, UT  Salt Lake City, UT  If you did a detour, you could hit   Mt Rushmore  Mesa Verde (southern CO)  Four Corners  Zion  Bryce Canyon  Grand Canyon  Hoover Dam    I don't know which part of CA you are ending up in, so it's actually hard to recommend anything west of Salt Lake.  You won't go near Las Vegas or AZ if you are in Central or Northern CA, but you will if you are south of San Luis Obispo.    And Yosemite & Mammoth won't make sense if you are trying to get to SoCal, but will for Central and Northern.      The good thing about i-80 is that there are lots of 'attraction' signs along the highway that you can stop at.  Places that you might never think about going, but would be fun to stop at just because.      Have a fun trip!|`|PE0oyIWtaa	I love doing road trips like that.  Your ideas sound good, but how about Hover Dam and Yosemite National Park?  Have fun and good luck.  Get a postcard from everywhere you stop, it is a good way to collect souvenirs that is very cost effective and they are fun to look back on years from now.

NNDcJb8Xaa	The northeast monsoon occurs from November to April, creating the dry season. The southwest monsoon brings the rainy season, and typically runs from May to October.

0zkNjyRyaa	I live in Canyon Country and can tell you it's an excellent place to raise kids. My husbad and I have lived in Glendale, Burbank and Quartz Hill and can honestly say that this is the best place for a family. We moved here because the schools are good and it's a beautiful city. My husband commutes two hours everyday to get to work and back but he says it's well worth it so our kids can live in a decent place. The only area around here I would stay away from is the Sierra Hwy. / Jakes Way area (lots of apartment buildings with lots of crime). If you are considering renting here, look up apartments in www.apartmentratings.com using zip code 91387. It will give you a good idea of the apartments around here. Personally, I would recomment the Oaks (Equity Residential) and the Colony.  Stay away from Diamond Park, River Ranch and Park Sierra.  If renting a house check out www.screm.com. Hope this helps some.    Good luck!

LAXbJfvwaa	I don't know any Canadians that live here - but we have friends that live in Canada.  I think the attitudes of the people in general are very similar.  I really love the Canadians!  I remember when I went on a trip to America and Canada and all the Americans were so tight and unfriendly - but as soon as we got off the plane in Vancouver we were greeted by the friendliest Canadian - and they were all like that.  So yeah - we like you guys.  I've never heard bad stories about Canadians from Aussies so you should be safe!|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Canadians are just like Australians except you have snow!  I think we have pretty similar tastes in music and humour.  Your only problem will be the small annoyance you feel every time someone asks you what part of the States you're from... a lot of Canadians sew a flag patch to their bags, hats, etc, to minimise this problem.  There's lots of Canadian/Aussie marriages too.  You'll have a great time!!!|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I spent six months in Canberra (Australia's capital) on an assignment.  Had a wonderful time; met many fascinating people.    There are some (not many, but some) Canadians in Australia; Sydney is probably your best shot (but Brisbane and Melbourne are definite "must visit" places) for fellow Canadians.      I won't dare insult a country as cultured as Australia by making any silly stereotypical comments.  It's a very diverse country in both thought and ethnicity.      Still part of the Commonwealth!  Safe travels!|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Australian people are very friendly, and have a good sense of humor Don't think you will have a problem living there. Just be prepared to accept their sense of humor!|`|90tPT5nlaa	There are a lot of similarities between the countries, except that we are obviously warmer with more of a beach culture, we are further from the US so we have a bit less American influence, and we like different sports. Otherwise we share a lot of culture and values. You'll fit right in and be very welcome.|`|IkWcwsj8aa	i luv Canadians|`|zOyWCvqtaa	I've hosted and managed a number of Candaian exchange students, and we love you guys.  You'll find that there are a number of similarities between Australian and Canadian values....especially our dislike of Americans haha.  Depending on when you come over, the heat may shock you a little, for example it'll be 42 degrees celcius this weekend in some inland parts of Sydney, though these temps are rare for long periods.|`|RjuciIbbaa	i love canadians :)|`|3jxBWMVeaa	Lol, I'm Australian and I'm moving to Canada next year. We spell our nickname 'Aussie' or 'Aussies' even though it doesn't sound like it.    Anyway, we're a pretty multicultural place, there's a trillion people here who aren't Australian, so you'll fit right in. A lot of people will probably think you're a yank, so make sure you clarify your Canadian.    I'd go for Melbourne over Sydney any day, Melbourne is really a much better version of Sydney, SYdney wants to be as good as Melbourne. They're very jealous of us down here in Melbourne.     I'm not sure a number of Canadians here. My cousin married a Canadian and they spend 6 months here and 6 months there, and he's awesome. Everyone here love him.|`|CpNOiYf4aa	Australia is a great country   I love living here    Most people i know think that Canadians are very nice, a lot have even said that Canada is the nicest country. But it is cool in Canada, maybe melbourne will be best for you.   Brisbane is hot, Melbourne is cool and Sydney is inbetween.    Hmmmm i geuss our humour is a bit different....... a lot of people say jokes that people i other countries would only say to their best friends.

rI7J9M8taa	Hotel rates are the highest in the summer months in Virginia Beach if you stay along the oceanfront.  But there is a lot of free entertainment such as the Annual American Music Festival which is a combination of free and paid musical acts.  Every Wednesday and Sunday night there are free firework displays on the beach.  Right next to the beach is a boardwalk which is three miles long. You can walk or rollerblade to your heart's desire.  They also have a new bike path that runs alongside the boardwalk and many hotels offer free bike rentals.  The water isn't warm like Florida or Hawaii, but is warmer than up north and the beach is very clean.

Give yourself two days to do it with an overnight stop in/near Bloemfontein.|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	Its hard. It hurts. Your eyes get sore.  You get so tired you can't sleep anymore.      On the positive side seeing the geographical climate changes is interesting and the scenery is beautiful.    And hell no is it 17hours unless you are driving at 160km/hr without stopping anywhere and even then... I seriously doubt it. Case in point driving from Pretoria to Cape Town takes about 14 hours and Polokwane is even further.    I'd sleep somewhere in the middle if i were you. Or at least get someone to help you drive...

For other cheap ideas try: http://www.CheapInTheCity.com    Have fun!|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Right now you can go ice skating for free at Bryant Park. All you have to pay for is the skate rental. :)     When the weather gets a little warmer, you can take the Staten Island ferry for free from Downtown Manhattan to Staten Island. On a clear night, you can see "Lady Liberty". You can go to a Staten Island Yankees game while you're there. Tickets are much cheaper than going to see the NY Yankees Major League baseball players play. Many museums have a "pay by donation" day per week where you can pay whatever you want to contribute to enter the museum. Admission is FREE on Wednesdays for the Bronx Zoo. I believe the Central Park Zoo has a different day (same fee). Check their websites to confirm.
xs2mpYjWaa	You have no chance in hell. Our legal age is 18, no 15 year olds get served alcohol. In fact you would even be allowed in a place they serve alcohol (except restaurants) without a parent or guardian and yes they check id. You will not get into nightclubs and bars fullstop, not even with a parent.     If they suspect you are under 25 they will ask you for ID, they can ask for ID up to 70 years of age if they want.     In New Zealand I was with my parents and at 16 they served me alcohol, but again with parents and 16 not 15.     So to answer in brief, you won't even get into clubs or bars, don't bother trying and don't come here with an intent to break our laws, its very disrespectful and not appreciated.     Enjoy the 7 year wait till you can drink in America.     By the way we don't have 'Spring break' in Australia, it sounds stupid to us so cheering about it will make you look weird.|`|Ze25ovEiaa	I'm not sure about New Zealand, but in Australia the legal drinking age of 18 is enforced.   Chances are you won't even get in to a club or bar. I turned 18 a few months ago, and have been asked for ID every time I've gone out. Clubs etc are supposed to ask for ID if you look under 25.   So nope, sorry, I don't think you guys will have much luck, even if you do look mature for your age.|`|3jxBWMVeaa	Legal drinking age is 18, if you look under 25, they'll ask you for ID. I'm only 17 but it's not hard to get it lol. When I was 15 my friend went to get drinks with her aunty who was 27, the aunty got asked for ID and my friend didn't.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	I don't know about across THE DITCH, but in Australia it is 18...It's definitely enforced, so you'll still need I.D...Much better than waiting til you're 21 though!|`|NzHtbpfJaa	Legal age is 18yrs old to be able to drink in NZ and Australia.  You will not be able to get into nightclubs, pubs etc....     Basically if you look under 25 anyone can ask you for ID, including bottle shops/liquor stores, restaurants, night clubs etc.    It is just not worth it to serve underage people - they can get fined hundreds of thousands of dollars and lose their trading license.    So no you won't be partying it up here.    Much more other things to do than drink anyhow !   Take in the sights for a start, you are going to another country, make the most of it.|`|GBqmmtbtaa	the legal drinkin age in australia is 18  the law states that if u look under 25 u will be asked for i.d|`|zOyWCvqtaa	I can speak for Australia.  The legal drinking age is 18.  There has been a lot of media coverage over teenage drinking, especially binge drinking, of late and as such many places have been forced to tighten up checking for ID.  I myself would never condone underage drinking, and I personally suggest not taking the risk.  Enjoy your stay over here anyway, and keep in mind during March/April it can still be quite warm in parts.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	I don't know who told you that the drinking age isn't enforced but they are completely misinformed.    You won't be able to buy any alcohol anywhere in Australia without photo ID which verifies you are over 18.    My daughter was asked to show her ID only a couple of years ago and she's nearly 30 now.

(:  ummm.... hmmm.....  omg! yes do disney land for idk how long  maybe a couple of days, but you HAVE  to go over to california adventures(right next to disneyland)  and go on the ride california soaring/screaming(its one of those two names)   universal studios might be fun too!|`|2FsNdcXEaa	Since she's in to that stuff, I was going to say Universal Studios before I even read it. I'm not trying to drag you down or anything, but if she's expecting any sort of "in" into acting, she should not be getting her hopes up. Honestly, I couldn't spend more than 2 days in Disneyland. It really isn't a very big park. Just walking around LA in general is really fun to, it's a great city with amazing shopping!

There is also Duck rides (the amphibious vehicles), the Mid-America Science Museum, Magic Springs theme park, Crystal Springs water park and the Hot Springs Mountain Tower.  There are also museums, aquariums, and a zoo for the family. If you want outdoor activities, there are three state parks in the area.

You will have to change; there are three options.      Option 1. Take Megabus/Citylink service M8 from Glasgow Buchanan Bus Station to Dunblane Police Station (coach every hour). Here take service 47 or 47A (every two hours) to Crieff.      Option 2. Take Megabus/Citylink service M8 from Glasgow Buchanan Bus Station to Perth Bus Police Station (coach every hour). Here take Stagecoach service 15 (every hour) to Crieff.    Option 3. Take Megabus/Citylink service M9 from Glasgow Buchanan Bus Station to Perth Broxden. here take the Park & Ride service (frequent) to Perth Bus Police Station. Here take Stagecoach service 15 (every hour) to Crieff.      Option 1 is probably the quickest and cheapest, but I am not sure of the connection time at Dunblane. I would probably opt for Option 1 if it was me.
