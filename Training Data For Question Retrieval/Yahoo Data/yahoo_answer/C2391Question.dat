20061103121411AAbPNIG	Education & Reference;Teaching	Do schools in the United States teach about Internet safety?	I see a lot of young girls and boys on here "shopping" for friends and signifigant others. They will say things like "I'm 15 and a girl, i really need a boyfriend in the San Diego area." or "I'm 16 and lonely, and need someone to talk to" If parents are not going to educate their children on Internet safety should the schools play a larger role.   I saw a question earlier today about whether or not teen girls get pubic hairs and what they are like...it was too graphic for just being curious and too ignorant to be taken seriously. Some young girls actually answered the question. I was shocked at how naive these girls are. Do they not realize that even when someone says he or she is under 18 that it could really be a pedophile in disguise?    Is there anything we can do about this? It's becoming more and more common for young children to be taken in by Internet preditors, it's frightening.

I was planning on going to Penn State (the Berks county branch) for Art - General, Graphic Design, and Japanese as my majors. The problem is, even though the State campus (at University Park) has all of those courses, I don't know...      1) If I would be able to transfer all of those classes,   2) Whether my acceptance into the State campus would             depend on my High School GPA, or the GPA of my college classes, and   3) What credits I would have to have to transfer           I've checked out their website (which I couldn't really figure out where I needed to go, since it was like, 2 in the morning ^^), and I've looked on  http://CollegeSearch.CollegeBoard.com  for info on either of the two campuses.

20081102133835AASd45y	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone critique my essay for me?	Prompt: While we leave the topic of your second essay entirely up to you, try telling us something about yourself that you believe we cannot learn elsewhere in your application.      I’m not sure what spurred me to that toy store. It was miles away. I’m not sure how I found the tiny 2 square feet dedicated to that little piece of plastic. Cobwebs had been amassing over the forgotten toy. I’m not sure why I spent my last two dollars from my paycheck on the plaything. My judgment told me to save. But I was sure that this was the beginning to something mind-boggling.   The yoyo at the end of the string was red, clear, and cheap. It had a fixed axle. The string was not fanciful or chimerical; it was just cotton. My childhood skills had long rusted and cracked and disintegrated. However, once I started, I could not give up. I faltered; I floundered; I failed. The devil bruised me. His tail cut me. My finger turned blue from the noose. But I never quit. I could not quit. I cannot comprehend quitting. And so for weeks I practiced. I read books on yoyos. I learned the anatomy: transaxles, ball axles, string lengths, centripetal force, gyroscopic motion, and more! And it worked.   The night I threw the moon shot was like any other. For about 5 weeks, my practicing had given me the normal throw, the sleeper, and other basic tricks. What I lacked in talent, I compensated with form. What didn’t come naturally, I taught with time. Now my ego had extended a new challenge to me. I wanted to throw the yoyo out in front of me, pull it back, but instead of catching it, loop and push it out above my head, “shooting the moon,” and finally catching it again. I gained a black eye for trying this on my second day with the toy.   Shot after shot, the yoyo swished by my ear. The string tangled and knotted. The yoyo played modern percussion pieces on the floor: I never understood the jumble of noises the avant-garde called the new art. I felt exploited. Worse was that I had only exploited myself. I expected too much too soon. Reality shook me.   Suddenly, I gained some primal urge. Some instinct inside me ticked and I knew I had to try again. I threw. The yoyo flew out before me, teasing the outmost edges of the string prior to soaring back towards my hand. I made the mistake before. Fix it. I lifted my hands, twisted my fingers, and conducted the most beautiful symphony I had heard in weeks. The yoyo grazed my skin before rocketing towards the sky. I shot the moon.   My joy had come in a split second before the behemoth of defeat glared me in my face. Following through with the trick meant catching the yoyo. In order to succeed I had to seize this threatening bullet. It came so quickly. I did not even have time to think. When I realized that the yoyo was in my hand, string tucked in neatly, palm red from friction, I slowly grew to realize the feat I had just accomplished. I won.

You may well ask, "Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches, etc.? Isn?t negotiation a better path?" You are exactly right in your call for negotiation. Indeed, this is the purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and establish such creative tension that a community that has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.

She's worked her butt off to gain money and is doing pretty well, but her parents are worried she's getting into too much debt. She is a very prudent and systematic person and is doing all of her finances without any help (she's 19). She has gained a lot from her private school education, but her parents (who have cosigned her loan) say that she has to transfer to a cal state and live at home. But unfortunately, from everyone's standpoint, having her live at home is like sticking her back into an abusive household. Her parents will dictate her bed time, and there are little things such as not having stable internet, and them forcing her at random (on top of all of her jobs, school, and the most minimal amount of social time she gets) to do hard physical labor chores to compensate for her living at home...please...what can my friend do?

20090128152424AA1hBGv	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Please help me organize my essay?	It's about homeless shelters. I've done research and I'm going to go into detail where they get their funding and what services they offer (or organizations they work with) to help residents find jobs, housing, and mental health services. My main focus is on whether or not shelters should euthanize residents after a year of homelessness. I've come to the conclusion that it depends on how the shelter is funded. A shelter funded by local donations would have a fixed budget and would benefit from killing residents after a year. Shelters that are funded by lucrative organizations and bodies would get more money with more residents so they should be no-kill shelters?

I learned that bar graphs are used to compare several things and a line graph is used to record info over time or a stimulus/response type of thing. So on the test it talked about a certain acid or something that people consume in their daily diets that increases the count of red blood cells. So 0.2 of this thing(I can't remember what exactly it was) makes your rbc count to 11 million, 0.3 to 13.5 million, 0.4 to 18 million, and 0.5 to 20 million. What type of graph would you use to graph this information? Line or bar?

20090128193342AAd9kjQ	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What should I do next? Thanks for answering.?	Hi this is my second semester in college and I had this teacher for 3 weeks. So this teacher for some reason he doesn't like me I tryed to ask him after class there was too many student ask him a question. Then he already packing his belongs to leave the room. The next class meeting during the lecture he was talking about how to do multiplications and Divisions. He turned around and made faces at me which it hurted my feelings. I felt awful when he did that. I heard people who sit around me studying and doing math saying" Yeah he is a good teacher and funny". I was wondering why everyone seem to like him. Its not that I think too much. Well I'm very shy remembered the first day he want us to share answer the person sitting next to me. I was too shy to share the answer then he felt disrespected and never liked me since that day. So later I started to feel used to the class and starts to share answer the person sitting next to me more than the first day. I continued to share answer forever. He still didn't like me. I felt like I want to drop and petition another class which I already have enough problem to deal with the whole year. I am shy but I have the courage to look up and to see how he treats other students. I see that he treats other student nice and laughing smiling but when he look at me hes the opposite. His face was red and not smiling or laughing at all. So what should I do drop this class or stick with it.

The poem is below:         The Journey by Mary Oliver   One day you finally knew   what you had to do, and began,   though the voices around you   kept shouting   their bad advice—   though the whole house   began to tremble   and you felt the old tug   at your ankles.   "Mend my life!"   each voice cried.   But you didn't stop.   You knew what you had to do,   though the wind pried   with its stiff fingers   at the very foundations,   though their melancholy   was terrible.   It was already late   enough, and a wild night,   and the road full of fallen   branches and stones.   But little by little,   as you left their voices behind,   the stars began to burn   through the sheets of clouds,   and there was a new voice   which you slowly   recognized as your own,   that kept you company   as you strode deeper and deeper   into the world,   determined to do   the only thing you could do—   determined to save   the only life you could save.

20090225154458AAf76zB	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	SAT prep help... Kaplan courses?	I'm taking the SATs this May and probably another time after the summer. (I'm a junior in highschool.) Overall, I'm a pretty good student; my average is in the mid-90s. I reallyyyy want to do well but I barely have time to study. I scored a 1560 on my PSATs and I want to raise my score by at least 400 points. I know that if I really work hard at it, I can do it but I'm just not exactly sure how to study for it.      My friend told me about a Kaplan online course, she said that it helped her brother improve a lot. I also heard of a Princeton Review course... If you took the course, or know somebody who did, can you let me know if it helped? The classes are expensive and I wanna know that if I do end up taking a class, my money will be well spent. Thanks for answering =)      p.s. I'm planning to spend the summer studying hardcore lol so it would help to take a course of some sort to make sure I have a guide...
