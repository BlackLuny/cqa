RzJTtMmsaa	Absolutely.  Check out "The Passive Solar Energy Book". It lists many examples of how usage of stored solar heat can greatly reduce and even remove all necessity for oil heating, by using radiant heat that is stored during the daytime by using southern-facing windows, and heat retaining materials.  Many materials will store up the heat from the sun during the day, and then release that heat over the course of an evening. This is called Passive solar.  Also, there exists something that sadly isn't used often, called a "Water Wall", which is a wall that has a bladder of water in it which will also absorb radiant heat from the sun during the day, and give off that heat at night.    The Passive Solar Energy book has many examples like this- definitely a book I'd suggest to anyone wondering questions such as yours.|`|ywOqliwKaa	Normally, solar power produced replaces power from electric generating plants. Almost no oil  is used to produce electrical power.|`|AA11562326	Solar can displace some heating oil, if a house is designed to take advantage of incoming sun, with moveable insulation (curtains, at least) for when the sun is not shining.    If you're talking about displacing motor fuel, until we have a good battery for electric cars, neither solar, hydro, wind, nor nuclear will help.  However, natural gas as a motor fuel could displace some US dependence for foreign oil.

There are many types of greenhouse gases like cow farts and auto emissions! I for one know there full of poop! The moon goes around the earth in an elliptical pattern and the earth goes around the sun in the same fashion and right now were entering the closest part of that pattern to the sun and the polar ice caps are melting and the green froot loops are bothering the rest of us in the box! Have you ever seen a volcano erupt? They spew out so much heavy metals and pollutants into the atmosphere that we in all of our life times couldn't even come close and the earth cleans up the air in about a month and they can't seem to get that through their thick heads! Yes I do believe we should do more to cut down on the excessive use of carbon based fuels, but not at the expense of the keeping warm in the winter or cool in the summer! I wonder what happened to the boy who cried wolf about the Ozone layer being depleted and el ninjo and Y2K? So you see its all about getting into your pocket and make them seem creditable! Hoax!

Without the gases in the atmosphere that trap heat close to the surface of the Earth, the planet would be far too cold for anyone to survive.  Energy from the sun passes through the Earth's atmosphere and is absorbed by the surface or reflected back to space by either the atmosphere or the ground.  The natural gases now commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, act to trap a certain amount of radiation that would otherwise be lost to space.  This part is natural and isn't the problem.  However, the concern is what happens when you increase the amount of those gases that trap heat close to the surface?  Well, that's the primary idea of global warming.  Human influences (cars, factories and so on) are increasing the concentration of these natural gases, and thereby increasing the amount of radiation trapped at the surface, increasing the average global temperature.  Hence the name global warming.  The reason many people are worried about this is because changing how much radiation is trapped at the surface changes the average temperature of the planet, which in turn has an impact on long term weather pattern around the world, or more plainly the climate.  Climate pattern changes have an impact on the weather patterns which impact our daily lives.  Many simulations have suggested an increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Atlantic, or decreased precipitation, both of which would have drastic consequences to humans.  The former because of the increased damage to infrastructure and human life, the latter because of the potential damage to crops.  The most common reason for fear when it comes to global warming is the belief that the ice at the poles will melt, causing a rise in ocean levels.  A tremendous amount of people live on the coastlines around the world, so the flooding caused by this ice melt could be devastating.    Don't panic yet though, the debate is still up among scientists of what exactly will happen as the climate changes, and the basic concepts of global warming have also come into question too.  One point of advice from someone who studies climate, don't listen to Al Gore, listen to people who actually know what they are talking about.|`|UnuRaYbjaa	Global warming is when the tempurature in certain area rises. This happens in places like the north and south poles. Global warming melts the ice that the animals live on and the animals die. Everyone in the world is a part of global warming. When we use cars and even some hairspray, we are killing the ozone layer, which has the role of global warming. If there is no ozone layer, penguins, seals, and the endangered polar bears, will become extinct,and then we can die.|`|02b722d4cd50b00ce535d9f71c2442b7aa	1st: Global warming is when the average global temperature goes up. This does not mean that every place in the whole world will have a hotter year. But, the average will go up. The problem with this is that when the earth warms 1 degree at the equator, it warms 12 degrees at the poles. 2nd: This is a big problem. If one of the major ice shelves melts so thin that it cracks, the global water level could rise as much as 20 feet! Most coastal areas would be submerged underwater, permanently, and the whole world would suffer.    The reasons for global warming are debated, but the general consensus is that WE are causing global warming. Its scary, but when you look at the human population chart, the carbon dioxide level chart, and the average global temperature chart together, it is very obvious that we are the problem. We eat so much meat that companies must raise more cattle to feed everyone. This means more cows spewing methane around like there was no tomorrow, which is a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide. We also have all the power plants running on carbon dioxide- emitting things such as coal, oil, and gas. Not only are we using unclean fuel, we are using TOO MUCH fuel.    The only thing we have going for us now that we didn't have a month ago? We have gotten a new President of the USA who is actually PAYING ATTENTION to the global crisis. Bush hired a high-ranking official from a gas company to be in charge of the Environmental Department. Thank god that Obama is interested in fixing this crisis instead of ignoring and leaving it for the next generation.|`|3OIklA64aa	Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. global warming is a natural phenomenon that is happening in  the earth. but when the years passed, humans enhances global warming, thus making the earth today very hot. that's why people are scared if what will result to the continuous enhancing of global warming. but if we work together not to enhance global warming is that we may consider global warming has a important role in warming the earth, and people will not be scared about it.|`|mJWX85HTaa	global warming is the warming of the earth and the melting of the polar icecaps. if the ice caps melt it would significantly raise the ocean and flood a lot of the shores of continents. through a series of events it would some how cause a second ice-age|`|8veEaquxaa	Because too much heat would cause some areas of the world being  flooded as a result of the melting ice.

If you live inland join a group like the Sierra Club.  They are naturalists that are interested in wildlife and birding.  They travel in groups so if you need a ride they will assist you.    Ask your teachers at school if they know of any groups in your area that protect wild creatures .    Google about specific endangered wild creatures that you are interested in and recycle aluminum and glass and plastic and give the money to that group.    Ask your parents to help you find ways to persue your desire to help endangered species.   I love the Panda Bears of China and they were endangered for awhile there.  It was an article in the local newspaper or a concerned group was making the public aware of it through advertisement.   Read your newspaper daily to be aware of endangered species.    The more you persue your dream of helping endangered species, the more creative you will become in finding them and funding them.  Put your name out there now and let people get to know you and your hearts desire to help the endangered animal.  Take a self-defense class because it gets ugly.  There are people out there that are after the money and dont care about the animal and are mean about it.  You may want to think about becoming a game warden.  So that you can arrest the poachers that kill the animals that you love so much.    Good luck, Kimberly

737e8ad896c16931d3da06dca8c8e2b4aa	Because it is true:    Actually coal fired plants often have multiple boilers and turbines. Additionally plants are brought on line or taken off depending upon demand.    I see this happening in NE Ohio.  Plants at Eastlake and Avon start additional boilers and turbines as demand increases. Not an instant process, but with preparation it does not take hours either.  Also the entire Cleveland E72nd street plant is cycled on or off depending on demand.     There is a certain base demand that is fairly constant, but weather extremes, cold or hot, require Additional generation capacity.  This requires burning more coal to heat additional boilers|`|AA11289359	Steam turbines are only ran as fast they are need to so that they can maintain a set RPM for the generation process. So goes the boilers you burn at a minimum fire rate that will allow you to maintain steam usage and pressure around 700 to 725 psi.|`|AOrpzha0aa	If there was no demand for electricity, no coal would be burnt.    The more demand for electricity, the more coal is burnt. Otherwise, if demand was low and you were still burning as much coal as when demand is high, the cost of coal power would soar and other power sources would be used instead.    Also, if demand isn't as high, fewer new coal stations will be built.    It may not be directly proportional, but less demand should mean less coal is burned.

My personal favorite is "The Green Book" which has parts of its book online as well at www.readthegreenbook.com.    As I have been striving to "Go Green" I realize it is like stepping back in time without getting rid of my modern conveniences. I'm doing many things I learned as a child, like line drying my clothes, sweeping instead of vacuuming, opening the windows in the morning to catch the cool breeze, only buying what I need instead of everything that looks cool, growing some of my own food, and canning what I can't eat now.     To me "going Green" is a frame of mind. Do what fits your lifestyle and do the easy things first, it is a process and like dieting if you go to radical to soon, you are more likely to go back to bad habits. I also believe there are good, better, best choices in most things. If you aren't ready to start a home garden, then try finding a farmers market, until you locate one look for produce grown as close to home as possible and go organic when available.     Many people think "going green" is expensive, I disagree. Some changes may take an initial investment, but they usually have a short payoff time. Things like weatherstiping and insulation cost, but the energy savings will add up quickly. You may need to purchase reusable bags, but most stores give you a 5 or 10 cent credit, so you are paid back within a few months.     My top tips are make your home more energy efficient, that also means using natural light, cooling and heating.     Reduce your packaging, if you eat more fresh food you will generally reduce packaging, it's the same thing they tell dieters, shop the perimiter, that is where all the meat, dairy and produce are located. Only buy what you will use, many Americans throw away a lot of unused food. Buy in bulk, that doesn't just mean large packages, but that area with the bins that you buy only what you plan on using.     Replace disposable items with durable items, if you eat outside often and use disposable paper or plastic plates, it is a wise investment to purchase a set of reusable plastic plates. Replace disposable razors, diapers and cleaning products like swiffer. Avoid bottled water, get a home filter like Pur or Brita.    Recycle, www.earth911.org will help you locate the nearest recycle center. I try to only purchase plastics that are  1 or  2, they are more easily recycled. I also buy recycled products when available, that includes paper towels, napkings, toilet paper, tissue, school/office supplies and clothing.

We are often swayed to buy a product because of a perceived value or status the item will bring us. I would say the majority of our purchases are emotional not rational. How else can you explain a person buying clothes that they never even take the tags off of and is never worn. You only have to watch tv or open a magazine to see there is no logic applied to getting people to purchase an item.     Here is an example of green washing, I don't remember the brand, but I saw one bottled water company claiming to be green because they use 1/3 less plastic in their bottles. I like the idea of off sets, but the reality is they relieve guilt for doing something we know is bad for the environment, I heard someone say why should be turn down our thermostat when we can pay someone else to turn down there's. I think those of us who understand the problems already use logic to make our consumer decisions, but to reach the rest of the sheep we need to use emotion.

Study on it and get it to your fit :)    Recycle or Landfill. Or buy another Planet  Polythene bag is harmful for the world. This simple truth started to get public attention. But still very slow the awareness. Polythene comes from petroleum. Also it is not decomposable or biodegradable. It is flying garbage, blocks water flow, damage soil fertility, produce gases etc. So what should we do with this? Will Recycle? Or keep filling the landfill?     Recycle:  To recycle the polythene bag needs a lot of energy for its process. It requires extremely organized collection system and public consciousness to get polythene separate from other garbage. This is almost impossible. Less than 5% are collected after huge effort on collection. And it costs about $.17 to recycle. When costs $.02 to produce a new bag. So, recycling sounds like, using a Machine Gun to shoot down a small insect. Also the recycling keeps motivating the production and usages of the Polythene bag.    Landfill:  500 Billion to 1 Trillion bags are used per year in the world. It takes 500 years to 1000 years to decompose a polythene bag. Actually we do not know exactly how many years will take to decompose or even never will decompose at all. Only 50 years we have started to use polythene bag. So we do not have evidence yet. The scientists estimates 500 to 1000 years by their lab test.    Now lets do the math to find about how big landfill will require damping all polythene bags used every year. If it takes 500 years to decompose, how many years it will remain there? Continue to land filling, how big the land require? How significant affect will have the air, water, land, animal, Eco system etc. So, why do not buy another planet to use as a landfill for Polythene bag. Is it not easier?  Or should we stop using the polythene bag immediately.    Solution:  It sounds like the invention of the shoe. Once upon a day there was a king. He did not want to make dirty his feet while we walk. So he called a meeting to solve the problem. All ministers offers many different solution such as, covering the country by carpet, or a group of labor keep unrolling and rolling a carpet when the king is walking. Finally a humble shoe maker came and advises to cover the feet of the king by leather. That is how the shoe was invented.     Same as the shoe inventing, we may not do recycling neither land filling but stop using polythene immediately. How does it sound? Wow! I am a genius. I just invented the solution.     Sorry, I did not invent. I have learned this from other humble country as Bangladesh.    http://www.amerigreenbag.com
99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	I certainly believe that global warming is possible. However to base it on such a short number of years of data is not sound. The earth does heat and cool in cycles but with only 150 or so years of data it is not possible to say with any certainty what the causes are. They may be man made and may not be but without a longer sample how can one say. In the 1970's the rage was global cooling so what is the difference? I like to think in geologic terms and in that way even one thousand years is not much time. I do believe that man has an affect on the earth and it is not always positive but I am "unconvinced" on global warming, there just is not the data to back it up.|`|AA11264399	People probably don't believe it because they can't always see it for themselves, especially if they live in cities, out of touch with the natural world.

As a science student in college, I believe nothing.|`|VNKAnCMNaa	Time is ticking away we need to stop and be more conservative !|`|fJZQ6gl4aa	I would not  believe in it if someone could not convince me.  So if you can not convince your friend, find someone that can with arguments and proofs.  There are not 100% proofs so far taking it in a scientific way, but logically our deductive human mind and brain would tend to believe that global warming, although a natural process over thousands of years, is somehow being speed up by our actions.|`|vhVRzVPRaa	Probably because she knows the truth about global warming, which is caused by water vapor,so there is nothing we can do about it.|`|Iyc5vrEcaa	It is because people don't understand science. If something is scientifically proven, it is true, not something to believe in it. There are things though that seem to contradict global warming, as both sides are poorly understood by the media which is where most people find their information. The media feels the need to show both sides of everything so they seem unbiased, which means that sometimes they have to listen to people who aren't very reliable or aren't respected by the majority of established researchers in other to get that side. I commend you for trying to understand her side and not changing your opinion. Sorry I couldn't give you a concrete answer, but there are a wide variety of opinions out there, basically based on incomplete information, misrepresented information and plan misunderstanding and incorrect reporting of issues.|`|rGgAVeDQaa	In the 1970's, it was global cooling.  The problem is, the temperature keeps changing, and people keep claiming "the sky is falling".  In the last ten years, the temperature has DROPPED one degree.  That kinda rules out warming don't you think?  One can't have it both ways.

qcCy3MOZaa	It depends on where you are. Check places like Walmart or Target first. <br>  My favourite place for interesting green supplies is Chapters. They even sell pencils made up from rolled up old newspapers! <br>  You may also want to check the health food store, I found some there before.|`|laVR7f1Faa	Try Target they may have what your looking for belive it ;or not.

Soo, if you're going to use more the 3 pages, use the computer, otherwise, use the paper.|`|GgTFxr0jaa	If at the end of every semester you take all your notes and put them in the recycling bin, then I would say paper.  Even more so if you are buying recycled paper.|`|sX3xxLAIaa	i would usually do paper and pen note taking because its greener and you don't have to turn the paper on, log in, go on to microsoft word, {im loopy, aren't i?} you just have to pick up a paper and pen.|`|QvFcqgnPaa	Paper and pen note taking on laptops it uses up lots of energy and coats A lot but pen and paper is better because you can recycle paper and is its more than 3 pages use a computer it saves time
