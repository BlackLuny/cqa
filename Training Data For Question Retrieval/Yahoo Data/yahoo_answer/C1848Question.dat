20090223155505AAz6aWA	Computers & Internet;Software	Defragging Hard-Drive?	I have used JkDefrag with limited success, having it crash on me a number of times.  As a result, I switched to Defraggler.  I am speculating that, given the volume of fragmented files on my hard discs, JkDefrag crashed.        Is it permissible to use both programs to defrag?  I find it convenient that Defraggler allows me to defrag individual drives, but I yearn for JkDefrag's optimization - transferring defragmented files to the beginning of the disc.

Well it has been a more than a month now since i bought my macbook from best buy (big mistake) and i just found out that my macbook doesnt have the official certified apple ram chips inside it. i opened it up and found 2 ram chips by the brand "eco korea something.." it doesnt even have the apple logo. I bought the macbook aluminum with 4 GB ram not knowing that they actually took my apple ram and replaced it with some no name sh!ty chips. i think they totally ripped me off especially becuase they didnt even lower the price. this also means that they secretly opened the box before selling it to me and apple care wont cover me for these parts if they malfunctioned.. i feel so bad because i worked so hard to make money just to get ripped off.      wat should i do next?

Now i am still hinged on getting a good laptop for graphic design and game development but is mac my only option for using adobe???  I do have about $5000 saved up for college and my school that im planing to go to uses macs (Full Sail University). I need adobe for making poster and covers for the games that i create but if i get a mac i will have to get two computes (Mac- Poster and cover development and a PC for game development) because i don't intend to make games for mac like bungee did in the 90's.  Im just wondering is Adobe works well with other systems besides mac or that im concerned have to use a mac laptop and a my old built PC instead of a laptop.   I used a mac before but i didn't find it as easy as people said.  I was still stummed on how to open the CD holder on a mac pro lol.  And im used to using a 2 button mouse so when i tried to left click it would do the same thing as a right click and i got pretty frustrated.   So do i have to kiss my $5000 dollars good bye with no games and get a mac or is there another brand that is a PC that is just as good as mac in the graphic design world?

20090223163513AAgLiOP	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	An IDE like JCreator for C++?	Hello, I am trying to learn C/C++ and am looking for an IDE. My first programming language was Java and I started out with JCreator and loved the simplistic functionality (click compile then click run) as well as the in depth complexity when necessary (pojects, JavaDoc, etc.). Can anyone point out an IDE for C/C++ like JCreator      Thank you,   Brenden Smith      P.S. The main feature I am looking for is the click compile, click run without a project etc (so more or less quickness)
20090223163524AAwvYVw	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How to use function and combine for loop in Array C++ ?	Ok, I m trying to make program using array.     Ex, In int array[7] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}   in need to input a number 1 to 7, the outcome should tell that the the place of that number I entered, like if I entered 1, it should say 0, like that.

20090223164255AAg7Z1i	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	How can I fix my computer?	About 2 months ago I downloaded a file which gave my computer Anti-virus 2009 (the obnoxious virus that disguises itself as your computer's anti-virus). I made sure that I deleted the file, and got rid of Anti-virus 2009, and then all was fine. But about a week after the AV09 pop-ups left, my computer started acting funny. Whenever I started up my computer, it would tell me that 'Pgukah.dll' or something was missing. Other programs like Aim told me that I had missing plug-ins. Also, while using Mozilla Firefox browser, whenever I would click on a Google link, it would lead me to an advertising site, instead of what I clicked on. So, then I switched to Safari browser, and the problem didn't occur. Soon my computer started to freeze, only it wouldn't unfreeze and I would have to turn my computer off to solve the problem. This happened nearly 5 times a day. I figured that there were still viruses on my computer so I ran AVG, and it said I had lots of tracking cookies and a few trojans on the system. After I had scanned, did a disk-check, and a defragment, the problem still continued. My friend told me her experiences with AV09, and said that the virus can only come from caches in your web browser. I cleared the caches in Safari, then the computer started to work faster. I thought I solved the problem, but it only got worse. The serious freezing-till-the-point-of-turning-off-t... stopped, but almost every single program I open up freezes momentarily every 5 minutes. What makes things worse is that I work in Photoshop practically every day, and that gives me nightmares when I just open it up. Photoshop alone will freeze whenever I do an action, move the cursor, click on something; then it will prevent me from saving my work and just close from 'not responding' all together. Other tedious things include not being able to right-click sometimes, and not being able to open up task-bars or being able to double-click. It also takes about 10 minutes for my computer to start up, and takes Safari about the same amount of time just to open.      Please help, I have seriously tried everything. I really don't want to have to reformat my computer, as I have had to do that so many times in the past and it takes me forever to get everything back ;_;

I know that technically you are just supposed to create images and buttons in fireworks and insert them in your web page on dreamweaver, but the tables in dreamweaver are hard to work with. Any thoughts, suggestions, or perhaps tutorials explaining the best way to integrate fireworks over to dreamweaver to design basic web pages?

I am trying to find my cousin Nicole that ran away from home when she was 16 she is now 20 or 21 I believe and she lives in Milwaukee, WI. Our entire family is worried about her. She used to confide in me about many things. She was one of my best friends. Then she took off, moved in with her boyfriend, I once had her number but then I lost it. Plus, I am a foster child, so I am constantly moving around and almost impossible to get ahold of because I was constantly moving. I just really want to get ahold of her so if you are a member of one of these services please respond. It will mean the world to me.      Thank you,   Shannon B.

20070612060918AAaaYUD	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Question for experienced Windows 2003 Advanced Server Admin?	Right : so I have a Primary Domain controller based on Windows 2003 Server,which also acts as File&Print Server and DNS server. The domain name is (i won't give the real name,just example) VOO , all users log on to VOO.   The company has a website VOO.RO and email on the VOO.RO domain.   Any computer OUTSIDE the LOCAL/INTERNAL network can access VOO.RO website and email,but when a computer INSIDE the LOCAL network (pc's logging to VOO domain controller) tries to access the VOO.RO email or  website,there is an error "page not found". Any other domain is accesible,any email account EXCEPT for VOO.RO (so there is nothing wrong with the ISP,etc) . I cannot use the public  IP address  of the VOO.RO instead of the DNS,as I have multiple domains hosted on one external physical server...   What is wrong? How can i fix the local pc's to be able to access website and email of VOO? There is something related to the DNS,but what?

20070718085425AA9iToU	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Accessing ADSL Modem From Behind Wireless Router?	Hi, I am connected to the internet using a basic Aztech DSL-600E ADSL modem connected to a Linksys WRT54G wireless router. The modem only acts as a bridging modem even though it has a built in single port router and the ADSL login is handled by the WRT54G. Everything is working fine but I am curious about how I can access the DSL-600E's administration page without having to physically plug in an ethernet cable between my notebook and the DSL-600E. My notebook gets allocated an I.P. address from the WRT54G which in turn gets the ADSL feed from the DSL-600E via an ethernet cable. I have no problems getting to the WRT54G's administration page when I am on wireless but wonder if I can somehow also access the DSL-600E while on wireless. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I already have several fonts on my computer but my friend is getting married soon and his wife wants me to help with their wedding invitations, the fonts that I have are 2 cursive style and several other very normal looking fonts and one that looks like handwritten characters. Unfortunately they are not to her standards and she wants something more fancy and unique looking.      I have looked on answers before writing this and saw that there are many people who have asked this same question, and a lot of them are directed to similar websites such as:    http://www.dafont.com/  ,  http://www.fonts.com/  ,  http://www.wazu.jp/  ,  http://www.clearchinese.com/  ,  http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/fonts.h...       She has given me several pictures of the styles that she likes for the invitations but I can't seem to find any fonts that look like that, and even though I am fairly good at Chinese calligraphy I am not good enough to write these fonts styles. Here are some samples of the styles that she liked:    http://wiki.d-addicts.com/static/images/...     http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Image:HTMN.jpg     http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Image:Till_Dea...       If anyone can help me with this it would very much appreciated.   Please serious answers only, thank you.   PS I have searched all over Google for them maybe I just don't know the correct search terms.
20081106035835AAWkM7o	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	How to repair system restore points?	I was trying to restore my computer to remove an update that I did, while the computer was restoring, it made it to 90% and then froze. After restarting the computer, it told me that the current restore point was not complete and that I should start again, however it has locked me out of doing that. I click the restart button but it didn't work, so I went to the help center and tried to start again. But now the restore calendar is  blanked out, and I can't do anything with it. XP is still working but there are noticeable corruptions such as the desktop crashes and I have to go to the control panel to restore it. How can I fix this with out having to reinstall my computer? Having to do that would be inconvenient because my DVD drive recently gave out, so I can't use my restore discs. Can anyone PLEASE help me to fix this problem?

Es decir, q cuando ya las tenga en CD, pueda reproducirlas en mi reproductor de DVD casero, y a se vean sin problemas con sus respectivos subtítulos.      Muchas gracias desde ya. Saludos.

20081109230105AAvN3m7	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	My new laptop keeps losing wireless connection?	I just got a new laptop with windows vista.  It has a Atheros AR5007 802.11 b/g wireless adapter.  When I turn the computer on, the internet initially works just fine, but after about 10 minutes or so I lose connection to the internet.  I check the available wireless networks and it shows all of the available networks as having a strong connection, but the internet does not work.  In addition, all other devices hooked up wirelessly to the network (only about one or two other items) get disconnected and the only way to fix the problem is to reset the router and the modem (but the internet goes out again in another 10 minutes).  The internet did not cut out like this before I started using my laptop.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what is causing this and how I can get a permanent fix for it? If you need extra information just ask.

So I tried to turn it on again, and it just came up with a black screen telling me it had failed to start, and i should press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart. So i did... about 9 times, to no avail.   So, i restarted and pressed F12 and did a diagnostic test. Where I got 4 Error codes that were 00F0:1344, 2 Error codes that were 00F0:1340, these 6 were in the Confidence Test, Also with the messages either (Uncorrectable data error or media is write protected) or (Address mark not found or media error). In the S.M.A.R.T. test I got error code 0F00:065D with the message (IDE device failed) and (The self test failed the read portion of the test). And 0F00:137B (IDE device failed) and (Blank media or no media is present in optical drive. Test requires media with data, (resource CD, Instalation CD).      After that test i tried to reboot again. And now whenever i start up the laptop/notebook, I get 2 loud beeps and it says...   'Read failure on internal hard drive      No bootable devices--strike F1 to retry boot, F2 for setup utility   Press F5 to run onboard diagnostics.'      Any help would be wonderful thanks.

Ive searched all over to try and find a way to make the burned dvd be widescreen, but cant find any answers on how to get it done. Any ideas please?! I would be willing to try a new burning program if it would allow me to do it (so long as its not too expensive to buy, free would be even better!)

I have to write a code for this program::      Write a program that request a letter, converts it to uppercase, and gives its first position in the sentence “THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG”.      For example, if the user introduces “b” then the output should be: “B first occurs in position 10”.      What would the code look like for Visual Basic?

20090223152758AAhWaMp	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Java Programming - working with strings?	Declare two variables city and state of type String. Add statements to the program to prompt the user to enter their hometown - the city and the state. Read in the results using the appropriate Scanner class method - you will need to have the user enter city and state on separate lines.    Then using String class methods create and print a new string that consists of the state name ( all in uppercase letters) followed by the city name (all in lower case letters) followed again by the state name (uppercase). So, if the user enter Lilesville for the city and North Carolina for the state, the program should create and print the string:      NORTH CAROINAlilesvilleNORTH CAROLINA      - how do make this work?    So far, I have written:      import java.util.Scanner;      public class CityState   {    public static void main (String[] args)    {     String city;     String state;          Scanner scan = new Scanner (System.in);          System.out.println("Please enter in city: ");     city = scan.nextInt();     System.out.println("Please enter in state: ");       state = scan.nextInt();              }           }            What did I do wrong and what do I have to do inorder to fix this problem?   Please help~ thank you!
