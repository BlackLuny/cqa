Ithis is what it says whenever i try to download it. is there anyway i can download it?      issue   Adobe Flash Player is not supported for playback in a 64-bit browser. However, you can run Flash Player in a 32-bit browser running on a 64-bit operating system.

Solution   To use Flash Player to view Flash content on a 64-bit operating system, you must run a 32-bit browser.

20090219230230AAyVdNn	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My laptop touchpad doesn't work correctly?	My touchpad doesnt work correctly. The right-click button doesn't respond at all. I have to either use "tap to click" or the left button, because for some reason it clicks instead of opening up menu's and such. I have tried updating the driver and once that didnt work i tried the roll back option. i have also tried swapping the config so it's a left handed one, but that doesnt work either. Windows says the device is operating properly, but its not. ive also turned off the touchpad and on but it doesnt work either. I'm using a Compaq Presario F500, and it's a Symnatics P2 or something. what seemed to start this problem was the touchpad causes the pointer to become jerky, and once restarting i had that problem. Anything I can do to fix this without a Full System Recovery?

20090220000729AA9NmDv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Running a macbook pro without battery??? help!?	I recently bought a macbook pro (the old style) and need some advice. I'm using it basically as a desktop replacement. To save the battery life, I would like to remove the battery and use the "magsafe" charger alone to power the macbook pro.    I have searched for details on this and have found nothing except that  the processor will run at lower speeds without the battery, incase of accidental shutdown..blah blah; this doesn't really matter to me.      My question is, is it safe for the motherboard (or other components) to be receiving this constant charge without running through the battery? Will it hurt the life/burn out the motherboard or any internal parts? Will it cause heating problems?    Overall, Is it safe to do so?      Thanks a bunch!!

Hi guys , i recently bought HD4870 Palit 512MB Sonic Edition , but I feel like I dont really take advantage of its full performance cause I dont have a HD full monitor ( I have Sony 1280 X 1024 max resolution )   and I have a core 2 duo processor e6550 2.33 which can bottleneck the gpu in games like crysis, gta iv and other games that require high end pcs to get a great experience,    I asked my friend the same question ( what do I need the most? hd full monitor or a quad core processor )   I thought the best choice is to get a quad core processor cause Intel have just released the new i7 processor so maybe the old ones would be less expensive than they were,   but in other hand, I won't achieve any goal in upgrading my processor cause maybe I get a new one but I couldnt get the most out of it,   so what's your opinion?? a monitor or processor?   BTW I live in Israel so sorry if I'm having some grammar mistakes or something ,

20090219234031AAihLY0	Computers & Internet;Security	Does Virtual PC consume ALL reserved RAM?	A very basic question about working with Virtual PC, actually, but I haven′t been able to find a clear answer:      If I reserve 256 MB RAM for my virtual pc on a host computer with 1 GB, does that leave the host with about 750 MB as soon as the virtual pc is turned on? Or is 256 MB just the maximum amount and my host might be able to use more if the virtual pc needed, say, 150 MB at a given point?       It makes a difference to me in configuring the virtual pc memory to know if that memory is "gone for ever" or if the virtual pc consumes only as much memory as it needs. Thanks for helping!

20081111215617AAp3N84	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Dell XPS or Studio 15 for graphic artists?	I want to buy a laptop for doing graphic art work on it. Using soft wares   Such as Corel, Flash, Illustrator, Photoshop, 3D Max.    I have decided on either the Dell XPS M1530 or the Dell studio 15. If anyone has any experiences on either for graphic design, I would be much obliged if you shared some info.   Also, they both have different graphic cards, I have had problems in the past with graphic cards, and I am wondering which one is better. The XPS has a 256 MB NVIDIA card, but the studio 15 has an ATI.   I've read a lot of pro-NVIDIA (ATI uses more power, NVIDIA works faster etc...) on the boards here, but does it really make a difference? I always assumed that the two card brands are just competitors, but after reading the boards, and also the whole apple thing, I’m having doubts. I have experienced problems before on computers for the rendering, and also the computer freezes when there are heavy files, especially in flash.   I did want to get an apple, but they are not really used in widespread here. Any help would suffice.   Also, I plan to take the windows vista out of the computer and add XP professional, will this have any effect on the graphics card? or any of the other functions of the computer? (yes, I know the colour is better on vista, or whatever, but like the operating systems, will it freeze up or something?)

If I knew the number of values, it would read:   int[] scores=new int[total_number_of_scores]   but again, I don't know how many values are going to be in the array.

But now how do i 'unhide' the folders so i can change back to old settings but see the folders that were once hidden?  I have right clicked > properties > then in the attributes i have tried to uncheck the box where it says hidden but it wont respond as if the option is locked or something. The folders i want to unhide are in my flash drive and i think there was once a virus so it caused some of my normal files to become hidden.  I have scanned it and its clean - with AVG. I think i remember once detecting a virus on it some months back and i deleted it but it seemed to have messed with my files now because they went from normal files to hidden and now i cant unhide them.      I appreciate anyone who can help.  Please if you are going to give a command line answer please explain as i havent dont it before and be clear where i have to type spaces.      I have also tried to create a .bat file with notepad and drag the folders there but it seems not to have worked - maybe i typed it in wrong.      Please explain well.  Thank you in advance.

I am terrified that something has gone wrong and I've lost all my files and it will never start properly again. All I did last night was turn it off normally and then re-start it only to find this happened.

When I open outlook, it asks me to download a component in order to enable Instant Search. When I click yes, it takes me to a chinese version of Microsoft Download center. By comparing it to the english version, I managed to download whatever was on that page, but upon trying to install it said it couldn't because the language was different. Neither could I find the component by searching the English Download Center. I found this article:       http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outloo...       which says that Vista comes with this component, which would seem to be true, since I can search my Outlook on my Vista laptop fine.

20090220022005AA0F84Y	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Cannot connect to Internet via mobile sim?	I have an Orange Icon 2 USB Internet connector for my laptop. The theory is that you simply pop it into the USB and the unit has its own software which downloads automatically. It does that ok but when I click on "connect" I just get the message "connection failed". I have taken the laptop to friends houses just to ensure that it is not a signal problem. That is ok. The sim card works in an old fashioned modem so that is ok too (that modem won't fit into my new laptop though so I am still having to use my old machine). The Icon unit does all the flashing light thing that it is supposed to but just wont connect. I have a feeling maybe I need to do something to the computer to allow the connection but I am a bit clueless on such things. Can any of you fine people help please?

20090220022508AA4fOLn	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Creeped out by almost random 'friend request': How to tell him to bu*ger off without hurting him?	A friend of a dear friend of mine ('C') sent a friend request because he was "drawn to" my pic and hears Joe Cocker singing "You're So Beautiful" in his head.       I don't accept random 'adds' and mostly use Facebook to network. I've been on friendship and dating personals and I would not be responding to a message like that from someone who's only writing because of the visual appeal.       I've told C my reasons and she's fine with them along the lines of "of course, dear, it's entirely your prerogative and you're not obliged just because he's my friend".      Today, I get a second message from him asking if he could view my profile. Errrrr, there's a reason why it's set on private!!! The only reason why he hasn't been blocked from the outset is because he's a friend of C.      I want to tell him to bugger off politely without resorting to blocking him as I'd still like to post freely on C's Wall.

20090220014339AA1wvX3	Computers & Internet;Security	What else can I do? Can I fix it?	My little niece came to me 2 days ago with her laptop which she has has for 2 years and told me that there is loads of virus's on it and it keeps freezing. So I said I will try and have a go of fixing it.  I ran McAfee which she had on the laptop and found that there was no virus what so ever, so then I decided to download Avast 4.8 ran that last night and OMG there was loads of virus so it deleted them anyways.  Got the laptop up and running  to the start screen then Avast was scanning the memory, but while it was doing this windows keep popping up saying that a virus has been detected (about 27 of them, not including the ones Avast had already deleted!). After it had finished scanning the memory Avast then said that the memory was infected ans it needed to restart the computer and rescan.        My niece has never ran a virus check on this laptop by the looks of it, I am not an expert but I know enough, so any advise would be great!!   Can I fix this laptop?  Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything else which I can download to help??

20090220010653AATCJnD	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Diagnose Network or ISP connection Issues, Line Quality etc.?	Ok so my internet connection  will work fine for weeks at a time and then once in a while will come to a stand sill. It's usually during offpeak hours so I'm eliminating the possibility of high local traffic slowing down my cable.    When I get everything back up and running it will go from it's normal speeds back down to 30-40 seconds to respond to loading google and then right back to crap again really quick.    What I want to know is how to diagnose and determine the connection problem logically. Should I check the cable wires intergrity and if so how, or what should the impedance of the line be? Basically what I'm looking for is a step by step process of elimination to determine the root of the problem.    As I said before the problem isn't consistent and comes and goes. None of the other computers on my network are using any bandwidth , my guess at the moment is that either my ISP's quality of servivce just sucks some times or that my router is cycling on and off giving me a poor connection.      Also looking for some suggestion on software issues that could be contributing to the problem , TCP/ip settings are mostly set optimally however I'm running NVida Forceware drivers and can enable FirstPackPriority and have a million different options I could change but don't want to hack around with them idly and muck somehitnfg up

Right now I have:              Dim array(10) as Double              For i = 0 to 9              (some code)              Next              (more code)      I don't want to declare the array length as 10 only. I don't know how long the array will be. I want to click a command button to begin data acquisition then click the same button to stop the acquisition. Whatever number of data points collected within that time should be the array length.      How do I change the lines starting with Dim and For to reflect my intentions? Keep in mind I'm using Visual Basic 2008 Express. If you're more familiar with other versions of VB, please jot down your thoughts as well. I can probably find a way to convert it to VB2008.

20090220031924AAt3Uws	Computers & Internet;Software	Cyberlink Power Director: Will this improve?	I have a trial version on my acer laptop which lasts for 16 days. It has been the only trial that has recorded with my webcam to  a nice quality. However if I click to fast or try to import multiple files it crashes and I lose all my work. If I were to upgrade is there a patch or has this problem been eliminated?? I like the program but if it crashes whilst your recording and then when you go to edit you have to import each file separately (all 40 of them) then it's not so good...      Has anyone had the same problem?

20090220025939AAGxP2o	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Question about graphics cards?	On my Intel Desktop Board DP45SG I have two PCI Express 2.0 x16 slots for graphics cards. I am wondering if I can put a pny 9800 gtx/gtx+ 512MB PCIe 2.0 with an AMD  ATI Radeon HD 4870 X2 Graphics. I really want both of the functions and features!      Btw - I haven't decided whether to use a pny 9800 gtx 512MB PCIe 2.0 or a pny 9800 gtx+ 512MB PCIe 2.0 or a pny 9800 gtx 1024MB PCIe 2.0!!!! So if the ATI Radeon only works with one of them, then my mind is made up!!!      Thanks if you can help! :-)

20090220032407AAxV9uk	Computers & Internet;Software	Problems with Powerpoint?	Ok, so on my slide show, i have a little speaker icon (that means a song will play) on my third slide, so when I reach my 3rd slide, the song will start playing.  i then have another speaker icon on my sixth slide (so when I reach my 6th slide, I want that song to play instead).  However, whenever I reach my 6th slide, it keeps playing the song that started on the 3rd slide along with the 6th slide song so it plays both at the same time.  I don't want it to play both at the same time, I want it to quit playing the 3rd slide song when I reach the sixth slide.  HOw do I do this?

20090220030350AA6GHi4	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Why doesn't my e-mail send?	There's a user on Youtube I'm trying to send an e-mail to (the e-mail contains a link), but it doesn't send. Why? Is it because Youtube doesn't allow e-mails with links in them? I know the user didn't delete the e-mail because I asked him "Did you get my previous e-mail?" and he replied as if I was referring to a previous e-mail before the one with the link. I've tried posting the link on a channel comment on his page, but that doesn't work either. And no, the user hasn't blocked me incase you want to say that. I just want to know if the reason for my e-mail not sending is becuase it has a link.
