20090226173815AAQJ4Vd	Travel;Air Travel	First time flying! Help?	Tomorrow is going to be my first time flying. I plan to leave about 1hr and a half to two hours early, but I'm a little anxious. I've never flown before, have a horrid sense of navigation, and will be going alone. I'm pretty anxious about the metal detector. O.o what about jeans that have metal buttons or studs sewn into them? I think all mine do.. or bra's with metal wiring? I have a permanent metal-retainer along the back of my lower teeth. I haven't seen that dentist in years.. so I can't get written approval for that by him or anything.. will that be an issue? The only watch I have is metal.. will I be able to bring that in? I always note in movies they have you take everything off and put it in the bucket.. do you get it back or is it gone? O_o How big of a carry-on bag can you bring in? Suitecase sized? Small handpurse/bag? Looking for some travel advice and tips please!

20090226190856AAPTK4p	Travel;New Zealand;Queenstown	What should I choose, Milford Sound or the TranzScenic Alpine Train?	My family and I are going on vacation to New Zealand in April and we only have a week to do it.  So far, we've planned stops in Auckland, Rotorua, Wellington and Christchurch.  On our last day, we'll be doing the Tranzscenic Alpine Train from Christchurch to Greymouth and back before flying home the next day.  However, I have recently read some great things about Milford Sound so I am now wondering if we should just go to Queenstown to see Milford Sound and Te Anau.      Notable here is that my mother has limited mobility because of a bum knee so part of the consideration is that we can only go to sites that will not be difficult for her.
