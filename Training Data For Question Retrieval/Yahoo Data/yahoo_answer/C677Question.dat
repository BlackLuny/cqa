20090308091323AAI4Avr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband has daughter from previous relationship and doesn't want any more. I am desperate!?	Hello. I'm 24, my husband is 26. He has a daughter from a past relationship who is now 6. He says he doesn't want any more children, and I am desperate to have a child. I have dreamed of having children for my whole life. I understand that he already has a child - but she's not MINE. I didn't give birth to her, she doesn't call me mommy, I didn't raise her. I love her as if she is mine, and I treat her as if I would treat a child that I gave birth to, but she still isn't mine. I always had this dream of having a boy and a girl. I don't know how to talk to him about this because every time we do, we end up fighting and he just says "No, I don't want any more kids. I already have my daughter and that's it. No more" I feel cheated. What should I do?

I'm not   Well basically when she had her hair cut with a side fringe I had mine done... so what?   Then she took a real shine towards the music and the film moulin rouge... it's a great film BIG DEAL!   She has been a Michael Jackson fan for a long time ever since I met her 10 year ago (we are 15) and I started to listen to him and I quite like his music a little. My dad works at the o2 so he can secure tickets to Michaels show so I got him to reserve me one. Meanwhile my friend isn't as fortunate as me and the first concert is 4 days after her birthday but she might not be allowed a ticket. And all my friends (except her) are saying i am taking it too far!!?! how the hell am i?

20090308092322AAWjR7V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, if a guy told you this(kind of long) or read it to you what would you think?	tell me what you think, plus my above question :)      Each day, I wake up thinking to myself; how did it happen like this, you asked me who it was, I started teasing, eventually telling you. It was you since then, way back when. Now everyday you are always on my mind, you stay there like it’s your own. I don’t mind because I know you. Now everyday it is easier to think about my life, and why I want you there; what I don’t understand is why I cannot ever bring up with you. I haven’t even asked you out, I just want to call you my girl. I didn’t sleep last night, thinking to myself. Why am I up thinking about you, I can’t call you. You need to fix that, text me back baby please can’t you see I am dying here in my shoes. I talk to you every day, and when I don’t you do not know how much I really miss you. I get happy when I see you, I laugh when I think about you. I tease you when I see you, and I am sure I’d dream about you if I slept with you. Baby, it makes no difference to me, your beautiful in every way I need to tell you how I feel, I am waiting for my moment, where we can go and be alone. It irritates me that I can’t see you; I am working on that and soon I will see you every day.

20090308093251AAfVtaI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Does This Mean...????????	I like this guy that's 23.Im friends with him and my best mate is friends with him as well.   Today the guy i like was standing and talking on the phone and his friend was with him.Me and my friend we're walking pass him.I looked at the guy i like and he was on the phone but he was just staring at me and smiling and kinda giving me this look which looked flirty.I looked away adn as we got past him i heard him say "Good evening"...I turned around and he had turned around so he was facing us.He was looking at me and staring and i think maybe checking me out.I was confused if he was saying it to us or on the phone.My friend said to him "You alright?"...He didn't even look at her or reply to her.He just stared at me with this look and smile.The tone of the way he said "Good evening" sound really flirty and smooth.My friend said he was saying it to me even thought there was 2 of us coz he was only looking at me.Later when i was walking pass with my friends he just kept staring at me and smiling.   Does this mean his friend knows as well that's why he did that in front of him?
20090308092928AALovPQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about my boyfriend?	I dont think our relationship is going anywhere. I told him the other day that i wanna go work abroad for a few months next year as a childrens rep but he said he is not willing to wait for me. This made me think that i'm not worth it. We've been together for 2 and a half years and have booked to go on an amazing holiday in may. We've both been looking forward to it for ages but lately i've been thinking its gonna end up testing our relationship and i'll end up making my mind up about whether i wanna be with him still or not. Not only that though but we hardly ever go out. He moans that he has to drive me round everywhere when i see him even though i only see him like once a week. Hes really let himself go lately as well. I am really worried about his health considering how much he drinks and how much junk food he eats. He's not fat but he has put on weight in the last few weeks. But he doesnt care. He even started having chest pains but he wont listen to me when i say he needs to go to the docs. He thinks hes invincible. What should i do? I dont wanna unbook the holiday now as it all paid for but i dont wanna feel like i'm not worth it and not feel like i'm a burden on his life. Please help!

When I figured out what she was saying, my heart dropped into my stomach.    Her dad is in the hospital, he tried to kill himself. He slammed a bottle of Everclear and took a bottle of some kind of pills...Liz, who is 16, her little sister Elle, who's 13 and her mom found him inside the open front door, surrounded in puke. Her mom is pissed, Elle is scared and really upset, and Liz is confused.

20090308093901AAapSCt	Family & Relationships;Family	How to deal with my son and daughter?	My 12-year-old son and my 13-year-old daughter generally get along pretty well, but they do like to tease each other from time to time. My son, believing for some reason that it’s cute or funny, will sometimes give his sister a “titty twister” or hit her on her breasts, which are just developing. I dont think he does it to be cruel but rather as I said he finds it cute or funny, as a way to tease her.       I’ve attempted to deal with this by taking away some of his privileges and by talking with him about how sensitive a girl’s breasts are. I’ve really tried to convey that to him, even likening a girl’s breasts to his balls. Each time, he seems to listen and seems to respond well, and he even apologizes to her and it always sounds like he means it - but then a few days or a few weeks later he is back at it.      Anyway, my daughter, God bless her, doesn’t like to tattle on her brother. As I mentioned, they have a pretty good relationship, for brother and sister. She approached me today (presumably after he did it again, although she wouldn’t say), and she asked me this question: The next time he does it, could she give him a taste of his own medicine by giving him a kick in the balls (not too hard)? I said that I would think about it and would talk with her later.       Naturally, it would pain me to see my son get booted in the berries so to speak, but I really sympathize with my daughter in this situation. Since I have tried taking away privileges and tried talking with him (all to no avail), I’m leaning toward giving her the green light to give him a taste of his own medicine.       I’m looking for your views on 1) whether I should give her permission fr her to do it; and 2) assuming I give her that permission, whether I should be on the sidelines, so to speak, to make sure nothing gets out of hand.

20090308095518AANlhBq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How should I interpert this.....?	I have been seeing this woman for 3months.  We've only had a sexual relationship because I currently live with a woman.  Me & the other woman normal only get together to have sex and then I leave.  I could tell for the last month that she was starting to act mad whenever I told her I couldn't come over or had to get up early for work.  So I ease up on her a little cause I could tell she was about to become a problem.  The woman I live with is problem enough because she's always nagging me & is really possessive.  Calls me constantly whenever I'm out.   After not being with the other woman for a month I went over to her place, she was all over me like she normally is but then the mood was killed by live-in constantly calling me & I couldn't get it up.  The other woman said that she wanted a man of her own and was tired of the booty call thing.  Me and my live-in got into it and I left for a few days.  I was going to stay with my other woman but when I called her phone went straight to voicemail.  But I called the day after that & she said it was fine for me to come over.  She was acting different, wasn't all over me like she normally is & I asked why she didn't answer my call the night before she said because she turns her phone off when her favorite show is on.     I spent the night with her for the first time & she got up in the morning took her shower & got dressed.  I asked her what time she was leaving out and she said in about an hour.  She left the room & got on her laptop & starting cooking breakfast.  I got up and left, she offered me breakfast, even told me I could stay if I wanted to but why did she get up and dressed so early.  I was there with her and she didn't want to stay in the bed with me longer.   She sent me a text later that day saying thanks for last night & that I was welcome at her place anytime. Even sent a text the day after that telling me to have a good day and smile.   How should I interpert this?  She's not all over me like she use to be.  I finally spend the night after 3 months and she acted like she didn't care that I was there.  I went back home to my live-in but she's not who I really want to be with, but now I'm unsure of how the other woman feels about me.  She hasn't called me in over a week & she normally calls to ask to see me.  Although I will admitt that I haven't always been accomodating to her.      Some advice please.

20090308095920AAEY4kS	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I pretend to sing?	Ok, I know it sounds really bad that I wouldn't be singing all the hymns at our wedding, but there's reason. There is one hymn which is very important to my fiance's religious tradition, and is very difficult to sing. (I'm a mezzo soprano, and the melody goes up to a high G, which is two full tones over what I can reach on a good day). Since the wedding's at my church, we figured that this hymn was very important.      Now, should I pretend that I'm singing, or should I 'fess up to the fact that I'm not participating fully in the liturgy? (Especially since about 1/3 of the guests probably won't be able to sing it either). And if I should try to hid the fact that I'm not singing (i.e. I want to look as if I know how to behave at church), how would you recommend I do so?      Oh, and I don't have a good ear, so I really can't sing alto, or a third down. Singing thirds (or fifths) is beyond me. I've tried it.
20090308094831AAGdliB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Shy girl and I really like her! :(?	Well, I have been talking to this girl for about 2 weeks now. On MSN/Face book/Text messages etc, and we get on reasonably well we are both quite flirty.      Well, I met up with her Friday night and she was with her friends at a GIG.. She was very "shy" around me when she saw me/came over and said "Hi" and everything.      I'm a little shy myself, and I get a little bit "gutty and quite" when her friends are around her etc.      It seems like I can only really talk to her 1on1 for now, and she is like she wants to be around her friends and talk.      So literally we Said "hi" on friday, had a little talk about things. Hugged her once, said goodnight.      He friends told me that she talks about me "alot" at school/college. And that she likes me, but she is very shy around me....      But when we talk on msn/face book/txt she seems fine.      She even said that she misses talking to me, and was sorry for leaving early on Friday night.      So we text's the morning after, the usual how are you etc.. Asking questions out of randomness. She said she was in the city today, and that after she wanted to meet up with me for a "walk/stroll" and talk.      She knows she is shy around me, and I get a little shy because she is shy... You see the problem?      Well, I met up with her at around 7 today up the town Centre and I met her friends, I said "hi" how you doing, what you been up too :)?, get anything nice.. You know being the casual type of person.. Her friends are talkative, once spoken too. So I tried to spark up a conversation with the "shy girl" I like and she just seems to feel awkward around me, and im finding it really tough to say something/interact with her so I can gain her trust..            So one of her friends had to go, so we walked her back to the taxi drop off point until she went.      Then we decided to go to the Park, so we walked to the park, gently talking/confronting her about what to talk about. Once we got to the park, we went to the swings.. Sat down and started to talk about things.      So there is us talking about random things like, what is the most cringest thing I have done etc... blah blah blah, garbage talking nonsense.. Me looking like a complete *** of myself as I usually do - ha ha! and the shy girl literally said that she wanted me to "sell it to her".      But I am not sure how or what to do, as I am kind of in a awkward position.. That she is shy, doesn't look/talk to me that much but knows im there... This is doing my head in.. :(      Her other friend, had to use the phone so she wondered off leaving us 2 on the swings, awkward I know!      But I really want to get to know this girl and become more than a friend to her.      So I said, like " how you doing, bought anything nice today? " Her replying blankly and dull like "yeah, I got this and that". Being shy.      After a bit of talking, I asked her.. How Do I get to know you more, how can I gain your trust so we can talk... She didn't really know, and kept being shy...      Anyway, her friend came back and she needed to go home. So we walked back to the "shy girls(who i like)" house and we went in to be picked up / talk.      After her friend went, it was just me and her.. In literally, utter silence.      *So I kind of gestured if she wanted to come sit with me, being kind and caring whilst patting the seat* and she was like "I'm ok, I can sit here* ( She was on the laptop sorting her younger brothers laptop out (MSN).         So I said " Would you like to go upstairs, and talk a bit" because her brother was in the room at the time. And she was like " You have seen what my room is like, a complete mess " Let's talk out in the kitchen.      So we walked to the kitchen and I said something like, " You are quite shy I can see, would you like a hug " and she literally walked into my arms and had a little hug..      So I said I should be moving on home as it is getting late, so I got my stuff and said goodbye, and hugged her again to say good-bye. She was still being shy..      I wasn't quite sure at the time, and I said " Could I do something else" and she was like " no" I was like ok (Smiled) and said talk to you later ill let you know when I'm home.      So I started to walk home, and she text me saying "what did you want to do" I replied " I wanted to peck you on the cheek x", no response... When I got home I told her I was home, logged onto msn and said      Me: Hey, did you get my text's   Her: yup   Me : Alright   Me: Sorry if I, confronted you a bit..

20090308100909AA4iSKm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you be offended if your husband said this to you?	This morning in the car, I was in a good mood and happily chattering away.  I was asking my husband questions about his parents and generally just talking.  Anyhow, he was mainly ignoring me with a few words in edgewise.  When we went to get out of the car, he said, "Wow, you're just going a mile a minute.  Stop asking so many questions."  Then, he laughed in a sarcastic way.  I was a little hurt by this and it ruined me wanting to chat with him about anything.  He said I was being too sensitive.  Was I?
20090308100032AAj0h5U	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why can't she be herself?!?	I have a friend who seems to like everything I like... here are some examples...   About a year ago I had my hair cut really choppy and unique, long with a side fringe but original as one side was longer then the other and my fringe had a streak of pink through it, a week later she books a hair apointment and has her hair done exactly the same!   Then she came with me to watch me at a horseriding competition and asked her parents straight after if she could learn to ride!   I love musicals and my favourite is moulin rouge (I just love it) when she came and stayed at mine she asked if we could watch it and we did, when it had finished she said it was a crap film... I though yes finally something of mine she isnt goin to take away from me, but was i wrong! When I went to her house a week later her mum came in from shopping and gave her a bag and said "here is that film you like" So when she wasnt there I looked in the bag and found guess what Moulin rouge!   For my gcse's I took art as I am a keen artist, she can draw a kinda :S but I wouldn't say she does it for fun. But anyway she took art aswell.   And this is perhaps the worst one yet... I actually burst into tears when I found out.   I have been a quiet fan of Michael Jackson for a long time, he is so phenomenal. I guess my mums tastes rubbed off onto me :) about a year ago I heard was watching mtv: michael jackson top 40, and I remembered just how much I loved his music.. so i dug out all my mums old albums and put them onto my ipod I played them often I just almost re-fell in love with him.. I have all his albums and dvds etc. I even entered a art competition by drawing him (man I love art) but why has she suddenly decided she likes michael jackson? Apparently according to all my other friends when I am not around all she talks about is him!   I mean he isnt something normal 15 year olds like... he was unique to me, infact isnt that what's so special about him... he is unique?   and he has just decided to go on tour.. but the ticket demand is astonishing and I know I probably wont get one, its only 4 days away from my birthday aswell:( but oh guess what she is going and when she said she was going she told me she was going because her mum wanted to go, and I remember this is the same mum that liked a song I was playing on my ipod but once she found it was mj she said she hated him! and when I stayed I asked her if she had any cds with him on but she said she didnt like him!   This will sound like I am a real cow... sorry for that :( but I just want to be unique, different and originality is said to be one thing a person can cherish more than wealth, thank you for youe time x god bless you xx

20090308095114AATucIh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you let your husband see sex tape of you and your ex boyfriend?	I'm in my late 20s, husband early 30s.  We've been married for close to 2 years, and dated for 2 years.  We were cleaning up our old stuff, and my husband found a DVD labeled with my ex-boyfriend's name and my name.     He asked what it was, I told him it was a homemade tape between my ex and me (my ex and I split up when he left town for a job, and I started dating my current husband a month after), and I had forgotten to throw it away (to be honest, I just put it aside, but I haven't watched it- well, okay, just once!).      Anyways, my husband said we should watch it together.  I'd be okay with it, but I'm unsure how my husband would react after seeing it.  He says he'd be okay with it, but I don't want this to cause a lot of trouble in our relationship.      If I throw it away, he has already said he would be mad because I kept it all of these years, and now when he finds it, I get rid of it.        I think this tape is pretty "sexy" and shows a lot of positions and you can see that I really enjoy it (it actually looks like I'm "peeing" when I climax).  I've never experienced this sensation with my current husband.

She tells me to go to hell, f*** me, b****. I am not a perfect child, but I am not a rebel. I get very good grades, I have many friends. Although, me and my mom always get into stupid arguments that blow up. My mom does suffer from depression, so something that is not such a big deal is blown out of proportion. One day were best friends the next we hate each others guts. I am sick of this. One day, If I was gone forever maybe she would understand the meaning behind the words she tells me. I just wish I could disappear. I dont want to talk to a counselor. I cant talk to my friends nor my dad or sister. Please help me! I just need to talk and get some advice.

But now he has a girlfriend who he talks to me about all the time.I don't think he kows how jealous I am or that i have fallen for him so badly, but should I tell him?   He always texts me, and rings me and ims me, and he talks to me like we are sort of like seeing each other, that kind of stuff which is kind of stringing me along!   I don't want to break them up, but i feel we should be together,   It hurts so much and the only way it will stop is being with him.   Should I tell him how much I like him and give him the choice or just say that he is flaunting it a bit too much, !or should I stop being such a *****, leave them alone and get on with my life?

20090308095559AAnQKqH	Family & Relationships;Family	Does my dad sound mean? Spanked my little sister?	Ok so we got in from church, and my seven year old little sister was bad during the sermon. When my dad got on to her, Kristen told him to shut up. We got home and I was in room changing a few minutes ago. I saw my dad take Kristen in her room and shut the door. A few minutes later I heard my dad giving her a spanking. My sister was probably being over dramatic, but she cried out and yelled for my mom. My dad continued to spank like four more times.    Now, she gets on my nerves sometimes, but this was not fun to listen to at all. I love her and hate this had to happen to her. I walked by her room a second ago and my dad is hugging her and explaining why she has to behave in church and do what him and my mom says. I know he loves her and me, and he is good guy. I just do not see how he can spank, especially with her crying out like that. Does he sound mean?
20090308095749AAMzPa2	Family & Relationships;Family	My daughter's father is taking me to family court to get joint custody. He has an abusive past.?	Three years ago I got a restraining order against my daughter's father for physically abusing me. When we went to court I was granted the restraining order and got full physical and legal custody of our daughter. Well, now he has petitioned for joint custody and is taking me to court, since the restraining order has expired. My daughter loves her father and wants to see him but I feel she is in danger if and when she sees him.  I have allowed visitations in the past but have completely stopped them three months ago.  To make things worse he has a girlfriend who has called me numerous times insulting me and has even called me names in front of my daughter.  Is there anything I can do to protect myself from his girlfriend? Should I get a lawyer?
20090308100457AAGG8AX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Best friend -> Secret ex? HELP?	So I was on my bff, Perry, piczo website.  Not many visitors. About 3.

20090308100446AAExtPW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend doesn't want me to talk to another woman anymore, what to do?	To explain my situation briefly. I broke up with my fiance of 3 years due to ongoing problems in our relationship. Basically this:  http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org/cy...  over and over again. Things have even been bad with her in front of my family and before she left I told her, not asked her that things had to be different from now on. Long story short, when I was busy working one day with a script she asked for help with hers and again, I was busy so told her I didn't have time to review her entire script and can possibly do so later. As a result she informed a good friend of ours when he showed up, complaining to him about it. Then she leaves, running off with him, ignoring my calls. Now if it were anyone else I'd assume she was cheating, but this guy is also my friend so in all fairness instead of talking to me about this she made him a messenger relaying our problems through him. Where right there I just decide to break up, that I was sick of these problems. And whats about to entail made me never regret it. I call her later out of spite where she finally answers me telling me she is going to her ex boyfriends house tomorrow, and regardless of our problems and my still having feelings for her I protested, whereas the next day she went to see him anyways. In the meantime I met someone very similar to myself, whom we have a lot in common with, who was interested in hearing about our relationship, I told her my problems , and the way she analysed them is the exact way I have.....Its like she spoke from my subconscious. I never braved to sit down and talk with my girlfriend about the problems as she would often be stubborn and just rush through them to find resolve, where the same things would happen again. And I don't consider this other woman a rebound...Anyways.....That is the introduction of her...Meanwhile my ex claims to be at her ex boyfriends house. Where they were both laughing at me when I actually told her she was making me miserable. I suppose if she wants to jump on her ex-boyfriend a day after our relationship thats up to her, I just don't see why her emotionally abusing me further was necessary. It came to the point where she finally joked "I'll get dressed then I'm going home."...I let that sink in for a moment quietly where she quietly whispered "I'm joking." then laughed at me again. Shortly after I hang up, and start pursuing things more with this other woman realizing I really enjoy talking with her. Later ex girlfriend catches onto this and tries to commit suicide, even ended up in the hospital. Afterwards she logged into my skype account stealing my conversation with this new girl when I told her earlier I would not allow it and she had no right to it. Regardless, after reading it she suddenly became all apologetic, telling me she will work on our problems and that out of all the times she promised this before "This was it", and that she "loves me". I forget what compelled me to make the decision to go back with her after her practically driving me to the point of insanity, she presented herself rather sincerely, I didn't know this other girl that well despite our mutual attraction and knew it was too early for a relationship, so I got back together with her on the grounds that I am not going to rid myself of this other girl just because we're back in a relationship. That I am going to be looking out for my best interests now, my happiness. However what I had with this new girl did not necessarily remain plutonic, (I did not cheat on my girlfriend) but in the way we acted around each other, this other girl eventually did things like text her saying "I'm slowdancing with your boyfriend." and later denies it to me despite my girlfriend provided a screenshot of it. Before the screenshot which was a last resort she just demand that I trust her and that it should be unconditional, needless to say I had to remind her of her past which evoked trust issues with her. So now after the other girl lying my girlfriend demands I stop seeing her. Currently my girlfriend has done that to me cause I didn't take action right away and find myself in a very difficult position. This new girl lied to my girlfriend, and to me about saying it and I did scold her for it, but right now the only person who wants me to stop is my girlfriend. Who hasn't been so noble in the past either, yet tells me I should forget the past and that she promised me...Etc...Etc....This was the last message I got from her "theres seriously something wrong with you. i will not stay with you while you continue to talk to her. if you want to be with her, then its over between us. and im dead serious". And I want to make myself clear, I asked a question on Yahoo Answers before about whether I should stay with my girlfriend, this was not the first time I was contemplating leaving her. During a visit at my house with my family it caused a lot of stress on everyone and there were mixed answers amongst yahoo answers s
20090308100938AAer3wd	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I tell my parents?!?	OK I'm 12 and sorta addicted to calling my last year's teacher. Last time the phone bill came in I got in huge trouble by my parents and they said, "If you every talk to this person again, we will talk to him for you and call a counselor. This person needs help" I know he really doesn't and he does have a life.      I told them he called me, when I really called him. He's not a normal teacher, he likes to stay in touch with his kids, and I was his favorite so I call him.      Since I was addicted to it, I kept calling him after that talk. I feel really bad about it! I just don't want to lose contact with him. Other kids do this too! My parents are overreacting!      So my parents are gonna kill me if they find out I called him more. I was thinking I could just delete them from the phone bill. I know how to delete them from the phone, but not from the computer phone bill.      My other option was to just admit it was me and then start crying and tell them he never called me, I called him. But they'll probably still take my phone away.      Is there any way I can delete the calls from the online phone bill? If not, what do I say when they ask me about it?!      I have the AT&T Samsung Propel, in a Family Plan.

20090308105804AATgM7n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married women: Do you own and carry a gun around a WITHOUT your husband or children knowing?	I made a post recently, and in the post, I mentioned an incident in which I jumped out from behind some garbage cans in the middle of the night and scared my wife as she was coming from home from work.      This idiot here  http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt...   said that I was lucky that she did not pull out a gun that she had bought unbeknownst to me and shoot me dead. I told her that that was about the stupid comment I had ever heard of, that I cannont imagine any reason for a woman to purchase a firearm without saying anything to the husband, and to not only carry it around, but keep it in a house where two other small children also live. The only people I would imagine doing something of that nature would be victims of domestic violence.      She answered and said that many married women buy guns without telling their husbands and keep them hidden, and that it doesn't matter if other children live in the home--as long as SHE knows about it, that's good enough. She even went on to state as many as 1 in 5 married women carry guns, and their husbands know absolutely nothing about it.      So, to put this argument to the test and prove who is right, I'm asking married women on this site--do YOU have a gun that your husband (or children) know nothing about, and do you carry it around in public?
20090308104554AACQcI4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to deal with feeling replaced and bitter!?	Okay, long story short. I am basically feeling replaced & bitter towards my mother in law. I don't get along with my husbands little brothers wife, 'Sandy'. Sandy is a stay at home mom & I work. I am very crushed as my mother in law used to strongly dislike her, but now the brother in law & Sandy have moved right down the road from my in laws & now Sandy is the greatest daughter in law alive. I feel MAJORLY replaced. My mother in law & I used to go & do stuff all the time, now its VERY few & far in between. I am SUPER bitter about it, & yes it makes its worse that Sandy & I don't get along. My mother in law watches my daughters [I pay her] when I work, roughly 3-4 days a week. So idk if she is just tired of seeing the girls so much, she just doesn't want to do anything with us. They just don't invite us for anything anymore. It really hurts my feelings. I don't really want to say anything. I feel like I shouldn't have to ask to be thought of ya know. Idk what to do. I know Sandy does alot of this to get under my skin & my mother in law lets her. I am so bitter that when my mother in law calls, I just get short & don't even say bye & I hate it cause I am not usually that kind of person. How can I over come this!? Advise is much appreciated. TY.

We were waiting in line to ask the teacher.  He put his hands on a desk and so did I(not knowing his hands were also on it).  I look down hand see his hands running along the desk and then his hands ran into mine.  I said sorry just to break the silence between us.  He just looked up and stared blankly into my eyes.  He didn't say anything.  Did he think that I put my hands there on purpose?  Do you think he did that on purpose?  What happened!  I'm soo confused.  Why didn't he say anything?  We are in 8th grade.

Michelle had 6 best friends and well they were really close. Me and her were always really good friends but we only hung out 3rd and 8th period. we never went over to each others houses we were those kinda of friends.....      Well her and her friends got in a fight and she had no one so i told her she could hang out with me and my friends (2 best friends then like 5 other girls that are BIG fakes).  Well she did that and my friends became jerks so we decided to hang with each other.       Last year me and my friends got in a huge fight and i walked away with nothing to say to them (long story).    Well anyways 4 some stupid reason i went back 2 them this year. I got to know how it felt to be out on the outside of things.   Her friends git in a fight and they don't talk.       Well now they want michelle back (3 months latter)   I am afraid she is going to go back 2 them then i will have no one bc well i left them 4 her.    what do i do how do i tell her i am scared,       help   btw we are 13 and 14

20090306160004AAqaVyv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I become less attached and dependent on my boyfriend?	Me and my bf have been dating 9 months and we're both 18 and going into our sophomore year in college....we've already said out "I love you's"...we have never fought...we have so much in common it's like we're each others half. It's a really good relationship.   We havent talked about getting married or anything because we are so young..we're just enjoying our time together but I really feel like I may be too dependent on him.   If I can't spend time with him like we planned to then I get really sad and sometimes i cry. He's almost always on my mind and when I know he's out running errands or with a friend I'm constantly thinking about him.   I know in my heart that I am in love with him and I'd be lying if I said marrying him one day has not crossed my mind.   I know that I'm becoming too attached to him and I really want to stop it before it gets really bad. I thought about maybe a break but those almost never turn out good. How do I detach myself from him? Also should I talk to him about it? Tell him i feel too attached or just keep it to myself...i don't want to upset him.
20090306114104AABthSQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Our sex life sucks after children?	Okay ..my husband and I have been married around 3 years. Before marriage and for awhile there after our sex life was amazing..then we got pregnant with my son and it was good throughout the pregnancy, after the baby it was okay for awhile. Then it basically just dropped. Neither of us "put the moves" on the other person, our sex life is just dead. We have sex maybe 1 or twice a week, sometimes longer. We are 26 and 24 - I lost all my weight and then some after baby, so I know that isn't the problem. We are expecting our second child now and I'm just hoping it doesn't get WORST after he arrives.  I want some spunk back in our marriage and sex life..HELP. Has this happened to anyone else after children??

20090308102157AAr5Vva	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	I bought this girl a rose for valentines day in school. She said "thanks" and asked me why I gave her one with a smile on her face. She asked me online and I told her I liked her and thought she was the prettiest girl in school. She didn't believe me and said "lol" a few times throughout the online conversation because she thought I thought she was mean, so I gave her proof that two of my friends know that I like her. After math class, which is the only class I have her, she walked out the classroom first and I was behind, she looked back which she rarely does. My friend told me she asked him privately after math class if i liked her to confirm probably, and my friend said yes. So does she like me or at least is interested? Does asking her out (I'm gonna say hanging out) increase my chances of going out with her than asking online?

20090308103220AA6FGx9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I read a message on my husbands cell phone from his female friend who he is close to...?	Me and my husband are on the verge of separation. We have been having problems for sometime now. We are not fighting or anything but just looking for amicable separation.      Sometime back my husband met his old school friend and has been close to her since then. I became a little paranoid about this woman coz on his b-day we hung it wid his friend in the pub n he mentioned how it wud have been great to have 'her', it wud hve been so much nicer.       He clarified that there is nothin more to it. Then he has been meeting her with his other common frnds ( i stay at home to look after the baby, i didnt mind him goin out either coz he has been supportive to look after the baby) . Then one day he came back home slightly drunk and made up this story about going out wid a office collegue to his house for lunch. I found rst bills n after much questioning he confessed to havinglunch with that same woman.      Again he said that it was just a lunch between frnds n since i get upset he chose to avoid telling me. Then, following which we had a fight (his fault totally) he sent me message by mistake, actually meant for her reading "Hey Beautiful...i m sick of this n want out asap blah blah" blaming me n posing himself as the victim.      Anyway, he aplogised n said he was just sharing it with her coz she is a close friend. He has also been adamant about the separation n blaming the last 5 yrs for it. He is right coz we have been hvn major problems.      He is v secretive bout his phone, today by chance i read his mess (coz we have the exact same model) n there were two mess from the same woman to my husband      mess 1 -'dont have a heavy breakfast tom sweetie, miss you"      * He told me only after this incident that he is meeting her for lunch. He didnt tell me this before.      Mess 2 (it was on my bday 15 days ago) - Pri's lawyer no is------, Hey baby miss you and love you"      Pls Pls I am very disturbed since evening. Ever since he came to know he has been telling me that I shud trust him, there is nothing between them, he is not having a affair, he is not screwin around they r just close,.....   this is how she talks to her friends, blah blah.      Pls girls n guys both give me ur objective opinion on this. Should I belive him or he is having an intimate r'ship n just waiting for our separation to take place to go ahead with this r'ship.      He keeps tellin me how he is not intersted in havin a r'ship. She is also married n has a child. She is also in a problem marriage.      Thanks for ur patience n advice in advance.

Lately, I've been trying to be more confident about him. SO a bunch of my friends and some of his friends were all talking. We were sitting next to each other and talking to each other. And we had recently talked to each other in gym. Well while we were all standing, he walks behind me without me knowing, puts his hands on my shoulders, turns me around, and moves me back. Then we walk back with our friends without saying anything about it. Actually he walks back and I stand next to him. Why did he do that. What does it mean? Why did he do that? Does he like me? Help.

And he texted me and said "Im going out with my girlfriend. Leave me alone..." He told me I always play victim. I was abused, so I was a victim of that. He used to care so much, and now he pushes me away. He got over a girl in almost a year!!! She broke his heart and broke up with him. Now all he does is pretend that I don't exist.

We r together for more than 1 yr 1 but even then since 1 yr he is not making hard efforts to improve.Also he dont listen to me most of the times even if I m talking anything on his topic. He is very careless abt everything, seems lost in his own world most of the times,talks to himself n smiles wid him(most of the times..I know sometimes doing so is normal..bt he does that too much) and  keeps himself busy wid laptop & in btwn sometimes replies a bit to me, that too depends on his mood. He dont want to go out, do anything on our anniversary, or my bday or any festivals,His motto of life seems just to eat, sleep n work on laptop. I m fad up of his habits & at times I feel there is noone to shower love on me, listen to me, care for me n understand wat I need emotionally from him.He understand when I say all these to him bt just make me quiet by saying yes I know, u have told me this already, I'll try to workout but no efforts there after n he is back to square one.I cant spend life like this n its often frustrating.Sometimes seems if he dont improve either I shud stop discussing or talking much to him n find soemone else to share my hapiness,talks n sorrow or divorce him. I also told him improve else if I by chance get into an extra marrital affair as I m a human n wants some1 to care for me, understand me n listen to me at times.Again he says he'll improve n then same result back to sqaure one.He is not into any other relation wid any other women. this is his careless attitute wid every1.

I was reading an answer about lady who had a sex tape of her ex, and her husband found it.  A person told her that if her husband saw the tape, he would be envious because her ex gave "G spot O's".  The lady who asked the question said she had "peed" when having an "O"- something she doesn't do with her husband.

20090306143918AAnPQt1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does sex develop in relationships, even if it starts out awkward?	If sex with my girlfriend is awkward and she doesn't respond to things I do in bed, is there hope? We've been together for 4 months and she won't let go in bed. It is starting to make me feel self-conscious. She once said to me that she likes to be told what to do. she said, for example, pushing her against the wall. "That is passion." I am not feel that with her though. What is confusing is, she is really wet when we ar e in the moment and she said I turn her on and give her a better orgasm than anyone ever has. Multiple a few times. But our sex is so infrequent and inconsistent. Even when she says she misses me, she always refers to cuddling or taking a nap, being together but not sex. I'm confused.      She is 24 and I'm 31 if that gives any perspective.                    She does want to be with me and continue the relationship. She is in fact wanting to move in together when she graduates this summer. I had to move b/c I just graduated so we're long distance right now. She says she is in love with me.

20090306230112AA0zcai	Family & Relationships;Family	My sister is an alcoholic.?	I didn't think it was an issue until recently. She was always the type to have a drink once in a while, until she starting dating an alcoholic. She's in 'love' with him, so please don't say 'tell her he's not good for her and to dump him!' cause it's not going to work. I've tried talking to her about her problem but she doesn't listen to me. She's a diabetic and she drinks every single day. I don't remember the last time she was sober for 24 hours straight.      Her BF of course supports her drinking habit along with her friends. I've told her that her friends don't really care about her if they would willingly support her habit, but she takes it as a joke. She's an adult (21) so it's not like I can do anything without her consent.      Yesterday was the last straw. She went out with some random guy that she JUST met because he said he would buy her alcohol and she cheated on her boyfriend with him. Cheaters disgust her, she would rather kill herself then cheat, so I knew something was seriously wrong. Me and my mother are the only people that care and were the ones that she shuts out the most. I don't know what to do.       She's in her room now, as I'm typing this drinking with her friend. I feel so helpless and so bad that I'm not doing anything to help her.      Help? :/

20090306190351AAKwe60	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I choose over 2 Girls??!!!?	My names Casey and I am in Year 10. I have a Tongan friend called ''Mata'' and shes also in my grade, we've been really close for sometime and we share each others secrets because we trust each other. She's the only girl that knows my secrets and I have another guy friend knows my them also (we are best-friends). Most of the time when I see Mata we often hug. And when I walk her to the bustop, I ask her normal things like hows this and that and she holds my hand hugs me often. Then theres ''Ghazela''. She's from Iran and is in I.E.C (Intensive English Student, when you don't know english, they teach you). I've never spoken with her before except once when I accidentally kicked the soccer ball on her head. I said a simple ''Sorry'' and that's it. And her friends come up to me saying ''Ghazela likes you and full likes you''. I say ''Why? I've never spoken with her''. The her friend replies ''She likes your personality''. I then say ''We've never spoken before! how can she like my personality?!'' Then her friend replies ''Love at first sight''. Ghazela always stares at me wherever I go and her and her Persian friends always go play volleyball infront of me just because ghazela wants to get a better look at me. I mean wherever I go they follow. And they purposly kick the ball on my legs so I turn around and give them the ball so me and Ghazela talk. I bought Mata a rose for Valentine's day. Yesterday, afterschool, as I again walkd Mata through the basketball courts to exit school, i said ''How's your love-life?''. She grabbed my hand and hugged me and said ''I want a boyfriend'' My friends behind me laughed their head off. The next day i askd them why. They said because Ghazela was staring from the window when Mata hugged you, she was full starring and not moving. This morning, Mata told me Ghazela and her friend came to her and said ''Are you Casey's Boyfriend?'' Mata said ''No, were friends''. Then Ghazela's friend said ''Then why did you hug him, are you guys dating?'' Mata replied ''We're friends. And no were not dating'' then Mata said they spoke persian and left. And in Mata's cooking class, Ghazelas friend was asking her again the same questions. At hometime, Mata kissed me on the cheek and and we hugged, and again i saw from the corner of my eye, Ghazela starring again.      Sorry for the long story but I'm REALLY stuck!      And I know that being in 10th Grade means study. I do study when it comes to Exams. When i Study, I get good marks.

There's this guy I've known for a year.We're both 17.I used to like him,but figured out he LOVES a challenge,so I gave up.Now,I get vibes he likes me,but I'm not sure.   He treats me different than he used to...He used to have no problem sitting down next to me,talking to me,even just asking "what's up?".NOW...   -When I talk about other guys he starts dissing the guy   -I've caught him staring at me   -he comes up to me with really random questions.   -He hardly talks to me,anymore. I said hi to him Sunday….He didn’t even acknowledge me!But at the same time..   -he will watch me when he's having a convo w/ people near me (even though he’s not talking to me),   -He even drove 5 miles to come find me when I got lost on the way to a superbowl party (I didn’t ask him to)   -Someone told him how a friend invited me to go bowling,then it got cancelled,and I never told me, so I showed up at the bowling alley and waited and waited until I finally figured out it was cancelled. AFTER HE HEARD THAT HE LITERALLY GRITTED HIS TEETH and got really mad that someone did that to me.   Anyways....I just don't get him.Does he like me or not? Why is he so COLD to me sometimes?

When I told my boyfriend it was time for me to go back to my car to leave for work he said OK have a good night at work.(I didn't know the area so I wasn't sure how to find where I parked) I said to him "Aren't you going to walk me to the car? He said no I will not be able to find everyone when I come back. WTF I said fine then my friend would take me since she knows the area. He got mad at me for being upset that he was being that inconsiderate as to not even help the person you're supposed to love find their car!!! Its not like our group of friends didnt all have cell phones to find them. OH and it was a 15 minute walk and he ended up showing me the way but he walked far ahead of me and my friend and then when we got to the car he was so mean and just kissed my cheek and said have a good night and stormed off.

20090306220436AAhZYFS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy problems please help me?	So I got into a huge fight with a guy that I have been dating and we haven't spoken for over a month. And recently I was sitting with my friends in the college lounge and he comes over to us and asks one of my friends a question. We did not talk. But my friends told me that he was looking at me from time to time.       Then this week, he comes to me again and he asks if i still have his papers and I said I did and he said if he could have them back!   Then he left and I went after him saying I am sorry for what happened and he told me he would like to be nothing more than friends. He also said that we either could be friends or if we still were not talking then he would be fine with that          If he wants to be friends or if he says he doesnt mind NOT being my friend, then why is he making an effort to show up randomly in my face like that, TWICE??? I really need an explanation       Thank you so much    Jill

20090306162644AAp2dOa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think my ex misses me?	He's a senior and I'm a freshman. We had been really close friends for about four months and then decided to start dating. It only lasted about three weeks because he said the age difference was just too much right now and it made him kind of uncomfortable. Three days after he broke up with me, he started dating his best friend, but he said that had nothing to do with the reason he broke it off with me. A week later, he texted me and asked me about what time we were supposed to be at a school event and then we ended up talking for three hours. A week after that I asked him for someone's phone number and he gave it to me and said "what's up?" and we've been talking for about an hour and still going. He's not the player type and he's only had four different girlfriends (including me and her) before. Do you think he misses me or still cares for me?

Don't know each other at all. but immediatly notice each other when they walk into the same room.       sarah finds her self in the same standing and sitting poses as john in class and visa versa.         what is up with this?

20090306194223AAoIgRL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hey guys what does it mean when a guy says this?	So I have a crush on this guy and I think he likes me too but we're too shy to talk to each other.   So today in science we divided into teams and were playing a game   Well obviously I started the game before they said go and all the guys on the team freaked out. Being sarcastic is their way of being funny.   So my crush ups and says "I think we should kick her off the team"   And he was smiling slyly   none of the other guys were laughing though.   And then the guys started answering all the questions and blocking my view of the questions. So the teacher says "why don't you let her help? She's smart"   So then my crush says "Well she needs to get her..self up here"   He sorta paused before he said self he didnt cuss though   he was smiling while he said that too   Is this his way of flirting with me?   Because I know he wouldn't be that mean
20090306234650AAQfb3U	Family & Relationships;Friends	Best friend hasn't talked to me in a week.?	Little about me:      I am homeschooled.   One of my best friends is a girl.   I have been out of school since September sadly due to a inner ear problem.   She keeps asking me when I am coming back to school and I always tell her when I can.   She recently got a boyfriend and we started talking less and less. I would always have to text her.   -------   The other day she texted me saying hello how are you.  I said not to good and she said "why"? I explained it was because me being homeschooled and wanting to go back to school. She asked me when I was coming back to school and I said I don't know whenever I can...AGAIN. Then she made some smart remark. I was through, I wasn't going to talk to her for a while and threw my phone on my bed so I don't even need to read her texts.      Now what do I do. I want to text her but I don't. I mean She seriously has been doing this forever and I am horribly sick of this. I actually want her to initiate the conversation because I am tired of doing so. Last time I asked her she said "it's because the guys text the girls first" .. I told her that was stupid and I am not going to do that.
20090306221425AAdGBCd	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think married man can sense I care for him?	I don't overtly flirt at all, but I email him all day long.  He emails me back.  We work together.  I always act so enthusiastic when I see him & hear from him, but I by no means flirt, in my opinion.  I don't want him to know I have feelings for him, as that would lead to embarrassment and it would show I'm low class.  I can't help my feelings for him due to the frequent emails.  We are friends, but not super close, although we are getting closer.  I don't want to wear my heart on my sleeve.  Do you think I sound like I do?  Thx.
20090306194430AAsbWCf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dont you hate popular guy?	I hate them cause, they can get almost　any guy they can, they had like more than　30 ex-girlfriends. Usually guys like this   have special cruel skills to attract women　like they act nice front of girls they like　but they are not actually nice to other people,   like unattractive girls.    I lather like guys who cant get girlfriend　easily.

20090306172208AASvcWu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I miss him so much?	I dated this guy for over a year and we had a baby together in October.  I've never had so much fun in my life. I truly found the one person I wanted to marry and really fell in love with. Well, he has serious anger issues and is possibly bipolar. When we had good times, they were awesome. But the bad times, were really bad. He had a tendency to throw fits when he didn't get his way. Like a child. He often called me horrible names, left me many times or at least threatened to. One day it got so bad, I told him I was leaving and was taking the baby with me and he threatened to kill me. I knew he didn't mean it, he just liked to scare me into doing what he wanted. That was my final straw and I kicked him out. We've been separated for about a month now. I'm really starting to miss him. I told him if he would go to the doctor and got on meds I would consider getting back together. But he doesn't want to because of bad past experiences with them. He has however, enrolled himself in anger management classes for 12 weeks. I love him so much and miss him. Am I dumb to want him back? I don't know what to do.
20090306190216AAkDfb3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, would you date me if i...?	tell the whole world that my bf is "a dream come true and everything i was wishing for" while i was dating him but tell the whole world again that "he was totally wrong for me" as soon as i break up with him, also i am in the habit of changing a partner every 14 months or so and always sleep with the guy a few weeks after meeting him for the first time, and for the record i have never stayed single for more than two months, which is proof of how irresistible i am to men.      so knowing all this about me, would you be interested in dating me?      oh and i almost forgot, i also cheated on one of my bf once, he was just wrong for me. i've had so many more after him who were better than him!      EDIT:   actually those that came after him weren't really that much better, but it don't matter cuz im with a new guy now, i met him a month ago.

20090306192644AAlQvoW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How fast do guys lose interest?	My friends told this guy I liked him (without telling me.. ugh) and we had this flirty thing going on where we would look at each other then kinda look away and he was always staring at my in gym, the only period we have together =[ but anyways, my stupid gym teachers decided to split our period in half because there were too many ppl and we aren't in the same class anymore. I rarely see him and I only see him when I'm at my friends locker at the end of the day. He'll look at me sometimes but not all the time and I walk home every Thursday (he does too) and he'll get kinda fidgety and avoid me at all costs when walking... if I'm ahead of him he'll walk really slow or when he's in front of me he becomes a friggin speed walker. He looks at me a ton still and when my friends told him I liked him he never said he didn't like me back and usually guys say straight up no if they don't. He is kinda jerkish to my friends that told him so he would have had no problem saying no lol..... is he still interested or has he already lost the interest?? If he is still interested, what can I do to kinda get a head start in the "relationship"... We have never talked to each other...it has been strictly body language and facial stuff lol but we are both shy so ya... any help is appreciated!

20090306162339AAxNrYR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I go out tonight (please answer)?	I was hoping to go out with this girl I like tonight. But when I texted her today she told me she made plans already. I'm not gonna try with this girl anymore, as much as I like her she obviously isn't interested in me, I want to go out tonight to try and meet girls at a club (though I don't care if I end up going home with someone). But for whatever reason I'm not really confident (probably because I feel rejected), so I know if I go out like this the girls will sense it and blow me off. What can I do to get myself in the right frame? I need to go out and get more numbers so that I have options, I'm really sick of being unsuccessful with women. And don't tell me that I should just wait and someone will come along. I've followed this advice for the last 3 years and in that time I've not had a single date or even had a girl interested in me. So obviously that's not the answer. Thanks.

We occasionally help her out with things in her house and see her in town. I went past a card shop today and noticed she was in there so I decided to pop in and say hello. She was talking for 20 minutes or so and I mentioned that it was almost my birthday. She asked how old I was and I told her nearly 25. She said wow and went to get me a birthday card and I told her that she didnt have to. She then started talking about me getting a girlfriend and what kind of girlfriend I should be looking for. She was giggling and laughing a few times while we chatted and I invited her around my house. She said she would pop into my house sometime. Im curious to wether she likes me and I want her to know that I like her. What should my next step be?

Ok..without coming off as conceited, I will say as politely as possible that I'm a pretty attractive girl. I used to model and really put a lot of effort into my appearance......but I want a guy to like me for more than that!      I recently started dating a guy. He's kind of a peacock and really cares a little too much about his "image" if you know what I mean.       I guess I'm just starting to get the vibe that I'm just an accessory for him...like a trophy girlfriend or something. It makes me really uncomfortable.       How do I know if he's just parading me around or if he really likes me as a person....would he still date me if I were ugly or overweight?

20090306162706AA20NOG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in this situation?	I've known this guy for over a year now, we've been friends but back in October of last year we started to really like each other & visit each other more often. (he lives in Chicago, I live in St. Louis). Well last June he had just broken up w/his gf, so I gave him time, and a few months back he said the past is the past. After that we would talk about a future relationship, but to this day we aren't declared bf/gf, & the reason he says is because he can't have a relationship right now because of the distance. We both told each other that our interests are w/each other, I see him more often, he even says I love you, but why does he want to wait? How long should I wait? And I feel like I should be seeing other guys since he is taking is time, so what do I do??

20090306184301AAFUrMF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I report a fraternity to  the executive chapter?	I unfortunately made a lot of stupid stupid decisions in college the last semester while I was drunk and slept with two guys from the same fraternity. I've been dealing with things the wrong way and regret what I've done, so please no judging comments that I'm a whore, piece of meat, **** or whatever. I've been dealing with this and have been working on getting over some of the horrible relationships I've been in.       Regardless of that, another guy I was interested in just wanted a one night, I didn't give in and he blew me off so of course I sent him some messages asking what was up.. he never responded so I sent some mean ones telling him he was a disgusting person that viewed women as meat, etc... sort of standing up for myself by trying to uphold others to similar morals (which is always a waste of time, but at the point in my life, I needed to do that)      anyhow, he told his buddies about me that night, which happened to be the fraternity that had those two guys I slept with and then the rest of the night proceeded with harassing calls from men I don't know calling me from different numbers drunk as f*** Calling me a whore, worthless, my dad wanted to abort me, and other things that hurt. a lot. apparently 20 guys were laughing about me that night, all of them belonging to the same fraternity. maybe they were wasted, but I found it a shame that only one of them called 3 days later to apologize, just ONE! and this was probably a result of another girl that I told this to that hangs around them and encouraged them to be gentlemen and apologize.      anyhow, I am still hurt from this. I just turned 21, just lost the v-card back in May as a result of something I did not actively say yes to, probably illegal, whatever I'm trying to move on, but I'm finding myself to have nightmares more frequently from that one night when 20 guys were calling me a ****, whore, worthless and find myself breaking down more and more in the middle of the day      I don't know if there is anything I should do in regards to writing a letter to the chapter executives and let them know of the way this one group treated me.       any advice appreciated.

20090306224716AAYDCoW	Family & Relationships;Family	I feel like I have to work to be loved by my cousin. What do I do?	My cousin is a little older than me. We're both at that age where we focuse on friends more than family. See I don't do that, bt my cousin does. She focuses on friends calls friends etc. I feel like I have to work for my love. She never calls me (I have to call her) and when we do talk on the phone she's on Myspace talking to her friends and she ignores me. I just don't feel loved. What should I do. And besides leaving her alone.
20090306225434AAVidJi	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend...a "psychopath"?	Hello,      I have a friend, let's call him Taylor. I have known Taylor for many years, ever since elementary school. We are now in high school.      Taylor and I sit together in one class and we are both part of the same sports team. He and I harbor absolutely no feelings of romantic attraction or love. We have a sort of brother sister mentality from being friends for so long. He has a girlfriend.      In my math class two days ago when I turned on my graphing calculator, the monitor warned that it was low on battery and immediately shut off afterwards. I found it to be very strange because I had replaced my batteries recently.      I find out later on from another friend who said "Don't tell him I'm telling you this or else he'll kill me" but apparently it was Taylor who secretly swapped my batteries for his dead ones when I must have left to go to the washroom in the middle of class.      Pissed off, I went and confronted him in chem class, but I don't remember how our little argument went. But I know for the most part that he didn't say sorry and he just immediately assumes that a hug will alleviate everything.      At home on this Friday night, my father was asking me to think of things to purchase over this weekend. I said AAA batteries, and I told my father this story of my battery snatching friend. My father replies with questions: "Did they ask you for permission? No? Is Taylor a boy or a girl?" I say boy....he answers "Then he's a damn psychopath. Stay away from him."      And now I'm feeling conflicted and torn.   Both of my parents want me to stay away from him from now on. Half of me can't because he sits beside me in a seating plan and because we are part of a co-ed water polo team together. And of course the obvious fact that we have known each other for years.      But the other half makes me remember the little things he has done to piss me off. This girlfriend of his is actually his third. He's a self proclaimed ladies' man. And I feel right now that he is only abusing my trust and friendship to use me and that frustruates me to no end.      I want to confront him about this, tell him how wrong it was of him to take things without me asking. But I don't know how. I feel like he'll just blow it off and hug me and tell me to not make such a big deal out of it.      Can you help me?   Thank you.

20090306193050AAIkBql	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this considered weird or does he like me?	Ok so basically, there is this guy who works at H-E-B( grocery store), now I live like right by here and my family has always bought most of their groceries there ( ok who doesn't?)  Well anyway, ever since I was a junior in high school, there has been this guy that works there ( and still does) that would STARE ate me hardcore!  Like very many times he followed me around the store it was kind awkward .  He hid behind the isle one time to stare at me.  Now I am a freshman in college so that makes this what 3 years already? And he STILL just stares at me( when I buy groceries).  Ok there is more to it. He also works out at the same gym as me, and I see him there all the time ( I have had that gym membership since I was 14) Same stuff, he just stares at me.  And also now I realize he goes to my school ( college!) and he just STARES at me.  Never has he come up to me to say anything, but sometimes he smiles?  Weird stuff! Anyway my mom still buys groceries at HEB and a few times she has said hi to him and he is very short with her like unfriendly( my mom was the one who first noticed him constantly staring at me when I was in highschool so she knows everything).  Anyway, now I have noticed he literally hides from me, weird! Like once I was in the library at school with some friends and he came in and left when he saw me? The other day at the gym I got there and he went to the restroom and never came out! And then like a week ago we ran out of cheese and I went to go get some, I almmost ran into him and I said sorry, got the cheese and I saw him walk like really fast into the storage room.... Ok, so like what's up with this dude?  Is he just really shy or what?
20090306233014AAlyPpq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why would people get married if they did not agree on wanting children?	Surely the main reason people get married is because they both don't mind having children? Wouldn't it be a deal breaker if you didn't agree on children BEFORE you get married? I mean if one partner says " Oh I really don't know about having kids" and the other says " yeah I wouldn't mind having kids" surely that would be be a clue may be you shouldn't consider marriage.
20090306231220AARnTBr	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do with this one?	Alright so here's the deal, i get to know this chick who thinks im cute yet didnt want to ever say it because she knew i was in a relationship. Yet now im single she made the move to asking me to her dance. Except the thing is she asked me if i like the single life, and she responded with"yea i like it but relationships aren't that bad" Now we were suppose to go to knotts this weekend, but now she's telling me she is afraid of heights. Yet prior to that she was asking me if i was talking to anyone, if it was cool that i chose her as my date, etc. Yet the dance is going to be @ a theme park, and gives me a response "sorry for not telling you that im afraid of heights, and if you want to go with someone else to the dance i completely understand. hahaha" What is she really saying? Is she playing hard to get, does she want me? hahaha im confused. Is it worth it to go the dance with her?????
20090306173404AAOIjPK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i find out the marital status of my professor that i like?	im 19 and he's 35, but we're 15 years of age difference. he's a math prof. i like him so much. im going to make a move when im done with him in school. i don't know if it's better to suggest being friends first or being friends once he refuses to date me. i also don't know if i should take his summer course and then after make a move or make it after im done with this semester. i've never dated before. if i miss this one, im not going to date for 3 decades as a side effect. plus, dating wasn't on my schedule before him anyways. one miss is enough for something that i wasn't expecting to do. is there anything else i can do to get closer during the term to build upto the climax? if someone's is friends with him on facebook, then they can see his marital status. how do i find out his status? there's no point in me liking him at all if he has something. finding out his status is urgent at this point since every seconds of my love for him is going to be added upto a big depression at the end if his relationship and my love were intersecting.

20090306193835AA4yxKD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	[please answer] is it possible to be in love with someone you don't talk to that much?	I'm not sure about my feelings. He was my friend, then my boyfriend (but it was like 2 weeks, I can barley even remember it) then when I had my first serious boyfriend, he was my best friend in the world, like i guess i sorta cheated emotionally on my boyfriend with him cause everything feels so right when i'm around him. And while I was with my boyfriend, he started dating this other girl and I told him I still liked him, and on the same day he broke it off with that girl. (he won't tell me why) and now this year, there's sort of a tension between us since he's been making friends with seniors since they're headed off to college and he wants to get to know them better, while I like smaller groups of friends better. And now we aren't talking much (like, it's been a year) , except a few times and in those few times I'm not sure if he still likes me or not. Like it was just me, my friend, him and his brothers playing WoW. And he says things like      "Wow, you're such a skilled player!"   and I say "Shut up! You know I suck!"   and he says "You're pretty too!"   and the other day we were playing and we were teammates, just the two of us and he kept saying:   "Come on! We can take on all of you! Just me and Millie!"   he kept saying things like that for 2 hours, and I said: "hey, I have to leave in 20 mins." and he said   "Millie! You're so boring! You have to leave! BORING!!" and I said   "Fine! I'll leave!" and he said   "No wait! What if I want you to stay? What if I want you Millie? What if I want you?" and I think he said something like that but his voice got lower and lower through the sentence.

I recently started dating this girl who I have seriously known for 9 years. I had never considered her as someone I would ever be romantically involved with. Well now it has happened and the last time we were hanging out, things got out of hand and I saw her with no clothes on. We did some things, but that's besides the point. Anyways, I am totally in shock right now. I am in love with her, but I can't get over the intense awe at seeing someone I've known forever naked. Also I can't get over the fact that we messed around sexually. lol. It is so weird. In a good way. I don't know how to get over this weirdness feeling. Any thoughts?

20090306202322AAoiwcl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am in love with America, Do you love America too?	I am a 30 year old Iranian woman who went to UK 7 years ago and recently came to USA. I just want to say that all my life even when I was 9, starting to learn English, I fell in love with America from movies, so much that I did everything I could to go there, but visa for Iranians was very hard, so I had to be careful, if once my visa was getting refused, there was no other chance, so I started planning, playing it safe, at the age of 17 I went to University to do a degree and told every one in the Uni that I am gonna be a Geneticist in America, people laughed at me, telling me all the impossibilities, anyway I chose England first because visa was easier, got the student visa, did my Master's but all the time, I was thinking about America. I worked for a couple of years, married an American, waited 2 years for green card process, and at last, recently moved to America, with PhD scholarship in Genetics, which I have just started 2 months ago. And I converted from Islam to Christianity 7 years ago.      I just want to say that all my efforts are paying back, all my dreams about America was true, it is exactly what I was looking for, even better, I totally love American people, culture, language, accent, the land, the air, the sun, the freedom, opportunities, it's amazing. Today I was attending a christian fellowship student group ( all Americans of course, because I only intend to be with them to learn more about this amazing culture), and I was just amazed with people, how energetic, how hospitable, how positive, the way they express their feelings, I just want to say that I think America is the greatest country of all, and American people are blessed. In 3 years, I am gonna be a US Citizen and a Geneticist and I am already proud to be an American.      What is about you American people? Why are you so stunning? I have seen many cultures in my life, but Americans have it all, God bless you people!!!! America is wonderful.

20090306230955AAXHBwI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	||||||Do you love me?|||||?	I'm bored, tired, and getting worried about my school. I don't want to quit but I'm getting frustrated. I had made a post on MySpace regarding my financial. I personally can not work full time-Go to school full time-And full dedicate my time to my three kids. Its hard and with the way I am IDK? I don't have insurance so I can fix why I'm so tired depressed and feeling low all the time. I try to shake it off but its so hard at times. Oh, this broad really got to me and I can't get the words out of my mind.      This is what she said      What type of financial aid are you waiting on...loans, grants, etc??? What are you majoring in? Not to be rude, but I find it offensive that you say you can’t work and go to school at the same time. The majority of UOP students work full time and raise families and go to school...that is what the entire online program is BASED on, dear. I am a few weeks away from a Bachelor’s in Psychology. I have worked an average of 55 hours a week through the whole 4 years, raised my kids, moved from the US to Europe and back, AND I have a 3.96 GPA. So...your excuse is pretty lame...you are making a mockery of those of us who are motivated. If you don’t WANT to work, then say so. But don’t use school as an excuse because that is ridiculous.      I hated when people don't know you and judge you...:p      Is it really me? Is it my fault? (To an extent yeah) But I have no help?! Victoria has to clean, cook, childrens school work, baby the hubby which I am getting fed up with, school work, study, worry about money well the man couldn't careless or care to understand! Sorry I just need to vent I have no one to talk too...

I think he used to like me cuz every time I turned around he was right there with me, or staring at me or stuff like that. Then he sorta stopped, and my best friend told me he said he liked another girl. I think that was true cuz he was always around her for a while. But she didn't like him like that and ignored him.So today in last period we had a free day and got to sit around and talk. Me, one of my girl friends, and a guy friend were talking in the back of the room. My guy friend was asking me who I like. All of a sudden, D comes over and asks what we're talking about.My friend told him, and then he wouldn't leave and was listening for me to say who I like.He was trying to flirt with me again like he used to.   He hasn't been acting the same around the girl he said he liked. He seems to be ignoring her like she is him. And I noticed he's been acting like he used to when he liked me. So does he like me again or what?

20090306225356AAGzca1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Getting Married without a Marriage License?	It seems strange to me that people get marriage licenses, when it is not illegal to get married without a license.  I do not wish to participate in getting a marriage license because the law was originally created to make mixed racial marriage illegal in the early 1900s and I do not see how it is the government's business.  I do not need permission to enter into relationships, it is my right to associate with whom I please.  I want to get power of attorney out on each other and sign a contract outlining out financial responsibilities to each other and any children that might come.  This contract would also have outlined how it would be settled in case of divorce.  I do not want the terms of my marriage to be up to legislators, especially because the law could change after I get married.  And in conjuncture with the contract I would have a religious ceremony where we would promise our spiritual and emotional responsibilities to each other in front of our family and friends.  I know that I wouldn't get tax benefits or s.s. benefits, but I don't want those anyway.  I don't think it's proper for the government to place financial incentives to get married while punishing single people.      Would this way of doing things protect me from state (New York moving to Missouri) shenanigans?
20090306170158AALFePk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help, I can't figure out what he wants!!?	I was talking to my guy friend that i like and he said we should hang out this weekend. I said sure. Then I called him to tell him I'm only free Saturday if he's still up for hanging out and asked him what he had planned. He said he didn't have anything in mind but "if you want to get lunch or dinner we can set that up". I said "I don't know" cause I'm not in the mood to go out for a meal. So he says "let me know if you're up for it"   So, what I'm trying to figure out is:   Is he leaving the decision up to me to seem less pushy or is he only interested in me as a friend?

20090306183811AAcaFgK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	[Ten points] Okay, so there's this guy, right...?	I met this guy through my best friend one day. We all met up in town and had a truly freakin' awesome time. This guy and I (let's call him... Gerry, shall we?) have so much in common it's freaky. I'm the sort of girl who will throw herself on the couch and play Zelda for four hours straight. Hell, we spent twenty-five minutes arguing about first-person-shooter games.      So, we traded MSN addresses and we've kept in touch ever since. We always have a laugh and we pretty much tell eachother anything. The only downside (but this is purely my own preference) is that he's a bit of... eh, man-whore? He's been with quite a few chicks, but he's 'been in love' with them every single time.      A few weeks after we met in town, I was just talking one night on MSN to him. I'm hardly allowed out, so this is our only way of contact. I had to go, so I said goodbye. And he responded promptly with: 'Hey, if you ever want casual sex, call me, ok?'      I was really freaked out. Like, seriously. I'm only 15 and I'm a Christian. This was the sort of thing I read about in books, you know? Or the problem page in magazines.      So I just kinda shrugged and signed off. I got over it gradually, and Gerry sure didn't push it. It was just like normal. Well, there's the school fair coming up. People are allowed to wear whatever and bring along friends, etc. So I just invited Gerry, because, you know, he's my friend. So I was talking to him last night and he was all, 'Oh, I'm not sure if I should go...' and I'm like, 'C'mon... if you go I'll buy you candy!'      Eventually I added, 'Okay, if you come I'll buy you a lollipop.' Trust him to take it the wrong way! Just re-read my statement if you don't get it. So, I was all, 'Aw, yuck, dude!' and he replies with, 'But, seriously, you know I'll let you do that, right?'      Jeez louise! He sure doesn't give up! Prior to this a friend's friend (everyone knows Gerry. All teh girls at my school think he's HOMG SO UGLY which is terribly shallow. And they think he's weird.) came up to me at school and said, 'Gerry thinks you're yummy. What ya want me to say back?'      Of course, I'm just, 'Woah... WTF?! O_O'. So that got dropped. And then my best friend (who is friends with Gerry) told me that he thought I was really, really hot. Falling back on the 'yummy' statement.       So... what should I do? I highly doubt he actually like likes me as we've only met once. He is coming to the fair next week, however, and I kinda want to show there's no hard feelings. But, seriously, what do I do? D: I've never lead him on in any way and I'm totally for the 'no sex before marriage' thing.      A bazillion thanks for helping! Ten points for proper answers! n_n

20090306194646AASIEt2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend keeps hurting me?	My boyfriend and I have been going out for a month. And I love him, but he keeps hurting me. Not physically or anything. But my heart. Like when I was with him for a little while, he started hating on my friends. He calls one of them a b*tch all the time, but she was mean to him first and she swears that it doesn't bother her. And then he tells me he thought that these really slutty girls at a dance we went to were hot. He apologized forever about it, and I forgave him. Then he tells me that he kind of likes my best friend. I got really mad, and we talked about it, and he said he didn't mean it, and he didn't like her anymore. Then I found out that some chick at his church likes him, and he likes her. We talked AGAIN and he said he changed his mind, and promised that he loved me, and didn't like anyone else. But I don't know, he keeps doing stuff like this, and it is really starting to hurt me. I mean, Im glad that he is being honest, but still. Should I break up with him? If not, what should I do?
20090306184214AAYDspV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what I should do.?	I have been with this GREAT guy for a few months now, but I just don't feel the same level of attraction to him as he feels towards me.   He is an extremely sweet guy, funny, and is always there to make me smile.  But he doesn't have a backbone, he doesn't ever stand up for himself and that bothers me.  Plus the fact that he sends me text messages containing info I do not care to know or that I find annoying.  I have told him how I felt about how he needs to be more assertive and how I am bothered by some of the things he communicates to me.  But  nothing seems to get through.      Our relationship has been great for the both of us as before we got together, our lives were both low and depressing.  Yet I haven't been this happy in such a long time and he feels the same.  Though I cannot say that I am sexually attracted to him even though he is strongly attracted to me in a sexual way.        I'm just lost because I am young and I feel that being in a relationship isn't quite exactly what I need at his point in my life and I feel that I might just be building up this young man's hopes..      any advice?
20090306181846AAPt0ku	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it normal to imagine someone you like in a dramatic scenario?	for instance i sometimes like to imagine a girl i like going home and thinking "mann....why can't q ever notice me? UGHHH! Why wont he notice me he's always got those other girls around him and then a image of her being sad." And for some reason thinking like that makes me want to see and flirt with her more. Be honest in your responses because i wonder if this kind of thinking is normal.

20090306200001AAwLpGy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would u do if u were me? LOTS OF HELP!!!?	There' s this girl, and I asked her out a month after we became really good friends, so that we would not enter the friend zone, and itd be weird to ask her out. She said no, but I was not convinced. It was not awkward afterwards, but regardless I stopped liking her. I asked her out on valentimes day, caused I started to like her again. She was giving signs that she liked me. The other day I stayed after school, and by chance she was near a school exit and she said hi. I simply thought of it as her just trying to be nice, so I said an indifferent hi, back. Then right before I left, as I was opening the door she asked me "How are you". Not flirtaous, but definetly more than friendly. I was like oh, and I was taken totally by suprised. I had given her the cold shoulder since, because when I asked her out the second time, she said I do not think so. And I must of mean mugged her without thinking about it. I said, kinda pissed "Well Alright. I understand." I thought I overheard one time later ,about she had a crush on me, and some other guy, she had been waiting for the other guy to ask her out. Well I then asked her about if she was doing a school sport, and I looked at her right in the eyes, what I saw, was the same thing I felt when I was friendly to a girl who said no, it appears as indifference, but inacuality its suppressed emotion. Its when you have an emotion there ,but it does not show becuase youve had to hide it, or youve felt like other people would mock you if they knew. The conversation was short, and then I acutally paused for a moment, and thought to myself "should I act on my instincts and just hug her". It did not seem right, but I now feel like I wasted my chance. I wont be able to see her of course til next week. Does this mean she really liked me, she treated me like she did, when i thought she had a secret spark for me earlier in the year. Whats going through the girls mind? A girl has never been like that, and I think even though it was all friendly, that she may of thought I walked out on her. I'm definetly to start a conversation with her next week. (Only new situations scare me, girls dont) A couple girls have crushes on me right now. But now that I think about I really want her. I realize my emotions are now also suppressed. Ive been having some self-identity issues. I want like 50 answers.
20090306175722AAHzO51	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love him heaps but does he love me?	Well I absolutely love this guy named Ian as soon as I saw him on the first day of school. Ian knows I like him. Ian is single! On Thursday we had Japanese and I just so got to share a laptop with him. We were suppose to be doing our work but Me and Ian were just talking and he said "I love being around you when you help me like this". I told him on MSN that I love when a guy can make me laugh and the next day at school he was just making me laugh all day(like he was trying to). In Science Ian was sitting behind me and he kept kicking my chair and than he pulled my hair in a playful way though. At school he always says hey steph whats up. He is the love of my life (at least so far). I like him heaps and he knows i "like" him but not how much. Why does he do all the stuff and say all these things to me?

20090306184250AATBsqx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Think this chick likes me, possibly not?	It's a biology lab class and usually I just go in there and work by myself. People rarely pair up. I am one of those people who do things better alone and have their own personal space. Basically this chick walked in class, there were empty seats here and there, i looked at her and she came straight towards me and sat to my right. We ended up working together. I rarely ever like someone, I see drop dead gorgeous girls all the time and never develope feelings for them, but this time i felt like that special "click" happened. Now, I want to see if I have a chance with her. Do you guys think that she would work and sit right next to someone she wouldn't be interested in at all? or do I have a slight chance of success. Also is it a bad Idea to let soemone k now that you like em, before you get to know them for a while. Because sometimes that can lead to friend zone status which I don't want.

20090306170316AAmGi9c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Breaking up or yelling at  someone?	Hi. I wanted to ask some advice from the general population as my friends are great, but they aren't objective observers. As some background info, I am the prototypical nice guy who got lucky and found a great person.       I've been in an amazing relationship for a year and a half. We are both in college, live 10 mins (walking) from each other, and are in love. Recently, some behavior arose from my girlfriend which I cannot mentally deal with, though I've tried. The specific behavior is that she'd much rather hang out with her friends than me to the extent that if her friends are partying, she will always refuse to hang out and the only times I can see her are when her friends are partying. This behavior is occurring because her friends are leaving in three months for 15 months. I've mentioned what needs to improve from my perspective many times and nothing has changed.       I am a very beta person and I hate getting emotional or yelling. When we've had relationship talks where we have gotten emotional, things go great. I am sure that if I yell at her and verbally abuse her about this behavior, then it will be corrected. However, I don't feel I have a right to order a sentient human being what to do. I am not the controlling type who tells other people what they can or cannot do. I'd be willing to put on this facade if it saved the relationship.       My question is, if verbally abusing someone would save a relationship, should I the abuser break up with the other person, or verbally abuse them? This breakup might only be a temporary one until the friend situation is dealt with but there are no guarantees.       My morals tell me that I should break up with her, but I really don't want to hurt her and would much rather yell at her once a week or so then hurt her and myself so much with a full breakup.       Also, should I just suck it up for the next two months and let her do her own thing for now? My worry is that she really does value her friends orders of magnitude higher than me, so that this symptom is part of a larger long term problem.

20090306162623AAite5h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Would He Do This?	so there's this guy that lives across the street. we'll call him zach. he's constantly flirting with me and is always touching me [i.e. arm around waist, hip, holding hands...] in some way. we're pretty close friends and are often found hanging out with one another. on weekends, we just sit in the back of my mom's car for hours, sometimes until one or two a.m., just talking. everyone says he likes me, and i had begun to think so too. he's so nice to me and risks getting grounded just to spend time with me [which i tell him is stupid, but it makes me feel so loved].       well, turns out, he has a girl friend. i feel so stupid for thinking there was ever a possibility of him liking me. why would he lead me on? or was i just reading way too much into his actions?       erg. i'm so confused. and i can't get in touch of any of my friends so that i can vent.
20090306205131AA6JT8H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i go along asking her out?	i like this girl named elyssa in my history class i havent really talked to her but im pretty good looking when i try to dress nice so how would i have a better chance at asking her out within 2 weeks?
20090306232603AA451Tw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there something there...or am I making something of nothing?	Alright I'm confused with this guy...I need help to decode the signals:      1) He sent me this adorable message a while ago...with a picture of a heart shape...he sent it the day after I was in a car crash      2) He's part of my friendship group...I've known him for 2 yrs, and he's never asked me out.      3) He usually avoids me, but when we drink me and him are very close...he always drinks when I drink.      4) We've never hooked up      5) last time I drunk too much, he took care of me for the entire night, and even when I was away he was carefully watching      6) we engage in witty convos every now and then, where there's this great banter      7) he ignored me the other day, even though he saw me, but sent me a friendly message about a weekend get together       8) He's never dated a girl before.      9) I dated one of his friends, it ended badly and he was pretty unhappy with him after...its been a year and a half since the break up.      10) He's always and gentleman, and opens doors for me, etc.      11) My best friend thinks there's something there      12) When I asked what his kind of girl is, he said he liked quiet girls...which I'm not      13) He gets a bit funny when I start talking about other guys       I'm just not sure...should I let it go...or is there something??      Please be brutally honest and just tell me if hes into me or theres no chance!!      Thanks

20090306175740AAsqQR3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need to freak out just a bit, comment if you want?	OMFG. This is about my new boyfriend, Chris. So....this is what I'm freaking out about:      Okay, this might take a while...Whew. Okay. So we're in the new semester at my school and I have third block Biology with him. First day, I was sort of interested in him. The day when my interest started growing exponentially was some day in January when he molested my foot with his under the table. Lol. I thought it was my friend Denise, but it wasn't. Sweetness. Anyway, so then we got to pick out groups for the semester and he chose me! YEAS! Next day, we got assigned seats and he now sits in the seat...okay, his sister sits directly across from me and from my pov, he sits to her left. Anyway, so I chilled with him in group and laughed at his jokes and pervertedness and got all twitter-paited. So...he's a flirt and he was always flirting with me and I was secretly pleased. Susan and I joked all the time about how I was in love with 'El Camino'. Lol. He has an el camino and it's black with green flames and a glitter finish. It's so dorky...I love it. Anyway, back to business. Let's see...on Tuesday March Third, his very, very, very good friend Heather came up to me in second block and was like, "Chris likes you." So, I freak and try to contain myself. I oh so casually said, "W-what?!" And she was like, "Yeah. I was talking to him in the hallway and he said he thinks he likes you." So...I was a mess in second block. I made myself sick with nervousness. In third block, Chris was flirting with me more than usual...OH! I forgot something! Monday, we had to do presentations over the biomes. Of course, my group went first. So after it, Heather sat beside me as usual and Chris set across from me, cause our Evil Devil Teacher had pulled up a chair in the spot he usually sits in. So, EDT had to do something with the computer and left the area of our group. So, I'm talking to Heather and I feel something touch my foot. Automatically, I tense and think Chris. EDT fixes the computer and another group presents. During that time, Chris molests my Vans with his. I'm trying not to laugh out of nervousness and because it tickles, and he knows it. So he's like, "Don't laugh,Taylor. Don't smile." So, of course I do and he looks pleased. Throughout the whole class, he molests my foot with his. And when I'm talking to Heather, he does it and he's looking at me and she's like, "You are so creepy, Chris." Of course she doesn't know what he's doing. It was so funny and so nervewracking for me...Anyway, back to the present. So, during lunch Heather comes in the library with her friends and I'm sitting in a chair and minding my own business when Amelia Smith comes over. I barely tolerate her. She says, "You like Chris." I didn't say anything, I just looked away and rubbed my nose. When I eventually looked back at her, she asked, "Are you a virgin?" I answer yes and she freaking leaves to Heather. Crazyness. So, yesterday, Wednseday, I'm talking to Susan before 2cnd block and she tells me that Chris told her that he didn't like me. (She and Chris are pretty damn good friends) So, during 2cnd block I am a huge wreck. I was so sad and pissed off. I almost started crying and I had to go to the bathroom 'cause I couldn't take it. I made it through 2cnd block and I was just pissed by the end of it. In the beginning of third block, I was so depressed and pissed and I wouldn't talk to anyone. During lunch, I talked to my friend Benecia about why I was so angry 'cause Susan doesn't have lunch block with me. Anyway, I'm like, "I just want to know if he's jerking me around. Playing me. I like him, but I don't want him to do this to me. I could honestly kill him right now." As we leave the library, overwhelming depression hits me and I almost start to cry and she's like, "He's not worth it." So, we get back to third block and there's only ten minutes left. I really am close to crying at this point and it worried Chris, so he asked Benecia what was up with me. That dumb hoe told him everything. I could kill her. Honestly. Anyway...whew, deep breath. So, we stack our chairs up and we're standing by the door and Benecia's like, "He's going to ask you out." My eyes widen and I hiss, "WHAT?" 'Cept it was really quiet. She says, "Yeah. He said he was afraid of rejection." So I blush majorly and he comes over and leans down to my ear and whispers, "Will you go out with me?" Oh my God, I'm going to have a fit of joy right now. One sec...Okay...Okay. So I say yes and we walk to our classes. I very luckily catch my bff Susan in the hallway before I get to my class and I tell her and we have a girly freak out. Then, Chris and I meet up at break and it's kind of awkward but we go to the library and I immediatly go to Susan. It helped soothe the awkwardnesss a bit. We walk back to class and we're both late. Lol. But I was beginning to have some doubts about our relationship...I was getting paranoid. So, on the bus ride home I make myself positively sick with worry an

Well a girl who is the most beautiful according to you. You respect her, moral values all blah blah blah are fine put them in the fridge. You know she is a virgin yet would do anything in bed as she is turned on by you. And you have no other business at that time of the day (say its already night) And no ones around and you are already in a safe place. And she not going to bother you or blackmail you even if it is to be just a one night stand.      You may not be willing to cheat on someone else or so but what if it was you and your beloved (I dont mean to say cheat on your wife but had it been your wife itself some years back, how would you have felt taking the chance or not?)      I am not conducting any survey. I want to have sex with this guy I don't know what he has in mind but he has no one to love or have a relationship. And if he wishes to marry me I am there but now I need passion tonight what would you do if you were him?(I feel like if you respect my feelings better do what I wished! what is your take?)

I confronted him about it last weekend, but it was through text cause neither one of us have time to talk a lot in person cause we don’t have any classes together.       He’s the main part of the conversation:   Me: Whats happened between us?   Him: What do you mean   Me: oh don’t play dumb. You know what im talking about we hardly talk anymore, things are different now and I don’t like it at all   Him: well don’t look at me   Me: your part of this situation and its like you don’t give a crap about me but you probably never did to begin with   Him: don’t even say that   Me: well that’s how it seems and how it feels   Him: sorry   Me: whatever you don’t care   Him: yeah I do but its not like you talk to me and when you do you always get mad at me so idk what im suppose to do. Keep talking and keep making you mad   Me: its just like I always have to talk to you first. Its like you don’t care if I talk to you or not. And like you don’t care cause you act like you don’t if you actually acted like you cared for once I wouldn’t get mad but you don’t so I get mad.   Him: Sorry   Me: when are you not sorry? All I hear us sorry sorry sorry. Act sorry for once.      He didn’t text me back.      Part of me doesn’t want to loose him but another part of me is tired of all this crap.   At school when I see him he stares at me like he’s sorry but he want talk to me. It’s been a week since that conversation and I don’t know what to do..   I want him to come to me and talk to me but it seems like he never will or whatever.

20090306185620AALmTPN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok all you guys out there, answer me this...?	i think about what it'll be like when i'm married. i know that i'm young and naive (nearly 16) and that being married will be nothing like what i think it will. BUT i have these things that i have begun to wonder if a guy would actually do them. So, would you do these things, with your imagined or real wife, on like a daily-weekly basis?      1. take a bath/shower with her (i know weird, but i've always hoped that my own will do that)      2. would you care if your wife wore your shirt and boxers to bed?? i used to steal my ex's shirts and sleep in them, and i LOVE to sleep in boxers, if your wife did that would it bother you?      3. lol i know this is weird, but would you put her lotion on her for her? lol i know i'm weird that i think of these things, but i always wondered... and i mean like nearly everyday not just once in a while      4. hmmm.... i think that's it! lol i know that i'm weird, i don't need you to tell me, and i know that i'm to young to be wishing that i was married. but sometimes i can't help it. i don't think of the actual wedding (i honestly will put more effort into the honeymoon than the wedding) but i dream about being with someone, atm a faceless guy cuz i have NO idea who i'll marry, for the rest of my life. i know it's creepy and i don't care.      so, would you do those things with your wife, real or imagined?

20090306184110AAbkTAM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What woulHow do i get him to back off, salvage the friendship and stay sane?d you like to ask?	alright, so here is my problem: after my boyfriend and i broke up, i was pretty messed up about stuff. and it took a while to get back to my normal self. this guy who my friend went out with but dumped started talking to me. he helped me deal with all my issues, made me laugh, made me feel happy. we started talking the day after the break up, and he listened to me rave and rant for weeks. he helped me move on and was there and listened to things i didn't even tell my best friends about. and then he screwed it all up by falling for me. at first i thought that was very sweet of him, and told him that i wasn't ready for anything. i told him it was like an ego boost, and he understood. but he never moved on. i expected him to like me for a bit, and then forget about it. he didnt. but since he had become my closest friend, i couldn't distance myself from him. then i introduced him to another friend of mine, and he said he might like her. i got a bit jealous and recklessly decided i like him. so we went out for a bit. but my mom talked to me and then i figured out it was not the best thing and broke it off. he fell for my friend, and everything was good. she didnt want to have a relationship with him, though he persued her relentlessly. but then finally he got the message... the 2 of us were fine... until i had problems at home, and he found me having a breakdown. then he decided he was in love with me. and he meant it. i'm 17 and i know im not ready for that, and i have told him so. many times. but hw got this idea that we were meant to be together and wudnt stop mentioning how perfect it wud be if we were togther. for months this continued, though i tried to repell his advances. i feel like i owe him a lot since he was there for me when i really needed it. we were uber close, always around each other, always holding hands, always moving towards each other. i knew it was more than friendship, but thats how it had always been with us. and then i did the stupidest thing of my life and let him kiss me. for the record, i was starving, had been feeling really wierd all day and was conflicted. AND i told him i might regret it later. he said he didnt care. so even though it was real, the whole day felt like a dream. which is why we somehow ended up kissing. the entire weekend i thought about him. on sunday we went to see a movie. neither of us knew what was gonna happen. but we kissed again. he was really happy.. and it made me happy to see him that happy. but i mistook that for me feeling good about the whole thing. and then i started freaking out, and i knew i ***** do this. so i broke it off with him. it was bad, i had never seen him that angry before. but he went home. and then wrote to my other best friend- my exboyfriend and told him what happened. my ex told his other friend, and his gf- another friend of mine. soon the whole group found out. i wanted to forget it ever happened, and he refuses to forget it. so it was really awkard for a week or so. then we started talking again. but i kept my distance from him. the thing is, i really regret it and with it never happened. i feel immensely guilty about it, feel horrible and uncomfortable around him. i dont like being with him alone, because he invariably brings up what happened. he crowds me constantly, and refuses to believe i want nothing but friendship. the thing is, the reason stuff happened was i was confused. but now i know i dont feel the same way about him as i did about my ex. so tehre is no point to try to work out our 'relationship'. i just want a friend, and he doesnt understand the meaning of distance. so i stopped talking to him for a while. life was so much better! i felt less guilty, cud do what i wanted and was much happier. and then a mutual friend decided to hold an intervention. so now im talking to the kid again. but its bringing me down. he wont stop touching me. he wont stop ceowding me. he wont give me distance. he wont stop comparing my behavious with my ex who is my best friend. he wont stop asking questions:where are u goin? with whome? why? when will u be back? when will i see you? when will i talk to you? why is your hair up like that, you never had it like that before? why do you like dogs now, u always liked cats? why are you spending so much time with this guy? and he even got our gay friend to ask me to prom because he cant stand the thought of me with any guy. he follows me around school, follows me when i go to talk to my crush and breathes down my neck. i am aware if i hadnt kissed him back, i would be so much happier right now. but as far as i am concerned, that never happened. he feels the need to know everything about me, analyze every new thing about me and challenge it. I cant stand it. if he touches me, my body involuntarily moves away. if he looks at me, i look away. he asks me questions and doesnt get a hint when i dont answer. I dont know how tro save out friendship. nor am i sure i want to. being with him is physical
20090306175625AAP3gRs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make my relationship work if these things are happening?	Alright, firsts things first. Me and my girlfriend have been going out since December 20. So it's almost 3 months now. I'm 16 and she's 17. She's the most beautiful and amazing girl I've ever met. She loves me, I love her back. She's been hurt in the past, but I showed her that I'm not like the guys that hurt her... but I understand her broken heart because I also have been in a painful past... But here's the thing, for some reason I don't feel happy. Is it because I can't see her often? I mean I see her everyday because we go to the same school but... it's for like 30 minutes tops. There's always somebody else there with us. A third-wheel. I hate that. It makes the moment feel so... awkward... But the worst part is, my parents are WAY overprotective. I'M the one who's not allowed to leave the house. I mean, LITERALLY not even stay on the porch. My parents really need to let me go at some point... the thing is that they always try to outsmart me. There's always a "What If" on everything... it's driving me nuts. I mean I ask my parents if I could go to her house because she needs help with schoolwork. They even say no to that...I mean, I'm really trying hard to be with her but she's not doing her part... I talk to my parents, and we figure something out. But she's not doing anything. She always needs to have somebody with her besides me, she says she trusts me fully, but she doesn't trust guys to be alone with her. Also, every thing's a habit. The third wheel's a habit, the shyness (which is crap because from what I've seen her doing she's not shy at all), every thing's a damn habit... I just... *sigh* I don't want to break up with her now because she's moving and she knows it. But she's not doing anything to make this relationship any better... She tells me she loves me, she tell me she gets upset cause she's moving, she tells me she cries herself to sleep because it's gonna be hard to see each other, but she's missing the whole point. She needs to concentrate on what we can do now. Not the past, not the future. Just the moment, and she doesn't seem to get that... I tried talking to her but she says she can't do anything about it... anybody have any good advice for this?

20090306190111AAk870V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex Boyfriend Vs. Boyfriend...what should I do?	Okay i'm going to do my best to make this as short and as simple as possible. I dated my ex about five years ago. We only dated for 6 months but he made a lasting impression. We have been best friends all of this time and I still love him and would do anything for him. I think he loves me but i'm not sure. The reason I say this is we have been intimate and he always asks for my help and to be honest I think I see him more than his own girlfriend does. We talk every single day and at times during the week we see eachother everyday or every other day. I know i love him but I just don't know how he feels about me.   Then there's my boyfriend. The only day that I see my boyfriend is on Sundays really. He is always busy during the week and all I can do is text him or talk on the phone which is getting a little annoying. He's a good guy and he's very sweet and we've been together for going on three years but I just don't see it working out much longer. I hate to say this but I love my ex more because he knows every little thing there is to know about me and he's been there through everything. I just don't know what to do anymore. Can someone help?
20090306181214AATeIEy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, what do you think about a girl like this (me, description of me in description in detail box)?	ya know, just wondering.      looks: not skinny but not fat. straight dirty blonde hair ecept i got a perm but it's coming out anyway so it'll be straight again soon. it's the tinniest bit wavy though. dark blue eyes, almost black-looking but still blue. smallish (not completely tiny but not big like some people) mouth, plumpish lips. no peircings or tatoos.      other stuff: i like the color black cuz it's mysterious but i'm not really emo or goth or anything.i love dark purple and dark blue. i always fight back and i fight for what i believe in. i don't get too jealous, mostly, and i can always tell if some one is lying. i love music to death. all kinds. i'm learning how to play the guitar (i've been doing it for a little while so i'm not horrible as i once was.) just started piano. i sing. great sense of humor, i don't do drugs, smoke, or drink. wow, i said a lot, i do that, too, talk a lot, i mean :)

20090306230959AAC2xO4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Lost and Lonesome : Friend Advice?	Currently, I am on exchange at a school in Auckland, New Zealand.   I am having a horrible time finding friends because the school is VERY cliquey. Therefore, the only people I have been able to hang out with during lunch without being socially shunned, or stared and and then ignored, is the group of friends that my host sister hangs around.      I do not have much of a problem with this people, but I have a hard time finding things to talk about at lunch and break times (Important note: I am an EXTREMELY shy person). And sometimes I feel like they really rather not have me around in the group - like I am some kind of burden or kid that must be looked after, even though I am the same age as them.      I do have many different classes where there have been some people who have been very polite twoards me. However, I clash with most of the people here, because it is NZ and the drinking age is lower, EVERYONE always talks about drinking and partying - which really are not my thing.       Now, there is this one girl in my English class who I think seems like a pretty nice person, but is always involved in sports. She is kind of quiet but hangs around with some of the people who have been really rude to me while I have been here.      I would like to become friends with her, or at least get to know her, but I do not know if it is the best idea. I only have English class with her, by the way.      What would you do in my situation? I feel odd asking someone to hang out around here because all they do is drink, and if I tell them that I do not drink, or party (I hate dancing) I think they will look down on me. Do you think I should just drop it and bear out the rest of the trip? Or if I do talk to this girl, what exactly do you think I should say?      Thank you for all of your help.
20090306221800AAKBCdq	Family & Relationships;Family	It's normal for a father call his daughter babe?	My bf always call his 10 years old daughter " Babe". I think  it is odd for a father to call his own daughter babe, because to me the word babe is refer to someone we as adult interested or have the "HOT" for them. Sometimes when his daughter and I both were  in the same room and he'd called babe, I was not sure who he was talking to. I think it is inappropriate for a father to call his own daughter babe or even baby because she is 10 years old. The other thing is that he has a son too, but never call him baby or babe, just always call him by his name. I think it is not right for treated one child special than the other or just because he is a boy. It is really discouraging me whenever I heard he called his daughter babe, it makes me sick to my stomach. So it is normal for man to call their own daughter babe or not? And what is word "BABE" referring to????? According to the dictionary it refers to a baby...but in today's society it refers to "hot chicks" or a "stud". I just don't want people to think that my bf is a pervert.

20090306223134AARAqYR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's the deal with my husband?	My husband and I have been together for 2 years and married for 7 months. We just had a baby girl in December and I already have a child of my own. Recently we had horrible problems with his brother and sister-in-law. They live almost 3 hrs. away and he is currently living with them because of a job (we are doing bad financially). The kids and I went to stay for 2 days and we were treated cruely by the in-laws. They wouldn't even feed us or even give us a glass of water. They give me and my children nasty looks and they hate us. They even went as far as locking my husband, my children and I out in the cold (we're talking snow here, lol). Then another time locked my husband out! When I said something to my husband he seems to ignore the facts and acts like nothing has happened. I finally had enough when he had his sister-in-law watch our baby so I could take him to work and get my son something to eat and when I came back my baby was hoarse and choking from crying so hard because she let my baby go hungry for 2 hrs. (mind you she has 3 children of her own). I told him to come home until the other job opened up or he could permanently stay there. He flat out chose his brother and sister-in-law and says he wants a divorce. I am horribly confused and I'm not sure if he's coming back to me or not. He says he does love me though. My family feels because he is hispanic this may have influenced his decision. Also, I have always been respectful and kind to his family no matter what. Someone please help!

20090306225236AAFTB4a	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you tell your parents when you feel they don't understand how you feel about moving to another state?	I have recently been told that my family will be moving to another state to save money.   I really don't want to go. I have made strong ties here, and I can't stand leaving so many great friends behind. I am also a minor.   My parents can tell I am angry, and it hurts them, but they don't understand the pain I feel when I think of leaving.    My dad moved around a lot as a kid so he just tells me, "That's life. You'll make new friends." But I know that I will never meet anyone else as great as the people I have met in Cali.   I don't know what to do.   Any insight on how to cope or how to talk to my parents would be great.
20090306232243AAeXDtK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am i overreacting? what should i do?	here's the situation: my boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. I sent him a gift card to the restaurant that I work at so he can one get a free meal and two so he can go and think of me. he called me earlier tonight and told me he was going to eat there and he'd call me later. then a few hours later i texted him "how's dinner?" and he said "good thank you baby" and i texted him back saying "you're welcome. what did you get?" then he never said anything back i watched a movie with a friend and still no call or text from him. i got online and he was online and i messaged him "hey" and he never said anything and stayed online for a while then just got off. he did that same thing online last night. He called me after but then his phone died in the middle of our convo and he didn't text me at all today until around 5:00 this evening...I feel like he's ignoring me. am i over reacting cause this kind of hurts. especially since i bought him that gift card i thought after he ate there he'd at least call and thank me but he only said thank you cause i texted him first. also, what should i do about this?

I've been with my boyf a couple of months now, but he doesn't even act like we're together. We had a fake brake up a while ago so our friends would stop making fun of us but I think (though my constant telling him) that he thought it was real. Then when we got back together he was really happy for a little while, but now he barely talks to me. Then yesterday I was talking to his best friend who I've always thought was very smart, funny, comitted, and cute and asked him if he liked me. He went silent for a while then whispered "yes I do, ever since fourth grade I've always thought you were the most beautiful girl in the world" and then I told him that I was pretty sure I liked him back and then he had to go and we said goodbye. of course I love my bf but I don't think he loves me back, I think he just likes my *ahem* chest. I have the largest er... "bust" in 6th grade. But my bf best friend said that that was sick and that he loved me because I was funny and smart and cared about others. I don't know what to do....

20090306222938AAxfLoE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?? im confused! help!!!?	Okay so. there's a guy, ill call him john. so john is so cocky it annoys me so much. he tells me about all these girls that hit on him at the bar. yada yada. so we were hooking up, but that stopped two weeks ago. we still talk, but john's an awkward guy. he talks alot of game but he's probably one of the most awkward men i have met. when i see him, he's uneasy, but when we're communicating online, he acts normal. a few days ago, we were talking online and he asked why i wasn't hooking up with anyone else. and he was the only person i could get. i was offended and flipped out on him. he said he meant it as a question and it came off rude. he said any guy would be lucky to have me. last night i texted him and asked why he was so awkward around me. he claims he isn't. he asked me what he was supposed to do. bring me flowers? i told him no. but its weird that hes awkward in person, but online hes completely fine.   john does alot of things to puzzle me. he says he does alot of things just to make me mad, but most of the time, it doesn't work. he told me hes slept with much more girls than he previously told me just to upset me. he used to initiate the conversation, but lately, im the one who initiates conversation and we find ourselves in sticky situations due to arguements or miscommunication.   im completely confused. does he like me? i dont understand.

20090306181245AAUSwqX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do women really want to be sex buddies?	Me and my friend had a conversation about this earlier.    She stated that there are many women out there over the age of 27 so "just want to be sex buddies," with no strings attached and that there are many women who just want sex from a man. A regular, call you when I need sex, don't need you until then type of situation.    I argued that most women after the age of 27 are looking for "more" but just settle to be a sex buddy. I think that women who are more accepting of those conditions are either married, already in a realtionship, or been married. But most women want to be more with a man, but hope the situation changes over time.    What do you think?

20090306162833AAGu6yz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend just hanging around for when hes ready to settle down?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 months. We were completely crazy for one another and  really thought that it was the real deal and talked about "forever" everything changed when his roommate broke up with fiance to be with her best friend who was also his other roomates ex. We stopped talking as much and both became scared. He told me the Friday night that he was unsure if he wanted to be in a relationship or just be single and hang with his buddies ( he is 24) and I was very hurt especially since VDay was just passed and all he said to me. I gave him his key and didnt hear from him until Sunday when I told him to come get his stuff. He apologized and said this wasn't what he wanted but he really didnt know if he wanted to be in a relationship and i told him since we planned on moving intogether that i had no choice but to move back home to chicago. he left and text me that night at 11:30 asking if I was home and if he could come talk. He had talked to his roommate and he talked some sense into him that he was letting the one good thing out of his life and told me he wanted to be with me and he could still have his friends...       t was Sunday its now Friday. We have not hung out ONCE alone he has been with his friends a lot and not inviting me and I told him Wednesday night when he asked where I was that he never really invited me and then he showed up at my place at 2am after going out. That morning he told me if its not stated as "guys night" that I am always invited. We went out last night with some friends and today he had a meeting at work and instead of comeing to see me since he was tired he went home and went to bed. I have not talked to him since 2 this afternoon and have asked him if he wants to get dinner or see a movie when im off work at 8 and i called him... nothing. I looked at his camera for the pictures from last night and saw from Friday when he first told me he was unsure he went out after that happened around 11pm with his friend and two girlfriends. Saturday he went out with his friend and had pictures with two girls and had pictures of them out to eat after. Sunday he was busy and came by my place and then monday I spent with him and Tuesday he went out and I went over there and wednesday he was with his friends but then after he was with them went out to get a drink with other people and then came to my place and this was the night when we discussed me being "invited" and that he wanted to spend time with me too.My friends think that he is not ready for a relationship but is holding onto me until he is ready? But I cannot go on like this. I feel like if he really wanted to be in a relationship and make it work he would be spending time with me... should i see how the weekend plays out and then talk to him. Thank you

He says he really likes me because im cute and im original:). Okay well anyways I talked to him about going out and he said he wasnt ready for a relationship right now. Later i had to have a serious talk with him and he says he doesnt want to date me because he's going to college soon and he doesnt want to hurt me. Most people I've talked to however say that he likes multiple girls and he even asked a girl to prom and then ditched her last year. Does this mean he just wants  to hookup and have sex? Or is he too scared to have a relationship with me?HELP! Oh and by the way he says he still likes me though.

20090306171615AAXjd5i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's on his mind? he did so many sweet things for me and says he's not into me.?	I met this guy while travelling latin america and we've been in touch a while. I met him again in Zurich, where he lives during my visit there, and really liked him but didn't think of any potential relationship as i live in London.      he visited london for my birthday and we kissed. I went to switzerland to see him and he organised a great snowboarding trip.  he came to pick me up at the airport, we had a great time and went to a carnival as well. i was so happy and completely in love after 3 days with him.      he played and sang beautiful songs, cooked for me and took care of me in everything but he says he's not into me... well, he later admitted that he likes me a lot but he has his life in zurich and i have mine in london. I suggested another weekend trip together and now he says he wanna keep his weekends free for himself....      looking back i realised it was always me who was active in our relationship, i was the one kissing him and hugging him.. is it just because he's shy? is he just worried about long distance relationship? or just not into me? if he's not into me, why was he so sweet?

20090306173513AAu4W9u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'd very much appreciate helpful advice. This is killing me, what can I do?	I'll cut straight to the chase.   I've been with my boyfriend for nearly two years now, we've had our ups and downs like every relationship... we've been through a lot together and I love him so much. He is my second boyfriend and I'm his fifth, so he's kinda seen what it's all about.       For the past few months I've just been really curious about single clubbing life and whatnot. I really wanna get out there with no strings attached and ...experience my youth as it were. No matter how much I try to suppress these feelings, they won't go away. But when I properly think about it... I know it would crush me to leave him, as well as hurting him. I don't want him to completely vanish from my life, I care about him so much...      What should I do? I'm so confused :(

Then they tell you to call anytime you want so you call at 7:00. They don't answer you wonder why but you don't get suspicious. So you wait an hour or two and call again still no answer But.. you leave a voicemail asking were they are and can they call you back but they dont you still wait...wait and wait hovering over the phone .

20090306183038AAhskGd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I know this question is on a lot but...?	I've known this guy for about 3 years now.  I wouldn't consider us good friends, but we talk every day.  Pretty much every girl in my class has liked him at some point in those 3 years, and he has turned them all down.  Recently, I've noticed some things he does:  Our class watches movies a lot, and he always pokes me and has little contests with me and stuff...  kinda random.  He also emails me allllll the time asking for the homework, and he's like, THE smartest guy in our grade. (and he usually emails back after i do to talk about other stuff other than school)  Whenever I walk by him, he slows down so he's next to me.  This may seem like totally obvious flirting, but seriously, he's impossible to read.  He has a sorta large ego, but I think I might like him.  What do you think?  Serious answers only please.

I eventually told her I loved her and she was surprised, but still continued to talk to me and didn't try to ditch me. Everyone has been telling me that she really does like me and is going to say yes. Even her friends have told me that they told her to say go out with me. It has been 2 weeks now and she is says she is still thinking. Does she really like me or am I just getting played? She doesn't seem like the type to actually play someone like that so I really don't know....

20090306191946AAFjc54	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I finally found a girl i really like, but my friend won't let me have her. What do i do?	i don't normally fall in love fast but i did with my ex girlfriend. ever since she and i broke up a few months ago, i've been a wreck. but then i started hanging out with my friend whos great and gorgeous and she makes me happy again. the only problem is, she's considered my best friend's little sister. they aren't blood siblings but they've known each other since babies. he's very protective and i dont think he would allow it; not to mention, he's a fighter. he loves fighting and he's one of those people who believes you should date older. I'm 16 and she's 14, and since my best friend's are all older than me 17 or 18, they think its wrong for me to go for 14 year olds. i haven't had a spark with any girls since my ex girlfriend, but now i have one. what should i do?

20090306194324AAE8ZIE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend cheating on me?	So recently I've been getting the hunch that my boyfriend has been cheating on me. We've been going out for 11 months. I really don't want to believe my intuitions, but there are just some things he's done and things I've heard that won't allow me to break them. Here are some reasons why I think he's cheating:      1. I've heard numerous warnings from my best friend (who has claimed to have heard this from my boyfriend's best friend) and other friends who all know him about how he's cheated on every single girlfriend he's had. This includes a girlfriend of two years who he supposedly cheated on twice. But every time I've asked him if he's ever cheated  he completely denies it (excluding one girl he went out with for two weeks who he cheated on with me before we got together `:|) .       2. He recently spent the night at his female "friend" Tori's house with her and her brother since she was going to through a party for him and her brother since they just happened to have the same birthday. There was alcohol and since they were over 18 and no parents were around. He called me around midnight completely thrashed, leaves me a 2 second message and doesn't tell me he loves me at the end (he usually makes a big deal about not saying 'I love you'). Though I've never heard of this girl before and when I ask about her he says she's a friend he's known since 7th grade. And the entire time we talk about it he stutters.      3. We'd normally have phone conversations lasting an hour and a half to two hours since we live slightly long distance. The talks have recently shortened to around 30 minutes and he seems rather distance. Like he's always making small talk instead of actually carrying a conversation.      4. His myspace (I know, I know) status changed from In a relationship to Swinger out of the blue and when I asked him why he claimed that it was an inside joke between him and his friend about him swinging on swings. Which he never does, I might add.         I'm hoping that it's just me being paranoid, but I can't help but wonder. Everyone always tells me he is, but he tells me he loves me too much to do that to me. Don't get me wrong. We've never had any really problems or fights in our relationship and it's been relatively calm over all. I just need to know. Is it just me or and I being played?      Also: There's an age difference of 3 years. I'm 18 & he's 21.

20090306202008AA83jBp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still like me? Or should i just give up..?	Recently my boyfriend broke up with me. He said it was because he knew he wasn't the best boyfriend and that i deserved better; which is obviously one of those famous lines all guys use to make the break up less hurtful. He still called me beautiful and treated me like his girlfriend weeks after the break up..which was a little weird. And now  all of a sudden he avoids me..i haven't talked to him in almost 2 weeks. Im not completely over him, obviously. i liked him a lot, more than any other guy i've met. But now i hear he talks about me behind my back; hes just turned into a total jerk. do you think this is a cover up for still liking me, or is he really just trying to make my life miserable....?

20090306204311AA8iTAp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The wedding whisperer: love or not?	I want some honest opinions. I don't care if they're brutally honest, but they must be honest.      I came to my new school about 6 months ago. It was then i first met J.      He is amazingly nice, to everybody. But he seemed to be particularly nice to me. Though I cautioned myself not to believe it, I couldn't help but feeling he had a crush on me.      Back then:      - I often caught him staring at me   - he used to frequently "accidentally" bump into me   - he bought me lollies   - he kept on showing off in front of me   - even though i played hard to get, he never stopped trying to get my attention   - he played with my hair, e.g. flicked my ponytail whenever he passed me   - always seemed sad to leave me      Anyway, it got to a point when I was quite certain he liked me. The climax came when we went to a mutual friend's wedding with our families. We ended up sitting next to each other, and during the ceremony he leant over and whispered "I love you" in my ear.      I didn't react. I blushed, probably, smiled a little. he gave me a questioning look, tried to get me to answer - but heck, it was a wedding, and i was embarrassed. I made no answer. but i thought it must be pretty obvious to him that I loved him back.      He continued chasing me in his gentle way, always seemed to appear around the next corner with a bright smile on his face. he tried to get me to go to lunch with him but i was busy and said so. he didn't seem hurt or anything - though in truth i was in a very bad mood that day so i probably didn't really notice.      Then came the odious holidays. Over Christmas I heard nothing from him, not a text message, not an email, nothing. I was fully expecting him to ask me out...but he didn't.      When we went back to school things were different. he seems more interested in my girlfriends than in me now - sometimes i think he is deliberately trying to make me jealous. Othertimes he's nice the way he used to be. he is sooo confusing!!!      Now:      - when I meet him unexpectedly he mumbles   - i noticed him blushing when he was with me and a group of friends, but it could have had nothing to do with me   - when we are alone, he shows me stuff on his ipod like he used to, and conversation seems cheerful though distanced   - if i ring him about the group assignment we're currently doing together, he often sounds bored and tired and wishing for the call to end   - once when i meet him unexpectedly with his (female) friend, he patted me on the shoulder and grinned and seemed really happy to see me      What is it? I really don't get him. is he just a flirt? sometimes i really think he must have never cared for me at all, and othertimes i think he's just stopped crushing on me. othertimes again, i think he's still crushing on me, but is afraid to admit it, or thinks i only want to be friends. but if that's the case, for God's sake, why doesn't he just ask me out? he's a guy, he has the authority to chase me. is he simply no longer interested?      What should i do? it's a miserable situation. I want the truth, however hard it hurts me. i'm still desperately in love with him and i know i won't be able to stop just because he doesn't like me.         I am totally at a loss.

It's really sad that I had to end a 7 year friendship over something like this. Did I overreact?
20090306233302AAljNaG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think I am a sex addict and my wife really isn't into sex.  What should I do?	I've been married for about a year now.  When I first met my wife, she was great--she had a very healthy libido and was very affectionate and passionate.      But, once we got married, the sex dried up pretty fast.  I now wonder if I masturbate more now that I'm married than I did when I was single.  My wife seems to view sex as a chore.      I've had previous relationships, both casual and serious, where the woman I was intimate with really enjoyed sex.  Basically, I enjoy horny women.  It's a completely natural thing, in my opinion.  I've always wondered if I was a sex addict, as I seemed to crave sex more than any of my friends.  For example, one night my friends and I were sitting around talking about how often we masturbate.  I was the winner--by far.  Most of them preferred every other day or so.  The most they had done it in one day was twice.  I've done it seven times in one day multiple times.      So, I feel like I might be a sex addict, and while I have this craving, my wife seems to not care.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

20090505090704AAuPInO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I wait for her to call me?	There is this girl who I can't read at all. She sends me mixed signals. Not too long ago I asked her to go see a movie and she was busy and I couldn't tell if she just wasn't into me or what. I decided not to call her for awhile and then she called me up and wanted to go on a walk or a bike ride. that was fun but then recently i asked her if she wanted to go bowling with some friends and I but she said she was busy for the weekend. She did say she wanted to go sometime though so I don't know. I can't tell what's up but I think she must suspect I like her and I do her favors like pay for her when we go out to lunch, help her with things and I gave her a 10 page essay that I got an A on because she was stressing about having to write it and her parents were coming into to town.       My question is, since the last thing I asked her to do was go bowling and she said she was booked for the weekend but would like to do that sometime though. at this point should I lay low and see if she gets in touch with me or would you try to ask her to do something again?

20070201103609AACYc5C	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you like my letter?	I wrote it to Donna         I feel angry that you were so mean to me. I hate it that you judged me. I can't stand your rejection and your rigidity.      I feel sad that you hurt me. I feel sad that you did not accept me. I feel afraid that there is something wrong with me, that I am not lovable. I am afraid of not being perfect, not doing things right. I feel afraid that others will judge me like you have. I feel afraid I will never be comfortable with myself or with other people. That I will always be on edge.       I feel guilty for being so insecure. I feel guilty for letting you treat me that way. I feel guilty for not being more accepting of myself.
20090307004345AAM3Vuf	Family & Relationships;Friends	How would I apologize to someone I back-stabbed?	How would I apologize to someone I back-stabbed?      I've known Rhea for/ever/. Since 1st grade. We were like, sisters, you know? However, since 4th grade, I scammed her out of her Neopets account, even though it was only a side account. In 5th grade, I annoyed the heck out of her when I cried too much to the point when she had to be sent to the office when I accidentally spilled curry on her book. In 6th grade, I never ever did my homework. Always asking for hers. At the end of the year, I had the nerve to hack into her main Neopets account and cause havoc in her guild. I wrote her a confession in 7th grade. Later, I self-froze. A few months later I found a little cbox she and her guild hangs out on. After talking a little bit (more like her friend harassing me every second as I /attempted/ to apologize to her...and I think I did it wrong...)      I feel so terrible for all the things I've done...I wanted to send her a letter, but I feel that is completely insignificant and I really, really should do something much more than THAT. I planned to write her a autobiography of my life during those times...the best and yet the worse of my life...but I figured that would be too melodramatic and that will just spur up the undying pity I would expect out of her. I honestly have no idea if she ever wants to speak to me again, but I would honestly just want to...like, break the dispute, at least. If I'm lucky, heaven forbid, I might ask if she would like to be friends with me again. I've been such a heartless person...I honestly didn't know I was hurting her since 4th grade. Well, actually, I did, but I thought she didn't mind...she never said ANYTHING. She hid everything so well, took it so cleanly. She can't even be considered my friend...more like a puppet, really. So I ask you, Yahoo, how I should apologize to Rhea. I cannot contact her though the phone or any real-life face to face situations, so I have to settle with poking her in MSN and making it on the Internet.      I can code HTML, use Photoshop to make pretty effects, write decent narratives, draw decently, have a tablet, and is trying to get my old friend, my previous puppet, to forgive me.      Just so you guys know, I just turned 13. Wow, my life is so tragic. For those that are wondering, yes, I have a 3.85 GPA / straight A's NOW and had like C's in 6th grade. I have already broken my previous non-homeworking habits...but this is something I really want to change...I want to do something about it NOW.

20090227104423AABM6Vx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I'm jealous of my room mate's (and every other girl's) engagement?	I go to a small Christian college, so I guess it's normal for everyone to be engaged here.       My roommate got engaged in November, about one year and eight months into her relationship. Now I'm constantly hearing about wedding planning, "I'm so happy for you," etc. And I know she's going to be a beautiful bride.      I know tons of other girls at this school who are engaged as well and when I find out how long they've been dating, my boyfriend and I have been dating a lot longer than most of them. I just feel like every other girl on this campus is engaged and I'm not.      But, I'm starting to get antsy. I don't want to constantly bother my boyfriend about it, but I do drop hints sometimes. I know he has reasons why he hasn't proposed to me yet, like his parents. They don't want him to get married until after we graduate, but the thing is, I don't want to get married until after we graduate either!      How can I stop thinking like this? I know he loves me and that it will happen when it's supposed to, but I just feel left out I guess. Advice, please?

There is this one guy at my school called Chad, and we are not doing very well right now. We are trying to be nice to eachother, but it is difficult because, I think we are mad at eachother about things that happened in the past. I don't know if he still likes me or not but he is always watching me, kind of gives me a mad look in a way. He kind of shows off in front of me, and when he talks to me he blushes. But I don't know if he still likes me like he did last year because he is always flirting with this other girl. And i can tell that he is having a hard time being nice to be. Does he hate me or what?

20090307002527AArKgC8	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Question for bridal shop owners or employees past or present.?	I have always been curious about bridal shops.  Do the shop owners actually pay for their sample gowns or are they sent them for carrying the designer?  I was thinking about it as I sat at a shop and thought, there must be $250,000 worth of gowns in here...thousands in veils and tiara samples plus the other odds and ends.  I could not see a small business owner buying all these out of pocket or even on credit.  Also, when someone opens a bridal shop do they just get to decide who they want to sell or do the designers pick them.  I have always wondered.  The shop I went to  is not a big overhead shop as in high rental area or anything, but jut the cost of the dresses would be worth more than my house!  If anyone knows the scoop, I am just curious..one of those things that you don't need to know...but have always kinda wanted to know.   Thanks for any "in the know" from anyone.

20090308091057AAK87mH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my friend call my guy more than she calls me?	She and him go to the same school (right by where we live), apparently. So they run into each other pretty often. But why the hell is she calling him at 11 and 12 at night some nights? She has a tendency to exclude me from things intentionally or unintentionally. Like, she and the rest of the "crew" tend to go out to parties and stuff, and they tell me nothing about it. Even when she tags along with me and this guy I'm seeing, she doesn't call me about it. And now he'd tell me like "yeah, she called me...I don't know why, I didn't pick up."      She doesn't even call ME that much. So why the hell is she calling him? Even if she called him to invite the both of us somewhere, I don't understand why she's calling him (just met him like 2 months ago) and not me (just met 12 years ago). What do you think?

20080926231340AAsoVDr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	>>>>>Serious answers only don’t answers if your going to be rude (Please)?	There is this guy & I consider he "likes me too" were both 21yrs old; we been talking to each other for 5months. (His in the military) He asked me out on a date but I had to break off our first date since my grandmother was not well. Therefore, I had no chose & I had to go overseas. I give details on what was happing and he said that it was “ok” however the next day he got “drunk” and he called me up asking me if I was “married” or if I had a “boyfriend”, he said that he wanted woman to chase after him for once and    “love him. He assumed that I wanted that too.         As well as he thought that I did not want to see him Therefore, I called him up the next day asking him if he was ok. We then worked everything out & he asked when I was leaving? & I said that I would call him before I go overseas. However, when I left I did not call him seeing as he went and place “photos up on face Book" of him and these other “woman friends” and other guys, they were dancing, and having fun. It is as if he wanted to make me “jealous” since he knows that many guys want to date me too. once I came overseas I sent Him an Email asking how he was??? he then replied and he said that he was well and that he missed me and he asked why I didn’t call. so I told him that I liked him and that I wasn’t playing around and that I wanted to see him once I was back and that I was sorry and confused. he then said that he felt the same and that he was thinking about me But after all that he didn’t keep in touch with me on face book? and I wrote him another Email asking him if he was ok and he didn’t answers.?? It has been 2months and I know that he saw it and I just came back from overseas and I saw on his face book wall that his friends were asking him if he was ok and they all noticed that he was keeping busy and I don’t know what to believe or do? And today he wrote on his face book wall for everyone to see….he said Michael is waiting for some replies.. But is getting writting off tonight!!!    What does he mean by that and why is he acting like this,  he knows that I will see this, what should I do now? And does he still like me, Thank you

20090308094800AAP5yTs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would community polygynandry (one can have sex with anyone) be a solution for sexual morality?  I come out of?	Would community polygynandry (one can have sex with anyone) be a solution for sexual morality?      I come out of a Puritan tradition that said essentially "sex is bad". That was a bit primitive. But indeed even now I see the great damage done to the lives of young people,especially by that blind wild sexual urge. It is very harmful to the status of women, but indeed it also ruins the character of men.      But then i wondered, what is the origin of sexual puritanism? And I realized perhaps it was not rational. Sex lust does a lot of damage to social relations. A culture of pleasure in the end leads to more pain. But there is nothing inherently wrong with the physical act of sex, except STDS, and perhaps pain to females.      So the solution seems to be, to allow people to enjoy the physical pleasures of sex, without the negative cultural and social relations that follow. Community polygynandry in which any man can have sex with any woman, and any woman could have sex with any man seems to be the solution. So it could be a voluntary organization in which men and women would have the opportunity to have sexual relations with men and women, equal and more attractive than them, but in turn have to copulate with those less attractive.      If sex was de-mystified in this way, as simply a way to enjoy physcial stimulation, without the ugly cultural side effects, I think marginal utility could be maximized.      What are your thoughts and objections?
20070510041832AAiyzJZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	What individuals are know for their great friendships?	I know there have been allot of people known for advocating love, tolerance and friendship, such as Ghandi, Buddha and Jesus. Additionally, there are stories of great romanticized lovers throughout history.   However, who has been known for being a great Friend?    Who has had a deep meaningful platonic relationship with another individual?      I would prefer real people from history or from your culture, but you can also name individuals from either fiction, mythology, stories, etc.

20090227102130AAxgH2y	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I wrong? Mother in law.?	My husband and I moved back overseas to settle after my husband lived abroad for 25 years.  We had to stay with his mum for 5 months while job hunting and house hunting.  For some reason, she took a dislike to me, and I was ignored, shouted at, and given dirty looks in front of the family.  Not being use to this sort of treatment I was really hurt and embarrassed.  This lady is 83 years old, but still very mentally aware.  I tried my best to turn a blind eye, but in the meantime I did everything I could in the house to show my appreciation, Cleaned, washed, scrubbed,  and not once did she ever say thank you. Two weeks ago, I left and am 300 miles away staying with friends until we can move into our own place.      What hurts most of all, is my husband watched all of this, and never took a stand in my defense. it was as though he was too scared to tell her, if my wife isnt welcome, then nor am I.  So he is there, and I am here.  I am not sure whether I would be doing the right thing to go back to him.  He basically gave her the message, its okay to ignore and shout at my wife, as I will still be the same towards you.      I am having a really hard time digesting this, and very indecisive as what would be the right thing to do.

So after what seemed of 30 minutes of bickering, he simply tells me to just shut up because he didn't want to hear my opinion anymore, and then he told me that our arguing was the very reason that we could never be in the future married, and he said it so seriously which made absolute no sense to me?

20090307012449AAmxCb0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the most appropriate way to deal with a guy like this one?	Here's the scenario: Boy meets girl. They become friends. Now they are apart from each other but the communication continues. "Hi's" and "hello's" boost each other's day. Aside from this, he sends her messages with statements such as "I appreciate everything in you" and "You are lovely". One day, he sends her flowers with a note that says "Love will find a way to bring two hearts together".      Now, this puzzles her. This tempts her to think that he already has some affection for her, but still, she does not want to be presumptuous. So she decided to ask him why did he send flowers and what does he mean by the note.  He replies, "It's my way of showing how I appreciate you. And the message, as clearly as it is stated"...

20090227105505AAaHG6n	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to deal with wife's sister and belligerent boyfriend?	Hi there!      I have a situation that is both troubling and difficult to deal with. If you have a moment I will outline the situation:      I own a home where I live with my wife. She is from Europe and has a twin sister that I fixed up with the guy across the street (who rents and will have to move eventually as the home is in foreclosure). Her sister has been in Florida for 4 years and in a bad marriage and when that ended she came here to live and we helped her find a place to rent. She is 25, and in 7 years of being in the USA she has really done nothing but exist at the expense of others. While in Florida for 4 years she never worked, nor went to school. She never got a driver's license, nor learned to drive. When her marriage ended we had her come stay with us with the understanding it was very temporary. We helped her find a place and she moved into a room-mate situation. She eventually got a job at a sandwich shop and I introduced her to the guy across the street who I had just made friend's with after he moved in.      Well, in her classic style she quickly moved in with him. It was OK for awhile-the guy is fairly nice when he's sober (he's about 28 years old). Eventually I saw that when he drank a lot he became belligerent. He snapped on me twice over trivial things, mostly related to his insecurity or when I would ask my wife's sister things like when she would look for a job, etc. By snapping I mean he would be verbally confrontational, almost to the point of a fistfight. I would be mature and just leave with my wife, only to have him try to apologize the next day. I brought a friend over once for a UFC fight and he nearly got in a fight with him-my guest! Another time he was close to fist-fight with one of his best friend's over my wife's sister again.      Finally he got into a fist fight when we went out to a musical gig downtown, and I ended up in the middle of it! I had to walk home, too. Well, then the reports of him getting physical with my wife's sis began. She told my wife he pulled her hair, slapped her, and on several occasions choked her. Now, I am very uncomfortable to say the least! I now hate living across the street from them. I won't talk to the guy, but he thinks everything is OK, and wonders why I am avoiding him. I don't think he knows that my wife's sis told her about the physical abuse. My question is-how do I proceed? The police were there once. He drinks every day and has a cush job Mommy gave him. I am actually equally disgusted with my wife's sis because she is lazy and sponges off men, hasn't worked since quitting the deli job 7 month's ago, and still has no license or car, so she can't really leave him, and I'm not sure if she even wants to.      What should I do? Should I continue to be uncomfortable and ignore him? Should I confront him and tell him I know about the abuse, and risk him getting mad at my wife's sis for telling her? Should I tell him perhaps that he needs to quit drinking and go to anger management before our friendship can continue?      It was a big mistake having my wife's sis come to Calif, and an even bigger one setting her up across the street. Any insight into a solution is appreciated. I really am torn because we have been to his folks for Holidays, and this guy is pretty cool when he doesn't over-drink. I'm not sure I'd hang out with him if it wasn't for my wife's sis being his girlfriend, but frankly I'm tired of them both!      Thank you so much!

20090227104211AANZFl6	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How to convince the girl of making sex ?	4 month we are together we didn’t have a table relation, she always needed to be sure of her feelings before getting in, she also refused to make sex with me as she said she refuse sex before marriage, I agreed and told her I respect . Then she met a man and had sex  after 5 days. Why ?
20090307001338AAcGTfM	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends are really getting me down.. help?	recently I've felt like my friends are reallly getting me down. They are selfish and bitchy and constantly letting me down, when I am consistantly a good friend to them. For example, whenever one of them is down about her ex, i cancel all my plans so she can come round or whatever, and she always comes to me when she has a problem. But when things are going her way, she doesnt want to know. She asked me out last week, and now she 'cant be bothered' so I cancelled my plans with my boyfriend for no reason. My other friends are equally as selfish and bitchy and Ive had enough tbh.      Its just really getting me down, because I feel like Im nice and easy to get along with and am a really good friend, yet it seems the bitchy selfsih people always win. The only people who make me happy are my best friend and my boyfriend, but she goes to a different college, and is so confident I sometimes think she doesnt quite understand what I mean.      The worst thing is we're all meant to be going on holiday this year (there are 5 of us in total). Its booked and I know if i say i dont want to go Ill be letting everyone down and theyll have to pay extra to compensate.      Please someone tell me what to do because im at the end of my tether here.

20090307004309AAXRRLT	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Question for those waiting or did wait until marriage?	How did you find the strength to wait? Especially when everyone around you was giving in. I'm 19 and in college and I'm having a hard time with it. I don't just want to have sex, but at the same time I'm afraid I'll get all bitter and start judging other people because they have had sex and turn down the girl that I should spend the rest of my life with because I couldn't handle her not waiting when I did. How did you deal with this and how did you decide what to do? I'm a guy and I've actually had nightmares where I gave in on a one night stand and felt like crap afterwards, which I think is weird because from everything I've been brought up seeing I'm supposed to not care about sex so I feel weird for caring. I guess I just feel different because everyone else here doesn't care and I need to know how you got through it. Sorry if I sound pathetic, but I didn't know where else to ask this.       Thank you.
20090307005557AA7IJxA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just friends I guess?	So, this chick I like (All these questions start this way :P ), came over and spent the night yesterday.  We talked about random things until about 4 in the morning.  She is really cuddly, flirty, kisses my cheek,  sends me signals; but yet she has made a point that we are just best friends... yet I never wanted that in the first place.  I don't want to spill my feelings for her because I don't want to chase her away, but I still kind of feel like I'm setting myself up for disaster.  Any suggestions, because I'm kind of stuck here.  Did I screw this up? I don't really know what my next move should be.

20090307010402AAu80T8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm with someone right now, but what about the other?	Back in the middle of 08 I made this friend that I became very close with. I ended up liking him but of course, I kept it a secret. I accidentally sent him something that was meant for a friend exposing that I liked him. Since then, he has stopped talking to me, has been cold to me, and has been cold to the friend it was meant for. We always have those awkward moments where we run into each other face to face or someone includes both of us in a conversation. I can understand why he stopped talking to me but I thought it wasn't right how he just stopped things. I'm with someone now I really care about but I still miss the other and want to talk things out with him. I'm not really sure how though.

20060704221406AAqaPPp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever done anything REALLY stupid for love?	I feel really stupid and really dumb right now I really don't ned to hear it from anyone else. From what I'm about to say you probably are going to think i'm a young naive kid but the fact is I'm almost 30. Guys, i met someone on the internet a few months ago. I had just ended a 5 yr relationship that ended badly..he hurt me by cheating. I was so desperate to find love again that when I met this guy my guards were down a bit. I thought i asked all the right questions and did all the right thigs. Eventually the relationship progressed (we'd never met, he was in the military in Europe and me here in the States). He told me he was being to deployed to live here in the States so I was excited. He said he wanted a housewife. He advised me to quit my job because I would relocate to be with him. To make a long story short, the guy never showed..i'm now left jobless and in so much pain. I feel worthless and so much like a real idiot. I hear abt ppl like that and say theyre so dumb! What 2 do?

And I know that involved wife can not be punished as accused of adultery or as abetter under section 497 IPC.   But if some married lady ONLY does an AGREEMENT of adultery  with another man without informing her husband about it ......... NOT more then that.....,    so now it is a case of criminal conspiracy under section 120 IPC.    Now her husband want to prosecute both of them under section 120 IPCfor doing criminal conspiracy of adultery.    Can some husband seek punishment for his wife for doing criminal conspiracy of adultery under secion 120 IPC in that case?

20070621205610AAvvpnP	Family & Relationships;Friends	When you are in pain, sad, heartbroken...do you think you're the only one that feels that way?	I sit all alone sometimes, and my chest literally throbs in pain missing someone, heartbroken.  It consoles me thinking that everyone goes through this all the time, for some reason or another, but still it is hard.  Everyone that is in pain is really forced to put on a brave face and smile, because I mean, for the most part, no one feels comfortable around a weepy, crying person, someone who is bewildered and sad over their loss.  Your friends can console you to a point, but they can't be there all the time, which is understandable.  But doesn't it feel so lonely, even with support some of the time from your friends and family, to be home alone sad, crying, etc - having to deal with the emotions?  I know this is a basic question, we all go through this, but have you ever thought about how we all really do?  It just seems like at the time, you are all alone and miserable, and your heart just hurts.  I'd just like to hear other's thoughts - I know this is vague...

20070716055722AAbEKEW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Estoy desesperada por mi novio?	Resulta que yo termine con el a principios de ano debido a que teniamos muchos problemas y que era muy celoso. Hace poco comenzo a andar con una chica y cometi el error de volver con el, digo que el error porque yo deseaba que el cambiara para volver con el, pero volvi por celosa, la regue. El supuestamente la dejo y volvimos. Pero solo nos la hemos pasado peleando, el me echa en cara que yo lo abandone. En mi cumpleanos tomo bastante y se puso muy pesado, hasta me hizo un chupeton en frente de nuestras mamas, me dio mucha pena, esas cosas no se hacen en publico. La verdad no se que hacer, el hombre al que yo amaba ya no existe. Cuando vio que estaba por terminarlo otra vez me asegruro que iba a cambiar, y que me amaba. pero ya me ha prometido tantas veces cambiar que no le creo . A parte abusa, un dia le pedi su celular para ver una foto y se enchilo y no me dejo, y despues, en estos dias me pidio el mio y se lo negue , pero creo que es justo y el se molesto. Es muy raro. Que hago.

But like many others, i dont want to tell her my feelings only to have them not returned and then to have our friendship fall apart. I have a feeling that she likes me too tho. She's a really friendly and touchy person who hugs people a lot and i guess you could say she's kinda flirty. But when it's just me and her talking i feel like theres a different mood about it. She'll touch me alot on the arm when wer talking. And if i'm sitting down she sometimes sits on my lap. Also when we talk and get close she'll look deep into my eyes. We also hug a lot. After we hug she sometimes we'll like keep one of her hands still on my waist. Sometimes when wer talking and im wearing a hoodie , she'l play with the drawstrings on my hoodie and she'll get close and look me deep in the eyes. A coupl of days ago wen we were talkin in a hallway and she held my hand (for like the 5 seconds then she kinda walked away) like the way that couples hold hands. does she "like" me

Yesterday afternoon some kids had to stay after for band because we had to play at a football game, and this guy that I think is really cute likes me but I am not sure. We were drawing on the board together and he even sat beside me while eating dinner. We were flirting and everything else. We were just joking around writing all the funny things down about who likes who that arent true. On the board he wrote that someone likes me so I asked him and he said that he wouldnt tell me. So later on while we were eating pizza for dinner I asked him if he would give me a hint and he said that the third letter of the last name is this and the fourth letter of the last name is this and that follows his last name. So I asked him if it was him and he said no after a few seconds. Then he said that he was just joking that that wasn't true about the last name letters. could he like me??

20090307012452AAeO2T7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Single and Gay and totally confused.?	Ok so I'm a senior in high school, i graduate in june, but unlike many gay men my age that i know, Im also a student in the Auto Tech Class at school. so im kinda a butch gay man but i want a boyfriend who will be protective of me and be the "man" but the problem is my parents know im gay, they are just very against it, like they drop hints when thier talking about my sexuality and then i say that sexuality doesn't decide a persons faith my mom then says that a person must be pure sexually to be a christian, so she won't allow me to even bring a guy near the house if she knows im dating him. my problem is how and where can i look to meet a guy where my parents either won't figure it out or know about it?

20090227113853AANKxi6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	WHat can I do about my nagging husband?	He Works full time...I work around 30 hours a week at my own business which I run from home (It makes a fair bit of money) in addition to my business I look after our baby and our 4 year old in the day as well as most of the housework and shopping. He does help in the house..he will wash up, do some laundry or cook sometimes...but he is constantly nagging me about the housework...some days it begins as soon as we getup...he will complain about the fact that I left teaspoons in the sink overnight...or that I have not folded my clothes and put them away...he nags Me on and off all day and all evening it is driving me MAD! I have spoken to him...told him that he nags me too often and too regularly about things which I don't think matter...I have a LOT to do and something has to give..it#s either run a perfect house and my own business or neglect the kids...I would rather play a game with the kids than fold the laundry! I think the problem is that his Mother worked full time in the day and then spent all night doing housework...so part of him thinks I should do the same! Well I won't...and he won't stop nagging either. What can I do? I have told him how I feel but it just keeps on! I cannot just stop doing everything so he sees how much I actually DO do....as that wouldn't be fair on the kids...help!

20070308181125AAVaRmG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why don't women ever admit...opinions please?	Why don't women ever admit?   to the number of sexual partners they have been with. And when they do it's like 1 or 2...and that's even a lie. It's like women don't count one night stands, I was drunk, I was on vacation, oral sex, if it wasn't good, if the guy was a jerk....none of those count in a woman's calculations. So, you can always double if not triple the amount that a woman admits to. Correct?

20060814171205AAPInxw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do? (if u read the other 1 on ivan hes the crush i like best) srry if its too long?	last year i started having a crush on a new guy so i asked him out he said he liked me alot. he said he will think about it and that he will tell me the next day cause we have a class together. the next day he made his friend tell me. when the class came up he wouldnt look at me (i say this cause he always stares at me). the teacher told me to pass out a worksheet out to the class and when i got to him he looked down (i think it was too awkward because he said no). later that day i found out that 5 other girls asked him out. it turns out the other girls were prettier and more popular. 5 days before the school  was over i found out he had like 3 girlfriends (during the year he is not a player) all one year older, way more popular, and more prettier. he broke up with the last one and now one of his best friends (girl she is also one of my friends) told me he likes me but he might go to a different school.  what should i do  sorry its too long

20090227120613AAoFwdL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	To go or not to go to grandma's bday party?	guess I could toss a coin about this,but I thought I'd ask everyone's opinion.    Tonight I have kickboxing from 6-7 and there is also bday supper going on for my bf's grandmother from about 5:30-7ish. I do not know his grandmother that well and I am not close to her. I think if I don't go to the supper, it won't make a difference to people there, especially her. My bf has told me I am invited to go and he would like me there but if I go to my kickboxing class he understands and it's not a big deal.   So do I go to kickboxing or go to a bday party for someone who barely knows me or talks to me and vice versa?
20070403070941AAu7K1E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do?!?	I have a crush on my best friend's brother. Problem? He is 6 years older than me and so mature I don't see how he'll like me the same way I love him.      I think it is possible that we could have something between us, but we are an entire ocean apart, and while I'm in Europe, he's in America having girls fawn over him daily (not like he dates anyone, he can't find any he likes). I'm going to visit all my friends and family soon (he is on the list), and I know that if I see some other girl on his arm I'll burst into tears.      I can't leave Europe because I just moved here, to a place full of opportunity and beauty, but how do I get to know him when he's so busy with work and we're 6 hours apart?!      Yes, I have his email, but I got it from my bro who is my crush's friend... but he doesn't answer...my best friend says the computer crashed! Man, that sucks.      How to get over a possible heartbreak is welcome.      Cheers. To love that is one-sided, and cherished from afar.

20090227110604AAqXhAL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My life is going downhill like everyone on the news, need some help?	this year started off all right, i had just lost my girlfriend whom i really loved, and still see from time to time, but was geting over her.  things were going well until i heard on the news how everyone was getting laid off n losing their businesses, so i began to worry.. which ultimately made me realize reality is set to hit the fan... i got laid off yesterday from the best job i can ever ask for, along with 17 other people in the engineering firm i work at.  there is bad news in my family too about their health now.  i feel like my world went from everything going so well to what is now just another statistic on the news.  its only been a day since my layoff but im already feeling like ive lost everythign, and nothing is helping me cope with my feelings.  i feel like i am worthless and hate my life now that i have nothing to show for myself. i dont feel like doing any harm to myself or others, i just feel like letting out my energy in another way, its all just a weird new feeling, and i really hate it. i feel like all of my good fortune with that job and my gf was just a ******* fluke and it just happened for me to get a taste of what i can have, but maybe it was since i didnt have a degree or any experience at that job, and still managed to get the job and do excellent work during my time at hire.  i feel like none of my friends really care about whats going on with me now, and therefore i feel like i have no one left for me... and im not even an old person, im still in my early 20s... does anyone think this stimulus bill is going to help out anytime this year? or am i going to have to suffer in this lonely mess for another 3-5 years until things get stable again?  if you have a similar situation going on with u, please tell me about it since i know im not the only one in this mess.

We live together and I have two kids from a previous marriage. A girl from his past that he hasn't talked to in over a year has been trying to contact him at his parents house. We live together, but his parents have given him the messages from her. He knew about this a few days ago but just told me today and I feel weird about it. When I ask questions he is very vague but he insists they were only friends...Should I be feeling jealous or strange about this or just let it go? I have no problems with him and girls...just her for some reason and don't know why...

I was suspecting my g/f was at Wal Mart hanging in the parking lot with some guys, or people... well I asked her and she says "Why would I do that? Someone you know could see me and just tell you"  "If I wanted to hang out with guys at wal mart, I would just break up with you"        It does seem to make sense because this is a small town but I dunno.

20070604174002AAep2KG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in love with my best guy friend. What should I do!?!?	So I have been very close friends with this guy for about a year now. We started off dating for the first 3 months and then we became the dreaded "friends with benefits" and that's been going on for about 3-4 months. It's actually been working out, probably because he hasn't gotten a girlfriend. I don't know if I could handle that. I still deep down always feel nervous that he may be dating other girls, but of course he would never tell me if he was. The thing is, I am totally in love with him but he still has never said it to me. He has problems getting close to someone and I doubt he has ever said "I love you" to anyone. I think he knows how much I care about him, but love has never come up. I wish I can tell him but I am concerned it's going to scare him away. I am so miserable because I know he is free to date others, but when we are together he acts like my boyfriend. I just wish I can tell him how I truly feel. Anyone have any advice for me?

20070608010044AAw3Yai	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men, how can you stand women?  #2?	This is my 2nd question on the subject.  I asked previously how do men cope with typical female tendancies like overemotionslism, crying, lack of practicalilty, and irrationality.      I got a few answeres that kind of beat around the bush.  One person said that some men are the same.  Thats true, but most aren't.  And that doesn't help me cope, so it doesn't answer the question.      One person said just be gay.  --no.   I love my girl.  And that doesn't answer the question.      One women said its undconditional love, and then insulted me.  Yes, I will love her unconditionaly, and do everything I can to make things right, but that doesn't make dealing with irrationality any easier.  Doesn't answer.      One said to just kiss her, hold her, comfort her... thats only a blanket fix and won't last through the day.  It can put a hault to the hole day.  Give the day to arguing, or give it up to pacify her.  Either way, nothing gets done.      So guys, how do you stay sane with a woman by your side?

Tenho a guarda judicial e crio minha neta como filha (ela é filha do meu filho). Ela me chama de m?e, como os meus filhos, mas sabe que é minha neta e que tem uma m?e biológica. A pedagoga do colégio onde ela estuda quer que eu a obrigue a me chamar de avó porque ela tem uma m?e biológica que a abandonou e desapareceu, mas eles alegam que ela existe e n?o é "correto" ela me chamar de m?e. Conversei com minha "neta-filha" e ela disse que n?o quer ficar sem sua única mam?e. Quem tem raz?o, a pedagoga do colégio ou minha filhinha do cora??o?

20070616183033AAq3diu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is how i'm going to ask out this girl at school, what do you think?	Here's the rundown: I see her at school(high school) all the time and we have made eye contact in the hall quite a few times, also whenever I see her in the hall I kinda get the feeling that she is looking at me.   I'm basically going to walk up to her in the hall and say: "Is it just me or do we make eye contact quite a bit" Then go from there......   Any of your comments and suggestions would  be greatly appreciated!!   Thanks in advance

I would like your suggestions on how to ask her put or maybe somethin special I could do to get her to say yes.

20070624234619AAtTBOP	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do?	I have a jealous co-worker(Sue) who talks negatively behind my back. She tries to recruit as many allies by talking bad about me and she recruited a new ally - Jen.      Jen is trying to match me up with her best friend Matt, who I suspected to be her boyfriend for months. She claims she wants to match us up cause I’m a nice person and new to the area. She also mentioned she is trying to get back with her ex and he is a jealous guy but doesn’t want her Best guy friend to be left alone. So she wants to match me up with him.       Of course I said no. Out of the blue she mentions Sue's name as a good match. She mentioned it as if she didn’t really know her. I smell a scam. Do you? What is Jen trying to do? What should I do?
