And I want to go back to my red hair, but I can't find extensions in the colour I want...so I'm starting to think about sew in extensions.      So here are my questions:      Do they last longer if you braid them or if you get them sewn in?   How much about do they cost?   When I dye my hair will they come out the same colour?   Can you notice them anymore than clip in extensions?   How much do they damage your hair?      Any other information you can possibly give I'd love to hear it, thanks!

The teeth are longer from Images 1 and 2 compared to the legit image   2. The eyes are round in both the first 2 images instead of just a line or slash compared to the legit one   3. The leg or arm closest to the mouth in the first 2 images has 3 lines/slashes as for the legit image only has 2.      Is this info accurate enough to say that this is a fake or am i just seeing things? Also is there more that i didn't see or missed?      What would you say judging from the first 2 images, would you say that this would be a fake?      *side note - this shoe was made in china (i don't know if this matters, i hope this wouldn't lead to any bias) unless you know for a fact that Lacoste shoes isn't manufactured in china.

20090222195216AAoWRQn	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Advice needed by a beautician or skin specialist?	Smack right between my eyes I have a small red bump which looks like a pimple but actually isn't.  I moisturise it but it follows the same pattern of kind of crusting over (just with dry skin, not with infection or anything) & the top comes off to reveal the little pimple thing there.  It's been happening over & over for about 3 months now & I want to know how to get rid of it.  I have no idea why it started, I think it was a skin coloured bump at first but now it's always red like a pimple.  Tired of trying to cover it up with concealer all the time & it's hard to cover up effectively.

20090222194755AAGRuLl	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do you un-tease hair?	I like to tease my hair for different styles, and it really makes a mess of my hair. I have very long hair, about down to my elbows. It's very thick and very curly, so I halready have trouble getting out knots and tangles.   To get out tangles now I just brush as much of it out as I can before I take a shower, then comb it out in the shower while I've got conditioner in my hair.   Is there a way to avoid all the troubles and pain of washing out the teased hair? Or at least a better method?

We found one we really liked and i wanted to try it again, but i can't find it. heres some of what it did that i can't find on anything else.   - you could upload your picture without joining the website.   - once you uploaded your picture they had you show them where your eyebrows, eyes, and mouth were. then they did the shape of your face. you could tweak the areas a little bit so that you could give them the exact shape(for eyeliner and such)   it then had the makeover.   we found this website using the yahoo! search thing but i can't find it again can anyone please help me.
