Ufa! é só você atrasar-se 5min que parece que tudo demora: O ?nibus demora meia hora para chegar, quando chega tá lotado, fica mais de 5min embarcando mais pessoas, roda mais lento porque está superlotado, para em todos os pontos( para lotar mais ainda) e n?o desce ninguém. é barrado por todos os semáforos... Por fim, aquele velho engarrafamento por causa da imprudência de alguns motoristas. Resultado: Chegar mais uma vez atrasado no trabaho.

I just bought a 1994 ford ranger 4.0L V6 and when I drive it for a while I notice that there is a water trickle type of noise in the dashboard by the passenger side. I cannot find any leaks anywhere, but it sounds like there should be fluid pouring out of somewhere. Like I said, I just bought it so I have no idea what problems it has or what has been replaced in the past. Also the check engine light is on. I have someone coming over tonight to check the codes to see what is wrong with that situation or could they be connected? All fluids are normal so I really have no idea.

20070414015907AAkNuP5	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Oil change damaged my car.  What are my options?	My 2001 Toyota Prius just came back from the dealership (it being a hybrid means that if you want reliable mechanical work done on it you pretty much have to deal with Toyota only) and I had a number of things that required expensive repairs.  The dealership said that at least one of the repairs, for sure, was probably due to the place that I get my oil changes at, overfilled my oil on my last change.  This resulted in oil ending up in the air intake manifold.  That set me back around $250.       I was wondering what my legal options are?  I have already paid the repairs (the biggest part being a replaced catalytic converter that was about $1800) since I had to have my car back immediately.  Am I stuck eating the bill and just avoiding this oil change place (and all the other 10 minute lube job stands)?      What do you all think?

I was riding down the trail and came up on another snowmobile going slower. I followed him, both of us on the right side of the trail,  for about 2-blocks when he pulled over to the far left side of the trail,then almost came to a complete stop. I thought he was letting me by.  I proceeded on the right side of the trail at about 10 mph to go by him. Then he made a 90-degree right hand turn through the brush and then I T-boned him at about 5-mph. When I asked him why he did that he said I did not think anyone was behind me. It cracked his belly pan and bent my left ski and control arm to the cost of $353.48 to fix my sled. Was he at fault to make a hard right from the far left side of the trail? Or is there a % of me/him at fault. Or am I at fault here. we both exchange names , addresses and phone numbers and I would like to farther pursue this matter.  Any Legal answers would be Greatly appreciated! .............Thank You.     p.s we both have $500 deductible on our insurance.

20090225005022AA2DrNw	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	I have been ripped off with car payments!?	Ok so i was offered a really good deal with a new car i am due to pick up today.  i needed ￡4000 cash back to pay off my existing loan (which they gave me) and a shiny new car.  i was offered this a while back and i wasn't sure then so i didn't take it but now i was.  i told the sales guy i couldn't really pay much more than ￡170 a month so we started dealing.  eventually we got to the Point where he said ￡45 per week and i quote "that's only ￡10 more a month" than the ￡170 i wanted to pay.  not bad i thought so i took it.  we arrange the paperwork etch i was the finance guy and everything was good.     i have since realised that the ￡45.16 a week actually work out at about ￡195 a month so i feel a bit ripped off and misinformed.  i'm not very good at arguing and i really want the car and cash back as it clears off the debit i owe my mum for my existing loan.  i can afford the 195 but don't really want to pay that much and i'm scared to challenge the guy now.  any advice??      thanks   Nic

20090225005659AAkFOuH	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	Did I add the antifreeze correctly to my 2002 Chevy Tracker 2.5 liter engine.?	I was driving home form work tonight in the country and saw my temperature gauge on my 2002 chevy tracker 2.5 liter engine rise and rise up to the red. I stopped checked the antifreeze level and the plastic container that holds it was empty. So, I added a little water into the plastic holder to get me to where I can buy some antifreeze. The temp gauge went back to normal but when I got into town, it started to go back up. Then suddenly as it was raising closer to the red it suddenly dropped back to normal. Then I bought some 50/50 antifreeze /water and filled the plastic part up to the full mark. Is that all I have to do to fill it up? Or is there someplace else you have to fill it up? After I filled it with antifreeze I drove around for about 10 minutes and when I stopped and put it in park and let it idle it started going back up again. I looked underneath and I know I have an antifreeze leak somewhere. But if it's filled with antifreeze, shouldn't it control the temperature? Please help!

The modifications are as listed + more      Rb26dett GT-R BNCR33 powered, Rear wheel drive   Twin turbo: 2 x Steve Merch Hybrid turbos   Massive Trust oil sump with breathers   Heltec E6k ECU   Racing clutch: Carbon fiber cavalier weave   Tial 50mm Blow off valve   100 x 600 intercooler   Greedy turbo manifold   Full 3 inch exhaust system   Carbon fiber mirrors (comes with factory mirrors as well)   Running on A symmetrical Micholen pilot sport tires 235 35 19      Engine has just had a fresh rebuild, New Rings, pistons, Trust steel head gasket, big end and mains bearings. Trickytune have given it a run in tune; will need to have a retune after another 500kms of driving.         The chassis has done 38,000km, and the engine is a fresh rebuild due to pre detination. Can anyone give me a little more insight into pre detination, and if this new engine is sweet?, ill give quotes from the owner.      "the car dont have any faults, gearbox is great"      Q: why has the engine been rebuilt when its only done 38,000kms?   A: Pre detination, it damaged number five piston       Q: do you have receipts for rebuilt?    A: Hi i have receipts yes, car will be sold to top bidder.      Q: so has the problem been fixed.. so it will not happen again? any reason it shouldnt pass a wof? who did the convertion to RWD?   A:Hello yes problem has been fixed, the ECU was not set right which caused the detination. Thier should be nothing to stop it getting a WOF it flew through last time. conversion was done by Mark Skully at Beyond Motorworks.      I have spoken to the owner. His reserve for the car was $1 on an auction site, and he was hoping to get more than 20k (NZD) for the car. Unfortunately for him the car auction closed at $12750.00. I lost the auction, but have called him and offered him 15 grand cash. he is getting in touch with the auction site to make sure he is able to do this. I will have a vehicle assessment done on the car before i buy it. Is there any reason for this car to not be in fine working order?      Seller is selling as needs cash for financial problems with mortgage.
20090203141322AApXBT8	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Should I get a Mazda rx8?	I got into a car accident (tree falling on my car during a storm) a few months ago and now I'm without a car. I've been looking but I'm picky about which cars I want. I was looking into getting a Rx8, but they are a bit expenisve on my pay grade but I don't mind as long as they are reliable cars and don't break down. So my question is do Rx8 have expensive maintence/repairs or are they for the most part a sturdy car? By the way I live in Arizona, and I've heard about problems with it in the cold but I don't think that would affect me here, but wondering about if there are heat problems? Thank you

20090224222315AA94Gur	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;GMC	GMC 3500 Duramax P0374 Code Problem?	Hi,    I have a '05 GMC 3500 with the Duramax Diesel. I love the truck, between the diesel motor, the allison, and all the luxuries of the GMC pickup, that truck is hard to beat. Anyway, reason I have a question is about a week ago, I was pulling my gooseneck and the tachometer started going hay-wire, I finally got the truck to a stop and a few seconds after I got stopped, it died, I managed to get it started again, it ran for a few minutes, check engine light came on, and died again. It started once again, when I pressed the throttle it reved up and started to sound like it was mis-firing. The truck wouldn't move under it's own power. I got it towed to a mechanics shop and it showed two DTC codes. The one I don't remember, but it was fixed with replacing the camshaft position sensor, however the second one was P0374 "Timing Reference High Resolution Signal 'A' No Pulse" which was thought to be fixed by replacing the crankshaft position sensor. However when the truck broke down in the first place, the on dash data screen said "battery not charging". Well the crank sensor was replaced today, and the truck will fire up, but will die soon after, does anyone know what's going on, or at least point me to the right direction to get my truck fixed? Anything will help because once the crank sensor didn't fix it, I am kind of lost as where to go next.

If you need to check the car here are the details you need :   VRM: FS54SLK   VIN/Chassis/No WDB1714422F043156   Due to the fact that i am located outside UK and we can not deal in person,i`ve contacted Yahoo regarding this issue and they told me that they could offer to me a program that is created especially for international transactions that protects both of us.They agreed to supervise this deal.   You will send the funds to Yahoo and they will keep the money until you receive the vehicle and test it.In this way both buyer and seller are 100% covered during the steps of this transaction.They will hold and insure your money until receipt of the car in good condition. That is how their service is working. As far as the seller concerns, i will be glad to know that Yahoo is in possession of the funds during the delivery period.   You will be given a 15 days inspection period from the day you receive the car at home( i will ship it to your address insured for full value to you ).    If you decide to keep the car, then you will have to authorize Yahoo to release the funds to me, and the transaction is complete.If the vehicle is not as described ( perfect interior,exterior,mechanical condition ), you will be able to send the vehicle back through the same shipping company ( return postage at my expense ), and ask Yahoo to return the money to you.   If you wish to purchase it and agree to these terms i will need you to provide your full name and address. I will then notify Yahoo and they will contact you to explain the entire procedure.

20090225021109AAYkAro	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Which economical car would you recommend for a small family?	Im about to take my driving test and i'm now swamped with the choice of which car to buy.  Im female, 30, engaged and we have a young child with a baby on the way.  I have a budget so im looking for something old/used but reliable and economical (obivously something cheap to insure with me being a first time driver)  I will be using the car mainly for leisure at weekends, and rather than just getting from a-z I intend to use it for short and long road trips. so something than has good sustain on motorways, etc,      Im pretty clueless when it comes to the technical side of cars , some tips on a good make/model would be much appreciated.      thanks!

I also had the lifters replaced around the same time. I had the oil pan replaced around the same time also. I had the started replaced around the same time. I had the timing chain and sprocket gear replaced. I had the ta-pa pan gaskets replaced. I had the intake gaskets replaced. I had the cap and rotor replaced. I had the spark plugs and wires replaced. I had the oil filter replaced. I also would like to know why my truck is burning oil it is not leaking what so ever. Could it be that the gage is off to but who knows right!

20090225023418AAxeqlR	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	What CAR is best for driving in winter?	I live in Michigan (we get some pretty wicked winters up here) and I am literally deathly afraid to drive in the winter time (mainly due to a car accident I was in on Christmas eve that killed two of my family members when I was a kid.)      I currently have a 1990 Dodge grand caravan and I hate it.  the center of gravity is too high.  I would really feel safest in a car, something lower to the ground.  I am purchasing a new car in the next few months (new to me is 2000-2008 model) and I am curious to know which cars are "safest" for icy roads.        I know that the most important thing is tires, and believe me I am planning on getting winter tires, so please don't mention them.  I am only looking for best winter car make/model.   Thank you in advance for any input.
