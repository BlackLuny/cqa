v8TWvtQgaa	I like how that 1 guy thinks you have to have a set speed like 180 mph to be top end.  I guess NO OEM cars had any top end then. <br>  <br>  Low end, mid range, and top end can be and is diff speeds for every combo. <br>  <br>  In gen when talking street/strip type cars. <br>  <br>  Low end is norm idle to about 3000 rpm <br>  Mid range is 3000-5000 rpm <br>  And top end is 5000- up to your redline <br>  <br>  Low end power means it makes power at lower engine speeds, and gets you going from a stop faster. <br>  <br>  Top end power is in the higher rpm range of your engine|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	low end torque/hp means you develop all your power under 4000 rpm's. Top end means the engine comes alive at 3500 rpm and pulls all the way up to and above 7000 rpm.|`|56l26dvCaa	Sax, low end means QUICK,100 mph in 9-10 sec. but that is as fast as it will go and top end means FAST ( Like 180+ mph) but not very quick off the line. Won a lot of bets street racing guys a mile and a half and back than I did a 1/4 mi. Plus the 'gut " factor,Can ya stay with me?. Diff was a mid to high range cam along with a 3:08  rearend verses a low to mid range cam with someone runing a 4:11 or 4:56 rearend|`|8AQw9xqBaa	Low end is what you want for typical street driving and towing engines.  High is what you use for special race type applications.

91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	I, too, have seen it used successfully as a "get you home" measure. It'll be absolutely useless of course for any cut, slash or other substantial damage. As already said, I'd hunt the scrapyards for a serviceable spare.  It may not be pretty but you could always wrap it up in plastic or something.<br>  <br>  Car manufacturers call it an advance in car design. What they actually mean is that they do not have to allow for a spare in the design, nor provide one, at great saving to themselves . . .|`|v6NdNE4xaa	yes they can work not all the time though wont work if theirs any damage too the sidewall or a cut in the tyre its advisable too go buy a spare either a space saver or go down too your local breakers and get a wheel and the carrier for underneath the car last thing you want too be is stuck on the motorway with a puncture and the sealent doesnt work standerd tow of the motorway is ￡150 if you dont have breakdown cover (aa wont attend a car without a serviceable spare)|`|AA10283947	These are only meant to be a temp repair to get you home, if repairing a tyre on the front wheel then I would advise you swap to a rear wheel rather than trust a repair on the front and keep to the lowest safe speed for the road you are using.<br>  They work okay on caravans as well but again don't rely on them, change  ASAP.<br>  P.S caravans can have an anti puncture devise called a Tyron which keeps the van straight in event of a puncture also reduces insurance costs.|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Occasionally it works but i wouldn't count on it 100%. Plus tyre places hate this stuff. If you had a simple puncture that could have been repaired cheaply they usually will not do it as it involves cleaning all the crap out of the tyre to do so. So an expensive ￡80 tyre with loads of tread goes in the bin and you have the pleasure of paying for a new one.|`|x2cKYj10aa	Yes they work so long as <br>  1 The tyre is not badly cut or split.<br>  2 Any sharp object is removed before use. - It will seal around a screw or nail, but it will not last so long and you might lose air from the tyre if you have to make a longish journey on the repair.|`|5voSgc6Oaa	Yeah, i used the aerosol repair can once, it did the trick and got me home. This kind of repair is only a temporary fix and should NOT be relied on as permanent. The tyre should be repaired by a properly trained person only.|`|EUgrt04Laa	yes but it is only meant as a temporary fix until you get to the nearest garage.|`|MnTvROkmaa	yes the tyre spray works with cars and bikes

SOfbIOzUaa	Another car question again with the asker not saying where they live??<br>  <br>  Every state has it's own laws regarding motor vehicles.<br>  <br>  As far as I know all states require a vehicle to be insured before it is driven or registered. If you buy a car from a dealer, the dealer usually puts a temporary plate on it that is good for 20 or 30 days unless it is strictly a used car dealer but in most cases they would likely do the same.<br>  <br>  If you buy from a private party how did you get the car home? The former owner drove it to your house? Sometimes that happens. If that is the case you could be fined for driving an unregistered vehicle and uninsured vehicle. If you get into an accident you could be in a lot more trouble.  I can't be sure because I don't know the laws in your state or locality.<br>  <br>  If you bought it out of state [and from a dealer which you must have if it is a new car] then the temporary plate is legal for the time period stated on the paper plate or the paper work issued to you by the dealer unless your state has some rule that says out of state cars brought into your home state must be registered within 7 or 10 or 15 days [whatever]. Again, you live there I don't, what did the driver's manual say in your state when you got your license?<br>  <br>  Take the bus to school if you aren't sure. I know it's demeaning but...|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	Surely, you have insurance or the dealer wouldn't have allowed you to take it. Didn't you get a paper (temporary) tag?|`|AA10191024	No problem. If you bought from any dealer, THEY take care of reg. If you bought from a private party and have a bill of sale, and explain to the cop the situation, he will let you go, unless he stopped you for speeding.<br>  <br>  Just drive safely and there will be no reason to worry.|`|lijNJznEaa	no, you can't. you need to have number plates on the car, otherwise the cops will arrest you for it. on the upside, you have a good excuse for not being in school, with a cast iron alibi.
F32uPjAraa	Follow the fuel line from the carburetter back, and you will find the pump. You will find it just behind the fuel filter.|`|AA12261615	if its not fuel injected and a manual pump its located on the lower right side front of the engine,if its fuel injected its in the tank,you forgot to mention the year of it,good luck.|`|cddc8069d50a9c0970cf9101369f17fdaa	If its like my ranger its inside the frame area towards the front of the vehicle.Generally if you turn the key on you can hear the pump for ten seconds.
LBuzNCUvaa	Bass speakers? You have subs so i guess you mean like full range drivers type of thing. It depends on your budget of course, but the pioneer D-series TS-D1602R are great.

AA11032586	Sounds like one of several things, first Idle air control module, second, throttle position sensor, third, vacuum leak. I would start with vacuum check first. Then unplug and spray some electronic contact cleaner on both module and sensor, and where they plug into. Then reconnect everything. Sometimes some road grit or connections become loosened or minor corrosion from moisture causes bad connections. I hope this helps you.|`|9dca1dd5e42bcda99289c2be71202077aa	sounds like your idle air control valve is bad and need to be replace.<br>  <br>  you can try to clean it and run it you get a can of intake cleaner and then run your car if its wont then replace it and remove the positive battery for 5min. the reinstall.

DyEIc0K8aa	Oil filter not on correctly...hole in oil pan....oil plug loose... may be more reasons possible, but that is 3 I can think of quickly. Best find the problem and repair it while you still have an engine.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	leaking that much you better check to see if the drain plug is still on.|`|203084e5ea553346cdd3577aa2818652aa	Blown gasket on the oil pan. hole in oil pan, busted main seal, loose oil plug or oil filter, hole in oil filter. If you tell me what type of and year of car you have I might be able to narrow it down. how big is the puddle. If it is huge it happened right now. if it is small then it leaked over time and could also be a leaky valve cover gasket or oil cover. have it towed to your nearest repair shop and hope for the best. older cars tend to wear out motor mounts and the engine will actually rest on the suspension and wear a hole in the oil pan. Most of what I have mentioned can be expensive to fix. will be much more expensive if you run it without oil.|`|BsMkp3nPaa	usually the only leak that occurs while the car is off is the oil pan. if it's damaged or rusted through. check there first.|`|ece6164651e8c46ee0724690594ca683aa	Possible bad drain plug gasket...... It could be a few things.|`|bvCkplELaa	I'd take a wild guess and say a leak|`|c5b397ec058fea6d96011e72ddc7bffaaa	A lot of things could have happened. Did you have an oil change recently (like within a day or so)? The oil change shop may not have put the oil drain plug all the way back in. Did you hit something? Something could have punctured the oil pan. Did someone mess with your car? Does it have an oil cooler, an oil cooler line could have gotten ripped off. An oil galley plug could have popped out. A gasket could have developed a leak. Lots of things could have happened.<br>  <br>  I would suggest having a mechanic look at it for you, or if you feel adventurous, look underneath the car yourself and try to determine where the leak began. There's really too many different things that could have happened to point any particular thing out, especially with the limited amount of information you've given.|`|cfJmx87Saa	Well, you got a lot of good answers already.  But you can't drive your car with no oil in the sump.  If it's draining slowly, you can refill and drive to your mechanic, but if it won't hold oil you need to have the car towed.|`|sP98NDi5aa	Stripped drain plug, double gasketed oil filter, bad drain plug gasket.|`|W0kzdEtVaa	Proly got a busted seal, or the drain plug wasnt installed all the way, im guessin the seal though.|`|TRt4tWGFaa	Don't Start the MOTOR,,till more oil is put in..|`|rUk58ywKaa	scoot under there and look up.<br>  Maybe you blew an oil cooler line.

2SXnPABaaa	Because blood stained ashphalt isnt a good look lol|`|AA12103453	Well you avoid getting tickets and all the ill that comes with them. More important though is that usually there are studies that find the safest driving conditions. The rules are set at the safest conditions that the majority will follow. Let's be honest they could set stricter rules and make roads safer, but most would get really annoyed at the extent things go. So instead they try to find the strictest level that people will still follow.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	safety first.<br>  sad, but each rule or laws have been created because someone has got hurt or killed before you.|`|OblSdMaaaa	Because if you don't, you will hurt or kill the following:<br>  <br>  a) yourself<br>  b) someone else & their passengers<br>  c) pedestrians<br>  d) pets/wildlife<br>  e) all of the above<br>  <br>  Not to mention any property damages that can occur.
M79W3Ct9aa	Did you check the throttle body and/or EGR valve?  I can't remember if the older cars had them and/or the EGR valve (maybe j3phil can comment on this), but carbon buildup on these parts is pretty common.  Just needs to be cleaned with brake cleaner or something.  I'd do that before going through the trouble with the fuel pump.<br> <br> EDIT:  Man, its been a while since I've had my Saturn.  I cannot recall the location of the EGR for the older cars.  The newer S-Series I think its behind the intake manifold.  I'd suggest investing in a Chilton's or Hayne's manual for your particular Saturn, that should tell you the location.<br> <br> For the throttle body remove the air filter snorkel assembly.  Look in the metal thing it attatches to.  If its like the newer ones, there is a plate that flips up and down and inside of that can get gunked up with carbon that may lead to "bogging down" similar to what you're experiencing.  Again, these $20 manuals will be helpful here or you could borrow it from the library for free.  Removing and/or cleaning these two things is very simple and should be considered regular maintenance for a Saturn S-Series.<br> <br> Also, head over to www.saturnfans.com.  I usually asked the fellow owners on this forum whenever I had issues with my Saturn car.  I know they can help you out.|`|wukv5BHcaa	Wow, those are some weird symptoms.  You have already ruled out some of my solutions, and the only thing that I have left to suggest is the transmission, like maybe the clutch is slipping or something.  If it is the transmission and you like Saturns you might want to start saying you last words to your Saturn and start looking at getting a different Saturn.  Transmission work will cost you $2,000-$3,000.  A used SL1 only cost about $2500 right now.  You could upgrade to a different saturn  and still spend less than transmission work.<br>  <br>  If you do find out what is wrong with you Saturn, I would love to know.  I kind of specialize in them.|`|XbeHIzOLaa	Punch it in the face.

KdFXk0ajaa	You want to check the dealer's invoice (showing what they paid for the car, more or less) and negotiate from there. Not the MSRP as that is an inflated price suggested by manufacturer that I have never heard of anyone paying. I suggest going to kbb.com  edmunds.com  and blackbook.com as these are the sites many dealers use to give you your trade in value. They all have new car pricing. Edmunds has a feature called True Value Pricing. Go to those websites choose the car you are interested in with the options desired. Best advice is one you do that figure out what the maximum you are willing to spend and walk away if the dealer won't give you that price. Don't tell them about  a trade-in until after you work your best deal to get the true trade in value they are offering. Go near the end of the month as the cars have been sitting longest (they start to cost dealerships money then). Also go about an hour before the place closes as they are more willing to cut a deal to sell you a car. Ignore the "I have to run it by my manager" nonsense as they know how much the dealership has into the car and what price they can sell it for .. bottom line.|`|KKE3lr0Iaa	I have to agree with the sarge, do not pay sticker! a good thing to keep in mind is you can walk away anytime before you sign & you control the negotiation not the salesman! be ready to walk!<br>   The best tactic I like is to go on the worst miserable rainy crummy day that you can.<br>  The best way to get the options you want is search the dealers inventory, find one with your options & start dealing. It is on their floor plan and costing them money while it is setting on their lot, and as I said, be ready to walk|`|Tg5PxDnBaa	Sarge is 95% correct-finding the car you want is paramount. Know what the dealer paid for the car is also important, the most important thing to have is the knowledge  that you are going to a *store*. You do research on the TV, stereo and fridge, do it on your car! the person you work with in buying the car is just as important. Would you buy a tv from a guy that seems slimy? Find an honest salesman( they are not really that rare), show him/her some respect(it will be returned in spades) and you may get some insider scoop! I have told customers to wait( sometimes to the detriment of my wallet) because i knew of upcoming deals on the car they wanted. but I wanted a client for life! <br>  as far as paying  MSRP.... some cars *don't * get discounted- period . Just try to get a deal on a Corvette or Honda Fit!!!|`|AA11451786	find the car you want, first. to look at base price and add a few things then figuring  a price doesn't work. you may never find that exact car, so find the car first. then work with the salesman to try to get a payment you can live with
bMW1u8DSaa	There are a lot of jobs you can do at about 15 years of age. To name a few: Waitress, Bus Girl, McDonalds, Stocker at a small Grocery Store, pretty much any small fast food restaurant.<br>  <br>  I guess my biggest tip would be to look for small local family owned businesses, typically they hire teenagers more often than larger corporations. <br>  <br>  I got my first job in June of 08. I work at a car dealership as a file clerk. <br>  <br>  Get yourself a savings account too. Deposit all your money in there. If you can, get direct deposit. The great thing about money is that if you never see it you don't miss it. Direct depositing doesn't allow you to physically get your checks, rather they go into your account automatically. It's a great way to save money.<br>  <br>  You can also do odd jobs like mowing lawns, babysitting, raking leaves, shoveling snow. Stuff like that for when you aren't working.|`|9zacWxG2aa	get a small job like a bus boy(girl) and just save every penny in the bank, you don't need some fancy luxurious car, just something that moves and isn't to repulsive fro people to ride in it.|`|MmjGvTSfaa	Cut down on unecessary expenses and SAVE UP!.|`|YTG3bCeDaa	Sell yourself!

x7yKGaEDaa	This would have a lot to do with how well its been taken care of .The 1995 tahoe 2&4 Wheel drive models have a good reputation for being a strong well built truck.The 5.7 liter (350 CID) engine used and its 4 speed auto transmission are one of the best chevy ever used.The 1995 tahoe also has a full frame that helps keep this truck going strong.One of my customers came in for some brake work last week with 305.000 miles on it.His truck still looks great sense he has taken good care of it and keep up on the normal maintenance and repairs.Best of luck.

AA10788612	For a truck I would figure 15K miles for every year of it age. <br>  So, <br>  2008 - 15,000<br>  2007 - 30,000<br>  2006 - 45,000<br>  2005 - 60,000<br>  2004 - 75,000<br>  2003 - 90,000<br>  2002 - 105,000<br>  2001 - 120,000<br>  2000 - 135,000<br>  Trucks are generally used for work & thus get driven more. Not like a car for commuting & smaller trips. Many trucks are purchased for the sole point of driving & hauling. That's it's purpose. Now this is not an accurate scale. But it's not even uncommon to find a 4 year old truck w/ 200,000 miles on it. I see it all the time on autotrader.com. But you might get lucky & find a below average mileage truck. But if you consider any truck, because they haul stuff mostly, have it inspected. Many people put too much weight in the bed & that can crack a frame or break suspension components. Be cautious if you see a good old truck with a new or freshly painted bed. They're hiding something.

ivH8tRtsaa	Good question! I prefer to do about five mph faster than the posted limit on two-lane roads and about ten to fifteen mph over the limit on the interstate. My personal reason is - I drive as fast as I think the law will allow. Just from personal experience, I believe you get a bigger tolerance on the interstate. I have passed state troopers with their radar guns aimed right at me, at speeds well in excess of the posted limit. For example, I drive  eighty to eighty-five mph in a seventy mph zone with little to no worries. Plus, getting pulled over on the interstate is almost like getting struck by lightning or winning the lottery. The odds are against it. The police just have to many speeders to choose from. Its my personal opinion that they are looking for the ninety mph plus drivers and leaving us little petty eighty-five mph drivers alone. Now, on a two-lane road the rules are a little different. Usually, on the smaller roads, you have the city, town, or community police that are just itching for some action and some revenue. Which means if you are doing thirty-six mph in a thirty mph zone, you are going to be ticketed or cited. It is another personal opinion of mine that even on the smaller roads, you can usually get away with five mph over the posted limit, but not one mph more. My motto when it comes to speed limits is, "Confident, not wreckless". Driving a couple of mph over the limit lets the officers know that you are confident, legal, and are in no fear of them. Oh well, there's my lenghty, very opinionated view of an answer to your question. Have a wonderful day. By the way, I live in the Atlanta area. These observations may not hold true everywhere.|`|AA12103453	Either they know the cops are around on the 2 lane road and are concerned(ones that go right at the speed limit) or they are IDIOTS. I tend to believe they are idiots. I tend to go around the speed limit, to 5 over, on any roads.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Most people drive at a speed they feel comfortable driving regardless of what the speed limit it. People (me included) feel safer going faster on the interstate than a narrow 2 lane road. People tend to drive slower on 2 lane roads that they don't drive down often. But for the interstate, it doesn't matter if they been on that interstate or not; most interstates are designed the same way and don't have sharp curves, so therefore people can drive 80-90 mph without a problem. But for a 2 lane road, it's easier to go slower because you have to watch out for animals and stuff. Basically, I feel safe driving fast on the interstate, but for a 2 lane road, it's common sense to me to go slower regardless of the speed limit. The speed limits on some 2 lane roads might seem too high for some drivers, especially not locals.|`|4MtR8MLpaa	Drivers perceive the four lane as safer so they drive faster. Here there are four lane divided highways with 60 mph and two lane roads with a speed limit of 70 mph. So it feels safer to drive 70 in the 60 than drive 70 in the 70 so I drive at 60-65 on the two lane roads.|`|LxosVVfuaa	Im guessing its dangerous to speed on a 2 lane road where there is traffic coming at u .

JuxxAm0Baa	The TWI (tread wear indicator) is a LEGAL limit below which the tire becomes illegal and you may expect trouble with law enforcement and insurance if subject to a check or involved in an accident.<br>  Technically, the margin of safety of tires keeps decreasing  throughout its useful life, starting from a maximum )after the running-in period, say, first 500...1000 miles) to the moment when the TWI is touching ground ... and beyond. This is conditioned by the tire's and car's design limits and, most importantly, by the driver's action.<br>  The decrease in tire safety is first experienced on wet roads, where the aquaplaning ("floating") effect takes place even at lower speeds, depending on the water layer and road surface; keep this in mind while driving.<br>  This should get even worse on snow/ice, as braking and traction depend on a rather deep tread profile.<br>  Advice #1: replacing tires as needed keeps out of trouble and can save a lot of money<br>  Advice #2: a modest new tire is way better than a fancy worn one<br>  Advice #3: if on tight budget, you may change tires one axle at a time.|`|6uOBkvXRaa	When you drive on tires that are worn you have a greater risk of having a flat tire because road hazards such as nails have a better chance of penetrating through the tire tread.

You can buy used but will most likely have to piece it together with parts from here and there like flee markets ebay and so on. you can put any thurbo on the engine the difference is in the bracket to hold it and the exhaust manifold and to big of a turbo will most likely wirn your engine into srap metal. And like chevy said you will need to do some serious mods to the engine to be able to hold together.|`|v8TWvtQgaa	Ok, Theres no full turbo kits out there for these cars. Banks does make parts to do it with, but very high priced. <br>  <br>  I have done a carb'ed blow through junkyard twin turbo setup on my dad's 1982 firebird that turned out well. Total price was about $1500but no where close to show car look. Its made for perfomance with looks not being much thought. His 327 at 12 psi boost puts out right at 700 HP. <br>  <br>  Now let me say this right quick though. 3 years of use so far, and he's blown up one engine already due to detonation. He had forged pistons, 9.3:1 compression ran 10 psi boost and it pinged on 93 octane fuel even with 25* total timing. It broke the ring land off the top of his trw/speed pro forged piston, and cracked the cyl wall. <br>  <br>  Now on the rebuild, used a diff block due to cracked cyl, forged pistons, 70cc heads, compression is 7.9:1 this time. <br>  <br>  Your engine really needs to be build for boost. Forged crank, rods, pistons. Lower compression, MLS type head gaskets (we blew stock type fel pro head gaskets at 7 psi boost), better main bolts and head bolts, great fuel system (you cant get away with stock pump or small supply lines, it will go lean). You will need a boost ref'ed fuel pump, check valves on all your vac ports, larger jets/injetors. If carb you will have to mod it for blow through use. <br>  <br>  You really need an intercooler, and 3" alum pipe fom cooler to intake. <br>  <br>  If you want just a mild boost in power you can do a single T3 or T4 turbo. IMHO thats a waste of money and time though. A twin turbo set up is really easier to do in these cars and not much higher. <br>  <br>  We used 2 T3 turbos from late 70's, early 80's volvo cars <br>  <br>  You need to have fab skills, cutting tools, welder, etc to do this type of project. <br>  <br>  As far as fitting it all in the engine bay all we had to do was remove rad., cut an inch or so off the core support and reinstall rad. That moved the rad closer to bumper, keeping the turbos from hitting the rad. <br>  <br>  We used some stainless turbo headers from a seller off ebay. SSautochrome IIRC.  They are desenct headers for the money. I think we paid around $250 for them. Banks and other places wants $600, 900, 1200 bucks for the turbo headers. <br>  <br>  Now I'm sure if you search for info on ssautochrome you will see comments about them being junk, cracks easy, etc. Well with turbos, no matter what headers you use it's not if, its when will the headers crack. Turbos weigh 30-50 lbs each, hanging on the end of header, the exhaust temps are 1800*+, etc  so all brands will crack. The higher priced ones may last a few year longer before they crack though. I can say 3 years use on his car and no prob yet with them<br>  <br>  For more info, pics, and parts for this type build look on the message boards of www.thirdgen.org in the forced induction fourm.

AA10786185	First of all the coil has two sets of wound copper wire inside of it. one set of windings is inside of the other set of windings. the outer set might have 10 times more windings of wire than the inner set. the outer set has a positive and a negative lead on each end of the wire so an electrical current can flow through the outer winding if 12 volts is flowing through the outer winding and the entire coil in the outer winding is full of current then you take away the ground wire that gives the voltage no where to go except for the closest place it can find in which case it would be the inner winding. so the voltage jumps to the inner winding of the coil that has 10 times less coils in the windings so that causes the voltage to be increased by a multiple of 10 so 12 volts would now be 120 volts since the inner coil only has 1 wire on it that leads to the spark plug that is where the voltage will go. The ignition module is the part that lets the ground be switched on and off at the proper time to the outer winding of the coil and is a separate part. since the coil is the device that is considered the load device it can build up to much resistance that it causes the module to go bad meaning both parts should be changed and both parts should be tested to specs. have an ase certified tech check this for you or you could keep pumping money in the car for domino effect problems. Or just change them both. What I tell you here is basic electricity. The coils work at much different multiples for much more voltage aprox 30 to 50 thousand volts but not deadly because the amps are so low just enough to shock you silly.

O3qsmr82aa	Bruce V is right...it could be just the thermostat.  The way to check is to feel the temperature of the upper rad hose.  It should stay cool until the engine reaches around 190 degrees f, then it will heat up quickly when the thermostat opens.  If the hose gradually warms starting a minute after you start the car, then the thermostat is stuck open and is allowing coolant to flow through the radiator right away which doesn't allow the car to warm up quickly.<br>  <br>  Also, you don't have to let the car idle for 10-15 minutes to warm up.  This is hard on the engine.  The oil pump is not strong enough to pump oil all the way up into the cylinder head, and the raw fuel of the engine being in open-loop washes oil from the cylinder walls.  The best thing to do is just let the car idle for 30 seconds to build oil pressure, then drive slowly away with the temperature control set to cold and the a/c fan off.  You can turn the heat on when the temperature guage reaches about 1/4 the way up.  It doesn't take long if your cooling system is functioning properly.|`|ybezyTdSaa	If your car is blowing out hot air than your problem is in the sensor or in the gauge itself there would be no further damage that could occur from it. However for piece of mind a mechanic could fix it for you. Probably cost a few hundred tho.

M7G3MZb5aa	engine oil serves the purpose of lubricating the inner moving parts of the motor so they do not overheat, it also effectively cools some of them so they dont melt, or fuse together causeing catastophic engine failure.  If there isnt enough oil in the pan, the motor wont be able to suck it up from the pan and into the differnt parts of the engine, there are tiny passage ways that the oil is forced through by the oil pump so it can lubricate every part of the engine, if there's not enough oil, oil may not be able to lubricate everything.<br>  <br>  You check the oil level because no matter what you do, your car will burn SOME amount of oil as it seaps around the pistons, in newer cars its a very trivial amount but in older cars, or cars with high mileage, the amount can be high causing you to add quarts of oil on a  regular basis,  because it gets burned off very fast.<br>  <br>  Also, in older cars, you may have small leaks where oil seeps out of the engine.<br>  <br>  Oil is designed to not only lubricate the engine, but also protect from corrosion, and absorb harmfull chemicals that enter the engine from the fuel source, most notibly sulphur, which if not absorbed can form the presence of suphuric acid, the presence of the acid would cause damage to the iners of the engine.<br>  <br>  Oil is also designed to remain at a certain viscostiy at all times so that it can both flow, and effectively lubricate the engine.  Normaly, as temperature changes the oil would change visosity, however chemical engineers have created special molecules that do just the opposite, they flow easier in cold temps and get thicker in high temps, the presence of these additives ensure the oil is at a constant or acceptable viscocity for both starting the engine, and when it is at running temperature.<br>  <br>  Over time, heat causes the aditives to breakdown and no longer function, and the cleaning additives are consumed by absorbing contaminants in the engin oil, causing a need to replace the engine oil, typically you should replace the engine oil every 3,000 miles. (as well as the oil filter)|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	To make sure there is enough to run the engine. Oil is the life blood of the vehicle. If there's water in it (grey foam) then there is a problem. Change your oil (or have it done) every 3,000 miles. This way it will keep the dirt out of the engine.|`|PhCbCjWkaa	modern day cars have an accepted oil burn-age which will be in your handbook. obviously for lubrication you need to keep the oil within the correct parameters|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Because almost all cars burn a little bit of oil and a lot of older ones have trivial oil leaks.|`|eMc9eLBtaa	you check your oil every other day to make sure that there is oil in it.your water/antifreez also.|`|O3qsmr82aa	Having the correct oil level is very important as the oil lubricates all the moving parts inside the engine, and helps to provide cooling for the engine.<br>  <br>  If you have an older car, its a good idea to check the oil level once a week.  Also, check under the oil filler cap for signs of sludge or a white creamy substance that could be a sign of a coolant leak.  On newer cars, I still check the oil regularly, but have never had to add any or seen any signs of problems.  Change your oil and filter every 3,000 miles, (or 5,000 kms) or every 3 months nomatter what your owner's manual says.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	In a perfect world, engines would not use any oil and leaks around gaskets and seals would never happen. This is the REAL world, where oil levels drop from leaks in seals or sensors, and from the combustion process. Keep you engine clean (use a power washer) so you can see and deal with oil leaks as they occur. If you are new to cars, then believe me on this point: Use only synthetic oil when you get your oil changed. It lasts longer, protects engine seals, protects the engine and engine internals better, and prevents sludge build-up and helps to prevent oil burning from valves or piston rings. Trust me!!
hSCcrSdbaa	Many countries allow you to use your home country license while visiting.  However if you move to a different country you have to obtain a new license that typically includes testing and maybe a motorcycle class.   Also not all countries have a national drivers license system.  Many times that authority is granted to states and provinces which often have different rules for licensing.

99a913abbd4155a71bc5c42adbf880abaa	I installed the front and the rear myself with the bumpers on i have a 00 civic ex. The front is real easy but the rear is a little harder because of fitment. This is what i did... First you need to try to fit it on you can use anything to try to hold it up like for example a gallon of paint. While it is up in place drill in the screws on one side first. Then stretch the other side to get it in place then drill in the other screws. Be sure to add some more screws in the middle to reinforce it as well as the front. If not if it hits or scraps something it will no fall off or rip off...|`|XGeRMVdTaa	My bf and I installed a type-r rear lip on his civic also, and it was a bit similar to this situation.<br>  Maybe it isn't completely wrapping around because you already screwed it in on one side and it isn't able to stretch and move to get around entirely. When we did it, we screwed it in AFTER we had it on the bumper. That might help it go on easier.
cDnUkCyhaa	the Constant Depression carbs are in need of serious work or worse.. it's only running on one cylinder.<br>  It is likely that the engine is only pulling on one pot.<br>  With the engine running and wearing good gloves and using a pair of insulated pliers pull off each HT lead in turn If the engine dies when only one HT plug lead is disconnected then that is the piston that is doing the work..<br>  Honda use a "wasted" spark ignition system where both plugs fire at the same time. on each downward stroke. this helps to scavenge the exhaust in the engine and saves on components.

XLXncQu9aa	It could be because the school system is corrupt.  If the bus driver has done any of those things you have said, then the bus driver should have been fired.  Those things you have named are against the school's rules and the driver should be fired.  But apparently the school system is corrupted to the point where all of your pleas to have her fired have been ignored.  I think you need to keep in mind who it is you are notifying.  If the school system isn't corrupt, then the question is, who are you taking this issue to?  Are you talking to the principal?  If you aren't going to the right authorities then you won't get any results.  So in my mind it is either a corrupt and irresponsible administration, or you are talking to the wrong officials.  Either way the situation should be resolved, and yes the driver should be fired.<br>  <br>  But also the kids are responsible for their own actions.  Sure she isn't right for letting you do those things, but the children should be punished as well, so it goes both ways.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	You little punks are the ones not following the rules.

You should be made to walk to school for being such brats.|`|AA12339318	Why are you asking US?|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Is there a camera on the bus that can be used as proof of your allegations? When I was a child riding the bus, there was a camera at the front of the bus. What you're suggesting the bus driver is letting the kids do are just allegations and if they can't be proven, she won't be fired based on the kids word. Bus drivers have a hard job as it is to be able to drive and having around 50-75 kids screaming behind them. If the bus driver is trying to control the kids on the bus and the kids are not doing what the bus driver is telling them, that's not the bus driver's fault. But if the bus driver is letting the kids behave this way or is in any way encouraging it like you say, you're right that she should be fired. It'll probably take an accident for the school system to notice and take action. If kids are standing up or sitting on top of their seats while the bus is in motion and if the bus driver has to slam on the brakes for whatever reason, the kids that are out of their seats will "fly" to the front of the bus and probably break their bones. So, it's a dangerous situation that the bus driver doesn't realize.|`|AA12103453	Honestly you should get suspended from the bus, especially if they are fighting. Now you say well no you shouldn't YEAH you should. This is just more proof of the problem though. See the bus driver SHOULD be reporting these incidences and getting people suspended from the bus so that they will have control. As you said the bus driver doesn't care though, that doesn't make what you are doing any more right, or any less stupid. Now the big answer to your question is I'm almost surprised the parents are surprised that the parents don't understand it. Yeah you are probably not old enough to understand what happens with a job like that. In short the driver is likely being protected as part of a Union, it's really difficult to fire union workers. As in UNREASONABLY difficult at times. If you think that's bad you should be where I live. We had a City Bus Driver that they tried to fire because of bad driving, and the Union got the driver reinstated, and said driver ends up hitting someone again because they weren't following the rules. I think they killed the person, and would have been the second person they killed(killed a someone on a bicycle and hit another person as to why they were fired in the first place).|`|pZSZUhXNaa	do you have a copy of the manual?  do you know what rules that she must follow?  have you gone through training?<br>  does she get you home safely?|`|f915b96cf0e8a3afb012b1b833b05df8aa	because they can see through your dumb scam. what needs to happen is you kids need to be fired from ever riding another bus<|`|TdrgZwnoaa	This driver should be getting a medal for having to put up with this behaviour.<br>   Instead of going after the bus driver, why aren't the parents going after their kids. It is not the driver's fault that the kid's are breaking the rules and, quite frankly, the driver is a bit busy driving. If the parents where that concerned they would be on the bus doing something to help the driver manage this situation. Parents in many communities have done this.<br>  <br>   This story sounds like pure fiction engineered to get a reaction.
HFrsH9MRaa	The Michelin is a good choice. Name brands DO mean a lot. For the best information, use the "Tire Rack" web-site. They have tested nearly every available significant tire on the market, separating the chaff from the grain, so to speak. They graph the differences and make a decision easier to make. The Primacy has all around good manners and ride qualities. Your Grand Am is NOT a race car, you should try to get a good balance between comfort, longevity, and road grip. Bridgestone makes some excellent tires, as do Yokohama, Continental. Believeme, the "Tire Rack" will sort these things out for you. You can use their prices for leverage at local tire stores, too. Good Luck!!|`|B5YsTF4iaa	a 2002 pontiac grand am? One year older than mine. Honestly, get a better car, then get new tires. Get normal tires. High performance or low profile tires are for racing. They are not to look cool. They kill your ride and are expensive. Get a racing car, become a racer and then get racing tires. No wonder capitalism survives in America. They can sell anybody just about anything.|`|AHygXkmfaa	Anyone who says cheaper tires are better tires is a total idiot. Tires are the only thing holding your car to the road. I'm not one of those people who goes around saying "You get what you pay for" but with tires, that rule almost always applies. <br>  <br>  Performance tires ride as smooth or smoother than cheaper tires, and of course you are going to use the same size that came on there originally unless you plan to replace the rims as well, so low profile isn't even part of the equation. Cheap tires tend to have problems with shifting belts, out of roundness, weak sidewalls, bad traction, bad balance, etc, etc... If you buy a set of $150 apiece performance street radials, they'll be the nicest riding tires you ever had, and they often won't even require any weights to balance them.|`|efa550f6673c521a6c47e67cc5153a8eaa	I run Kuhmo Solus hp3's on my 01 grand am gt and routinely run 80-100 mph on the highway, no problems.<br>  <br>  i would run more of a touring tire, the car is governed at 115 anyway|`|eMc9eLBtaa	go to another tire place and get a couple of quotes|`|TD0MWkCSaa	waste of money... hes trying to sell u....hes a salesman|`|0K6yEQBuaa	If you an aggressive driver then I'd opt for the performance tires if your not so much a speeder then the grand touring would be better fit for you.

It is almost impossilbe to damage a Toyota engine to the point where it self destructs, except by using really cheap oil in it.

JeUvm9NIaa	NetJets fractional interests start at $425,625 (price based on 2009 deliveries and subject to change) for a 1/16 interest (the equivalent of 50 hours of annual flying time) in a Hawker 400XP. Prices vary depending on the aircraft type you choose. Finance, lease and pre-owned alternatives are also available. <br>  <br>  Acquisition Cost<br>  There is a one-time acquisition cost based on the interest size desired as a fraction of the total value of the aircraft type you purchase. At the end of your initial five-year agreement, there is no additional capital outlay required, you simply renew your management agreement for an additional 5-years at the prevailing costs, or sell back your interest at fair market value.<br>  <br>  Monthly Management Fee<br>  The monthly management fee is a fixed cost that covers indirect operating costs including pilot salaries, training, hangaring, insurance and Owner Services support.<br>  <br>  Occupied Hourly Fee<br>  The occupied hourly fee covers flight specific direct operating costs including standard fuel, maintenance, catering (for light and midsize aircraft), and landing fees. You’re charged only for occupied flight hours plus 6 minutes of taxi time (12 minutes on the BBJ) at the beginning and end of each flight.<br>  <br>  Other Fees<br>  Includes variable fuel surcharge as applicable, international fees for travel outside the U.S., taxes and insurance. <br>  <br>  A GV would be much higher, depending on the contract you want to sign, and the number of hours you plan on using it.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	Why don't you call them? Of course, there is a possibility that someone here might know, one never can tell who's lurking about.|`|dWLgwb3baa	There are a lot more variables than just signing "a contract".  Netjets sells shares in airplanes - as little as 1/16 of a share, which entitles you to 50 hours per year (1/8 share is 100 hours/year, 1/4 share is 200 hours/year, etc).  The total price will end up varying greatly.  You are actually paying for that fraction of the airplane, plus a monthly management fee, plus hourly operating expenses, plus any "passthrough" fees (landing fees, parking fees, customs fees, etc).  When you want out of the program, Netjets will buy back the residual value of your share (what's left after depreciation), less a remarketing fee.<br>  <br>  If you fly less than 50 hours per year, they offer the "Marquis Jet" prepaid card in 25 hour increments.  This is a prepaid charter, meaning you don't have to accept the risk of airplane ownership.<br>  <br>  That's a long-winded way of saying it's impossible to give you a fixed cost.  But I *can* tell you that the G-400/450 on the Marquis Jet program (less risk, but likely to be a higher cost) will be somewhere between $13,000 and $15,000 an hour.<br>  <br>  You'll probably have to contact Netjets yourself if you need a more detailed figure.  Good luck!
OjuC3hqHaa	All engines burn a little oil.  If the exhaust is not blue from excessive oil, then it could be normal.  As an example, 911 engines (flat 6's) typically burn a quart of oil every 1500 miles!  Totally normal, and expected.  And even between identical engines, it varies - usually because the engine break-in is slightly different for every engine.<br>  <br>  The only reason to care (beyond the nuisance of having to keep topping off the oil), is if you are losing power.<br>  <br>  If you wanna find out for sure if you are burning it, pull the plugs.  Normal plugs are grayish/brown and look dry.  If it looks wet and black, the amount you are burning is excessive.

2VVU7gNfaa	Depends on what you like to drive.  If you like driving a manual you probably won't like a CVT very much.  If you like an automatic you'll think the CVT is much better than the manual.  <br>  <br>  If you're talking in terms of performance then the CVT should theoretically be a little faster in terms of acceleration once under way because it can keep the engine at its power peak longer than a manual (because the CVT can keep varying gear ratio to keep the engine spinning at peak power RPM).  The manual can generally be launched a little harder though (since you can drop the clutch from a stop at higher RPM in the manual - something you can't do in the CVT) so the manual will probably be roughly as fast in a timed 0-60mph or 1/4 mi run due to the harder launch.|`|O3qsmr82aa	Make sure you test drive a car with a cvt to see what you think about it.

HFrsH9MRaa	The idea is not to have a "hotter" spark, but a more complete burn. An MSD ignition stands for multiple spark discharge. In other words, instead of just sparking the plug once on the power stroke, it fires many times. In theory, this should burn the fuel more completely. A magneto is just an ignition that uses no points. Usually it fires from sensors instead of from a so-called distributor. What kind of car are we talking about here????? Most modern cars have a high voltage spark and a disributor-less ignition and the spark is controlled by computer.

a47cAPypaa	You will need someone to help you, on the gear box you should find the clutch slave cylinder which operates normally via rod onto the clutch release arm. This slave cylinder should have near the hydraulic hose a bleed (screw) nipple, you need to attach a piece of rubber hose to the nipple with the other end of the hose submerged in brake fluid using some kind of container. You then get someone to press the clutch pedal down forcing fluid down the pipes as that person pushes down on the pedal you have to open the bleed screw with a spanner.<br>  Before that person releases the clutch pedal you have shut the screw off. Best way to achieve this is the person in the car says down and holds pedal down, the person at the bleed screw opens the screw and the closes the screw, having closed the screw he then says up.<br>  This may take quite a quite a few times to get any air out of the system.|`|ucYCE0G4aa	Ask Gordon Brown hes been bleeding us for yrs.|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	open the bleeder valve, push down the pedal, close bleeder valve. do this a couple of times but the vehicle make model and year would really help here.....

jLTDqVHsaa	Wow, what happened to the old days of looking out the window?<br>  <br>  Anyway, this is just not a job that's conducive to a do-it-yourself setup. You'd have to mount it securely (and put it somewhere that it fits, because 19" is gigantic for that small a space). On top of that, you'd have to figure out the power connections and get them exactly right, making sure they're safely mounted with NO hazards. Then, you'd have to consider what you're hooking up to this thing. After all, what good is a TV without anything hooked up to it for viewing?<br>  <br>  This seems like a big job, highly impractical, and very expensive.<br>  <br>  This is why in-car screens, like DVD players, are much smaller than 19 inches. 19" is good for a small room, but is utter overkill for a van. At that distance, everything is magnified and would look grainy.<br>  <br>  Professional installation is HIGHLY advised here if you want to try this. The other option would be to leave the TV-viewing for home and just let the kids enjoy the view out the window, listen to music, read a book, or participate in other similarly enjoyable activities when it's time for family road trips.
ivH8tRtsaa	First of all, how do you know its the vacuum? Do you hear a vacuum leak? Have you found a vacuum leak? Vacuum lines are the small diameter (1/4 inch to 3/8 inch) rubber lines that run to various places under the hood. They are easily inspected. First, you need to check the condition of the vacuum lines. They should be soft and pliable. If they are hard, stiff, or brittle, then it would be a good idea to replace them. If the lines are in good condition, find the ends of the lines where they connect to the motor or other various components. Usually, if vacuum lines are going to leak or break, this is where it will happen. Make sure the line is pushed well onto the connection. Next, flex the line at the connection and manually feel for splits or cracks in the line. Some cars have more vacuum lines than others. Some engine compartments can be mind-boggling or intimidating at first glance, while others are as simple as can be. Toyota's are usually fairly simple, while Honda's vacuum lines look they were just trying to get rid of some surplus rubber tubing. If I were you, I would give my vacuum lines a quick inspection, shouldn't take any more than ten minutes. If I didn't find any substantial problems, then I would look to what is most likely causing your problem. "SENSORS"  You can take your car to pretty much any big-chain auto-parts store and have your car diagnosed for free. They will tell you which sensors are reading out of their specified range. One sensor malfunctioning can greatly affect other sensors and the functions they perform, which results in problems such as yours. So....Check your vacuum lines, have your car diagnosed, and you should have a better understanding of the problem and what to do to correct it. Usually, replacing sensors isn't very expensive. The benefit should outweigh the cost. If you take your car to a repair shop after first educating yourself about what is wrong with your car and you are very specific as to what you need done, then you leave very little opportunity for the shop to cheat you. I hope this helps you out. Have a wonderful day!|`|AA12261615	it might ,but there may be other problems with it also,what id do is repair the hoses and then see if that helped it any and also have the computer scanned on it this might reveal other things wrong with it,good luck.|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	If it only does it in park then look at your Idle Air Control Valve, clean it and the port it goes into.

HFrsH9MRaa	Try leaving the coolant reservoir cap off. Start the engine, let it get warm, and watch. If bubbles eventually form inside the reservoir, then you have a head gasket leak. Combustion gases are leaking from the gasket directly into your cooling system. If you can drive the car with the cap off and the leak stops, then you can be pretty much be assured that the head gasket is leaking. With the cap off, there is no place for the extra pressure to get trapped. And no, the check engine light does NOT come on when this problem occurs. Also, go to a power wash, and clean out the space between the radiator and the A/C condenser. This space always collects road debris and leaves and such, and prevents proper air circulation around you radiator fins. Also, check your engine cooling fan switch and fuse. The electric fan is designed to go on from a signal from the switch. If the switch gives a bad signal, the fan will not go on at the proper time or for the proper intervals to prevent over-heating.|`|k10O80XYaa	head is cracked or warped-common on that model|`|O3qsmr82aa	Sounds like you need a new head gasket!

uL5772kCaa	If you havent bought the head unit yet, i suggest you highly stay away from Sony made things. For the head unit, you can buy either pioneer or alpine. They're both really good and user friendly. When looking at power, you do not look for the max rating (this is a marketing scam). You look for the RMS of things. You will want an amplifier's RMS to match your speaker's RMS. If you are just looking at front speakers, then a 2 channel will do.<br>  <br>  For the subwoofer, it all depends on how loud u want it to be and are willing to spend. You can buy a nice budget subwoofer, put it in a custom box and get a nice to power it and it'll most likely be more than enough for you. You might wanna look for a subwoofer that can take around 500W RMS such as RE SE, Audioque SDC2.5, etc.... They will sound nice while not taking a lot of power from your electrical.<br>  <br>  Yes, a subwoofer can be turned off as long as the head unit is capable. Look for a headunit that has 3 sets of RCA pre outs (one for front, rear, and subwoofer). Many of the low end head units only have one set of RCA pre outs and they do not allow you to turn off JUST the subwoofer.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Umm, no im not particarly knowledgable of the head units that have usb and bluetooth. I believe most pioneer head units support bluetooth (as long as its not the cheapest), but you have to buy it separately. Im not sure on the alpines since i've only had pioneer =P<br>  <br>  Yes, 3 RCAs is enough for 2x front, 2x rear, and subwoofer. If you dont want to amp your rear speakers, you can be fine with 2 RCAs, and just plug in the rear speakers to your head unit.<br>  <br>  Go to www.caraudio.com/forum to learn more.

Maybe someone out there has heard of this odd situation , but not me|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	It will be either worn piston rings or worn valve guides/seals.

Any number of cylinder head or engine block issues can combine to result in oil entering the combustion chamber(s). Is this isolated to one cylinder, or are all the plugs fouled? What is your oil consumption? Have you popped off the valve covers and performed a visual inspection? I'm hesitant to tell you "Hey, no sweat, just buy more oil" without a little more info. Now, generally speaking, I would say you just need to go through and rebuild your heads pretty soon, but I have no idea about the history (Who did what and when to it) of your 35 year old SBC engine.|`|O3qsmr82aa	Any oil thats leaking into the top of the cylinder is caused by worn valve seals/guides in the cylinder head.  If there is a little blue smoke coming from the tailpipe right after you start the engine, then the smoke goes away, its the valve seals.  If there's blue smoke coming from the tailpipe all the time when you're driving then its worn piston rings.  Neither scenario will cause any engine damage.  It will just foul the spark plugs.|`|431f4f4660d05d452f7ab879b9cd3dcfaa	Bad valve guide seals would be my first guess.

If you do, use only synthetic oil in the future.|`|AA10331789	Typically not a big repair cost. The older GM engines usually had leaking valve cover problems. Ask for new high performance valve cover gaskets used for racing engines. You can also replace your valve covers with new covers to help seal the gaskets better. This assumes an external oil leak onto the spark plugs. If it's an internal cylinder leak, use standard inexpensive spark plugs and change them every 10,000 miles and you may not need to fix the internal oil leak problems.

AA11264416	well don't expect just a replacement stock filter to do that, what you'll need is the actual K&N air intake kit, but its not going to save that much gas i don't think, people get an air intake kit for performance not better fuel mileage, i have the K&N air intake kit on my truck and i can't really tell the difference in mileage, can only tell a difference in better acceleration|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	The stock air intake is the most efficient in terms of fuel economy.  Aftermarket air intakes are designed to increase peak horsepower, usually at the expense of the mid-range where people do most of their driving.<br>  <br>  Anyone who seriously believes using a different air filter will increase fuel mileage by 15-20% come see me, I've got some ocean front property in Montana you might be interested in.<br>  <br>  It is simply not possible.  <br>  <br>  If you want to increase fuel mileage there is nothing you can buy that is going to make any real difference.  Just ask the EPA who have tested over 120 supposed mileage boosting products and found that none of them work.  The secret is in your right foot and in between your ears.  Careful driving habits do more than anything else to improve fuel economy.

They should come off.|`|256891400379bbbbbce12396d37ae520aa	your car is fairly new i would see or call my dealer and garage in your case as not to damage any thing on the tire,s.|`|C5KMQkcvaa	Best thing is to read your owners manuel, it will tell you step by step. Also, since your vehicle is new it may be equipped w/ nitrogen which only servicable by a tire shop or your dealer.

XgpuXjwtaa	If the other insurance company can complete their investigation in a timely manner, it should take less than two weeks.  If their insured does not cooperate, it could drag out for some time.  They will not settle until they have an opportunity to complete a full liability investigation.   <br>  <br>  However, you should consider filing a claim under your own collision coverage.  Your insurance company will pay you less your deductible, and then subrogate to recover what they pay out and your deductible. <br>  <br>  If the other party accepts liability, they will reimburse you for rental.|`|j3f8m6REaa	A lot depends on the company. Insurance giants like State Farm and Progressive have their own army of claims adjusters, appraisers and investigators and can usually settle a claim that doesn't involve serious injuries or lawyers within a few days. Smaller companies that have to sublet the claims portion of their business can take weeks.
ojxfzv7Faa	No|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	no, just the opposite.|`|AA12261615	nope,they decrease it they force more air through the engine and cause it use more gas,but they also increase horsepower on it also,good luck.|`|fPLv0QrSaa	The idea behind a supercharger is to increase the power of an engine with a small increase in weight. Adding a supercharger to an engine lowers the gas mileage when compared to the engine alone. Ideally it would get better gas mileage than a larger engine with the same amount of power. For example, a V6 might be 200hp and get 20/30mpg. A supercharged V6 might be 250hp and get 17/27mpg. A 250hp V8 might get 13/20 mpg. I haven't seen too many cars that offer a supercharged V6 or a V8 but in that scenario, the V6 would probably get better gas mileage than the V8. Something to consider now though is that many vehicles are now offering V8s with variable displacement. This allows them to run as 4 cylinders at cruising speed which greatly increases the gas mileage.|`|431f4f4660d05d452f7ab879b9cd3dcfaa	No, superchargers pressurize the intake with more air, and would require more fuel to maintain the right air/fuel ratio for the car to run right.   Superchargers are meant to increase horsepower-----  More air + More fuel= More power|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	Nope
cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	take the battery terminals off the battery and clean them and the battery posts real good with a steel brush and rehook, sometimes just a minute piece of dirt will keep it from making good contact.|`|AA12261615	check the battery connections on it when they get loose or corroded they will cause that too happen,that or a bad alternator will cause that too happen,good luck.|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	It sounds like it is your starter.<br>  <br>  If not then you may just have a short.<br>  <br>  If it were your battery - nothing electrical would run.<br>  <br>  Chevys have the most electrical shorts in their cars out of all the car manufacturers.<br>  <br>  And GMAC is going bankrupt so have fun with that...........they want $82 per hour JUST TO FIND THE SHORT.  That doesn't even cover parts and labor to actually fix it.   Total bill for a little short:<br>  <br>  $1672 - it is RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!
EmV1Kojyaa	guess it ain't that Smart...|`|6uLtp7Hbaa	u actually bought one of those things????
4lxbt5cEaa	First of all check out the dealer first, because i've heard stories of poorly made chassis from direct bike, from my motorbike instructor. Second of all check ht clause "minimal assembly" on the left hand side of the web page, as some turn up with the front wheel taken off to save on space in the box, that's if you are getting it delivered. Because of this you have to set up the wheel and brake cables soo.. it can be dodgy.<br>  <br>  Personally i'd get a peugeot, brill machines, a bit more money for a 2nd hand but direct bikes can end up not being worth the bother.<br>  <br>  Mopeds are great, loads of freedom, but see if the dealer/ seller/ whoever can derestrict it for you when you turn 17, as you'll be fed up by then of going up hills at 15mph and slow acceleration :S <br>  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do have fun and stay safe :)|`|TNXQbg4Saa	it depends if you are responsible and how well you're able to drive. <br>  <br>  i really like that bike, by the way! i want a vespa. :)|`|TPnFFBIVaa	I say go for it, great on gas, easy on enviroment. As long as the kid is wearing a helmet i don't see why not|`|zRFvk96Eaa	if you live in a town with a moderate climate it would be fantastic. A lot cheaper to maintain then a car, easier to find parking. It wouldn't really work where I grew up with 6-7 months of snow, but if you've got the weather for it I think it's a great idea.|`|mCbhjcLuaa	Heck ya, just wear a helmet and watch out for the cars because you will be hard to see.|`|1cc0530fb7fd6e139f507fa33c7d10f1aa	I would buy something like this, but from a local dealer. Avoid the Chinese machines, if you're short of cash a used bike of a reputable make (Peugeot, Piaggio etc.) would be better. If something goes wrong then you have backup and spares available.<br>  BTW, you are right, riding a 125cc would be illegal before you are 17 - even if it was restricted.|`|phQ16eJdaa	I'm a 17 year old girl, and I took my CBT test when I was 16 too.<br>  I've been using a Peugot Vivacity 50cc the whole time. Had no problems with it at all.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if I was to be 16 again, I would get a 125cc and restrict it. It's perfectly legal to restrict, and then you can derestrict it when you're 17.<br>  <br>  50cc bikes or scooters do around 32mph to 40mph.<br>  <br>  A restricted 125cc will allow you to do a little more, and legally too. Plus it saves changing bikes when you're 17.<br>  <br>  Good luck, be safe, have fun :)|`|W7IKifoEaa	Depends where your driving it and how responsible you are.|`|VoTAmfYLaa	yes.  50cc is a good start at any rate.  Good choice  and can be used thew collage to get around also.

M7G3MZb5aa	You can buy a used/rebuilt transmission, then pay somebody to swap it out, afterward, sell you old tranmission as a rebuildable one, people buy these, rebuild them and sell them.<br>  <br>  It may be cheaper than rebvuilding your own and paying sommbdy to take it out and put it in while doing it.<br>  <br>  You need to put a functioning transmission in your car regardless, and that does cost a lot of money.|`|1SnI86BIaa	take care of your car next time?|`|yzZchHHTaa	Find one in a scrapyard and take to a transmission shop and swap it out.  should save you a few bucks.

28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	How many Coils do you have in your car? how old is the car? are your coils stood up or are they laying down, if they are laying down re mount new ones so they are upright as the oil can leak from them and they will overheat. But to be honest I have not known a car with 3 coils so I am begining to think you are talking about something else. The most common cause for engine management lights to come on is the Lamda (oxygen) sensor in the exhaust manifold.|`|a47cAPypaa	Suspect the clicking noise you can hear is arcing of the electrics, which means some form insulation problem and the WD40 is dispersing the moisture.|`|W0ijrDcuaa	change your spark plug wires or wait until dark and look under hood at coils and see where its arcing at might be simplier to go to junkyard and get used coil pack for @ 45.00

DTV2V0lnaa	Your defroster would not cause the check eng. light to come on. It seems to me that there is a bad ground in the system causing an overload and getting the wiring too hot(the burning smell) Get it to a mechanic shop.

AA11073620	Bentley publishers makes good repair manuals for vws. They run about a hundred bucks new or 60ish used. I don't know if the one for mk6 is out yet but it should be soon.
mWZ9BXIdaa	Assuming you have ruled out the obvious tired plugs and leads. The usual suspect is the coolant temperature sensor located on the coolant elbow (front right side of the cylinder head). If you have a multimeter you can test it. It should be round 3000 ohms when cold and 300 when hot. About ￡10 to replace.
SOfbIOzUaa	My guess would be that if the finance company holds the title, they need a copy of the divorce papers to prove who is now liable for repayment and who is not. I would think that a new loan should be drawn up to pay off the old one. DMV should also be informed. A new title should be issued with the new owner's name. They may require signatures of both parties to do the transfer to a new title with one owner.<br>  <br>  I am only guessing. Every state may not be the same so if you don't say what state you are in, you may not get an accurate answer. You should contact the financial institution and/or DMV. I'm sure they have seen this situation over and over, again and again and would have the answers for you.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	the loan.  you are still on the loan.<br>  call them or refinance.
Rwn0svq0aa	Tarra,<br>  <br>  The world of automotive manufacturing has changed a great deal in the last 13 years. You have been spoiled by today's standards of how well your Volvo has lived up to it's service life. Their are plenty sexy automobiles to tempt you into ownership, but few that will give you the utilitarian comfort you have probably been able to take for granted to date. Volvo no longer has the reputation that you have enjoyed at the time of purchase more than a decade ago.<br>  If I were you, I would take the time to get a good measure of understanding the brand, model and year you are considering, because most, if not all car manufacturers are cutting costs to survive. <br>  To date, BMW is still whole, but they are notorious for expensive routine oil services. A BMW cannot take abuse, it must be serviced on time and thoroughly. Audi is much the same.  <br>  Perhaps what you may want to consider as a start is the power-train.  In the top tier for your purchase I would recommend the turbo-diesel car. This type of unit is better suited to providing you 20 years of service life, a million miles, superior gas mileage compared to it's gas engine counterpart and not much maintenance costs to boot. Cheers.|`|gJBqAXwtaa	Get a Volvo C30!!1<br>  I WANT ONE OF THESE !!!!<br>  it's edward cullens car (in the movie)<br>  you'll be a hit with the ladies!!<br>  <br>  or Volvo S60 (in the book)<br>  edward cullens car<br>  <br>  good luck|`|LtomN44Waa	about this 2 cars: No.<br>  I would buy a Volvo V70 2.4 TDi SE. <br>  I know that car perfectly because I had it for over 2 years and I can tell you honestly that you wont find a safer car than Volvo V70.<br>  By the way, now i have a BMW 1 SERIES and i am not entirely happy with it.<br>  P.S. if you are going to buy this Volvo V70 then buy it from year at least 2001 no older.|`|3HSNFDaJaa	I have a 2004 S40 1.9 diesel and am looking for an estate (2 kids, husband & dog!) and have been thinking about the Audi but the A4 Quattro. I will be trying out a Volvo though, never had one before this and I do like it. Would not consider BMW but also been looking at Saab.|`|9dvmMRX4aa	The Audi A3 is very nice and would probably suit you well, I would go for a BMW 328i Touring (wagon)
Yq2CUhtYaa	Hardly anything.    The gears will help you accelerate.    And you'll lose all your top speed. And highway driving will absolutely suck for you.    Unless all you care about, is what cars you can keep up with for the first 60 feet.....Hopefully you're not that stupid.    The CAI? No gains at all. You seem to have missed the part about the dyno where the advertised gains are ONLY at peak rpm.    Which means for all your normal driving? No gain at all. Unless you feel like keeping your engine at redline 100% of the time....have fun with that. See how long it lasts.    Get a performance chip if you really want to ruin the car. It will lean out your engine, which will cause it to develop knock, or detonation. And you'll actually lose acceleration, because it just shifts power to the top end, for higher numbers. But numbers don't win races.    Otherwise, you have an automatic, with 260 horsepower at the engine.    After drivetrain loss, more like 210 at the wheels. If not less.    If you want to be faster, get a faster car.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	well it will be faster and harder on the engine and tranny.it will also like more gas and you will fill up more often.why not have the dealer see what gear is in it and do some mods,like a chip,cold air intake.|`|5FPAobonaa	DOnt do it. 4.10 gears are not for driving on the street. You will experience transmission damage and very very high RPMs when you are driving.|`|AA11604724	First of all dont listen to Mr. Knowitall below...    Personally I wouldnt of bought an automatic Mustang, those transmissions suck. You can always put a shift kit in it and go with 3.73's, that is a good all around gear.    Cold air and underdrive pulleys are a minor upgrade, they help but not enough.     Just remember, your car is going to be as fast as the amount of money you put into it.

bMW1u8DSaa	The questions on the practice test aren't exactly the same, but they could be similar. Most states have many forms of the test with different questions. So no one really can tell you exactly what will be on the test. But the practice tests are good for just that, practicing. That way you have a few examples of what could be on the test. But instead of focusing on the practice tests online, focus on your road manual. That's where the questions on the test come from.<br>  <br>  I took my test here in Minnesota in June. I had a lot of situations and questions about certain laws. I also had a lot of questions on distances and numbers. I only had maybe 3 or 4 sign questions.

M7G3MZb5aa	well after learnign as much as i could about your car, i learned two things, 1 being, im never buying one, the seoncd being it has two motors.<br>  <br>  If you have the 130hp model with dohc, the spark plugs will be located directly ontop ot the engine recesses deeply between the two camshafts, they will not be visible on the side fo the engine or anywhere.<br>  <br>  Obviously you need th spark plugs, once you have them, you need to gap them, your owners manual will probibly have the spark plug gap listed, you need a gapping tool to do it, they cost like $1.99 at any tool store<br>  <br>  First you probibly have to remove some kind of plastic covering, that will expose the valve covers, it should be easy to remove, once you see the valve covers, you need to pull out the plug wires from the holed inbetween them, they will be long rubber rods that fit down into the holes and onto the spark plugs, there may be some kind of additional plastic peice protecting this area that you will have to remove to pull out the wires.<br>  <br>  Try to change the plugs on at a time and only remove and replace the wire one at a time to minimise the time the plug hole are expose to incoming falling depris.<br>  <br>  After you pull a plug wire out, you will need a spark plug socket with a rubber boot (usually a 5/8th spark plug socket, and a socket extention that is 6-8 inches.<br>  <br>  unscrew each plug and pull it out, the plug hsoudl reamin stuck in the rubber boot of the plug socket so that you can pull it up and out of the spark plug recess.<br>  <br>  take the new plug and lube it with a bit of anti seize compound, and carefully thread it into the hole being very carefull not to crosstrhead it.  tighten them to 12-15 ft/lbs<br>  <br>  reatatch the spark plug wire and repaet for each cylinder.<br>  <br>  when all cylinders are done, replace whatever you took off the car.<br>  <br>  If you have the 90hp single cam model, i coudl not speculate where the spark plugs are located, but it may be similer.

The coupe just came out maybe not even 2 years ago, so it will look new and fresh for another 4-5 at least. The coupe is probably the best looking car out there right now. Even when the 3 series is completely redesigned, the coupe is the last one to get the makeoever, which keeps it newer longer.<br>  <br>  You can even get it with all wheel drive if you need that SUV capability on a coupe.|`|W7IKifoEaa	I would get the 328i.

AA11264416	your envoy is 4 wheel drive<br>  <br>  the differences is that in all wheel drive its full time 4 wheel drive, so all 4 tires are pulling all the time 24/7, but a 4 wheel drive is when you have to manually put it in 4 wheel drive, its normally in 2 wheel drive which is the 2HI and thats for normal everyday driving and then you put it in 4HI or 4LO when you need to, like for going off roading or for driving on snow or ice, 4HI is for snow, ice and light off roading, 4LO is for heavier off roading and mudding since you have a lower gear ratio, the A4wd is Auto 4wd, when that button is pushed in its usually in 2wd but when it starts slipping it will automatically put it in 4wd but i don't recommend having it on A4wd|`|AA10877931	all wheel drive means all wheels are driving ALL the time.<br>  4WD means you can switch it from 2WD to 4WD<br>  your GMC is 4WD|`|fjb69YOKaa	A4WD means automatic 4 wheel drive. You're on two wheel drive until<br>   one of the wheel indicate excessive speed then the transfer case locks up in 4 wheel drive mode automatically via speed sensors, wheel sensors and computer.<br>  <br>  If you want 4 wheel drive then put selector in 4 HI.|`|0CkFC43raa	four wheel drive comes in two types, full time and part time. the only difference is that the full time system uses a center differential to prevent binding in the drive train. a four wheel drive vehicle splits the power equally front to rear.<br>  <br>  an all wheel drive vehicle is a full time system, and also uses a center differential to prevent drive train binding, but the difference between all wheel drive and four wheel drive is the all wheel drive system splits the engine power as needed. in other words, you might get a 60/40 split, a 50/50 split, a 90/10 split, what ever the system determines will give the best traction.

Only thing you need to understand, an air/oil cooled engine is harder on oil than a water cooled engine.

3ebd75c7592ac57d07131a5bcaa56296aa	check starter relay|`|PMRp2ZRlaa	Has anyone check the *coil pack?* (modern ignition coil). It could be bad. The noise "hums" means that your fuel pump is working. If there is no spark on any of the spark plugs, that means that the coil pack is bad. <br>  <br>  Other things to look for are:<br>  <br>   Make sure that the *batteries* are really good. Fully charged don't mean anything. I do have lots of batteries that are fully charged but they don't work at all. Best bet is really put a new one to be very sure that it is good...<br>  <br>  You mentioned that the engine hums,but that could be anything. If the *fuel pump* don't work, then the car won't start. A fuel test can be done by removing the plug at the end of the fuel rail. Note: Remove the cap, removed the fuel release valve inside the rail. (similar to a tire valve) and use a hose long enough to reach a fuel can (find a hose with the right diameter). Connect or push that hose at the end of the fuel rail and into a bucket or a fuel can. Turn master switch on. ( Ask a helper or someone that has any idea about cars). If the pump is working, it should shoot lots of fuel into the fuel can. Be very careful with the fuel. Shut the switch off and continue to find the problem if the fuel pump is good. If it doesn't work,replace the fuel pump. <br>  <br>  * Spark plug wires, spark plugs.<br>  * AIC- air idle control sensor<br>  * TPS-throttle position sensor<br>  * Cam sensor<br>  <br>  Start with the battery and work you way down with the problem listed below. Good luck.
PRx6j6YQaa	whatever car you buy have it checked out by a mechanic well worth the money|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	you deff can find a eye popping car with $8000. 8k is alot of money when your buying a car straight up. what you could do is take that money and use it for a down payment on a car worth about 16k. so basically you will be financing a car thats worth 8k instead of 16k, your monthly payments will be cheap pending on how long you finance it for. <br>  <br>  If you dont want monthly payments that you can still find eye popping cars. Hyundai Tiburon 03 or newer. Mitsubishi 3000GT. Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder(convertible). You might even be able to find a late 90's BMW M3. They are luxurious, sporty, and very very fast. 333hp stock. they are great cars. 2000 or newer mustang.

RbsRpcIyaa	You'd need to check with your local DMV. In some states, your dad loses the rights of ownership after a certain amount of time.<br>  <br>  For example... when my father passed away, we went through his car collection and found that one of them didn't have a title, nor did anyone know who the vehicle belonged to. The truck had been on our property for well over a year, so we applied for a "lost title" and got it. Months later, the owner called us wanting his truck back, but we had already sold it. I have forgotten what the time period is (6 weeks or 6 months, I think), but after that time had elapsed, it became our property. (This was in Texas, about 13 years ago.)|`|5A7RmIH6aa	go to dmv with the pink slip,and do a title search..and you might get lucky.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Call its name, and offer to buy it a drink and a pack of Betty Crocker muffin mix.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	how did this happen??

baQodlHWaa	I had a '96 Protege and it was a great car.  I had to patch the exhaust system every year since the Michigan salt kept eating away at it.  Then when I bent a rim in a pothole, I decided it was time for a new car.  The cars new owner says that he's enjoying it more than his Mustang (Mustangs in Michigan winters are not all that fun).  I'll guess that it still has plenty of life in it.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	My Protege has 140,000 miles and I drive it hard everyday and so far so good. I had it for 4 years now. I expect it to reach 300,000 miles if I don't crash it. If it dies before 200,000 miles, I would be hugely suprised.<br>  <br>  My friends older Protege has over 250,000 miles. He never had any problems with it so far.<br>  <br>  My other friend also has an older Protege. It is around 230,000 miles and so far he has not had any problems.|`|9cLykSGSaa	ask the owner if he change the timing belt<br>  <br>  if not.... kept in mind you will need about 300$ for parts and labor<br>  <br>  if anything else has a good record of maintenance you can buy the car, the monkey above sold the car because he don't give the proper maintenance the car deserves|`|PKCqLJvHaa	just sold 1 cause the parts are 2 expensive and it was constantly breaking down.

igBTDM8Waa	I still would think that it's from the gas. 1 Gallon of gas weighs about 6.5 lbs. My WRX takes 15 gals, thats 85 lbs. If you were on empty, that would be 85 lbs lighter. Eighty-Five lbs lighter could be similar to taking the hood, trunk, and a door off. If you look at how people change hoods, trunks, and body kits to light carbon fiber to go faster, this should be the same concept. <br>  <br>  Also, you said 1/4 of a tank isnt as fast as being on empty. Well, 1/4 of a 15 Gal tank still weighs about 21 lbs, which is significant because a stock hood weighs almost as much at 22 lbs.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps,<br>  JJ

54jCmmI4aa	My recommendation is to focus on quality. Here is a list of vehicles that are on AutoOnInfo.net's list of the Best of 2009 based on their reliability history over the past 10 years.<br>  <br>  The Toyota RAV4 small sport-utility vehicle, with a Composite Reliability Value of +1.00 on a scale of -1.00 to +1.00,<br>  The 4-cylinder Honda Accord, with a CRA of +.95,<br>  The Honda Civic Sedan, with a CRA of +.95,<br>  The 6-cylinder Toyota Camry sports car, with a CRA of .90,<br>  The legendary Toyota Corolla, with a CRA of .90,<br>  The Honda CR-V small sport-utility vehicle, with a CRA of +.85,<br>  The 4-cylinder Toyota Camry, with a CRA of +.80.<br>  <br>  Of these, the Toyota RAV4, the Honda Civic, and the Honda CR-V are on Consumer Reports' list of Good Bets for the Long Run, candidates for long-term ownership.<br>  <br>  For the Toyota Corolla, you can likely safely go back to the late 1980s and still count on high reliability, provided that it has not been abused. This is likely true for the Camry, although more repairs are likely. For the Hondas, I would not go back more than 12 years.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Used 2000-2002 Honda S2000.<br>  1990's Mitsubishi 3000GT<br>  2002-2005 VW GTI<br>  2003 Mazdaspeed Protege<br>  2002-2004 Nissan Sentra SE-R<br>  2004 Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart|`|c5b397ec058fea6d96011e72ddc7bffaaa	I would consider looking at a used Honda Civic, used Ford Focus, used Toyota Corolla or Camry, used Chevy Cobalt or Malibu, used Saturn Ion, Dodge Neon, etc. There's plenty of decent cars out there, and provided he doesn't need a truck or SUV or van, any of the above would make perfectly safe/reliable/fuel efficient first cars.|`|Vqqc54oNaa	Personally, I think eight grand is way to much to spend on a "1st" car.
