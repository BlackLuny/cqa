Ok as you might have figured out I recently had the sugar test done when you are pregnant. And I was above the average by 15 points.  It was non fasting so not sure if that played a part in it being slightly above average. I go next Wednesday for the 3 hour blood sugar test, which is a fasting test. 3 days prior to the test I am supposed to carb load 200 grams for the 3 days, and then fast for 12 hours the day before the test.  I understand that part.       My question is this. How can I lower my sugar without medication or insulin?       And for the carb loading what are some healthy options?         Thanks to those who take the time to answer. I hope my question was clear enough.

It wasn't gooey or anything, yeah, gross. It was yellow and probably could fill a large glass to the top, which was everything I threw up.      I called my mom and she dropped Evan off at school early so she can come over here until she had to go to physical therapy (she had neck surgery in october)      What was it? I do get real sick normally, my mom thinks it's Pneumonia because I always get pneumonia.       What do you think it was?    I ate after I threw up, about an hour later and rinsed my mouth out with mouth wash because of the horrible taste. I didn't throw up since. This is the same thing that happened last year, looks the same. Yellowish liquid.       Ideas?

20090225082904AAw8I0e	Health;Men's Health	Men do you think this is immature behavior?	Okay I have posted several questions on here about my own drinking and relationship problems.     Men, at what age did you feel like it was time to stop being a young party animal?  (meaning drinking).   My BF is 43 soon to be 44 and he still wants to drink all the time.   He is always planning huge events that involve alcohol.   ie....St. Patricks Day is coming up and he ALWAYS plans a big event to go down town and go bar hopping starting at noon.  Everyone gets trashed.  Trust me I was always right in the mix.  Lately though I am thinking I need to watch it (I am 44 will be 45 in summer).   I just don't handle it like I used to, plus I have drinking issues in the past and just don't want to go there again.  I am afraid of spiraling into alcoholism.   He refused to believe he has a problem and still wants to act like he is 25.     So Men, I guess my question is...at what age did you decide "Hey it's time to grow up and start taking care of myself."

20090227121946AA5oZCR	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Is there a disease she could possibly have? (SERIOUS! please help!!)?	My good friend from high school has been quite ill for a few months now. (she's 26) I asked this question somewhere else, and although got no good answers found out that a woman's daughter has basically EVERY SINGLE symptom listed. Her daughter started getting them when she was 11, she's now 14 and things are getting worse.      They're fairly usual symptoms, but they're causing the destruction of their lives. Enough chit chat, they are:      -TERRIBLE insomnia, up until past 4 every night, no medications or lifestyle changes help.   -Frequent spells of tremors. It's almost a hyperactive thing, except it mostly happens when they have no energy.   -Terrible nausea very often. Results in shaking and crying.   -Acid reflex.    -Often very lightheaded, frequent headaches/migraines   -Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing although there are no signs of any lung problems.   -If they don't eat they get bloated, then gassy but not gross just basically air. This is a very painful thing.   -Changes in ability of vision.   -Extreme mood fluxes, (almost like a manic depressive)   -Become very impulsive and apathetic.   -Suicidal tendencies or thoughts.         These girls are not acting out for attention. It took a lot of effort to find out these details in both cases.    I'm very very worried is there any disease they could have that we can cure for them?? I hate seeing my friend's life unravel. She can't do ANYTHING anymore, not even eat!   I know depression etc is psychological but I've heard that things like brain tumors can make you depressed.      JUST PLEASE HELP!!    Doctors say they're fine    because they hide their symptoms      but I see the pain my friend suffers. So much pain. How do I stop this??

Going to the cinemas or something like that.

When I go out I am always looking around and am conscious incase I get beat up or attacked.

I finally was able to rest by 4AM, and haven't thrown up since.      I know it can't be food poisoning, since me and my hubby ate the same thing last night and he feels fine.

As for my diet it has stayed the same, I eat very healthy all good fats, learn proteins, whole grains, fruits veggies.. etc NO JUNK period. How long will it take me to get back down to my normal weight and what should I do to intensify my results? This is so stressful because I worked so hard to lose weight and it came back due to the fact of me getting sick [I still am I have really bad digestive issues, colon, infection... ulcers etc. Well thats why I think I gained weight because it made me inactive because of the pain] I want to sky rocket my metabolism, suggestions, criticism.. everything just help me out!

Three of my upper front teeth are root canalled so they are discolored. Other teeth have fiilings. My dentist offered me to put crowns on 3 root canalled teeth, and put 3 veneers on close teeth so i have a perfect smile of 6 front upper teeth. My question is should i leave my ugly teeth and not to do anything or should  i put cosmetic crowns and veneers??? A friend of mine said: It's always better to have your own teeth and not to have dentures by 40 y.o. Please tell me what to do....

20080229183954AANmby3	Health;Diet & Fitness	Healthy food I don't know?	OK- was first diagnosed with anorexia 3 weeks ago. (I'm 13) I started going to a nutritionist and asked her what foods are healthy and not. This is what she told me:      2% milk    (how come people keep saying have 1% or skim??)      Egg yolk and white   (She says the most nutritious part is the yolk, and to have the entire egg. Why do people say only egg white?)      French Toast   (She says it has good nutrition cuz it has milk, egg, and bread all in one)      Bacon  ( good source of lipid, and protein!)      Peanutbutter  (isn't peanut butter FATTY?)      Regular Mayo and Regular Butter and Regular Salad Dressings    (she says the point of having all those things is to get the fats, and there's no point in eating them if they are no fat or low fat.)      Regular Syrup  ( she says that low cal syrup and sugar free products contain something that makes your intestines worse)      So are these healthy? Should every american eat these instead of all those fat free and crap things?

20081117105629AAXHjQI	Health;Women's Health	What can cause a 54 year old woman to have trouble completing sentences?	A woman close to me is having a lot of trouble coming up with simple words even if she is even staring right at an object.  She wants to say 'thing' and 'stuff' all of the time.  It's not like she can't remember it, she can think of the first letter and knows what it is and why she wants to use the word, but she just can't think of i unless she really concentrates for 10 seconds.  She also has trouble spelling even simple words.        There is no memory loss, but when stressed she can get emotional and flustered.        She is menopausal, but menopause isn't complete yet.  There are 3 benign cysts on her uterus.         Her doctor wants her to have a hysterectomy, but she doesn't want it because she's afraid it will change her personality.      She takes antidepressants and her doctors have switched her through a dozen medications over the last two years and she's really frustrated because nothing is helping and there are no clear answers.   Everyone says it's just menopause, but it's been going on for 3-5 years.   There is a history of Alzheimer's in the family and that's a big elephant in the room.      Good advice has been hard to come by, some doctors are recommending she pursue disability for age-related dementia,  but she still wants to work and another doctor says she wouldn't get disability for that.        It's a maddening situation and any advice any of you would have would be a big help.        Thanks in advance.

20080401123016AAcVVBH	Health;Women's Health	Do you think this little BCP mishap will cause me not to get my period today?	So I have been on Birth Control for 6 1/2 years. NEVER EVER not once have I forgotten to take a pill, except for now. This is what happened. Last Thursday and Friday night I was out with a bunch of people at the time I needed to take my pill. To be discreet when I'm around others, unless it's a boyfriend or close friend, I take my pill out while keeping it in my purse so no one knows what I'm doing. Basically on Thursday I grabbed Wednesdays and on Friday I grabbed Thursdays. Come Saturday night when I am about to take my last pill for the month, I see Friday AND Saturdays there! I of course flipped and then realized I must have missed Wed night. No clue where my mind was at! Saturday night I just took two together. Maybe that wasn't such a good idea? Today my period is supposed to come and it still hasn't. Normally it's on time to a tee. So far no period. I do feel mild cramps but nothing major. What should I expect w/ this mishap of mine? I cannot believe I did that after 6.5 years!

20080925194731AAN3TQB	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is losing weight all about keeping track of calories? What about the other things on nutrition facts?	They say the key to losing weight is just calories. Burn more than your intake and you will lose weight. So if I eat a hamburger that is 700 calories (junk food, full of fat, greasy, etc) but burn more calories than i ate at the end of the day, then i should basically lose weight still right? I am not sure how this works.      When I calculated how many calories i need to maintain weight, it said i need 2,200 calories a day to maintain weight. 1,400 to lose a lot of weight. Well it is almost the end of the day, and so far i have only eatin 530 calories. So if i ate a burger tonight and end up with 1400 calories today, wouldnt i still lose weight?      No i am not going to eat a burger btw, im going to the gym in about an hour lol. Just asking so i can make sense of this.

I've recently changed my life style to become healthy although i'm not fat as you can see from my height and weight, i believe i am unhealthy.   I've cut down a lot on sweet, crips and etc basically i don't eat that sort of food.   As aspects of exercise i run for about 40 mins everyday cardiovascular then play a 20-30 mins of basket ball of football. i'm a pretty fast runner which i jus sprint for a while every morning too.    and physically it's all good but what i've been having trouble with is my diet, i simply do not know what to eat and how it should be cooked. i have tried searching up the internet but simply can not find what i'm looking for.   i don't want to lose weight( if anything i'd like to gain some but be healthy at the same time) i'm pretty genetically mesomorphic and endomorphic.   i was wondering if anyone could give a diet plan which shows different varieties of dishes or foods which i can eat weekly and what time etc etc. Thanks very much in advance

I have just been prescribed Xenical, and I was looking for some feed back from people who have either been on it or known someone who has been on it.      Things I am mainly interested in (that I can't seem to find answers for anywhere else) are:   How much weight did you loose in the first month?   Were you slightly overweight to start off with or very overweight?   How did you manage to loose the weight, was it simply by taking the pills, adding in a little exercise or going all out at the gym 3-6 times a week?   How much did you have to cut down on your food, if you are going for a calorie controlled diet how many is good to take in a day?   If you did NOT go for a calorie controlled diet, what else did you do?      I basically would like anyone to answer any or all of these questions from personal experience (as I said, either yourself or a family member or close friend).  If you want to add in anything else important and useful I would be happy to read it.      Thanks in advance for anyone who comments !!!

I have been without insurance for 3 years, because of small details that make me unable to receive state or county health or medicaid. I know I have something wrong with my uterus. I had rapid weight gain, hair growth, striations, and weird interruptions in my monthly. I have been feeling the past 2 years like there is a fog in my head, and I cannot focus or concentrate on anything for more than a few moments. I have all of the symptoms of uteran cancer, and lately i cannot stay awake, I am having weird bleeding, harsh abdominal pain, my throat is sore constantly, and I cannot get energy. I have been anemic when I visit the ER, and have been told my thyroid is not abnormal. Every day, my stomach and head are in pain, and I am starting to feel like I cannot even think, like I am losing my ability to think and my motor functions have gone downhill, including speech. My mother and many of my family died of cancer, so this worries me, but there is nothing I can do. Does anyone know of a way to see someone if my symptoms are so bad, without insurance, or county health? Or should I just wait it out and hope for  the best, since I don't see many options?

20090307045315AA0ke8l	Health;Women's Health	I'm 17, so why am I always tired? Doctor's opinions would be great?	I've been going to bed at 9 pm the past 2-3 weeks and waking up at 6-7 am, then around 12-1 pm I suddenly get really tired and tend to get a tension headache. I can't even pay attention in school for the last 3 hours and its effecting my grades. Its my senior year and I typically go to bed anywhere from 11 pm to 2 am, except now, and I normally have energy all day.      I have lunch around 1:30 at school. A year ago my doctor said I was borderline anemic and so I ate more red meat and took a multivitamin with iron, but then I was feeling more weak, and now I'm just tired. When I get home from school I want to sleep but I have to do homework. I don't know what's wrong with me and I have a play going up march 18th that runs from 7 to about 10, and I obviously have to be awake for it and have energy.       Do you know what's wrong/have you experienced this? What should I try to do to make me not fall asleep?

I have not been very well lately and have had quite a few operations :( But when i woke up last night (my 1st night back home) i found a few things that worried me! Firstly when i was getting out of bed i noticed a mixture of blood and a funny yellow puss which i then noticed was all over my torso and was coming out of the cuts. Once i had cleaned it off they all continued to bleed and give out a puss! Also one of the cuts looks a bit open, Could a stitch have fallen out? Is this normal? should i just clean them/cover them and hope it will get better? Should i seek some medical advice? Are they infected? Is there anything else that i can do because i don't like hospitals? Did they do it right in the first place?      I am quite worried about it because the operations were quite serious so please don't leave anything stupid        Thanks

Now mind you I have never had acne, even as a teen (I am 27 now) and began having horrible breakouts with cystic acne. Regardless of my period it has not cleared up and I think it has to do with the IUD. Now I fully realize that paragard has no hormones but from my reading it appears copper can play a huge part in the formation of acne. If you have paragard what experiences have you had regarding your skin? Any changes since the IUD?

My son came home from school on Thursday feeling very tired, he went to sleep and when I went in to check on him he was burning up. His temp was 104.5.    I called his pediatrician & the nurse said to give him both advil & tylenol and put him in a cool bath for 30 minutes. This dropped his fever to 102. She said every 3 hours alternate between 400 mgs of advil and 1000 mgs of tylenol. About 5 hours after the tylenol his fever goes back up to 104.2.  I took him in to see his pediatrician, and he said my son has a viral infection and to give him Robitussin w/ codeine... this just doesn't feel right to me.  His fever is back up to 104.3.  His doctor said make sure he rests and drinks alot of water. And that every time he approaches 104 to put him in a cool bath for 30 minutes.  I can't handle seeing 104 on his thermometer! I am trying to form the next conversation I'm going to have with his doctor. I want to tell him basically, that although I respect his opinion and I'm pretty sure he's right, we're taking him to the ER just to be sure.  Does that sound reasonable? The doctor didn't think the ER was necessary.      His only other symptoms besides this fever is a cough that just started this afternoon, slight sore throat (from the coughing, I think) and a minor headache.     Does anyone have any experience with fevers like this in teenagers?

20090307010715AAjvrcl	Health;Dental	Dental Plan // Medicaid Help?	Okay so basically. I was on my moms medicaid plan, they screwed it up 3 months before i turned 18, 2 weeks before i went to the dentist. yeah. so i needed an xray, i didnt get the xray done due to not having enough money. I am about to turn 19, and I have no job. I am going to college. No job = No money. No money = Nothing(meaning i cant get nothing).   So my question is... is there a cheap, but good, dental plan for an individual in florida? OR would it be possible for me to get medicaid myself?    My teeth are pretty, erm, well.. not pretty. I DO brush them, but when I was younger, I only did sometimes. =/ (Little as in 8-10). Well I just noticed earlier tonight, I MIGHT have two (or more) cavities. Last time I went to the dentist, I didn't have any, and they said my teeth were fine, shocking to me though. I hate talking or even open my mouth because I feel like everyone is just staring at my teeth, but i know they arent (i hope)       Anyways, enough blabbering.   Dental Plan? Medicaid? Any help would be great.   No need to put your rude comments on here, as I already have a low enough self esteem because of my teeth. Yeahh.

I think she might be a borderline psychopath or something like that. Here are her "symptoms" (i don't know what to call them): analyzes murder movies and thinks that the killer is stupid because he didn't do x and y and that caused him to get caught; talks about death CONSTANTLY, researches torture methods just for the fun of it, plans the "perfect crime." Based on these "symptoms",one might conclude that she is a psychopath. However, she has a conscience, loves animals, and is the kindest person you'd ever meet. She feels complamented when you tell her that she is like a psychopath and thinks that she has an advantage because she knows that she could kill someone if she really had to. I know she isn't a full-fleged psychopath because she doesn't have any of the symptoms. (contradictory, lacking conscience, grandoise, etc.) Do you think that she could be a border-line psychopath or is she just a sucker for crime. Who knows, maybe I should recommend that she joins the FBI?

20090306191141AACb1Cd	Health;Women's Health	Birth control causing weird feelings?	In November of 2008 I began taking Reclipsen birth control. I skipped my first period (I knew for a fact I wasn't pregnant so I wasn't worried) and started the second pack. I also visited my long distance boyfriend during the second pack. We used condoms all but one time (we're faithful and its a very long term relationship). I also have taken my pills religiously and on time. I came back from the trip and a week later had a normal period.       I then began taking LoEstrin 21 FE because I needed a lower dose. Shortly after starting LoEstrin I started having weird symptoms. I was nauseous, never threw up, and had a lot of stomach pains. I was also very constipated. After about two weeks the pains went away and so has the constipation. By then, if pregnant, I would have only been two weeks, and I know that's much too early to have any pregnancy symptoms.      I started taking my reminder pills on Tuesday and never started my period. I took an EPT Digital pregnancy test and it was negative. So, this past Wednesday after no period, I started taking my pills again. My nipples are now sore, but only if pinched. Not to the touch or anything else. I'm also having weird pains in my lower abdomen. I have no nausea or any other normal pregnancy symptoms.       Am I over reacting? Is it all just side effects from the pills? I know it take around 3 months for the body to get used it the hormones. Should I wait?       I know we should have used condoms every single time. It didn't happen and I just need some guidance. Thank you so much in advance.

I am not sure if this is abnormal bleeding or if i should see a doctor. here is a record from December: The period was 10 days long with 2 days that could be compared to heavy (i described the amount to a friend and she said that is her equivalent to moderate). Then there were 23 days in between until an 11 day period started. The flow amount was the same as before (light). Then only a 9 day break and then a period that lasted 7 days but was REALLY light. then another 9 days in between and a period that has lasted 6 days so far. There was hardly anything in the beginning- like literally, a few drops came out in the morning then no more for the rest of the day. Today it was moderate-heavy. Am i bleeding too much? or is this normal because i got my period less than a year ago?
