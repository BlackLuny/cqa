20090225101224AACfZKy	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Rental agreement & evicting a roomate?	I have been living in this apt for over 3 years. I have a written rental agreement indicating the apt is rented on a month-to-month basis (which is what I wanted), however, the landlord had stipulated he wanted both names of the tenants living in the apt on the document so that both are held accountable. That was fine by me too (the other person besides me is my brother).      Here's the deal: I want to throw my brother out now. Can I do this by simply having the landlord draw up a new agreement and changing the locks or do I have to go to court to legally "evict" my brother for non-payment?

20090225101637AAmDz6p	Business & Finance;Credit	How can I make my credit score better?	When I was 18/19 I took my ability to get credit cards a little too far. I got in over my head and tried to pay them as best I could, but all I could do was minimum payments. Then my husband and I rented a house for 2 years and unfortunately, we could have bought a house with the amount we paid. So in that time I got even further into debt and I just turned 25 a couple of weeks ago. I took my tax refund this year and was able to pay off every debt I owed (aside from student loans) and now I have no more credit card payments!!! YAY!!! My question is, how do I start building my credit again. My credit isn't horrible, but its not that great either. I finally got the job I always wanted so I am making quite a bit more than I used to and we also moved into an apartment that includes utilities. So we are able to save over $1000 a month plus there is an additional income from my new job. I won't every get in deep like that again, I just want to build my credit score up again. Now that we are on our feet again, everything is paid on time, or earlier, so I know that will help a lot but what else can I do. Reason I am asking is because we are saving to buy a house, and I know given the way the economy is, that trying to get a mortgage is even harder than it was, and I just want us to start off on the right foot.       Any tips, advice, etc. would be great! Thanks!

I've screwed up a lot and have really bad credit and an crap load of student loans (over thirty thousand). I only have about 50 credits to show for it. I have started going back to school but still don't what I want to do. I was thinking of Physical Therapist Assistant but almost none of my credits would apply to it. I was thinking accountant. Mostly because I feel I would make good money and I'd really like to be able to afford a decent life for my son and myself. I worry that my credit would be a hindrance when trying to get a job as an accountant. Also that I struggle with math so I'm worried that might be a problem. Lastly, I'm not sure how secure a job as an accountant is or will be in a few years. Pleas tell me your thoughts.

Now 2 weeks later i call and i hear 10 people are already hired. Im really pissed off. I feel like hitting the wall. I've been waiting all this time. Im tired of looking for a job. I want one, i need money so i can move out and get my own place and fix my teeth. I can't even get a date without a job. Plus im unattractive but you know..money can fix it. I planning to drastically improve myself also, ive been planning to all my life, and i also want to buy something to fix my mothers teeth. I want a studio apartment, i want a car , until i get either i feel like im still a little kid at home.  Yeah i hear about the recession, then why everyone i know got a job. To be honest im tired of acting like it doesn't affect me. I want a job and i want it now.  Im sitting here crying right now and i feel like ending it but i won't.  It's like they see my application and they just throw it out, they don't even take the time to take me seriously.  They might as well just say if you don't got a GED or College degree don't apply, instead of playing with someones hope. That may be rude but i don't care, this hurts.  Until i get a job im going to be single and stuck at home playing video games, so thanks companies for thowing out my chance at starting a life for myself.

This summer I will complete a post-grad course in Quantity Surveying, a career I've been in for six years now.  Unfortunately the construction industry (I work for a main contractor) really isn't for me - far too many arguments, dirty working environments, and an industry set twenty years in the past all frustrate me more than I can express.      Wanting a change, I'm tempted to study a course in M&E (mechanical and electrical services for those of you not in construction) or construction law, both of which would move me into more of a consultative role and away from the 50+ hours spent on site I currently put up with (plus 15+ hours in the car each week).      What do people think of these career paths - are there jobs out there in law and building services?  Long term job potential, salary expectations, benefits are also obviously important.      I'm not really after a specific answer (hell, I barely have a question) so your thoughts would be gratefully received.

Well, in mid-november I received a letter congratulating me on passing the interview-and gaining a civil service job providing my security checks and references were satisfactory. I left my previous job at the end of December, as, every time I spoke to someone at HR there they would keep me updated with how my application was coming along. Every time I rang them up they would lead me to believe that the checks wouldn't take much longer. A few days ago however (end of Feb), I receive a letter explaining that unfortunately all the positions were now filled and I would be placed on a merit list for 6 months but as the recession is occuring nothing might happen. Ringing up, I was apologised to by a rather unapologetic member of HR but they said this happens. I am more annoyed about the fact that I could have gone for other jobs but I was given hope every time I rang up that the job would start soon, and I was pleased as this would be the best job I could ask for. They said that my references and checks were good. Do I have any rights here? I was dealt with in a very unprofessional way that has ultimately made me lose out on a job. Are the government allowed to shaft everyone because they have the power? I am aware of a recession happening, a 2 year old child is too, so why advertise jobs knowing you can't take the people on, don't they have economists for this sort of thing? Sorry I'm ranting now...any experiences or help would be much appreciated thanks :)

I recently decided to get a house (for rent) and i put in an application on 01/15/09 and got approved, I told the realtor that i might move in on Feb. but a week later after being approved they took the house off market. I went ahead and put a deposit down on 02/10/09 i got a receipt and everything, but on the 12th my husband broke his foot so we could not afford the house and his medical bills at the same time. we did not want to get into a bind and be late on rent the very first month we move in. So i went ahead and called our realtor and i told her that we will not be able to go with the house at the time.    Well now it is 02/27/09 and i have yet received our money back (Deposit).  on the application that i signed it stated that:      ***Once approved the future tenant has one day to bring in the holding deposit, that will take the home off market.   ***If you fail to enter into the property and/or sign the lease within 3 days of being approved you forfeit your holding deposit.      Now my question is that if i got approved but didn't turn in my deposit till almost a month later of being approved and i DID NOT sign the lease how is it possible for the owner to have any of my money into his bank account if i have not signed anything, and is it right for him to have say so of my money if nothing was signed and the house was taken off market under the realtor discretion not mine?

Miren la cosa esta así, este a?o me he decidido enrolar a las fuerzas armadas de Espa?a, (soy de mexico) y pienso en meterme al destino que pague mejor, en este caso (4° ciclo de reclutamiento) el mejor que salio es en Canarias, donde aparte del sueldo normal te dan un poco mas por el destino, y si tienes casa un poco mas y asi.      Y la cosa es que si bien en la base dan alojamiento, algun dia vas a necesitar independencia, asi que me gustaria saber precios de casas en canarias o en su defecto en Espa?a, se notara que no tengo la menor idea sobre el tema.      El dinero con el que contaria el primer a?o serian como de 15,000 euros. Ya se no es gran cosa, pero considerando que te dan la carrera y que sube cada a?o, lo hace mejor.

I had a job interview January 27th and the guy told me to call him within a few weeks and remind him of our interview. I called him February 16th I think and left a message with a girl that works there because he wasn't there. 2 nights ago my family went there (just because it has good ice cream) and I saw him and he might've recognized me, anyhoo I waved as I was leaving to be nice. The guy said he would pick employees by the end of February and it's the 25th...my mom and dad say I should call so I can talk directly to him and remind him of our interview. They said it would show him I want the job, but...   1) I will feel like a stalker for having gone their within the past few days and I'm calling yet again   2) It seems like he would've hired people already...

20090225103539AAAypG1	Business & Finance;Credit	Current middle credit score is 587.  Will paying off a tax debt increase score?	My fiance's current credit scores are 720 (Experian), 587(Transunion), and Equifax is not currently reporting anything.  Our mortgage broker is guessing that what is bringing his score down with Transunion is a tax debt in the amount of $5800.  (Experian is not reporting this debt).  He is currently on a payment plan with the IRS and has not defaulted.  If we were to pay this debt in full, approximately how much would his credit score be raised, and how quickly?  The only other debts which are bringing his score down are a Hollywood Video debt, which is from 2002, and a medical debt from 2001.  We have been advised not to pay those off since it would bring recent activity to an old account, and would bring his score down further.  He does have recent positive credit as well.
