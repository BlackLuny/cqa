20090310025920AAWER5n	Social Science;Psychology	Why is life repetitive and boring?	This sounds cliche and almost spoiled, but I am utterly bored of my life. I'm lucky to have the life I have (it's not like I don't have enough materialistic things), but I'm just so fed up. A typical day consists of waking up, going to class, being bored in class (even though I like to learn!), then going home, where I start homework. I'm envious of those people who have a LIFE! By this I don't mean wild party animals that involved themselves with drugs and alcohol, but just people who have a interesting and fascinating life.      How do you live your life to the fullest? Any advice on this?

20090310030548AAJVzab	Social Science;Psychology	Am I self conscious? selfish?	Im trying to understand myself sometimes analyst my opinions on based daily or people in my life.    Why I don't often feel sympathy for women who suffer abuse from their loves one? I sometimes feel like how stupid they don't open their eyes and they could be killed one day? I feel like that's not my problem even though she doesn't chose this for her lifestyle. I know a woman who is in abuse relationship and i often told her to pack and she kept told me that hes stressing with his job and his life. a lot of crap. I ended up told her that shes flirty with the death because she decided to be with him instead accept my help. i told her that she have 2 decision. leave him and i will help her. Be with him, our friendship will be over. she feels that im threatening her and i am not. i already explained to her over hundred times that she will die if she continues with this lifestyle. she also mentioned to me another day that if she decided to leave him he will tracked her down and beat her up. I know her boyfriend dont make good money and obviously he cant afford hit man. if i call police she will lie and threat me that i abuse her. our friendship is ruined already and thats why i dont feel sympathy anymore. can anyone help me out is that my selfish action or just trying to help??
20090310034206AAak7pI	Social Science;Psychology	Why does it seem to be harder for some people to move on?	Why do they complain, blame even someone who's already dead instead of living their lives now?      For example a son or a daughter who grew up in a  dysfunctional family.      What does one's comfort zone and familiarity with things have to do with this?      How do you help or encourage that person to move on and see the "now"?
20090310040825AAmUPqI	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Should boys and girls go to separate but equal schools?	I used to abhor the idea but now I think that they might do much better from K to 12 in gender based schools. The boys could compete against their peers and not be left behind in verbal skills right from the beginning. And the girls could concentrate on their studies, especially math and the sciences, without interruption from competitive boys.   Plus, they each could be safe from temptation on the school grounds.

Well tonight I had a dream(not let lucid)  that I was in a old jail, dungeon more like it with maybe 3 other people in it and a dog that was barking like crazy.  I was trying to escape by climbing the wall to a window but the dogs bark was so loud it was making the whole place vibrate and I thought I was going to fall so I climbed down.      I forced opened a door out of the place and for some reason I was trying to keep everyone els in the jail and just me escape.  I opened the door and trying to shut it fast but the dog squeezed through and got out.  Now the weird stuff.     I look back and the 3 people looked like zombies and were walking towards me.  I was really scared and ran for me life.  ~While I was running, the lucid part of the dream took in and ya know I was like Im going to fly away.  So I get up in the air, not very far(later in the dream I get better at flying faster and farther) , I go up in the air pretty high and come back down, I get the same feeling as on a roller coaster going down a steep slope, when Im flying down.  Is this normal?      I thought it was very weird because you cant feel anything in your dreams but when I fly I felt the gforces effect me, I could feel it in my stomach.        Has anyone els had this happen when they feel g forces when they are flying fast in dreams?

I'm becoming more and more aware of the importance of language. How expressing oneself and being able to understand others is imperial to avoid insanity. One can see this in criminals who have difficulty expressing themselves and enormous flaws in verbal and writing skills. The less efficient your communication is, the less likely you are to be socially successful and this can lead to margination, a fertile ground for dangerous thoughts to erupt.

20090309134522AANUfQV	Social Science;Psychology	I am always feeling angry/irritated, is this normal?	Alright, I know being a seventeen year old girl that I will have mood swings and PMS and all that just because of hormones. But I honestly do not think that I should be SO annoyed all the time. It isn't just recently either, I think for about a good five months I progressively wanted to hurt people. I am originally not a violent person and I have self-control to not punch people, but the urge is there and it's extremely tempting. I'm not talking just my friends, or family. Everyone. I get mad when things don't go my way, I get annoyed when there is nothing to eat in the house, I want to explode when my computer takes forever to load! It really doesn't matter how big of a issue or minor, and pointless of a situation. A good 90% of the time I am in pure agony from annoyance. Now seriously, does this sound normal to you? I cry sometimes for like absolutely no reason! But the most...annoying lol, part of this all is I told my sisters, parents, friends and boyfriend about my uncontrollable irritably and they ALL tell me "Oh it's just stress. You're a normal, hormonal teenage girl." I don't think it's normal to want to want to stab someone and yell when the last pudding cup was taken, which just previously happened. I also do not think this is healthy because I am now starting to get killer migraines, and I was never a person to get bad headaches. I sleep for a good 12 hours (when I can) and I am STILL exhausted when I use to be someone that could run on five hours of sleep just fine. I get random nausea attacks and sometimes I get so nervous I shake, which I never had before. I know this is long, but I just want to clarify what I am going through. Please, tell me anything you think!
20090309155609AACB7Yx	Social Science;Sociology	I feel like I'm turning sociopathic?	I feel like I'm becoming disconnected with the world around me, besides the circle of people I know, work with, trust.  It seems to me everyone is out there for themselves with little regard for other people, and the only reason people do anything nice for others is for some sort of contrived reason, in order to appear good, or maintain some sort of status-      -A store clerk will smile because he/she has to, Cell-phone representative will say please and thank you because they have to...and it bothers me intensely.  I almost want to stop someone in their tracks and tell them to cut the bull-shh.        No one seems sincere anymore.      These feelings of frustration magnify when I'm in a pubic area, where many people have to share the same thing...cutting me off when I'm driving, not cleaning after yourself or washing up in public bathrooms, employees withholding information to save themselves 5 minutes of work, people not putting weights back at the gym...stuff like that.      I pressure myself to excel, grow, and learn every day, mentally and physically.  But the more I learn about people and my surroundings, the more disgusted I become with the general public, and the more disassociated I feel.       Does anyone else feel this way?  Are these normal feelings?  Abnormal?

20090309161937AAw9mSr	Social Science;Sociology	I need advice from Wise, Serious, Kind Answerers please?	I met this guy at work today. First day. We were both trainees so we were in training class together all day. We had to do a meet and greet with someone in the class he and I automatically turned to each other. When we talked we automatically clicked. We had so much in common. Come lunch time, I got into the lunch room first and sat down by myself. He walked over and sat down with me. We had lunch together, talked, and found we had even more in common. We then went outside to a break area and talked. We had so much incredible chemistry and we would just look at each other and smile and giggle. It was too perfect. Then he got a text on his phone. He then said "Uhhh" and looked kinda aggravated and I said "Girlfriend?" and he said "yea". He told me they'd been together 3 months, and that they're a really lovey dovey couple, that it annoys people. I didn't understand why he would act so interested in me, making me believe he'd ask me out any second, when he had a girlfriend. But, break time was just about over so we went inside. Come to our second break, I went outside first and sat down. He talked to one group of people for a minute or two, then came over and sat down with me. He got out his phone and showed me a picture of an ultrasound. I asked him what it was, and he said his girlfriend just sent him that. I asked him if it was his, and he said that he got with her right after she broke up with her boyfriend, and that they've been together 3 months and she just recently found out she was pregnant, so they're not sure who's it is. I asked what they were gonna do, and he said he wasn't sure. The thing is, he continued to look at me that same way he did when I didn't know he had a girlfriend. He'd just look at me with those eyes like he was falling for me, and he would just stare into my eyes for about 5 seconds and smile. It was so obvious to me that we had amazing chemistry, almost like a love at first sight connection, just completely unreal unlike anything I've ever experienced. He and I talked and tomorrow we're gonna bring music we want to share with each other during break. I'm just not sure how to react to this situation, if I should still flirt, if I should say something, or what. What do you suggest. I'm at a total loss here. No clue what to do.   It's just everytime he got the oppurtunity, he'd walk next to me, sit next to me, talk to me, smile at me, stare at me, and he completely knocked me off my feet. We flirted like crazy and instantly connected. I want to say something, but don't want to cross the line.

You tell what you are by the clothes you wear   By the spirit in which your burdens you bear   By the kinds of things at which you laugh   By the records you play on your phonograph   You show what you are by the way you walk   By the subjects of which you like to talk   By the manner in which you bear defeat   By the foods you choose and the way you eat   By the books you select from the library shelf.

But, I DON’T REFER TO PERMANENT INJURIES OR ILLNESSES.      1) If u are men, have you ever experienced to cry cause a physical pain?      2) If so, which was the cause?        3) how old were you when the fact happened      4) did u break in tears like a baby (screaming etc..) or just tears?      5) did u feel humiliated to have been seen by other people?      1) Men and Women, taking the same questions…have you ever seen a grown man crying cause of physical pain?      2) If so, which was the cause?        3) how old were you when the fact happened      4) did u break in tears like a baby (screaming etc..) or just tears?      5) did u feel humiliated to have been seen by other people?

So, I had a dream on a Thursday night when I was at my friend's house.  that me and my friend (not the friend who's house i was at) were driving on the freeway, with one lane closed with no cars in it, and one lane open.  A red helicopter was trying to land.  I woke up and told both the friend who's house i was sleeping over at's house and also the friend who was in my dream.  A few nights after I had the dream, Sunday night, I was driving home with my friend that was in my dream, and there was a fatal accident.  Traffic was so conjusted that we were barely moving, but the other lane was closed. I looked out my window and saw a big red helicopter a few feet from our car, trying to land!  I didn't recall the dream at the time, but a few days later, I realized that my dream had come true, called both of my friends, and they thought it was the craziest thing ever.  What do you guys think? Was my dream trying to warn me of the fatal accident or was it just a coincidence?

Then I see Cole ( I sort of have a crush on him, and we've known each other since grade 1 from religion classes, but they ended in grade 7 and we are in grade 9 now).

My mom gets super angry and she's like ' *my name* come over here now!!'      But I couldn't because Cole wouldn't let go, and I couldnt say anything because he was still squeezing me so tight.

You were really close and bonded to this person and you'd tell each other stuffs etc. And you LOVE their company. But then as time goes by, they starts to "change" and you starts to feel they have "no time" for you and you can feel they're distancing/fading away from you, and it really is until they're too far for you to reach back and now, you're not that close nor bonded anymore like it used to.

20090309121620AAiuPoW	Social Science;Psychology	How to make emotion bond better with bf?	Me and my Bf have been dating for 4 months now. I find that our relationship is overall good. There is lots of affection and we spend almost everyday together. The sex life btw is really good. He stays with me, but has gotten himself a new place. I think thats good because incase i want my place to myself when i am upset he can go there for a few hours. I dunno if it's me or him. But i don't feel this relationship getting stronger, our emotional bond i find it not that strong and i would like for it to be. I guess i maybe sabtoage it because i feel somtimes he doesn't care about me/my feelings. He says he wants to be closer to me emotionally and i do too. Any suggestions on what i could do and we could do to make this bond better?

20090309121523AA5X6P1	Social Science;Economics	Why are people getting married and having kids in this horrible economic climate?	"Can't feed 'em, don't breed 'em". I'm 32 and single with no children. I'm just barely squeaking by as far as paying my rent, utilities, car bills, college loan interest payments and food. As hard as it is on my own, I can't even imagine what it would be like if I had a wife and kids. But I would never do that, as long as I'm not financially capable of supporting a family.       Aren't people who go and have large families fundamentally selfish creatures who only live for the moment?       It's difficult for me to feel sorry for people who get hitched and make babies when they don't have steady employment. In hard economic times like these, all weddings should be put on hold, and couples who are already married (or simply dating) should be using birth control.  It's all about quality of life. Population growth is NOT economic growth (quite the opposite, in fact). Especially in times like these.       As Americans, we're often quick to criticize others for this exact same behavior. Like Jose, the migrant Mexican agricultural worker who works in this country illegally. Jose is from Sonora and has a wife (who is unemployed and uneducated like her husband) and they have 8 kids. We kick Jose out of the country, and he goes back to Mexico and makes another baby.       Let's not act like Jose. Let's not make children we can't afford to feed or clothe or educate.
