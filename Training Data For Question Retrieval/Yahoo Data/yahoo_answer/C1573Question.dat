20090205135042AAWed5z	Travel;Australia;Other - Australia	What Do You Think of Kevin's Cash Handout?	Personally I like the idea that I will be getting $950 - but that is a purely selfish thing and I can't see how it will help the economy or Australia in general.      However, why doesn't the money go towards something like our transport systems?  It would provide more jobs for now AND for the future and would set the country up much better for the future since we have such an awful transport system at the moment.  Wouldn't that be better for Australia as a whole?      I definately agree with the new school buildings etc - I do think that is a good idea.  But what about insulation for low income earners?  Wouldn't most low income earners be renting?  Isn't that just a little pointless?  And it is just a short term gain for the insulation businesses - after a year they'll just go back to normal sales.      I'd like to hear your thoughts - whether you agree or not!

20090205140723AAoMECd	Travel;United States;New York City	Late Night with Conan O'Brien standby ticket line question, need input from New York City residents?	So I'm planning a trip to New York city (for sometime next week), and while I'm there I want to see Late Night with Conan O'Brien.  I don't have a reserved ticket so my only chance for seeing the show is getting a good spot in the standby ticket line.      So my question for all you New Yorkers is how early has the standby ticket line for Conan been forming as of late?  Typically I would think about showing up around 5 or 6 in the morning the day of the show for the line, but since this is the last couple weeks of Late Night I'm thinking people might be camping out even earlier than that.      If anyone lives in New York and has been noticing people camping out for Conan standby tickets especially early (the night before a show or very early in the morning), I would appreciate your input.  Any info would be helpful, as I'm trying to throw this trip together pretty quickly.      Thanks a lot!
