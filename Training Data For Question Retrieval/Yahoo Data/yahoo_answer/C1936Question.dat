I am getting the LG enV2 in November, when my mom's contract with T-Mobile ends so we can get Verizon. I want a prepaid phone like the GoPhone but it's AT&T. Can you please list some good prepaid phones from T-Mobile? I don't need a fancy phone like all of these other kids because I'm still in elementary (6th grade). God, I know 3rd graders with fancy phones. What is happening to this world?       Anyway, I don't need a fancy phone until August when I enter middle school, but I won't have a cell in August, September, or October. That is why I want a prepaid T-Mobile phone but I don't know if they have any.      My mom has nothing against me getting a cell. She thinks I'm responsible and mature, and I've had straight A's all year so far. It's just that the money is an issue, and she won't even let me get a pre-paid phone.      My mom just got me a iPod Touch for Christmas because of my good grades and they cut hours at Dillard's so she only works every other day and when she does work, she works from 9:45 - 3:30 instead of 9:00 - 3:30, so her income is dropping!

But I wasn't surprised, because I had picked it up and moved it around a bunch of times. But I got a replacement sent to me. I put that down, and never moved it a single centimeter and only removed the hard drive once, a couple weeks ago. About 3 weeks ago, I got the 'red rings of death', but it was only in the part of the ring where the thirdplayer spot is. But then i saw that the hard drive wasn't in all the way. So i corrected that, and it worked fine after that. But today, I turned my Xbox on for 1 hour. Then i turned it off for dinner. I came back up 2 hours later and turned it on. There was no spinning ring, just the red ring. It was everywhere except the secondplayer spot. I don't know what is wrong!!! PLEASE HELP ME!! Oh yeah and i checked all the cords and the hard drive... again... PLEASE HELP!!!
20090205163801AAGyubz	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Anybody ever have a problem with their Motorola Razr?	I've had mine since May 2007. Yesterday it started to act abnormally. I turned it off so I could charge it. I plug the charger into the wall first and then into the phone so the phone stays off. Later I go to check its status only to find the little screen lit up but nothing on it so I open it and when I do so it starts to boot. Now it won't stay on for more then 10-15 minutes. If I catch it turning off and have the phone open it will just reboot after going to some blue Motorola screen with a 3 word message at the bottom which is "something reboot init."       Has anybody ever had an experience like this and if they did how they solved it?

20090205171429AAPc2VR	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	Slow dial-up connection?	Before you say dial-up is slow by nature, please read.  I'm using dial-up because my cable-internet just went out so don't say I should upgrade.      Here's the issue -- its an old house and I knew there were problems with dial-up not working before, but that was due to a rotary phone on the line.  Now, there is no rotary phone and I still can't make it work worth anything.  I used to get 28K here fairly reliable.      After several tries, I'm connected at 7Kbps.  It went up to 16Kbps for a moment but dropped out, several other tries it wouldn't connect or would connect at 14Kbps and drop out.      Don't believe me?  Look for yourself:    http://members.cox.net/millermmail_web1/...       I'm dialing to FreeDialup.org, which is long-distance for me but I've done long-distance dialup before and had solid connections in the 28-33Kbps range, occationally up to 48Kbps so I don't think that's the problem.      Help?  I've become rather good at diagnosing data network issues but my experience with dialup is limited to all-or-nothing problems -- wrong number, shorted phone-line, and a pulled out plug...I'm not used to "troubleshooting" bad or intermitant POTS.            What should I look for?  What can I do?      It's cold, dark, and snowy right now so I can't check if it works better at the Telco junction box coming into our house, but I'll see what that does when I have a chance tomorrow or the next day.

20090205161932AA2XFvd	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Will this internet problem affect Xbox Live?	I have comcast cable internet in my house. The problem is, every once in a while the internet will stop working for a moment. Usually it only lasts  between like 5-20 seconds, but occasionally it will go for a bit longer. I've talked to Comcast several times and they do nothing and never really tell me what's wrong. Sometimes it won't happen all day, but other times it can happen 5-6 times in an hour. It's not a big deal while I'm on the internet (I just wait a few seconds and it eventually starts working again), but how will this affect Xbox Live? I play on using my laptop with an ethernet cable instead of spending 100 bucks on the wireless adapter. What will happen when this happens while I'm connected to Xbox Live? I don't want to spend the money if this is going to kick me off or something every time it happens.

20090205175611AAu51R6	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Can someone name this  playstation 1 game? It had  mechs and...more in  description?	It was a 3rd person fps, you were a mech walker and built tanks and turrets to defend your base, the tanks would move on a preset path to your opponents base depending on which gates you have open.  you can also build planes and super-planes/tanks. i remember the tank was called a juggernaut.  It was on the playstation 1 console, POSSIBLY n64 but i dont think so.  it had something to do with police in the future...thanks

Ok so i signed up for new service a few days ago, i wanted to upgrade to an HDDVR but it was too damn expensive in fact so was a regular HD box. I had no choice to go with a regular receiver, now my question is about programming. If a program is broadcast in HD let's say like a network pritime program i don't know heroes or lost. Does that require you to have an HD box?. I mean the program is being broadcast in HD meaning so you wouldn't need a HD receiver to watch it in HD, right?,. a regular reciever would be ok to watch on your HDTV if the program is being broadcast in HD?.

20090205180838AA40qb2	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Please help, my ipod touch has water damage.?	I dropped my ipod touch in the sink today with the water running.  It worked for like 15 minutes so i thought nothing was wrong.  Then the speaker started acting funny.  It said that the headphones were plugged in but they werent so i couldnt listen to my game without headphones.  Then the whenever i pressed sleep/wake, it thought i was changing the volume.  UGHH! So then I tried holding down sleep/wake and home and restarting it.  It worked, but the touch screen wouldn't work then.  Then i turned it off.  then i tried to turn it on and it wouldn't go on.  So then I stuck a little piece of paper in the headphone jack so the apple people wouldnt be able to see the orange water damage indicator. (Yes, its stupid of me to do, but i was panicing) =(     So then i plugged it into the computer. the screen turned on!! (YAY!) but you could see the water damage insidde a little part of the bottom of the screen.  and it said i had nothing on the ipod.  When i plugged it into itunes it asked me to restore.  I did, and then it seemed to work fine (but the speakers and the sleep wake volume problem) its unplugged in my room.  So what should i do? should i try to get a new one??    I could probably return it to target and just say it didn't work and get a new one.  Should I do that or take it to the apple store and risk possible fee??    And this is the 2nd ipod touch i got from target in the last 2 weeks.  The first one's sleep wake button was just non responsive and they took it back no problem.

20090205185903AA0SpVW	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	When I send a long message on my Verizon LG Voyager, it takes a long time to send, why?	So I send really long text messages sometimes, and when I send them, they take FOREVER to send! Like it be 5 minutes later and the picture with the little mailbox with the envelope will still be there. Then it would lead to "SEND FAILED. TRY AGAIN?". I click yes, and then it repeat about like 4 or 5 times. Today it took me 20 minutes just to get one little message out! It was annoying! SO ANYWAY............   I was wondering if any of you Verizon customers have the same problem. Oh and not to mention there is good service when I send them (small messages send easily!) I live in an area with crappy service, but my phone had some good service. Is there any way to fix this?
