20090222175651AAK9umk	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What would happen if you went 8,000 miles before getting an oil change?	Out of curiosity, what would happen if you went 8,000 miles on conventional motor oil before getting an oil change?  Let's say they were mostly highway miles, and the vehicle is only 3 years old with 20,000 miles on it.  Would this cause any engine problems in the SHORT-RUN?  In your opinion, what would be the worst that could happen in the short-run if you went that many miles without changing the oil?      I know some of you will say it should be changed at 3,000 miles no matter what, but what if it was all highway driving?  Wouldn't you be able to go at least 6,000 miles of all highway driving before worrying about changing the oil?

20090222190424AAUk7L1	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Problem with the rpms on my truck?	i have a 1998 olds bravada. it has a 4.3 engine 4 wheel drive automatic tranny. now the problem doesn't happen all the time but it does happen when im driving. ok when im at a stop or leaving to work i accelerate and and sometimes the rpm gauge  will jump up a little higher than i am accelerating then it will jump way down. when it jumps up it goes to about 3000-3500,and when it falls it goes to 1500. it also seems to be idling a little high when im warming it up but i think that's because its been very cold out here(chicago). im hoping its not a trans problem. i also noticed its making a very hard growling sound when i accelerate. i checked the levels on the oil and trans both are good, i had the trans flushed and oil changed. it only has 76000 miles on it. is there anything i should check. or can a diagnostic check the engine and trans, i know more about the engine than i do the trans. to me it doesnt seem to be running the same since the tranny flush but it could be anything. i want to take it to a shop but the last 2 have gave me bad advice and changed parts that prob didnt need to be changed or couldnt find the problem and started guessing what the prob was. n wanted to start doing repairs that prob didnt need to be repaired which would put alot of money in there pocket and not help the problem. so what can i do first before i take it in what should i look for. most of all the repairs i have done so i am capable of doing the repair myself but the trans i know nothing about except checking the level. so any help will help before i take it in or back to firestone. but even they said if there is something wrong with the trans they wouldnt know what to do (i know nice for a place that offers a trans flush and not really do repairs on trannys). so thanks for any advice, and if you have any questions about this problem leave your email and i ll email you back. thanks again

This no lie and I don't get to share my story cause, "who really cares". I have had this car for 8 year's. I have had other car's in between time, calling myself "trying to get a run better". I have even went thru my 1st repossession, and I still have this "Chevy". No matter what, this car that I got from a "auction" for "$180 bucks", has been there for me. I have "damned it for to long" and it's time for it to get fixed. I just get and go. Leaks and all, good strong "350" monte carlo motor. It was put it by people who probably had attentions to fix it better. But now I got it. Appreciate what you have. If you have a classic and has fallen into your hands for some reason, take knowledge to it. My car was the last model they made. So now it's time to quite playing games, and make it look "Good". Enjoy this peace!

I also changed the oil filter with a K and N filter. I filled the filter to the top then reattached it. The pressure spikes above 2 rpms as i accelerate into higher rpms. I didnt rev it high enough to go past 3/4 mark. it idles at just under the half way mark on the gage. Before it idled right on the half way mark.

It was making like a grabbing noise ( don't know how to explain it) every time you stepped on the brakes. Replaced the front brake shoes (which was worn down and needed to be replaced) Took it for a test drive and now that noise is  alot louder then what it was before. It is coming from the passenger front side. I noticed on that right side rotor passengers side it had some grooves in the rotor. Which means that the brakes been down to far. But anyway the new shoes should wear in where it shouldn't make any noise but still does. Got over 50 miles on the new brake shoes. Would the wheel bearing be going out on that side? That is my only thought now.
