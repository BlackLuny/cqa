This past weekend I was hanging out with 2 of my chick friends (one of which I'm close to and have a crush on), the other was just her friend. We were in a barn and I was about to climb up to the top and my crush's friend pantsed me in a position where my pants almost completely came off! I was wearing briefs and was really embarrassed, especially since I had to drop down and take a lot of time to pull my pants back up >_>.  But my crush didn't really make fun of me, she just giggled and was like, "Aww, cute!" Was she just being nice or did she like what she saw? lol. Could this have actually helped me?

But now that it is starting to warm back up, the humidity is comming back, and its really bad.       I use a paul mitchel pro straightner and aussie freeze spray. I go to school with loads of hairs spray in my hair and well, when that mixes with the horrid weather it feels really gross on my head haha.

I'm REALLY REALLY want a nose ring for my birthday.   I asked my mom, and she said no, which is weird because she said it was fine if I got my bellybutton or ears pierced (again).      The only reason she doesn't like them is because they look 'strange' and that 'they never heal'.      Can you guys give me a list of pros + cons for nose piercings, and a scale from 1-10 of how much it hurts (10 being unbearable pain, 1 being can't feel a thing), and some info about the healing part.

I've been trying to grow my hair out, but I finally got all of the nasty dead damaged old hair cut off. Now my hair is about chin length. I'm going to try to grow it out so I can wear it curly and pretty, but what should I do with it at this point? I'm taking a trip to LA this week and would like to look nice for the pictures. Usually I just style it sort of under, like a bob. What else can I do with it that I can do by myself?       http://i56.photobucket.com/albums/g192/a...

Just not for anything special, just a cold day, you got jaens, black and white DC's and you got The Black and white Thriller jacket. What would you think, cuz i did the jacket out of sheer design, many of the jackets the two creators( they also made Shawn Michaels vests and stuff) are very nice, but the thriller one looks to me as the most plain, nice one. I prefer black and white by the way.

And I am planning on wearing it to Florida during spring break in two weeks in Fort Lauderdale. I was too afraid last year, but after seeing other women like myself wearing them last year I am definitely gonna wear one this year. I am a little nervous about it and at the same time very excited. I really can't believe that more people, both men and women don't wear thongs on the ocean, It gives everyone a chance to show off their figure while getting a great tan, In many other countries thongs are much more common, Don't get me wrong, I don't want to see older or overweight people bearing so much skin either, But as a 21 year old in great shape I wouldn't mind seeing more people my age in thongs, Sure I'm nervous, but I think it will be fun, Isn't it about time more of us start wearing thongs to the beach? Hopefully I'll see more of you in two weeks!

The rest of my head is fine except for my bangs. They hang straight down and make my hair look like a bowl cut. When I run my hand through it and pull it to the right side, it looks the way i want. But that only stays for a little and it falls back the way it was before. Is there anyway to keep that side swipe look without using gel/mouse/any other product. Also my hair is somewhat silky because i condition it.

20090309231723AARgM4k	Beauty & Style;Hair	Question for all you hair experts: shampoo...?	I've been told by a few hairdressers that most shampoos and conditioners sold in stores are bad for your hair, that the best shampoos and conditioners are sold in salons. I was also told that pantene is the worst. My question is: Are their any store-bought shampoos and conditioners that are ok for your hair? Maybe dove or nexxus? the cheeper the better...      Also the hairdresser at the paul mitchel salon said pantene is the worst because the very first ingredient is alcohol, however when I looked at the paul mitchel shampoo the first ingredient was alcohol as well.       Thanks for your time and your answers

20090309213607AA64xua	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Weird experience but I got a new cologne out of it called Parfum du Monde. Help?	Quite an interesting story      Tonight at about 10 o clock I was walking out of Wal-Mart when I see 3 shady guys with a trunk open by my truck. I think nothing of it and just walk to my truck not wanting to cause problems. One of the walks over to my truck all G'd out like a gangster and gave this bs sales pitch that he works for some cologne industry and they were told to get rid of overstocked bottles of cologne. I'm thinking this is a set-up and i'm already pretty sure i'm about to get knocked out. So I go see what they have trying to sound as cool and relaxed as possible. They let me sample this cologne called Parfum du Monde and told me they are trying to get rid of it and they will sell it to me for real cheap. I gave them the $20 in my pocket and they let me have it.      Now i'm not stupid and i'm thinking the same thing as you "It must be stolen.". However, due to numbers and muscle not being on my side it didn't really seem smart to be shown stolen merchandise and then tell them no thanks. So I took the deal out of fear of my health.      So now i'm wondering about this cologne, is it good? expensive?

20090310000201AALZDB3	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair. how would this look. thanks?	ok. so i just wanna start this off by saying it doesnt matter to me if it suits my face shape, i think it will, if it doesnt, i can always take some scissors to it and make it look better lol =]      alright and secondly, this hairstyle was put together by me by looking at scene people. im not trying to be scene, been there, done that. i just happen to like the hair, minus the poofiness lol.       so here's how i want it...      i want it to go down to my bellybutton. a little bit of volume, just so it doesnt drag. NO POOFINESS. face framing layers that are really blunt. my bangs would go down just past my eyebrows, not really in my eyes though, [thats how mine are now]. i want my hair triangled at the bottom. LOTS of layers, really blunt ones and a few normal discreet ones.       now for the color =]      i want the colors in it to be mainly black and pink, but a bit of turquoise underneath my hair, but so you can see it underneath my ears by my neck. and a little in the back. i want the black to be around my face and to highlight my layers and make them more obvious.       so yea, if you could tell me how you think that would all look put together into one hairstyle that would be awesome. any tips on how to make my layers really obvious [creams, blowdrying tips, etc] would be great. and same with any ideas on how to get volume, just enough so that its not stuck to my head on top [because of the added weight].       p.s. it wont be very thick, i have fairly thin hair and im getting the bottom thinned out a teeny tiny bit. and i plan on getting extensions btw to make it this long.      any tips or ideas you think would help would be greatly apprecieated.      thankyou =]

20090310005513AAGUNOl	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do you bleach your hair? I just don't get it!?	Like, when a girl comes to school with white blonde hair, and it was dark brown before, I just don't understand when people say "She bleached it." What  does that even mean? Like the big bottle of bleach my mom has in the laundry room?       And if you have dark brown hair like I do, how do I get it to be blonde like that? All over, solid, light blonde?       Won't it mess up my hair? Like, turn it green or fry it to death or something? AUGH I AM SO CLUELESS!

20090227115023AAwSLM0	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Help with skin tones?	Am I a warm or a cool skin tone?      I have what I consider to be a medium tone, with a yellowish tint.  My mother always tells me I look good in earth tones, which I know points towards a warm skin tone. However, I have been told by my hair stylist that a vibrant red wouldn't look good with my skin, which I know it usually does with a warm tone.  Also, I have blue-gray eyes, which I've heard is more common with cool tones.  I can't really tell if my veins are green or blue.  And I used to tan all of the time when I was younger.  Now I sometimes tan and sometimes burn, which turns into tan.        I have a picture to help:       http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e242/C...

I had my tongue pierced for the second time (first one I took out right after it healed). It is still very swollen but does not hurt and I can eat perfectly fine... When I think of a swollen tongue after a piercing I think of pain and I was wondering if that is normal for it to still be swollen but not hurt at all?? For anyone with a tongue piercing when did your swelling finally go down? It is just annoying to talk with a huge tongue! but I am thankful I can eat normal!
