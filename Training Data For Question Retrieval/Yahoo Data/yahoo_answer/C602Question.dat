Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.

My 18th birthday is on February 10th, and my boyfriend wants to take me to Los Angeles on Friday, the 13th, after my birthday, to a party. It is somewhat of a night club. The problem is, I'm not good at parties and I'm not very social. It starts at 10 at night, and I am not even sure when it ends. I don't want to ruin anyone's fun there, but at the same time, I feel I have to go because my boyfriend really wants me to go and he wants to give me a special 18th birthday party. Should I just tell my boyfriend that maybe it's better if I don't go, or should I just go to the party? I live in San Diego, and it takes us two hours to drive there.

20090202193825AAZVRtX	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do? Am i being too sensitive? Are my friends right?	I love twins! my best friends are Twins and they have always been SO close but lately i have been feeling really left out! I used to be a Twin but she died when we were babies lately its been on my mind and as i have been feeling left out. I wonder if Violet (that was her name) and i would have been close! I began to get jealous but i let it go and then my friend (one of the twins) said a really mean comment to me and the other twin stuck up for her (as sisters would do) and i said " but you weren't even there you can't assume i am wrong!' and then they brought up my weakness....... the death of my twin they were just like YOU R JEALOUS OF US! and also My friend called me immature, fat, mean, cruel, and bossy, To keep it short just out of the blue i think she was kidding but it wasn't funny then her and her twin started laughing at me. I let it go and i was about to cry because i had a twin sister who died when we were babies and i really wanted her there. Ten they kept doing it day after day and i stated saying stuff back like "why are you being so mean" and "you are adding to your bad karma" and so then they were being really out of controll and one of them was like "you are jealous because i am skinnier" then i lost my cool and said " You insult everyones weight and body you are going to jinx yourself so be quite" Then she got mad and said "I am practicaly anorexic i am not going to wake up fat" and i said "you eat so much what will happen when your metabalism slows down!!!" then she got mad and her twin sister (my over all best friend) is mad at me. This is the worst part so i was joking around in a big group of girls about having a evil twin the next day she yelled at me infront of everyone you cant say you have a twin your twin died YOU DONT HAVE ONE i almost cried! they are my only friends i am scared to lose them but i hate being put down every day and i wish my twin could have lived! But is my friend being heartless or is it just me?

Ok, my 14 year old friend(the one with the 19-year old bf) said that I should stop wasting my time and start having sex. She says that sex is the best thing in the whole world and that it feels so good.      One time, when me, her, her bf, and my other friend(female) were hanging out in front of our school waiting for class to start and she started to rub his pants(like in between his legs) and he was smiling and laughing and then she stuck her hand down his pants.       Are couples supposed to act like this in public? Watching her just made me feel...I don't know...uncomfortable. She told me that he makes her feel so good in bed and that he pulled her hair and that he had a big **** and that it was great. I don't really understand what she's talking about but I don't know...she makes me feel curious.      Should I find out what she's talking about and have sex? She said that if I ever want to try it, she can just get one of her bf's friends to come and help me.       Should I do it?

20090202194829AAKyArs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I capable of making a marriage last?	Ok, so I have some characteristics that make me who I am, and I want to know from other people, who are married preferably, if you think it will prevent me from being in a lasting marriage.      Here's my list:   -I am very independent, always have been always will be.   -I am stubborn.  My way or the highway!   -I am sensitive and get my feelings hurt easily   -I get mad easily   -I like my own space   -My money is my money, if I make it it is mine why do I have to share?   -I have patience with some things, but once it runs out I'm a *****   -I don't want to feel obligated to have sex or feel it is expected of me   -I don't like drinking and I think it is a waste of money   -I am very responsible so won't do things that are irresponsible   -I have goals in life and if someone gets in my way of those I get mad   -I take very good care of my belongings and if someone else doesn't do the same I get mad      There's probably more, but that's most of it I think.   So what do you think?   Would I be able to be in a marriage and make it last without changing myself?
20090202194916AAWQq5i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he giving me the silent treatment?	So I've been seeing this guy (not officially dating) for about a month now and we were really close, we've kissed a zillion times, I spent the night at his house a ton of times, (but didnt have sex, which is nice that he didnt pressure me) and went on dates and stuff a ton of times. The last time I saw him was last week, after we went out to dinner, went bowling and rented a movie. Then I spent the night and we just cuddled in his bed like always, nothing different. He even paid for everything. When I left he kissed me goodbye and said he would text me later to see if we could hang out that night.      He never texted me. I brushed it off and texted him the next night just saying that I thought I was getting sick again (cause we both had gotten sick) No response. That was wednesday. Then last night I just texted him and said "heyy :)"  and no response. Wtf? why is he ignoring me? He seemed really into me and said he missed me all the time and it honestly seemed genuine. I've been played before and this didnt seem the same, and this really hurts. Nothing seemed wrong. nothing different.      Its so hard waiting to see if he'll get back to me, but I dont want to seem desperate and text him again. Should I just give him the silent treatment back and see what happens? this really sucks :( why could he be doing this? :(

I have what the doctors calls "premature libido", and this runs in my family, in almost every female member as far back as we know of.

For about 2 years now, me and my friends have been going to the same basketball court after school. We get there after school finishes and are back by dark. I get my home work done and im a generally good kid, though i do kinda hang around with the wrong crowd. Mum doesn't really like them.      Anyway the other day, i was playing outside the school, shooting bball. And one of my shots missed and fell straight into a tough lookin group of kids who looked like they were up to no good. They turn around and see me on the court. They run up and start hustling me, started making trouble. One picked me up on his shoulders and spun me around.      I came home, my mum got scared. She wasn't happy at all.. i dont know.. shes really over reacting.. theres been talk she might send me away to my aunt and uncle in bel air.. I dont know if i can do it..       Please.. give me some advice.
20090202044840AAx5XiT	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I deal with my family problem?	So, it's like this:      When I was little(like 3-4 yo) my dad beat mom because of his drinking problems. My mom found in her the power to forgive him.       Between that period and now, they were still having fights(not the physical ones) and because of them, mom suffered a nervous breakdown. From that, she fell in a depression.      Now, she is better, thanks to the drugs she's taking. Today, they had another argument, before I woke up. When I asked "what's going on?" they both said it's nothing wrong.      After that, dad invited me to a walk around town, but I refused, because I would rather stay with mom and find out what was really going on.      Dad left a bit disappointed and mom was like: "why didn't you go with your father?".       I'm very confused from all this. It's very hard for me, as their only son, to choose, after a fight, if I want to spend time with dad or with mom.       How can I make both parents happy?      P.S. Sorry for my bad English...

20090202105358AA20CtJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What documentation should I bring with me on my custody case hearing?	I have my child every weekend and every holiday. During the week she stays with her dad and she goes to school. She has been living with her dad for the past 6 months. I get her from Friday nights to Sunday nights. On our days we are always involve in social activities, church and family activities, we also take a lot of pictures.  I have a stable and safe residence, and I am financially stable. The dad doesn't allow me to talk on the phone with the child during the week. He recently moved and has refused to tell me where they live now and who is the daycare provider. He has admitted that he doesn't want me to have any contact with the child. The only reason I see my child now is because it was ordered by a judge. What documentation will be valuable to show to the court that the child is better with me than with the dad? Are written statements from witnesses acceptable in the court?

20090202114600AAmyjrY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why have western countries high divorce rates?	Last day someone asked a question about whether a western woman may marry mid east men. And the answers were very negative with most of them citing woman rights abuse and stuff. Okay in western countries we have woman rights but still most of pedos are from west ( did anyone remember Austrian arrested last year or Australian this year), then there are high divorce rates which leave most of children with one parents stigma. I am not mid-east guy, but a muslim from Canada who currently lives in some damn muslim country. From what i have seen, most of elite and middle class women are treated as princesses. The ones having to face abuse belong to poor class or ones having taliban like savages as husbands.

20090202132726AAKmUMa	Family & Relationships;Friends	This person is everywhere? Help! Being followed by friend!?	My friend is being followed by another girl who thinks she is my friend's best friend. She follows her to and from her locker, finds her if she's alone or with other people and didn't tell her where she was going, hounds other people to tell her where she is, calls her cell phone if she isn't on the bus in the afternoon, and gets upset if she doesn't tell her about plans, even though they don't include her. My friend doesn't like this person, but has too much of a relationship with her to just drop her. She's already tried using obvious hints to tell the person to leave her alone, but she isn't picking them up! My friend doesn't want to be outright mean, but isn't sure how to get her to go away so she can BREATHE.       They also live really close together (the same street) so making excuses is too hard because they take the same bus. Please, my friend just wants some personal time and can't stand being literally stalked by this person who thinks they are her best friend.      Thanks so much for your help!

He's thinking of converting after his GCSE's which is in July/August.   People have been telling him if my family find out that we're going out, they'll kill him but i know that's not true because only strict famillies do stuff like that and mine aren't strict.   We really love eachother and we're serious about eachother. I really don't want anyone to find out about us but a few people at school already know but we deny it. I don't mind the white people knowing because they're mature about it whereas the asians at school are so immature and pathetic.   Please tell me what to do, i don't want to lose him :( x

Honestly, can't the woman do something else than yell at me for leaving my room messy? I don't have time to clean it, because my school schedule is already pushing it. The thing I hate most about my mother is she doesn't know what privacy is. She doesn't knock or anything. She just comes in and complains about something and leaves storming out. If I lock the door, she assumes I'm up to no good, even though I am a great student in school. Sometimes I feel like yelling at her and sometimes I do. What can I do, when she won't even listen to a single word I say? I feel like I have no respect from her :(

I'm feeling really lonely and unloved. Im 13.   I've got a lot of friends, but I'm not that close to most of them. The main problem, is guys. I've had a few boyfriends, but that was ages ago. None of the guys at school talk to me, even if I talk to them. some pick on me. Im not ugly, and im not fat either. I'm generally a bit of a quieter person around guys? I feel like, I'm not good enough for anyone. A few guys have liked me recently, but then they start liking someone else. This sounds really sad but, There's a guy, my age I met online and I've known him for about a year. He's really nice, he's cute. No one has ever been as nice to me as he has. To me He's different than the other guys. Ive seen him on cam and w.e and Ive spoken to his friends before, so obv he's not a peido or something lol. But, He told me he realy liked me, and I really liked him too. He was special. :S He was always telling me how "awesome" and "pretty" I am. And was so sweet. But, Then he moved on And now he likes someone else. It used to be so sweet when we stayed up untill 4 in the morning talking to eachother and saying that we didnt want to leave eachother. its so depressing!! And he's always talking to my best friend now, He hardly ever talks to me. Not just because of him, but I feel so lonely and worthless. My best friend doesnt really care when Im upset either. The only person I have to talk to is my sister but I dont normally get to talk to her much. This is turning into an essay!! But AGH. I feel soooo lonely and unloved. =[          Can anyone try and cheer me up? :D =[ xxx
20090202141402AA76GgM	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad molested me once and my..?	Ok so when i was around 5-7 years old i was molested once by my dad. And some other (different) times when i was again around that age he also called me and my older sister into the bathroom to see him naked peeing trying to make a fountain or something?. By peeing in the bathtub while taking a bath. I know this sounds dumb but idk if that would technically be called molestation would it?.   Anyways i did tell my family (My 2 uncles,my mom,grandma,and older sis) about what he did and they all seemed really upset(one of my uncles even cried about it) ,and they believed me completely right off the back and everything. But they never did anything about it like put him or me in counseling or put him in jail or kick him out the house. Also after that day when i told them what happened they never brought it up with me again except my grandma. And now that im 17 years old im really confused and kind of upset that my family didn't really do anything to my dad about this. And for awhile this didn't really bother much but now i keep reliving in my mind what he did to me. But i feel if my family doesn't do or say anything about it anymore maybe its not as big a deal as i might think it is. And i should probably just not think about it anymore. But the thing is i do really love my dad hes a good hearted guy when he wants to be. But knowing what he did to me makes me feel really awkward around him at times and idk if i shoud even forgive him and love him for what he did,wich i do. So should i just forgive and forget what my dad did to me and move on or should i still worry and not forgive him (honestly).   And also should my family have done more then they did about this honestly?   and i honestly feel that they wouldve done more about this situation but since my 2 uncles were his brothers they were probably embarassed and ashamed to tell anyone else about what he did.   (thats my opinon ^ )   And no my dad hasn't really done anything like that to me ever again. Except my grandma has told me recently he was checking out my but and also commented to her that "my breasts are getting bigger".
20090202141634AASvZGy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need help... please no rude comments (its kind of long)?	my husband has 3 children from a previous marriage. i do not have a problem with this. his oldest son and his daughter do not make any effort to contact him, and he tries so hard to talk to them.his son is nowhere to be found, and his daughter uses him for money. she asked for a wii for Christmas, and a pair of ugg boots (they cost like 100 dollars) for her birthday... which is 2 weeks after Christmas. she wont even give him her phone number... he talks to her on myspace and he calls her at work. his middle son we send between 25 dollars, and 50 a week. here is the thing... we have an 8 month old daughter, and I'm a stay at home mom. he only makes 14.50 and hour, and i get 253.00 a month. all of his children are adults... his oldest is 30, then 29, and then 23... i guess my question is how do i deal with this? i don't understand how this is right... he feels guilty for not being there for them, which i get... but i don't know... any suggestions, or advice?

20090202140300AAJnMN2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have been married to my husband for almost a year.  We have a wonderful marriage and are very happy.  ?	My husband has three children that are ages 13, 10, and 8.  They live nearly 5 hours away from us, so we don't see them but every 3 or 4 weeks.  When they do come down for visits, we have a great time.  My oldest step daughter acts like she absolutely adores me and her father.  She is constantly on my heels while she is at our house, and while she's here I feel we have a very close relationship.  However, when she goes back home to her mother she talks about us like dogs, makes fun of me, and makes up things about us and our marriage that are absolutely not true.  My husband's ex-wife is very dangerous, as she made up things about him during their divorce that sent him to jail for several days, and even cost him his job.  In the end, he was cleared of everything and that is finally behind us.  However, due to my husband's ex-wife's obsession with causing trouble for him, I am very concerned about even being here for the weekend when my step-daughter visits.  I am tired of her using us to get what she wants and telling repeated lies about us to her mother.  I have bent over backwards to be nice to her, and to make her feel at home and welcome when she comes for her visits.  We have confronted her before about playing both sides of the fence and telling lies about us, but she continues to just get worse.  In fact, she is having trouble telling the truth about anything these days.  The other two children and I get along great, and they are not exhibiting the same behaviors. Is it wrong of me to not even want to be present when she comes down for her visits in the future?  Am I totally overreacting?  I love my husband and I want to support him and help him with these kids, so what do I do about this?

20090202142359AAPAmUB	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do about the pot smell coming from my friend's apartment?	It all began about a month ago when a close friend lost her apartment. My parents are the landlords of the apartment building I live in, so I pulled some strings and got her the place across the hallway from me. Well, she has only been living here a little while and I'm beginning to regret it. She has become a heavy pot smoker (thanks to the ex, before him she wouldn't touch the stuff) and the smell is pretty strong. Now, what I am saying here is NOT that I want her to stop smoking, It's her decision, not mine and I don't really give a rat's bum.        However, as it is my parent's place, I really don't want them getting in trouble for this. And as I live across the way, the smell creeps out under my door and before I know it, the whole apartment smells like weed. My boyfriend and I are non-smokers, and needless to say, I don't dig it. Are there any methods she can use to keep the smell to a minimum? I'm not about to insist she smokes somewhere else for my comfort, cause it seems rather imposing of me. Honestly, I don't know if I'm being imposing by having a problem in the first place. I don't know what to do and feel like I should've helped her find somewhere else to stay. But I can't do anything about it now. So any suggestions about the scent?

20090202140206AAjD9u2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does he stay and is reconciliation a possibility?	My husband told me three weeks ago that he wants to get a divorce and then start over building a friendship.  He says remarriage is a possibility, but he wants to just take it slow and see if a romantic relationship develops after a period of friendship.  He still lives with me and we sleep in the same bed but we don't share intimacy.  He says that as far as he is concerned he isn't my husband and just a friend.  He says that this marriage is too damaged to saved and he just wants to start all over again.  I'm confused and a little hurt.  We have to be separated for 18 months before he can file for divorce.  We have been through a lot, but I just don't understand how he thinks divorce and remarriage is better.  What are the chances he will change his mind during the separation?  He says he still loves me and wishes that it didn't have to be this way but he feels it is his only option.  Please no rude comments either way.
20090202140249AAaWxPJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married women - cheating?	I am just curious about the general consensus here.  I have been with my husband for 6 and a half years.  I truly believe that he would never cheat on me, but before I decided to marry him, I thought a lot about what I would do if he ever did. Because of how I feel for him, I know I would be able to get past it if he was willing to work things out.  It would certainly take time, but I would want to.      So, I am curious to see what others think -  Is cheating a deal breaker, or do you think it's something that you could get past with time?

20090202142336AA9mnwO	Family & Relationships;Family	How do you forgive a long dead abusive parent?	Yesterday someone in a line recognized my last name. Came up to me and asked are you related to this person (my father). I said yes and knew what was coming. They launched into this long tale of what an extraordinary and wonder-full man my father was. How much they admired him and how lucky I was to be his son. After his death over a decade ago I got this allot and I always allowed them to keep their illusions as to who he really was. This was the first time in a couple of years this happened, and I just was not prepared for it. I just told them they had no idea who he was and walked away. It ruined a pretty good day.   I have been considering how much damage he did to me and my mother, and in fact continues to do from the grave. I try and forgive him sometimes only to curse him a few weeks or months later. I can never forget the beatings he gave to us, and the bruises on my mother's face.But the verbal attacks were far worse.   I think about how devastated he would be if his admirers knew what he was really like behind closed doors. He could be so charming and warm. But what effect would this have on the person that considers him to be their favorite teacher? Would it be selfish and vengeful to say something?   How do I put him out of my life?   I don't know if I actually expect answers for this, I guess I am just venting.   Any constructive advice?

20090202142418AAZTvgM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Which trip option do I choose?	I have to choose between senior trip and church (high school) camp. Church camp is about $500 cheaper than senior trip, and this is really my last chance to go to high school camp, as well. I don't really have any friends going on either trip. There are a few people I talk to that are going, but no really good friends. Also, there is a horrible guy that annoys me and makes me want to rip my hair out at times that is going on senior trip. There is only a small group going on that trip, so I might run into him a lot. Both are a week long, and I don't want to miss out. At the same time, I don't want to be on an awkward trip for a week and waste all that money. Which one do I pick? Or do I not go on either trip? (This may be the only opportunity I get to go anywhere for quite some time.) Thanks!

20090202142549AAb2jQN	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	PLEASEEEEEE give your advice!! how do i motivate myself?	before you read this, let me just say.. if you have any cruel comments then just keep them to yourself.   Don't call me Emo, or anything of that sort. because you don't know me.      however all other opinions and advice is accepted :) thank you         I used to be a really great student. I had straight A's and never missed a day of school, no matter how sick or what was happening. i used to be the smart one in class, that everyone copied off of.   Then a lot of family problems occurred, then we moved to a completely foreign country. neither my parents spoke the language. but i learned it quick. I became the one who had to pay bills make phone calls and do everything else at age of 12.   anyways when i moved to my new school and not knowing the language very well or anything, i became the "stupid" one in the class. and i just didn't adjust very well to the change.   anyways i was still doing sort of OK in school until  i got to high school and a bunch of things went on. [to say the "LEAST" my parents both died, and i had to stay with their friends in a foreign country and take care of my little bro] their friends treated us like crap, and i had to work to support my little bro & myself. and i hit depression/suicidal stage. i pretty much gave up on everything (school) and made some pretty bad choices.       i just got out of my depression stage not too long ago and now its my senior year in high school, and I'm pretty much failing behind very badly. i have a very low GPA and I'm missing about four credits.    in order for me to make this all up i have to do some serious hard work.    some days I'm positive about it, and just think "oh its alright just work very hard and you'll be ok" but then most days i think of how a failure i am and how much i let myself fall. and it really gets to me.   and it doesn't help that a lot of people just bring me down. because they don't know the things that i went through. they just assume I'm some stupid kid who's failing. and they treat me like that, which also brings me down. I know I'm not stupid, I'm much smarter then a lot of people. Its just i made some really bad choices. and i didn't try/gave up.      i really don't know how to stay motivated with my negative mind, and peoples negative comments. should i just drop out and get my GED? i really want to get my diploma instead but i feel like its a little too late. what do you think?

20090202155250AAKEsMI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Girls wanting to gang up on me and beat me up?	Now there's a rumor going on at school, that all of the girls I've been mean too are gonna unite and beat me up.  Ok I don't know if this rumor is actually gonna happen or not, but it's kind of scaring me.  Yes I admit it, I have picked on these girls and have made them cry at times, probably about 5 girls in all.  I only did it because it was funny, it was nothing personal at all.  If these rumors of them getting together and beating me up are true, what the heck am I supposed to do?  I can't possibly fight them all at once, maybe if I fought them one at a time than I'll be alright, but if they gang up on me than I'm gonna get hurt.  What should I do here?  I'm really worried that this is gonna happen.  I'll try to apologize to each and every one of them, but I don't think they'll forgive me.

20090202143404AAksbYN	Family & Relationships;Family	What did she mean by this?	I told my fiancee I cheated on her and got another woman pregnant. I feel awful about it and I'm surprised she didn't hit more or anything.       Well when I told her she just stared at me for a minute before I spoke. I said "Look, it's probably best I just go."   She said "I never said go did I? I never said I was breaking up with you"   I replied with "What do you mean?"   and she said "It's obvious you feel terrible about it otherwise you'd have not told me. Besides if you aren't here I can't punish you for being a cheating B******."      Before I went to work she looked at me like everything was normal and I went to kiss her as usual and she slapped me and told me I wasn't allowed touch her until she could trust me again. I can't deal with her being like this, I know I'm getting off lightly but we're getting married at the end of march. Or we're meant to be.

She doesn't like it very much either, but I really hate even the idea of her cutting her hair in the first place. Her hair looked much better before and people are making fun of her now. She looks like a guy and there's just nothing good to say about it. What should I do? I'm not just going to be all shallow and not be friends with her, I still treat her the same, but other people are making fun of her and it's hard for me to adjust to it.

Is it my fault or just luck? i had five extremely close friends. i was nice to them eventhough sometimes i can be a jerk. And everytime they have a problem, i would always be there for them. I also had put two of my friends together into boyfriend and girlfriend. Most of the time when they have problems for example with family...i would drop my current work and talk to them. We would go to clubs and places. But all that have changed....they talk to me much lesser. Once they all have their boyfriend or girlfriend, i feel like i am all alone since they rarely talk to me now. Did i do something wrong?   BTW we had been friends for more than 6 months.

20090202155233AAmDgoi	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to make yourself happy when everything's going wrong?	My life's turned upside down.      Me and my best friend basically just split up, whereupon she told me I was boring and basically that she liked two other people from our group of friends more than me. She then dedicated her entire online profile to being basically about them. Then I realized that a lot of my music and clothing style is simply ripped from somewhere else and that my life has never been, and never will be, as cool as I've made it sound at times. I've not had a boyfriend for a long time. I've never been in love. I'm getting a belly and I can't be bothered to try and make myself even look good anymore. I keep running to make the selfconciousness go away, but it barely works. Movies bore me now, there's nothing much that effects the way I feel. I watched an inconvenient truth and now all I'm aware of is that the world'll **** itself up very, very soon. I realized the world's twisted and corrupt. I also realized that I don't like any of my friends and that I have absolutely no confidence to meet other people anyway. I have a lot of loose friends that I actually value more than I should. I hold on tightly to strings that are related to popularity, too tightly. I hit 15 4 days ago and the day after, the gig that I went to as my birthday "party" - Relentless Tour gig - was cancelled after three hours. My friends were all mean to me at the sleepover that followed the cancellation, they did a lot of **** they probably didn't realize hurt me.      So back to my original question; how can you make yourself happy when everything's going wrong?

20090202162407AAXGEAc	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend got paddled by her dad?	Okay so my friend (age 13) was sitting down funny in science class and I (age 14) asked her what was wrong. She said nothing was wrong just that her dad had paddled her the night before really hard and sitting was uncomfortable. I tried to stay all cool about it like I found it normal but throughout the day I was able to get out of her what happened. Apparently she was watching a video online of an episode of House MD that she missed and the website she saw it on gave her computer a virus and deleted a lot of her father's work files. When he found out about it he took a disciplining paddle and made her bend over a table. He gave her a few hard swats with it over her jeans, and then he told her to take off her jeans and he proceeded to paddle her butt over her underwear. He made her count each stroke, and she had to call him sir. She didn't tell me how many swats she received.   Isn't she kind of old for a spanking? She says she is still spanked with a hairbrush when she is bad and paddling is for serious offenses, but I thought this situation was kind of weird. What do you think?      btw her parents are very nice, non abusive people. my family has known them for years and they are trustworthy and kind.

If you had a chance to reconnect with that great past love of your youth,would you pursue it?      There were never any lies, infidelities, etc... in the break-up, just two people who had to go their separate ways 20 years ago. You find yourselves reconnecting after your divorces and you feel like love struck children all over again.      I've been speaking regularly with an old flame that popped up about a year ago and for about the past 6 months, we've been on the phone pretty much every night. We've just had a great long weekend together and it terrifies me to say it... It feels like we never missed a step from our past.      I am interested in hearing what advice other divorced people who have gone down this road would offer?

20090202153920AAHHAM3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Feel neglected by my boyfriend?	Am I wrong to feel like this? We live a few hours away since ive moved to uni, so we only see eachother once a week if that. it used to be every day or so. im always so excited and happy to see him i cant help that but he never seems to be. its very casual now, when we see eachother its 50/50 that we'll have sex and im always so dissapointed when we dont. we just watch the rugby and see his friends and not go out, its nice but not all the time when its everything his way.   the other day i came home to see him for a few days after not seeing him for weeks and we had (bad)sex once. (we used to have sex whenever we'd see eachother and he'd also really make an effort with initiating and foreplay, now he literally tells me to get into bed and often ... doesnt even come through sex anymore.)   the other day he also asked me not dress up so much because 'a. it's uncomfortable for me b. theres something sexy about not making so much effort' i told him i enjoy it and wait till when i see him to wear my new stuff, but he persited and i kind of let it go. it did upset me though because it makes me feel like he doesnt appreciate anything i do anymore. that goes with me seeing him all the time, buying him little presents and him not, asking to go on holiday and him rejecting etc. am i being too picky or is he taking me for granted?

20090202161958AAvtc34	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i say goodbye to the person ive known my whole life?	for about a week my bestest friend never answered her phone Well than a month after she finally answered, my bestest friend in the whole wide world (her name is Autumn) told me and my other friend Victoria that she was grounded for a week for forgetting a math book so we are like okay whatever then we called her back after a week and she was still grounded, so we kept calling her and asking if she was still grounded until it was 4 weeks then she said that she was grounded again. so we keep calling her and she keeps saying that and its been about three weeks, well me and Victoria think that there is something more, like her mom just somehow for some reason started hating us because we are all different like autumn is black, victoria is asian and im mexican, well there is so much more to it but i cant say much cuz there isn't much room, but me and victoria are so tired of this, maybe she doesn't want to be our friend any more or maybe her mom doesn't want her to be friends with us but we are tied of all this and so we are sort of thinking of giving up and fading away and saying goodbye to her, what should we do?
20090202163148AAON1xe	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I take my mom's side?	A few months ago my mom took out a loan on her car title so she could pay rent and last month her car was taken away because she couldn't pay it off. Ever since then I have been taking them to where ever it is they need to go. Her and my step dad give me ten dollars for gas every couple of weeks, but it just gets really annoying when they knock on my door every five minutes to take them to their friend's or the beer store or some place totally uneccessary for me to take them to. Neither of them have jobs and I am in college, but I only go twice a week. I'm also having to take and pick up my little sister from school too, but that's not really a big deal to me.    anyways, here's my problem. i have a boyfriend that I have been dating for a couple of years that my mom has bi polar feelings about. when i leave for a day or two to go over to his house like i always do on the weekends she complains to me that he's controlling me an doesn't want me to help her and my step dad by taking them places or letting them borrow my car.    my mother, by the way, leaves with my car for hours when she says she's going away for half an hour, tells me she will give me gas money when she gives me two dollars, tells me i only need to take her to one place when it's five, and is constantly telling me what I should be doing, which is usually helping them out by letting them use my car while I'm studying or watching my baby sister.    when i try to put my foot down and tell her that i cant always take her where ever she wants because i have my own places to go, she calls me selfish and says i dont care about anyone but myself and my bf becuase thats what he tells me to do.    My bf, michael, tells me that my mom is a loser because she spends her last dollars on alcohol and expects me to always bow down to her demands. he also explained to me that she goes behind my back and tells his mother how rude i am to him and that we need to spend time away from each other. we get along completely fine and things couldn't be better.    mom says that she's trying to get another car but it's hard becuase she cant get a ride for a job and cant find a way to earn money. she already owes the landlord 2500 dollars and we have to move out by the 20th, but she's sure that my grandma can help pay for it.    my mother cannot keep a job for more than 4 months and spends her money on alcohol and pills and cigarettes. she even buys it when we have no toilet paper. my step dad isn't any better, either. he's always talkign behind peoples' backs and constantly fights with my mom.    my mom tells me that shes trying to make things better and that i just need to stay home and spend alot less time wih my boyfriend so i can stop acting so rude to them, becuase apparantly thats where my attitude towards just them is coming from...      do i stay home until they get a car and help them or should i tell them that its my life and my car and i dont always have time for them?      i just need a straight answer. by the way, i dont have a job as of now and i am 19, in case that helps your mental image.

So one day, I go up to him and ask him why he keeps on staring at me and he says it's because I have pretty hair. LOL. After that day, he's been talking to me non-stop. Before classes, during classes, during lunch, and after classes. Almost the whole day. He's such a chatter-box.      Yesterday, he told me that he wanted to be my boyfriend. LOL. I mean I do like him and I like talking to him but do you think I'm too young to start dating? I mean, I'm almost in high school and everyone dates there.

20090202164552AAs01BM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	For Men Only...I want to leave my wife and I want custody of my little girl...?	Has any father here sucessfully accomplished this? If so, how?      I am a wonderful father and I work very hard. I had posted a question earlier today, but aside from all the feministic opinions that I had received, I had very little else to go on.      I put my wife through school and she has two degrees now that I have paid for. She has since been out of school and has this sense of entitlement that is mind boggling. She has come right out and said that because I was a man, that I should pay for everything. I'm sorry, but that just doesn't seem like the "team" that I had envisioned when we got married.      My little girl is everything. I work two fulltime jobs to give her everything that she needs, I make very good money, and am very frugal with what I spend. My problem is that my wife sleeps 12 hours a day and does nothing to help better my daughter's life.      I am not leaving my wife for another woman, I have tried to fix this for some years now and now I am completely of the opinion that staying and fighting with my wife is not at all what I want to teach my little girl in regards to how one should live life.      I spend every moment that I can with my little girl and take her to church (my wife refuses to go) and to starbucks every Sunday and I play and spend time with her every moment I can. I don't want any child support or alimony, I just want my little girl...is there some way that I can take my little girl and just move to another place and establish custody. I have told my wife to leave our house and she won't, so I am now prepared (i just rented another place) to leave with my little girl. I think this is legal as long as I inform my wife of where we live.      Any advice men?

20090202183424AAnGHyA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do u get over an affair?	i discovered my partner was having an affair late last year after 5 years together and we had just had our 1st baby 8 weeks previous to that      i caught it early, it had only been going on a couple of weeks as i had read all the signs (cagey about his phone, 'working late' ect..)      originally when i first found out i asked him who he wanted me or her and he couldn't decide, he said he cared about her deeply, he had told her we had split up n he had moved out so as you can imagine she told him where to get off!      a day later he moved out and he decided he wanted me (but my 1st worry is im second best n he chose me cus she wouldn't have him)      but it just runs through my mind permanently, i cant get the thoughts out my head, i still cant sleep and just break down in tears at anything.      i keep asking myself y he did it, is it because i'd put on weight while pregnant and didn't fancy me! (she is thinner and prettier than me) and y do it just when we've had a baby? i have so many questions, but he never answers them straight!      i really don't know what to do anymore, my mind feels completely messed up like it will never be normal again!      do i take him back and feel second best? or will i get over feeling second best?

20090202171400AAqFAqK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Boyfriend vs Bestfriend?	My bestfriend and my boyfriend both hate each other. They both got in an argument because while i was kicking it with my bestfriend my boyfriend called and he was pissed. And then my bestfriend in the background was telling him to leave me alone for just 5 mins or something. Then when i hung up on him, he went to the food place where I was at with my bestfriend and started yelling at her. Telling her she's a bad friend to me. (because when i moved she stopped talking to me, then when she had no one to talk to, like boyfriends, she would talk to me.) Then i told him to just leave and forget that me and him were going out. I went up to my bestfriend and i told her that i was sorry. She just told me to go to my boyfriend. But i didn't but when she left me in the table i just left and my boyfriend came and i was yelling at him for what he have done. But after awhile we talked and wer now okay. And i have fallen for him harder after that. But the thing is, should i have made my bestfriend happy by dumping him? i kinda feel bad because shes like a sister to me. And now i think i've lost her. Would a bestfriend still forgive a bestfriend if they done that to each other? Or was she even a bestfriend to me
20090202175510AABM4RS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I asking too much out of someone I consider to by my Best Friend? Am I just letting myself get hurt?	I've been friends with a good friend of mine for a year. In that year a lot of things have happened, both for the good and the bad. He is someone I have considered to be my best friend! When we first became friends, he would always make time for us to hang out, we would go have dinner, go to the movies, or just go and talk, slowly we got closer and began hanging out more. He would call me and text me and want to hang out pretty much every other day. Then his girlfriend went on vacation for the summer, and we started hanging out even more. During the summer, we would hang out talking for hours, going to lunch or dinner, going to the movies or the drive in. Just hanging out, and we grew really close. Later his girlfriend who I have never met, decides to randomly send me a really wierd message telling me to leave her boyfriend alone the he was hers. I replied back nicely being like what are you talking about. She replied back talking crap to me, and I replied back telling her who is she to judge me, she replied back saying that I was judging her and she started saying more crap to me. I got upset and without thinking much of it, replied back telling her to F**k Off B*tch. I told my friend what I had said and although he told me he wish I hadn't said that, he was cool with it. The next day he stopped talking to me for 4 1/2 weeks because his girlfriend made him. We were later able to work things out and talk things through, but things have never really been the same. Before the fight, if we ever had an argument he would always want to talk and fix things, if he knew something was wrong, he would get me to talk to him about it. But after the fight, all we would do is argue about stupid things. Then we went for about a 3 month period where things were going really well, we were talking more like before, we weren't arguing, things were good. I went on vacation for a week, and that whole week he was constantly texting me and calling me, and couldn't wait till I was back. The first day I was back he was wanting to hang out and we hung out the whole day. Things were really good. But then for some reason he just started pushing me away again. Not sure why. I've talked to him about it, and he says nothing is wrong he just doesn't have time. Before he used to make time for us, now its like he never makes time. He gets upset with me because I get upset about the fact that he isn't making any time to hang out. I understand he has his own life and he has a girlfriend, but am I really asking for too much for him to make time. At least talk on the phone or text message me. Something! We work every weekend together like we always have, but I want a friendship outside of work too. Is that too much to ask for??? One thing that I found out about recently is that he had made a promise with me not to drink, I later found out he was drinking behind my back and lying to me about it. He later admitted it, but now I don't trust him completely about it, and he gets upset when I ask him if hes been drinking. Another thing that just came up, is we made a promise to not have sex, and he broke that promise too, he told me he didn't want to but his girlfriend wanted to, so he couldn't just tell her no. I somewhat think that him losing his virginity is part of the problem, thats when he started pushing me away. He wants me to be cool about him having sex, even though I'm not. What am I supposed to do, just go about it as if nothing happened and its ok for him to be doing that? I don't know! Do I care too much??? Am I asking to much from him??? I really think things would be different if his girlfriend were not in the picture, but it doesn't seem like that will happen.      FYI, he has been with his girlfriend for 3 years almost off and on. He has also cheated on her, but has never told her completly.      He is 17, I'm 21!      He also has told me he doesn't think much of friendships anymore because he's been hurt in the past!      On the occasion that we do hang out, he can't even tell his girlfriend with out her getting upset!      I am a guy!      WHAT DOES EVERYONE THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M ASKING????

20090202165447AAVcdpW	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend got raped?? Not even affected!?	Okay well one of my friends was raped by her cousin. It happened when she was 11 and he was 13 or 14. Now after it happened she didn't tell her mom. (It happend at her dads house). She told one of her cousin's and her told his mom. That's how her mom found out. The mom of her cousin that raped her didn't do ANYTHING. Now he didn't exactly rape her. She said he put it in and after like 30 seconds took it out. She was asleep at the time. But she didn't seem affected by it AT ALL! She didn't care and wasn't sad at all. Now the cousin who raped her still comes to her house and stuff. And recently my friend who got raped started her period! What if he strikes again..

Yes I posted this once but got no answers so here it is :P       Me and my friend got into a spat. - xD I like calling it that :P-    It's been going on for a few weeks and it started when my other friend was over and it seemed like she was getting jealous. I honestly don't know is she was but i can understand why she would be mad my other friend was rude to her the same day - I talked to the other friend about it- but she did overreact and hang up on me even though it wasn't my fault. So I made it clear that I didn't like it. She acted like nothing happened and it was my fault so I told her not to call me and hung up.    The next day she called like a million times so my friend kept answering and being rude but at the time I really didn't care.       I still don't. But there are those times when I know we're fighting for nothing.    My question is: Now she wants to talk to me... what's the best thing to do?

So what im asking is can you give me any ideas on what to talk about while im at school hanging out with my friends and also how talk to guys especially well thanks so much!   Thank you! in advance!
20090202164151AAxFrM1	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it okay that I denied my aunt's request on facebook?	I could really care less about my aunt. She was absolutely horrible in e-mails she wrote to my father. And my whole family has access to read them which means my mother and I read the e-mails where she completely insulted my mother several times and called my sister and I "f*cking kids" while complaining about her stay at our house, she and her family were at our house for my sister's funeral (2006) I cannot even BEGIN to describe how hurt and angry I have been with her. That happened in January 2007 after my grandmother died. So is it alright that i denied her on facebook and told her i don't want to be her friend?
20090202191515AAtHFi5	Family & Relationships;Friends	What does this means?	I was fixing my sister's friend computer, I install some software for her, while my hand was on the keyboard she touch my hand for a few seconds, I look at her for while and continue on doing the computer thing and she took her hands away.
20090202192621AAhS8XD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make friends with my ex?	I was going out with a girl for about a month or so, but we'd been really good friends for a while before we started going out. We ended up breaking up by mutual consent as our relationship was going nowhere. Then, I joked about her behind her back, but everyone knows I was joking and she must know I was joking too because I haven't changed from the time I've known her and she knows me well.      When she found out I'd said something, she became very aggressive with me and started slating me to her friends. This annoyed me and I started slating her to mine. This lead to her friends calling me and emailing me calling me all sorts of names, they didn't really hurt, but I felt it was immature and my friends hadn't done the same to her. Her friends also continually denied that she had said anything about me, but I know she did.        She was a really good friend before we went out and broke up and I'd like to rekindle our friendship of old but how? I tried talking to her, but she wouldn't have anything to do with me. I don't think this is all my fault and I'm being made to be the bad guy of it all.
20090202182622AAonj95	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this unfair of me?	My aunt needed to move back in with my mom due to circumstances. There, bang, zip. Exposition.      Okay, so we have two refrigerators. One in our basement, where she, her daughter, and on weekends, son, stay. And one in our kitchen, which is newer and replaced the basement one.       Herein my problems lie. My aunt keeps food in the downstairs refrigerator, and only she, and her children know. she keeps things like ice cream, juices, and other little treats there. Am I being petty to resent her for doing this, and eating up everything that we have access to?       I'm fifteen, her son is fourteen, her daughter is six

20090202175959AAH0TIJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I Bother sending him a birthday present?	I've been friends with this guy but nothing more for three years until last october when we went on a date...things seemingly went sour because he hasn't been in touch since then (I Know!) I tried reaching him but he must have changed his number or something, I know he's alright because his active on FB. Anyway in the past three years we've always given each other presents. But he didn't even acknowledge my birthday in NOvember. Now his birthday is coming up in a few days and I don't know whether to give him something or not? Will it seem like I'm 'begging'? I think he's just blown me off completely. I'm bummed as I though we were at least good friends!!  Question is should I give him a gift.

20090202133859AAyh4YS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could I be/ am I in love?	I'm fifteen. So I know this probably sounds like puppy love, and maybe it is, that's what I'm trying to figure out. But I've had many other crushes in my life and one other boyfriend, yet I've NEVER felt this intensely for anyone else. I'm happier just holding hands with this guy than I was when I got my first kiss from my ex. I can't sleep at night because I'm thinking about him. Whenever I think about him, I feel like crying he makes me so happy. I feel like I love him so much...is this 'in love'? or just puppy love? With the other guys I've liked and in that one case dated...I liked them, but I knew it wouldn't last and was ok with that. Now...I just feel like there's no one else in the world that matters.
20090202183415AAcTcNV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Bestfriend Problems =(?	Okay well first off i have been friends with my friend for 5 years.   She and i have "always" liked each other from day one.   Well anyways she has been always the kind of type to go out with a lot of guys for a short period of time, and then dump then.   Most of the time they just want to get into her pants, and she's not looking for that.   Well anyways i've "Always" have wanted to go out with her, but for some reason ive always been scared too.   I saw how she was friends with her other guy friends and i saw how she went out with them and then broke up with them, and now she doesnt talk to them anymore =[.   So i was toooo "afraid" to risk our friendship.   Because her and i are really close.   Well anyways just recently My Church got a New Pastor, and he has 2 sons.   One is 16 and the other is 19.   And there pretty cool, they have now been going to my church about 2 months now.   Well anyways Victoria ( the girl im talking about) just jumped right on in and started dating the guy that is 19 years old.   And i havent talked to her for a month now and she doesn't even pay attention to me anymore at Church.   Its ridiculious, she has been treating ALL of her friends like this.   I mean i hate to say this but maybe im a little jealous, and it is her decision what she wants to do.   And i "know" i should of taken a chance and asked her out before he did.;   But still, it hurts that she knows i told her i will ask her out once im done with school this year ( i'm a senior) and i would love to be with her.   Ive never felt more in loved with someone like her before, i mean Victoria is extremely attractive, funny personality, and the best thing about her is that she is very caring and is also very family orianted.   Just her overall self, and i dont know what to do.            So i called her today, and told her that she has been acting wierd.   And i told her i want her to be happy but still give me attention and love like a friend she should be doing.,   and she got ALL upset with me, saying maybe it should be better for her and i to stop being friends.   That right there REALLY hurt my feelings.   Idkno what to do, ive been trying all day not to cry.   I feel like a child, i mean i put SOO much of my time into her and i feel like i waisted it all =(
20090202174513AA9plVB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i tell my step brother that ?	should i tell my brother that i think that his girl friend is cheating on him because she came over here and she got on myspace on my computer and then she forgot to log off and i was going to play a joke and send me a me sage from her computer and send one back as read so i went in her inbox and i say some message with a weird subject  and i opened it and they were talking about how they had fun and telling each other how much the love each other please help me
20090202174636AAuX0zq	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends are putting me down, badly.?	I've been friends with these girls since I was in preschool.  I've changed, I've become very mature.  I love to hang out with guys, and I'm the only one out of all of them who has kissed a guy.  Overtime, it seems they've gotten extremely closed minded.  And now, they are actually saying really mean things.      Like today, I wore my super cute mini skirt.  I had gotten lots of compliments, until my "best friends" saw it, then they all ganged up on me and started calling me a slut, and saying "Oh Anna your dressed like a slut today?" In front of everyone.   Another one of my "best friends" won't let me sear AT ALL in front of her.  One night, my boyfriend had Just broken up with me and I was really really sad,  so I was swearing alot, but not at her.  I was crying and everything and all my friend could do was yell at me for swearing.  That made it worse.      Things like this have been happening a lot over the past few weeks with my old friends, and my question is, is it my fault? or are they Just being ridiculous?      It's Just the girls, not my guy friends.

20090202164332AAS9IIx	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do when my fiance freaks out about me visiting my step-sister?	My fiance whom I have a child with hates my family and blames them for a lot of our problems. They did do some underhanded things and because of that we aren't on the best of terms.       My stepsister flew in this week and I expressed interest in going over and saying hi, my fiance threw a fit over it citing all the things wrong with her and that I shouldn't go over there and she didn't want them seeing our son.       My step sister wasn't involved with the unpleasant businessbetween my family and us, she has just made some bad choices in life. So my fiance gives me the cold shoulder over the whole thing because I still want to see her. Things got better for a day but then the next day while running errands I stopped by to say hi and she called me while I was there and when she asked I told her what I was doing.      When I got home she started yelling at me and saying how now she knows where she stands and that she isn't important to me and how I don't love her or my son, really going off about it. I don't think seeing my step-sister is a huge deal but now she is talking about having to re-examine our relationship and everything.       What do I do? I've been getting tired of her making me feel guilty over small things and blowing things way out of proportion. But with my son and all I don't think I want to end the relationship. Should I just suck it up and get out now or try to work things out with her?

And she also bought the same hair straightener as me. I really hate it when people copy me. and my mom always tells me that I should take it as a compliment because they like my ideas or things so much that they would copy me. I wouldn't mind it as much if it wasn't like all the time. How can I stop her from copying me?      And I also want to do something to my room like decorate it somehow. like in a way that she can't copy me. any ideas?         thanks sooo much. I will give a best answer.
20090202170425AAbzf4V	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you consider this unhealthy, can you relate?	i reeeeally like a guy  (typical huh?)(i'm a girl btw i know my name doesn't help lol)) i'm pretty used to going from one big crush to the next. most of them (like last year) i had no chance whatseover to "get with", i didn' even talk to them. but this year, this guy, what caught my eye was his extremeness as a christian. he's just so on fire for God and so dedicated to him. and to me, as a christian, i find that very attractive in a guy especially that he is a junior. so other than that, i found out we like a lot of the same music. and one day i talked to him on facebook telling him how much i admired his dedication to God. and boom. he invited me to his bible study that he leads, gave me his phone number (not like that lol). he's good-looking, sooooooo freakin' nice,  and i've hung out with him once outside of the usual bible study. and we've had a big convo on facebook.  (it's still pretty early in the friendship stage, but it's past acquantances which is good)    i just can't help but think it's unhealthy to like him THIS much. when he got a gf,  i was soo bummed, and when they broke up i freaked out in joy.    if we dated (big word being IF) that'd be amazing. but it'd be amazing to have him just as a friend. but it's tough talking to him when i can barely think straight. can anyyyone relate???? is it unhealthy???
20090202170526AAZ1Bb2	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to deal with someone who always putting you down?	so someone i thought was my best friend apparently isn't anymore. she replace me with my other friend. earlier last month she confronted me of something i was doing then said we weren't friends anymore. then i got sad and later i got her back. but every since then we haven't been as close like we were earlier. now all she wants to do is make little comments about me like appearance, my hair, or my little blemishes. honestly when shes with her guy friend its even worse, they continentally make fun of me and make me feel depressed. but then hours after that she pretends like nothing happened. when he's not around she acts perfectly fine. and its killing me inside cause i want to say a come back but i know better than that. so how do i confront whats happening and how i feel about it?

20090202173237AAWy9Lp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I discipline my wife?	I've been married for about a year and until now everything has been alright. Within the last month though, things have been going downhill.       Every day when I come home from work I expect dinner to be ready. A few weeks ago it wasn't and she had not even started cooking. I confronted her about it and she responded with a sarcastic comment about how I'm too lazy to cook for myself. I admittedly overreacted a little and started yelling which made her cry. She eventually did cook that night, but the same thing happened just the other day.      I'm thinking right now that the best punishment might be to not allow her to use the computer or take away her cell phone. Any thoughts or experiences with this issue?

My older brother had to take care of me and our 4 younger siblings since he was 6. he was more of a parent to us then our own parents. we moved in with my dad while my brother stayed with our mom for his last year of high school and to help our mom with her drinking problem.    the last time i saw my brother we got into a fight. he told me that i should forgive our parents because they are trying to make up for their mistakes. i told him that i would never forgive them or him because he basically abounded us. i told him that i hated him and our parents. now my brother might die.    i know my brother is a strong person and he has never failed at anything. but i can't help but be scared that i might really lose my brother. i'm not strong like he is. i was scared to be the older brother because of this move but if he dies then that mean i would will be the older brother. i don't want to lose my brother. i'm scared. everyone is scared. we are all praying and we are waiting for my mom to call us about how Will is doing.    how do i keep mine and my family hopes up? we are all so scared

20090202181829AAYRCt2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Bad Boy vs The Nice Guy: Which is preferred?	There is a difference between a door-mat and a "nice guy", so when I use the word "nice guy", I do not mean a spineless man who will allow a woman to walk all over him; what i'm referring to is a man who is utterly in love with his wife/GF and has as his greatest desire to make her happy. A man who goes out of his way to make his partner feel loved, appreciated, sexually appealing, and valued. Is this man (not the door-mat) a turn off to you women?     Typically I'm a huge jerk to women when I date them. I use them, I'm inconsiderate, I"m rude, and I'm just plane mean. The odd thing is when I display this type of behavior, the women fall in love with me, and can't seem to get enough of my attention. However, the few times I've been in love, I behave completely differently; I'm the exact opposite. I'm sweet, caring, attentive, respectful, and all I want is to make my partner feel loved and taken care of. The problem, is, anytime I show a woman that I actually care about her feelings, the see it as sometype of weakness and become inconsiderate and mean to me, which is why I'm usuall an !@ hole to women.    So, you women out there, what's the deal? Is a nice guy who actually cares about you a turn-off? Do you lose resepect for a man who loves you? I'm currently utterly in love with a woman; I adore her and my actions demonstrate it. Lately though, I've detected some thoughtless behavior from her. I'm afraid to show her I love her. Should I be  jerk to her? What do I do?
20090202182741AAFNDfb	Family & Relationships;Friends	I love my friends, but somedays I feel as though I dont' relate to them like I once did?	I'm a 23 year old student. I'm currently in graduate school and studying hard these next few months to get into medical school. I believe that I need to focus in order to do well, however, I do make time to go out with my friends once in awhile for dinner. I am naturally not an extreamly social person and over the years, I've found that I have started to drift from my friends a little bit. I love my friends, but over the past two years I've become more mentally engrossed with my research, career, and future. I don't believe that it's to my detriment - these are just things that I think about all the time. I read alot about world issues, join clubs, help advocate and the like. My friends sometimes seem annoyed that I don't go on MSN and just talk about movies and the like during the week, but I get home very late most days and usually have to get studying right away to get things done.      Am I at fault? I don't want to drift from my friends, but sometimes I feel as though I can't relate to them sometimes.

20090202191943AAsZDxK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me or not?	I go to college and had just finished my morning classes... after class I went to the dining hall to grab some food by myself and started talking to a really cute girl while I was eating.       She ended up staying talking to me for like 20 minutes at the table after she'd finished until I was done... and during the convo she told me "it's really rare to find a guy like you."      She also told me about herself and when I said, "that's the kind of stuff I look for in a girl" she smiled. She smiled again when I told her she had beautiful eyes... both times were the blushing kind of smile where her cheeks really lit up and her eyes creased and her face flushed red.      She also kept asking me a TON of questions about myself and my life and seemed really interested in finding out about me.      But without me asking about her relationship or anything she randomly mentions to me she's single and wants to be single for a while.

20090202192520AAImUAO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do I Get This Guy To Notice Me? Or Does He Already?	Well I met this guy thats new to my school and i thought hes really cute so I added him on Myspace and then we started talking and he added me in msn. We've never actually talked in person yet but every time I pass by him in the halls he looks at me straight in the eye. And once I tried to talk to him when he wasn't with any of his friends but I chickened out and right after that period the teacher let us out late and once I got outside my friend told me that he was waiting for me right outside my class but then he left. I really dont know if he likes me because he is really shy. He looks like he tries to talk to me but like me I guess we both chicken out. But when we talk in msn he doesn't look like he's shy and he has a lot of friends at school. So what should I do... The problem on me going up to him is that I'm kind of afraid of getting hurt by a guy it has happened before and I dont think i want it to happen again but i really want to give this guy a chance... So should I just go up to him and talk to him or what?       Thanks!

20090202132408AAw8oDt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So heartbroken i feel like dying =(?	I would ask people how to get my ex back and they warned me that an ex should stay an ex, that I'll regret it, but I didn't listen. I learned my lesson now, I really did. But I'm still madly in love with him, and the past three months that we've hung out EVERY weekend as just friends only made me fall deeper in love with him. But now I see how much he likes this other girl and just ignores me now that she's around. Valentine's Day is coming up so he'll probably ask her out. I never want to see him again because it would hurt too much to see him happy with her. I hope he's happy, but what can I do? I saw him Saturday but I already am dying from missing him and my heart is broken all over again. (we broke up in middle of august after going out for 1.5 months but I'd known him for many months before, and then we didn't see eachother for 2.5 months- until halloween. seen him every weekend since.) PLEASE HELP ME, I'm going crazy again. Those two months away from him completely crushed me, I don't want it to be that way again!

20090202133553AABc7ov	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why would someone give you this reason for breaking off your long partnership & engagement?	My partner (fiancee) of 7+ years suddenly ended our relationship one night and I'm still lost over what happened. Things were going well between the two of us when it happened but we were both depressed about our jobs. His excuse for breaking up was that he wanted to "find himself" and thought I should do the same. I don't get where this is coming from. He is about to finish college and I'm already done. We had plans to get married once we were settled and had worked out a ton of problems (even went to couple's counseling) so it seemed like we were communicating and relating really well when it happened!      He cried on me and swore he still loves me and wants me, that there is no other woman he wants and he's still attracted to me. So I asked WHY he was doing this. He said he "had" to...something about proving to himself that he could be independent and wanting me to do the same. He said not to hold out hope for us getting back together but that maybe someday it will happen (because there's always a place for me). I don't understand his reasoning at all. What the heck is that? He's never lied to me before and something told me he was telling me the truth by the look in his eyes.       We were each other's "firsts" if you know what I mean (we waited over 5 years into the relationship) so I am feeling really betrayed because I thought this was forever. We even had our kids' names picked out. Why the heck did he do this to me? I'd ask him but he says if he talks to me he'll break down!

20090202133846AAsbHS8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(Guys and girls) Can I guy do this.......?	....and only think of a girl as a friend, or do you think he has interest in her? Quick background: He moved away a long time ago and just last year we started talking (so it's all online talking mostly).      He:   -Stays up later than he usually would to talk to me. (At 1 AM he said he'd get off in 20 minutes but he ended up talking to me until 3:30)   -Once when he was on a slow computer late at night he asked to text instead and refused to go to bed when I said he should (so he could keep talking to me.) Then the next day says he had fun.   -We flirt sometimes (but we're joking so...)   -He always listens to me and gives me advice when I need it (but he's that kind of guy)   -He starts 95% of our convos.   -He invited me to this game site he plays on and he played with me on there even though he's WAY better than me and could have played with someone better.       BUT   -Last summer he said something that made it seem like he liked someone else (though he never talks about other girls to me).   -I don't think he's into having relationships online (since it would be sort of long distance), so idk if he likes me.      Do you think he likes me of he's just being my friend? Can a guy talk to a girl that much and not have any interet?

Ok I met this guy back in august of 08 and i fell in love with him very quickly and we dated last year for 6wks and he broke up with me because he didnt like the fact that he couldnt see me. but then in november he came back and said he made a stupid mistake and that he loved me and never should have done that and i was so happy. We just celebrated our 1 month on the 31st and i am crazy in love with him. We have never met in person but we talk everyday on the phone and text and everything and we both say we are in love with each other. Is that okay that i love someone ive never met? or am i just saying it to fill the void of having someone i could see everday? Cause i honestly think im very in love with him.

It has COMPLETELY devastated our whole family, especially my dads mother (who was here visiting him from Europe)       My dad was an unfunctional alcoholic 6 years ago, and finally stopped drinking. He completely changed his life around and I cant even describe in words what an amazing, loving, hard working, and strong person he was. He did everything for his family, and especially for his beloved mom (my grandma)      Anyway, now that he is dead, my grandma is so depressed. She has one other son, but he is a total retarded alcohol. When my dad was alive, he always wished for my uncle to be sober and change his life around as he did...but my uncle never listened.         How can I convince my uncle to stop drinking, so that he can take care of my grandma at this time of sadness, and so that he can change his life around and make my dad proud.
20090202134215AAQLgCs	Family & Relationships;Friends	How far would you go if a relative stole from you? ?	When my mother past away, my maternal grandmother raised my sister and me. She received SSI benefits for our care. My grandmother did something wonderful for my sister and me, she invested a portion of the money in the property we currently live on.     When my grandmother was ill my aunt (her daughter) convinced me to let her put her name on the title of my property, because I would have to pay an inheritance tax at that time. Short story is I found out she lied; my grandmother had a will stating that I was the executrix of her estate, she also put my aunt on it. Shortly after my grandmother past away, my aunt took the will and it has not been seen since. I have gone to court and hopefully all the legal documents will be recovered to move on with a probate.     My aunt transferred the property into her adult children names which has created additional problems. One, them thinking that their mother is within her rights.    I will never talk to any of these people again, but, now must decide if I want to sue them for all my sister and my grief. Insult on injury my aunt call my sister and said she had no intention of ever evicting her.     Thank you - within the law.

20090202134852AAZS8L1	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I help my mother?	I apologize in advance for the length.      My mother was recently diagnosed with Ankylosing spondylitis after having been to countless doctors, misdiagnoses, and wrong treatments. It took her 25 years to get a diagnosis. The disease is hereditary and affects .5-1% of the population. She also had breast cancer last year. This year, my grandfather was diagnosed with bladder, lung, and bone cancer. He only has about 2 months left. My Pop goes to the same oncologist as my mother did, and she accompanies him to every chemo treatment. My mom had recent bloodwork to check for some other disease they thought she might have (she doesn't have it.) This morning when she went with my Pop to the oncologist, the doctor came in and asked her if it'd be alright to tell my grandfather the news. (she assumed it was the negative bloodwork.) So she said yes. The doctor went on to tell my mother that the disease she has is hereditary and he is the likely giver. My grandfather has already lost a son (mom's brother died when he was 25,) and now he thinks he's the reason my mother has been suffering her whole life, and that his predicament is what she will end up like. He's only cried twice in my mother's presence; the death of his son, and now this. She thinks he's going to go to his grave thinking he failed.       Not to mention my poor grandmother! She's losing her husband, lost her son, and saw her daughter suffer through cancer and this disease.       My mother hasn't come down from her bedroom all day, and I'm worried about what this is doing to her (psychologically.) She and her family has already been through so much. HOW CAN I HELP HER?! =(    She's also worried that I might have this disease too.

20090202134713AAVRsKG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to break up with my boyfriend but I don't know how...?	I really want to break up with my boyfriend of two months.  He is a year younger than I am though.  All my friends are saying "No, don't do it, don't do it, you'll break his little heart." But I rarely see him because we're in different grades and he's a little immature. He never really knows what to say or do to me.  Ugh...help!
20090202203954AAL5kB3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should be done about this girl?	Okay first off I'm writing for my brother.       There is this girl he met a few years ago who liked him but he didn't like her. She accepted this and got a boyfriend.    He never even liked her as a friend but she always texted him and said that he was her best friend. He never saw her and still over the course of 6 months when they didn't see each other once (and they only live 12 miles apart) she claimed he was her best friend.    When she broke up with her boyfriend she somehow got the impression that meant her and my brother were dating (note: my brother is a major pushover) My brother tried to set her straight but she failed (They still hadn't seen each other in almost 10 months)   My brother being the pushover gutless guy he is asked his friend to text her for him. His friend went beyond rude but he got rid of him and there was no contact for 3 months. During this time my brother got a new cell phone = new cell phone #   So she had no way of contacting him. He liked this because he didn' want to talk to her. Until a few days ago when she e-mailed him and apologized and asked to still be best friends.   My brother is having a hard time with this because he doesn't know what to say to her. He doesn't want to hurt her because he is the type that wants everyone to be happy but at the same time he won't be happy.    What should he do?   Should he agree be just friends with her? (He won't mean it because he said that before and it meant nothing)   Should he tell her they cant be anything?    Should he ignore her?      He knows that if he takes her back she will be in his life for a long time in the future. She's very clingy. And he doesn't want that.      Wat should be done to make this as painless for the both of them as possible?

20090202201552AALnEg8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Adults - Has anyone dated a recovered addict? I'm feeling left out...or puzzled...?	I posted this here bc i'm not 15 and wanting to know what do with my crush (singles & dating)...anyway....      My BF and father of my baby due in June is a good person. He is a recovered drug addict & has done a lot to turn his life around. We have a relationship with very deep feelings & a lot of passion.       However, he goes through these periods where he will completely shut me out (mostly when he is struggling with "inner demons" & issues that are hard for him to process). He will also make comments that hurt my feelings like "why do you have to invade on my time?" when we're apart & I text him. He usually realizes how he has come off & apologizes...      but I'm wondering, what can I do to avoid feeling so hurt & left out when he withdraws inward, or turns toward his NA or AA friends? I know about AlAnon, but any other suggestions?
20090202134301AAeH2wi	Family & Relationships;Friends	What is the world's smallest violin?	ok. so, i was relaying the story of my grandfather's recent death to a friend and in the middle of it he said, "hey, check this out.  i'm playing the world's smallest violin."  he was rubbing his thumb and index finger together with his 3 other fingers out straight.  he made some weird face like he was listening to classical music or something.  i am not sure what that meant but i felt like he was being an @sshole and as i was really distraught i freaked out and beat him pretty badly.  he had to go to the hospital because i broke some bones, including his jaw.      when i went to see him, his girlfriend and family members were in the room and when i entered they all looked at me and stared.  his girlfriend, who i am also close with, started yelling at me and while she was berating me i said, "i'm sorry but i can't hear you because i'm busy playing the world's smallest violin" and proceeded to make the same hand motion and facial gesture that my friend made at me.      everyone looked really pissed so i just walked out.      can someone please explain to me what the hell happened?
20090202204831AAMGCy5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	**Desperate** Am I doing something wrong ?	Hi, i have been married for 12 yrs, and I always feel like i'm not good enough. My husband is good to me and very sweet to me, but he has always had porn around and I don't like it, but we recently went through a tornado and now he don't have it anymore. Know he keeps getting pics on his phone from his friends of girls, and I have told him that on several occasions that I don't like it but he don't seem to care. Why doesn't he understand that it hurts me and makes me feel like i am not good enough, or beautiful in his eyes. I know he loves me, and i know part of it comes from his dad (personal), but it still hurts.I have been a good wife and very faithful to him,but I can't help feeling that way. Is there anything I can do ?

Last semester this guy made eye contact with me in the hallway. he was really staring and not smiling so I had to look away (i'm shy).      He is in one of my classes this semester where we all have to say something in class about a topic the professor brings up and he always brings up stuff that he hears my friend and I talk about before class (outside of class I think he listens in to our conversations) and the stuff he brings up are irrelevent to the course...this is a religous course (like nintendo, video games, perfume which he described as what I wear etc)...he's done this 4 times. I see him looking over at us sometimes but he also looks at everyone.      I have never talked to him ever but he came and stood right beside me today but I didn't know what to say and he was about to talk to me till another person came up beside him and started talking to him. Is this his way of hinting that he likes me or is he just making fun of me & finding ways to do this??
20090202194827AAjeIlF	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend seems to enjoy saying hurtful things to me?	She'll randomly insult me and she may think that she's kidding, but it really does hurt.

Or if she talks to a guy I like she'll say things like he said you were kinda cute.   One time, this boy I was *madly in love with* was talking to her and she asked if he liked me point blank and she seriously told he said I was ugly and that just crushed me.   Why would she try to hurt my feelings by telling me these things?Is it fun for her or something?   Please help!   Thanks   -el

I'm pregnant and i have been loving this guy for an entire 8 months now and well things are confusing between us and i really like him but he is so confusing. I feel that he plays games with me and stuff but he's also sweet and well i dont know what to do. he stopped calling me for like a month and now we're talking again and he's telling me that we're gonna be family once this baby is born if it's his; (long story but he might be the dad and can also not be) well he's super sweet but i dont know if i should really believe him.      he's not a bad guy at all. he actually wants to be the dad and he's getting a DNA test done. i really dont think he is since i had sex with the other guy so many times. anyways, my question is what do you think i should do about him? i really regret what is going on and really wish i could change time...   anyways, the reason i am so confused is because i really love him and dont want to lose him but i dont know if i should trust him either. and im so scared what would happen if the baby it's not his....      do you think i should write him a letter telling him how i feel or just keep pretending that i have a bf and that i dont care anymore?? oh yeah i told him i have a bf but i really dont i just wanted him to believe that and suddenly he acts all jealous and saying all this stuff about me that i better not be having sex with my "bf"...and it makes me smile all the time. what should i do??

My honey works for an oil field company, recently they cut his hours and we started wondering if they were going to close his branch of the office. He started looking for other jobs that would pay the same amount or better, but so far we haven't had any luck in finding anything. Today they had a big mandatory company meeting and told everyone they were closing his branch of the company. When he told me about it tonight I could see how upset he was and he told me he felt like a failure, we're having an extremely difficult time making ends meet, but we are getting by. Barely.       We were going to move into a new place, then the property company told us that the place we were going to move into was no longer available (after we had been approved but before we signed the lease), but we'd already handed over the keys to our old place and it had already been rented out. So we had to move in with my parents temporarily.       Now he feels like he's a failure because we didn't get moved and because he's getting laid off. How can I help him see that I don't blame him for these things and that he isn't a failure?

20090202193359AACtP3l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did I cause my girlfriend to bleed during sex?	Ok so my girlfriend is 16 and I'm a little but older but still a teen so don't get the wrong idea here. Anyway it was only our second time doing it, but we are both experienced and yea something strange happened when I was penetrating her deep.      When I pulled out I noticed I had blood on my penis, and she was really embarrassed but said I went so deep that I popped her cherry. But that's impossible because shes not a virgin and has had a lot of experience even though shes only 16. And yea there is no way it took this long for some guy to pop her cherry.      She is not a whore either, she has just had a lot of drunken experience and she has been very sexual in her relationships because a guy told her he loved him just so he can get in her pants whenever he wanted.      But I'm concerned because it hurt her, and shes not on her period because she has not bleed since then. Shes actually expecting her period but it can't be, there would of been a lot more blood and she would know of course.      Any ideas what I did I went in as deep as it goes. She seems to not want to talk about it, and was shying away from going at it again a second time that same day.

20090202204657AAvKzRL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Was it a bad idea to apologize to her?	A few weeks ago, I ran into a girl I used to date. Things didn't work out but instead of telling me how she felt, she made up some story about moving to another country. When she tried talking to me I was mean to her and told her off, even though she apologized for lying to me. I was still mad at her for lying to me. But then I started to think about it and I felt kind of bad for doing that. The next time I saw her, I apologized for being mean to her and since then we've been on good terms since then. One of my friends thinks that I shouldn't have apologized to her because all that did was make me look weak and it now allows her to walk over me again, like she did the last time.

20090202194035AAuO0TA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I always re-play memories of my ex and me?	Well, to put it short, my ex boyfriend pursued me again after breaking up with me.  We basically were on and off from June-December. We were "on" during winter break but without the label. He even said that he wanted to work things out but we both agreed to hold off on the label. Then another girl comes along; and he totally forgets about me. No contact. No calls, texts, NOTHING. We have not talked for a month now. I don't want him back because he's such a jerk.. and I know that now. I am actually relieved to be rid of him. I have a class with him everyday. Even though I know he is a jerk now, I always think back on when he wasn't a jerk: during the summer. When I hear songs that make me think of the summer and "us", I still get sentimental. I know it's not that long but it was my first relationship and I feel like I should be over it by now, but it is constantly on my mind. I know I should keep busy, and I have been, but I'm always constantly re-playing great memories between us in my head and it's getting old. Any idea on how to cope with this? (BTW-I'm 17).

I've known him for a month now and he's been thinking of converting to Islam for atleast 3 months. He's 15 and i'm 15 next week. He's thinking of converting after his GCSE's which is in July/August.   People have been telling him if my family find out that we're going out, they'll kill him but i know that's not true because only strict famillies do stuff like that and mine aren't strict.   We really love eachother and we're serious about eachother. I really don't want anyone to find out about us but a few people at school already know but we deny it. I don't mind the white people knowing because they're mature about it whereas the asians at school are so immature and pathetic.   Please tell me what to do, i don't want to lose him :( x

20090202194410AAgS7UB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is Sex a Requirement in Marriage?	My husband and I have had a strained relationship for months now.  We seldom talk, and when we do, it usually ends up in an argument.  I am trying to focus on the kids and involve myself in other things so that this deterioration does not hurt so much.  He is now sleeping in another room.    His only focus is resuming our sex life.  Which makes me resent him even more.  It would be nice to hear a few kind words once in a while.  He only seems to react to the loss of our sex life.  I miss the nice conversations and companionship we once had.    I refuse to be here to just fulfill his needs.  What kind of a marriage is that.  If I give in, I think that things will only worsen.  I could use some advise.  And yes, I have talked to him about my feelings until I am blue in the face.

He feels that he has to be playing video games 24/7 since he had gotten laid off.  It's like we are roommates now.  I'm in one room and he is in the other.  I have nothing against video games.

20090202193524AAplkRa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Getting to know a male teacher?	I consider myself a pretty rational person and not one to "fall in love" with someone at first glance. I've never had a crush before in my life, and I've never been attracted to anyone either. Last week as I was walking through the hallway at my high school, I made eye contact with a male teacher that I had never seen before.      It was the weirdest, most incredible 30 seconds of my life.       Now I cant stop thinking about that moment. I'm not infatuated and I don't find the guy incredibly attractive or anything.       Any advice on how to strike up a conversation with him? I see him often around the school, but have no idea what it is to say.       I DONT want to start a relationship with him. I just want to maybe get to know him better and figure out his deal.      Thanks in advance! =]
20090202193638AA8pUe8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Random Opinions? Falling In Love?	Okay any ideas on falling in love at a young age. 13-14 to be exact. Now before you go on a power strike, I know he's probably not my soul mate, or my true love, or even the guy I'm gonna marry. but right now i think my heart really does belong to him. He's 2 yrs older than me, a little troubled, doesn't like to talk about stuff, has a few problems and tends to keep the weight of the world on his shoulders. We dated once for a few months and I've known him for little over a year. He was the only guy to ever truly break my heart, now he loves his new girlfriend. and after everything he's put me through I would still take a bullet for him, without a second thought, or regret. I just really care about him and I don't care if he loves her and I can only be his friend, but I'm just confused. I think that's love. Do i love him? And even bigger, am I 'IN LOVE' with him? i don't really know anything anymore, now do I? A little advice or anything?

20090202193821AAJUyeK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married men only......?	I have this married guy (who seriously is like a brother to me,stepbrother to be exact) coming after me. I mean it's been going on for a few months now and I'm 19 while he's in his early 30s (i think? not too sure). At first it was just hugging and compliments then he started kissing me ...and then the touching began.he never has approached me in a sexual way before this. Honestly, i thought he hated me...

20090202193841AARd4Wf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I get custody of my kids back?	I have three beautiful kids, 8,6 and 2. My two year old lives with me but in August my older children were court ordered to live with their father (my ex-husband). We have been going to court for almost 8 years and up until this point they lived with me. I was in a bad relationship with my younger sons dad and my ex got wind of it. He used that as leverage to obtain custody. The judge never said one ill thing about me but was concerned with my younger sons dad being involved in the children's lives. I have been apart from my 2nd ex for almost 1 1/2 years. If the courts found nothing wrong with me as a parent and the children wish to be with me then why can i get them back??? How can i get them back?? I really cant afford a attorney, and i am willing to do all the leg work but need help. Also my ex-husbands new wife is treating my kids like sh!t... why would she treat them so poorly when they are already going through so much. Someone please help! I'm in northern CA; if you or anyone you know can help please let me know! Thanks - MC
20090202193946AAMa2Bd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Questions about alimony?	I found out that my xwife will owe me alimony every month. My concern is that it comes with strings. I really cannot move on with my life. I want her out of personal life and only deal with her for the kids. Do i have the right idea about alimony?
20090202075725AAhvL7V	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	So many requirements ?	I recently went to court with my xwife. Turns out she will owe me alimony. The problem is I am overseas and do not qualify because I am overseas. I am suppose to be a resident in order to collect alimony. I meant a lady overseas as well and will marry her at some point then the alimony would stop anyway. Does this make sense?
20090202194034AAQrNxT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend told me a secret ?

The last time he did this was last year and when she told me this she was shaking and crying. I dont know what to do could someone please help me because i love her with all my heart and i want to help her.
20090202194126AAbjvcL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend a bad guy for me, or is he in love with me, therefore, a good guy..?	My boyfriend and I have had a 2 week break, my fault, I needed some space and I had an accident, I wouldn't see him, trust issue.  He said he looked at my myspace page all of the time, and why didn't I change my picture.    I saw him just now, and doesn't like the way I don't ever call him, and make him feel wanted like other girls have done in the past, and he has such strong feelings for me, but that it makes him unhappy that he may be wrong for me, because of our differences.  and he wanted to know whether I missed him, and then said: "you don't, do you, I can't read  your signs".  Then he asked me: "what are we going to do about us"?  He didn't think I did miss him, he kept wanting to hold me, and then said that we had a few differences, like I wouldn't try E once, and I didn't want children in the far off future  and at the end he went home to sleep and whispered in my ear, "you know I love you don't you, I really love you, and that's why I get so sad"..    He then said that he would like to stay the night soon, it sounded like this week    We are both in our late 30s.    What does all of this mean..?
20090202194436AA6lj67	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I told my crush I like him... now what?	ok, so me and this guy are both really shy (we'll call him Dan) and I told Dan I liked him last week. we still dont talk alot, but enough to make light conversation. plus since I told him he looks at me more, (so does his friend) and his friend (friendly) punches Dan in the shoulder when I say hi to him. and he stands around after class until I leave. (but he hasn't come up to me)    So I don't know what I should do. we're both really shy but i dont know what to do next

20090202194411AAd7TC8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can this be mended or is it time to move on?	So me and my gf have been together for 21 months but for the past few weeks it feels like i forgot why i liked her and wanted to be with her but when i try to remember it instantly gets clouded with negative thoughts. I know that relationships have their moments but i dont know if we should move on or try to make it work. Lately we have been having arguments that havent really gotten worse or better and it would always be over something that we cant remember but whenever we do it feels like im the only one trying to solve them all because whenever she replys all she says is whats the point, why dont you just find a new gf, i give up, this is pointless, it cant be solved or fixed. and once we said our thing one of those makes us forget the argument and we become how we were beforehand and never touch the subject again yet now its like its all coming back up at once and i cant solve it. We touched up on the subject last saturday and she told me her thoughts and how she hides her feelings and other stuff but today it feels like to me she just wants to truly give up. we have broken up before (last year around the same time as now) and i was truly heartbroken crying and all but now i just feel this heavy pressure on my chest yet my head and my heart are still strong and that im not going to run away from the problems like i did before and try to work toward finding an answer

20090202194459AAFteH0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I dare try dating her again?	So I dated this girl for a month, I thought our dates went well, I asked if she wanted to be BF/GF. She said no, said she really liked me and wanted to keep dating and be better friends first. In the next week I texted her 4 times and tried to start 2 IM conversations. She ignored all of them and sent 1 text asking how my classes were going, ignoring my responding question about how hers were.      After that I decided she really didn't care and stopped trying to talk to her. I assumed we were done after 2 weeks went by with no attempt at conversation, but she just IM'd me today asking what's up. She easily could have not spoken to me again, we live in seperate cities, it's an hour drive for me to see her for these dates, odds are we never would have met again.      Did she actually care and finally just break down after I stopped trying? Or is she just playing me? I'm not sure how I feel towards her right now and want some feedback before I make any commitments....

20090202201036AAUkR9Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she really my best friend? ?	I've been best friends with this girl for 5 years. Three years ago, we didn't talk because she started liking my ex boyfriend (who wasn't talking to me at the time) and so she left me for him even though he had a girlfriend. Finally after a few months, she called me and apologized over an hour long conversation and we became friends again. Last year, my friend had a boyfriend who she constantly had problems with and I helped her though it all. All she ever talked about was him and we even had a few three way conversations? I also played third wheel a lot (talk about awkward lol) Towards the end of this past summer and the beginning of the schoolyear, she started liking this one guy who she talked nonstop about. About a month into the schoolyear, i started liking this guy who my friend approved of. What i didn't know was that while the guy i liked was dating his ex, my friend was flirting with him constantly and acted like she liked him. (even though she had another guy) When him and I liked each other, everything was fine and i talked to my best friend about him and she said nothing but good things but then it turned into a competiton. The day i told her that the guy i liked kissed me, she wanted to kiss the guy she liked. Then when i was asked out by my guy, she was asked out three days later by her guy. It got awkward because everytime i'd talk to my friend on the phone about my boyfriend, she'd change the subject. After about a month of dating, she basically pushed me out of being her friend. She stopped calling me, said i only ever talked about my boyfriend (behind my back), and was just rude to me. Now, we don't even talk. I want to be friends with her but i dont understand if I did anything to make her hate me. She never said that she liked the guy i'm currently dating because she liked someone else. I don't know what to do!

He is in the army and is stationed in Germany right now and will be there for 2 more years while I live in Louisiana and am going to college. He's 22 and I'm 19. We want to get married when he comes to visit in the summer because he would get extra pay and we would be doing awesome financially. We were going to save it so we could buy a house when he gets back from Germany. We know for sure we want to be together forever and we have talked about it A LOT. His parents also support us 100% but the problem is my parents will totally not allow it. I haven't told them yet but I just know how they would react. They just want me to finish college but I know if I tell them this then they will think I'm moving to Germany with him but really I'm going to stay here and finish college. Then we're going to have a big wedding once I'm done with college and he's back from Germany. Any advice on how to tell them?
20090202201233AASeuf3	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it appropriate to squirt your teenager with water when they don't follow orders?	My Ex said that when our 13 year old child is at his home, and she is not following orders; such as being asked to hand something over she is hiding and she refuses, it is ok to spray or squirt water on her? He said that it is his way of not having to pull, push, or tug on her in any way that could harm her. He persisted to tell me that he read this on a parenting web-site on "How to handle your teenager".  Personally I feel that this is a way to handle an animal not a child.  I am just looking for an outsiders perspective... Is this wrong of him?
20090202201257AAsKG3U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Troubles with my 'ex best friend' she wants to be mates again after what she did... should i?	a couple yrs back we were really really close then at the end of the school yr we both moved to different schools. we tried to stay in contact but eventually she didnt give me the time of day (had a new group). I was quite upset especially as i just broke up with my bf so i didnt really have a network of close friends anymore. I eventually built my network up again and suddenly 6 months ago she wants to hang out all the time. i then found out no one liked her anymore at her other school which was the reason she wanted to hang out. I took her in again forgetting what she did to me last time. Now a few weeks ago she got her drivers license (which me and my new good friend had already as we are 1 yr older).

20090202201708AArO1jx	Family & Relationships;Family	Can someone please edit my essay?	As a thirty- four year old woman who once endured an unstable home life, teen pregnancy, and a period of homelessness, I realize the necessity and value of an education. My life experiences have impelled me to further my education and pursue a Master’s degree in Social Work. I have prevailed through numerous tribulations and my goal is to become a social worker so I can, in return, ensure that others will overcome life’s hardships.      During my childhood, I lived in a single parent family household with my mother. Our relationship suffered due to numerous arguments and a lack of understanding one another. Needless to say, when I confided in my mother that I was pregnant, our relationship completely dissipated. There was too much family conflict and the environment became increasingly unhealthy. Eventually, I became homeless. Everyday became a constant struggle. Not only was I homeless, but I was about to have a baby, had no money and no support. I felt alone as though nobody cared about my situation. However, I eventually found a shelter on Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Thankfully, at the shelter, I met a social worker who helped ease my concerns. She provided constant support and gave me a sense of hope. She encouraged me to resolve my conflict with my mother and return home. When I moved back home, I made a sincere effort to heal my relationship with my mother.      Six months later, I found a job as a counselor, working with adolescents who had experienced similar situations to mine. I began my preparation to achieve my personal goal while I worked at Harbor View Adolescent Center, a level-14 group home facility, as a youth counselor. My primary work responsibility was serving as a positive role model for adolescents from twelve to eighteen years of age. The adolescents had backgrounds of being homeless and victims of physical and sexual abuse. Others had problems with drug and alcohol abuse, depression, and the criminal justice system. At times, the position was extremely stressful but I discovered that I had the ability to connect with the children and develop strong emotional ties with them. I focused upon several areas of treatment, including their social skills, coping skills, and independent living skills. My main ambition was to help them build their self-esteem and improve their sense of security.  As a youth counselor, I gained valuable experience in listening to adolescents and helping them make positive decisions to improve the quality of their lives.       From my personal experiences, I learned that I had the ability to persevere through my most challenging times. I developed empathy for people struggling with everyday problems and, most importantly, I learned the importance of having support from my family. I am committed to helping others achieve personal growth and take an interest in their own well- being. As a result of my homelessness, I understand the constant despair and frustration experienced by those who find it challenging to cope with life’s everyday problems. I am also convinced that increasing one’s own sense of empowerment can make the difference between a future of despondency or one filled with hope.      I am applying to the Master’s in Social Work program because it is my goal to help others embrace their inner potential and make a positive life transition. Most importantly, I want to become a professional social worker because I want to do everything that is within my power to enhance the quality of a person’s life. I want to address the needs of all people in my community; especially it’s most vulnerable or “at-risk” members.  I am deeply committed to the service of others, and most specifically to the service of troubled and neglected youth. I am confident that I will succeed as a social worker and transform the lives of many.      I have always been deeply concerned about the welfare of the most vulnerable members of our society, particularly troubled and neglected youth. I believe that each of us has a duty to help and serve others, to seek out marginalized and less fortunate members of our communities and offer any aid we are able. I have always lived by the motto “do unto others as you would have done to you,” and feel that the best way to express this belief is to devote my life to social justice. I feel that respect and dignity are the foundations upon which social justice is built. It recognizes that every human being is worthy of respect and possesses dignity, prevents injustice, affords basic human rights, and fosters self-confidence. When we as a society try to see the world through the eyes of the less fortunate, we can empathize with and understand one another instead of focusing on our differences. Only when each and every member of a community is able to earn the same level of dignity and respect can a society truly be called civilized. Those who cannot demand social justice for themselves must have a voice to demand it for them. It is my hope that I can be t

Alright, so I thought Id call one of my friends whom I havent seen in months and I thought I would call her to see how she was doing. Well everytime I call, the phone doesnt ring but there is just an automated voice message that comes on and says your message was too short, but there was never a voicemail greeting, nor did it give me time to leave a message, and then it keeps saying press whatever number if your satisfied with the messsage. And I havent heard from her since, idk if shes not getting the calls or if her phone is messed up. Does anybody know whats going on??????         Additional Details      But then Id try calling again and then it rings but then it doesnt connect but does the beeping noise like its busy and the phone disconnects. ???   It just goes back and forth, from the not ringing and automated voice message to the ringing but busy signal. what is going on???

20090202201908AAjRZLT	Family & Relationships;Family	Teenager has cleaning problems...?	My teenager (13) has some issues when it comes to cleaning. How much do you think she should have to work? She keeps her room perfectly clean (I never have to ask her to fix it up), and her bed is usually made. She is a good student in school as an 8th grader- she gets a 4.0 and has all 'E's in citizenship. All she does though is come home, do homework, occasionally go to soccer or basketball practice and then watch t.v. for the rest of the night. Whenever I ask her to clean up after dinner or clean the kitchen or anything, she gets really upset and asks repetitivly why her sister (10) hardly ever has to clean. I already give my thirteen year old daughter $20 a month for allowance.

20090202202215AALY1eM	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Thank you cards for engagement gifts?	So I'm new at this..but since we've opted out of having an engagement party, we've just started recieving engagement gifts from people, and some appliances etc that people are getting rid of. I'm grateful, but some just arent my taste and also, we are running out of room to store stuff, and we havent even registered or had any showers yet! (Plus, clutter and useless stuff - ie, the not my taste candle holders we just recieved - drives me insane, I'm constantly purging my possesions lol). I honestly do appreciate the thoughts though (I am probably a bad person).      Anyway, my initial question is, do we send thank you cards out for engagement gifts or things we recieve from people randomly (the toaster oven)? I hadnt planned on buying thank you cards yet...how does this even work? We've thanked them verbally, but still.      Again, sorry, I'm new at this! lol.

20090202202337AA5y8Ev	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP: I Harshly Ignored This Girl And Now She's Sad, What Do I Do?	This girl and I were kinda dating but not really super officially, then I got sick of her so I kinda brutally ignored her for a few days, and then today I looked at her and she looked at me and she looked SO sad like she was going to cry. But you know, I think the reason I ignored her is because I'm a little insecure and it made me feel better, I know it's a horrible thing to do and I am sorry beyond belief but I know that's no excuse for what I did. So anyway, what do I do? We had some good times together and I don't want our relationship to be hurt. I don't necessarily want her back, I just want to fix my mistake, I think she's a really cool person. Thanks!

20090202202723AANaUBN	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why do things have to get so hard when you love someone?	Loving someone never gets easier. It doesn’t get harder either, love just grows stronger. So one thing that used to be easy, changes into something that makes your heart break over and over again. Being married to someone who is gone half the time is difficult, it is even move difficult when the other person doesn’t show it. I make decisions based on my heart, and he makes them based on whats best. I don’t think either is right or wrong. Maybe it is just easier for one to be away. The first deployment wasn’t too horrible, I only knew him for 4 months before he had to leave and I knew what I was getting myself into. Even though I only knew him for 4 months I still cried the whole car ride back to my college. He proposed when he came home for R&R and we got married one day after came home. Our love continued to grew stronger and stronger each day that passed on. Everyday we told each other it would get easier. We had a beautiful baby girl who is now 5 months old. I spend every day with her and feel so blessed that I am able to do so. And part of me is sad that my husband cant do the same. I know he loves his daughter move than life itself.       Today we came across another dilemma, he got orders to move to a different location, and this is because he has to deploy next jan. I was so excited to move, I spend the whole day looking for a house and found the perfect one. I was ready to get out of this shitty town, ready to be somewhere where it is just him and I and out baby girl, and out dogs of course. Money is a proble, he is only 23 and I am only 20, so like most people our age we are doing OK… since we have some money to pay of he doesn’t think it’s a good idea for me and our daughter to move to the house yet, since we really don’t have the money to do that right now. He wants to pay of our credit card which will only take us 6 months now, and have us move then. Meanwhile he spends the time where he is assigned to, and comes to visit us on the weekend.       I know…doesn’t sound like such a bad idea. But the fact that he is deploying in jan. which means I don’t really get to see him for 6 months brings tears to my eyes. This means I will only spend 5 months with him before he deploys and misses a whole year of my daughters life and my life. I hate it. It never seems to get easier. I don’t know what do to…I love him so much but I feel like my heart is breaking over and over again when he has to leave. I hate doing things alone, I hate sleeping alone, I hate making dinner for one. Movies are not the same. It is a horrible thing having to go a whole year without a kiss or a hug from the man i want to spend every minute of every day with. Especially when everything around me  reminds me of him.       Im sorry for the long rant….i have been sitting here crying because I don’t know what to do anymore.
20090202202745AAoQNq2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i listen to my friends or myself?	So basically theres a guy i like, my friends don't really like him and say i deserve better. They don't like him because he lied to me awhile ago tell me he slept with 20 girls when in reality he's only slept with 1. They also don't like him because he smokes weed, but that doesn't bother me, its not an all the time thing, its only like once a month or so. So they tell me i'm wasting my time with him and i should just stop trying to be more than friends with him. So what do you all think?? So should i listen to my friends or myself??

20090202202809AAgAX0v	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I;m in my thirties should I leave my marriage I'm not happy!?	I'm so frustrated in my life and I think I made a very bad choice of marrying my current husband.We've been married for about 2 yrs our problem far goes to like no romance, affection or cold turkey sex. He's just retired from the military and adjusting to staying home looking for a job. He blames not finding a job as to being selfish to my needs or celebrating our anniversary of 2 yrs mind you, this will be the first of time we celebrated our anniversary in which he promised to go through with it. Now he doesn't want to celebrate it and I'm fed up. We don't have sex anymore and I don't know why I steady take birth control because we don't have it. I'm 31 and he's 39. No kids lives with us its just us. I'm taunted going out with gf and their finding men to date and satisfy them. I constantly fight with him over this and wants to leave him.He acts like he's a zombie like he doesn't get it and I don't want to stay around him. Our sex life has been inactive and no romance I guess when we got married. Is this tell tell signs that I need to leave him. I'm very attractive and men see that I'm not a happy person. I'm more meaner now and that's never been me. I just feel like a dragon that wants to unleash a huge ball of fire on my dumb *** husband because he doesn't get it even after seeking help many times before. I feel frustrated and the men I see out there aren't my cup of tea. They see me and they want me in bed. So I'm a little hesitant to leave because I feel this is what I will face once I'm on my own.I'm just not getting the perks out of this marriage. What should I do? I will accept real answers and no bull $%^& remarks.

20090202203120AAM4xSp	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should i believe in my boyfriend?	We were best friends before we started going out 4 months ago. The transition took place around my birthday. My friends planned a surprise birthday party, & one of my friends, A was in charge of inviting him as a surprise guest coz they knew i really like him & we've been meeting up every week. After the birthday weekend, other friend told me that the guy (my boyfriend now) & A were txting each other. I assumed it was just to settle my birthday dinner plan. Well, last week, the topic came up while i was chatting with my boyfriend (we're in a LDR right now, i'll get back soon). And he admitted that they did txt each other. What hurts me is that he txted her to ask what she was up to. He said that he txted her to get to know me better, but when i asked for him to tell me what was it that he asked her to get to know me, he couldnt think of anything specific-just said that it was generic. We didnt talk for a week, then yesterday I found out another thing...I found out he txted her after my birthday dinner & that was when we started going out. He said he txted her to keep in touch & to ask if there were any more fancy celebration for my birthday. And now im confused coz firstly, he told me before he txted her to get to know me better but now he said to keep in touch? & then, at first he said he only txted her before my birthday dinner when we werent going out, but now he said that they txted after my birthday dinner as well? And the cheek of him, getting mad at me coz i got mad!      The thing is, this 'friend' of mine, found him cute, thinks i'm lucky to have him, CHEATED on her boyfriend! And the girl had the nerve to take pictures of back/side of his head & posted on a social networking site. I can get if she's being a hoe & txt him first, but he txted her first as well..      Theres more to the story, but that's the gist, i guess.       I am so confused, i don't know what to do. I really love my boyfriend, & i've always been afraid of feeling betrayed by him but now i feel like i'm betrayed. What do you think?
20090202203121AAyh5Vk	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do i get to be with this girl?	A year and a half ago I met the absolute girl of my dreams while I was in Mexico. She had a bf at the time so nothing more than just heavy flirting developed but now she is single and we have a great chemistry and friendship. We talk on the phone and write each other now. She says she really wants to be in a relationship with me, but the distance is obviously a huge problem. Not to mention that her family likes me, but wouldn't want us together. I want to be with her but I don’t see how it could happen. I don't see how I could live in Mexico for financial reasons, but I would move there if necessary. And it will be a while till she will be eligible to come here. Maybe sneak her in? What can I do to give this a chance? I will do next to anything to make it work out. Any good advice will be appreciated.

It started off as a casual sex thing but then later on developed into a relationship. She has a little boy who is 5yrs old and he's great and doesnt have a problem with me at all and I dont have any issues with the kid at all. Latley my girlfriend has been telling me that she feels she is holding me back from experiencing a full life and sleeping with other girls (she is my first) I've told her once not to say that because it just makes me feel bad, like what am i suppose to do then? I love her so much and she loves me. I'm at her house almost every night, her family loves me to death. It just doesn't seem like she is taking me seriously as a boyfriend. She has mentioned that she wants to have another baby but she said it in a joke kinda way, but she has been telling me that she does want one, one day.. no time soon. I'd love to have a baby with her, everyday i wake up with her is a blessing. I just dont know how to make her see that im serious about her and i dont know how to make her see that i am serious.

20090202203213AAKUQOV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is he in love with me?	How can you tell if a guy youre dating is in love with you?   I know this is a hard question to ask.....but here's some facts about when we're together that maybe you can help me figure out. i think he may (he hasnt said it) but i dont know tell me what you think?.........   first off he calls me every day (i rarely get the chance to call first), he'll call meon his lunch break (or text me, cos if im working at the same time he's on break he cant call) ....he'll call me seriously the second he gets out of work and we'll usually talk from anywhere from 10-20mins (and this is every day).   he'll sometimes call before he goes to bed (or definetly will text me). when we hang out and are parting (either me from his house or vice versa) he makes it a point to call me the second he gets home (or insists i call him to make sure i get home ok).   when we are together......esp out in public, hes big on PDA's (public display of affection)......i noticed the other night at blockbuster, there were some cute girls across the way......he didnt seem to care that they were there (like most guys do, they have the wondering eye.....i notice that, but he didnt, if anything, he put his arm, around my arm in a linking chain sort of way, held my hand and then kissed it).   he called me one day cos a song was on his mp3 shuffle in his car that reminded him of me (just to say "hey our song is on, just wanted to let u know")   he does all the typical stuff, holding of the door, helping me with his coat on and always taking me out and paying.   we hang out anywhere from 1-3xs a week. (we both equally initiate plans.....me more so on saturday, but if we hang out extra days, like during the week, if he has free time from work and working on his masters he'll iniate those plans, that may happen like every other week or so.   i noticed on his iphone, his wallpaper is a picture of us.   ive met his parents (a bunch of times, and we've only been dating for 2 months).   we were out to dinner one night a buddy of his called, he was like 'i cant talk right now, ill call u later, im out with my girl"   when we're together, either his parents house or mine.......sitting on the couch, he always has to be snuggled with me one way or another, either just holding my hand, or with his arms around me, or even leaning on me so that im behind him and i have no choice to put my arms around me......he'll always kiss me here and there, either kiss my hand, my arm (if my arms are around him coming from behind) my cheek, head, or anywhere that he can. hes verrrrrrrrrrry affectionate with me.   ive met his friends.   so like i said.....i think he does. not sure tho' (cos i always have doubts) so i was thinking what you all thought. if these are tell tale signs that he does, or if theres other signs that are tell tale signs that he loves me. let me know, all feedback is great. thank you.

I took this option over a buy out of contract to keep bennifits for kids and to go back to school.  I graduated in December 08 and have been job hunting since then until last week.  I have a golden opportunity to work for a large company and work a job I would enjoy.  The job is in another state and would mean I relocate my family.

LOL  I cant even afford to live alone and work the new job while my wife and kids stay in the house while it is on the market.  Is there still places like boarding houses where a person could live while putting his family back together?  I know things will be better with my education and job but DAMN THE STRESS OF THE UNKNOWN!  LOL

20090410044242AAgq3Bw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it time for me to get another job?	I work as a companion to an elderly lady and have held this job about 20 months.  I am paid by the lady's family who are also handling her finances and paying with the elderly lady's income, which is slowly running out.  Three months ago, she had to have all of her front teeth pulled because they were decayed.  She was told before she had them pulled she would have a complete denture made.  She also needs a full bottom.  It has been 3 months and her family has not tried to do anything about her teeth.  I have reminded them constantly, but they will not do anything.  They are also paying me later and later.  When I call them once a month, they are on the cold side.  I am going to call elder neglect services for her and I am doing everything I can to find another job.  I love the old lady and will continue seeing her.  From all of this, how soon should I be looking for another job?

20090202141555AAQPsST	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband had an affair and then left with her about two weeks ago. What can I do when he starts crying?	Yesterday my husband came over to my house after being gone for two weeks with the woman he had an affair with. I needed to talk with him about either divorce or legal separation. My lawyer said as long as we are civil to talk with each other to try to work out the kinks on our own and the ones that we couldn't he would work out. He began sobbing and said that he needs a swift kick in ***. I actually asked him why. He told me because of the mess he made of our life. I almost started to cry too, but I didn't. I didn't know how to react. I asked him if he wanted a hug. He said no and that I deserve to be happy and if my boyfriend ever hurt me that he would kill him. I responded first of all I don't have a boyfriend that he is just a friend. I don't know what to do. Do I not talk to my soon to be ex anymore and let my lawyer Talk to him or What is he trying to do? Is he disappointed in himself and the bed that he made for himself ? His friend told me that he said that this whole thing was the biggest mistake that he had ever made leaving me. He also said that he wishes that he could rewind his life so that this would have never happened. What is he doing? Is he trying to get back into my life or is he playing games with my head?

We went out, i didnt drink, had a nice time and went back to a mates house to play on his wii.       In the morning (still at house) i say i want to go home, this friend says that I cant. he says there's no point and that taxi's will cost too much.       I say i really want to leave, decide to stay in the spare room. a minute later this friend comes in saying there's no other beds so he'll sleep with me and wont toutch me.       I say i want to sleep. He keeps asking me questions like "what you did with your ex" and tells me that he won't let me leave if i try as he hid the keys.

20090202142601AAwa2wh	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you deal with your partners ungrateful friends?	So my boyfriend has had the same friend since high school. He recently got married and had a child. I have a 2 year old from a prior relationship and we occasionally get together and let the children play. Usually they come to our home and we gracefully provide food and beverages for them. I enjoy cooking so I do not mind, but when it comes time to put things away and clean his friends run from the kitchen screaming. The first 4 times it occured I ignored it. But now it is getting to very aggrivating. Not only that ,but the friend of his calls him 15 times a day on the weekend. Always asking for favors. Its very irritating because they spend their money unwisely on video game systems and brand new cars. Yet ihey are always expecting hand outs from my boyfriend.He is used to this he says and wouldnt know what to say. So he says to ignore the ungrateful behavior.How do u ignore something like that? Just 2 days ago they came for a  party we had and left with our sodas. They loaded up everything not bolted down basically. To boot they didn't say thank your for any of it!  On top of that they left dirty dishes everywhere and never lifted a finger to clean up the enormous mess left behind.Everyone else had the manners to bring there things to the trash and sink.  Not to mention there child was absolutely rude and was wiping snot everywhere. Any advice to deal with this?? I am absolutely at wits end with this situation.

I have asked him to please do the same, but he just gets angry and says they are his kids and he can talk to them if he wants to... and he does, alot.
