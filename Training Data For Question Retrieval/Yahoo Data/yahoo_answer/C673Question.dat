20090307182916AAyNIDg	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does life get any better after high school?	I'm a senior in high school and graduation is coming up soon. Looking back on the last four years of high school makes me really sad.       My high school experience has been far from ideal. I go to a small, private Christian school (K-12) and from the moment I got there I just did not click or fit in with the majority of my class. I see everyone around me forming these amazing close friendships and having the time of their lives in high school and I'm just kind of floating by.       I have a small group of close friends, but nothing like I would've imagined high school to be like. Because of this, I guess you could say I've formed a real resentment towards my school. The "I reject you because you rejected me" type of thinking.       I never wanted things to be like that - and now that I'm almost an adult I keep feeling like I've wasted my best years!       High school is suppose to be some of the most carefree and happy times in a person's life. But for me, they've been completely frustrating and I've spent the majority of the time being restless and unhappy.      College is coming up next year and I've opted to stay home and go to the university in my city - is this a mistake? I really want a new life and fresh beginnings but I don't know how to make that happen. Is college better than high school? Can I still have an amazing, fun, happy life even without that quintessential high school experience?      :(
20090307182739AA07ZW9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Confusing situation with best friend that I have a crush on?	I'm a teenaged guy and I realized I'm bisexual after my long time best friend and I used to masturbate together sometimes.  I came out to my best friend and even told him that I have a crush on him, so we talked and agreed to still be friends as long as I didn't flirt with him or do anything inappropriate.  The problem is even though my buddy is straight, he always has a girlfriend and knows I'm trying to suppress my crush on him for the sake of our friendship, he sometimes whips out his penis at random times to show it to me and he gives me oral sex every once in a while without wanting me to return the favour.  I'm so confused because I keep trying to tell myself I have no chance at him being my boyfriend and trying to just think of him as a friend, but he keeps teasing me by doing all these gay things, even though he still keeps saying he's straight.  What should I do?  Would be grateful for any advice.  Thanks in advance.
20090307183813AAA3ZBA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Whats the deal with alimony?	I dont get it. Why should a guy have to pay a money grubbing woman a check just so she can live off of it. They are divorced meaning that he should have nothing to do with her anymore. So why should he have to pay for her golddigging self to live. Why can her a** get a job and support herself. I think its just stupid, lazy, shallow, and goldiggish. I just never understood the whole concept. A couple gets married, gets divorced, then through some process he has to pay alimony. Its really messed up if she cheated or did nothing to give to the relationship. So can someone explain why there is alimony and why does it exist?

He worked all day and will be home at about 10:30ish. I really don't want to fight b/c that will only carry on until tomorrow and that's our only day together. I think we need a nice fun night out. We just haven't been out in a long time so I have no ideas. We're young and fun but we kinda lost that in all the fighting. I would really appreciate  any ideas for a late night make-up date.

Thank you for opening      That's her friend on pic.        http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...          There is a girl I liked, I seen her since I was in Michigan as sophomore yrs. I did not fall for her for her best body, I dont know what made me like her by a split second.         What I hoped for it was right, I was hoping me and her we graduates  from same school, Iw as right. I wished she one day talks to me, it happen but she asked me for pencil, I did not have it that time. is aid I dont have it, I realized I wish I had a pencil I would give it to her. Then Iw as thinking I did not hurt her.       Ur saying go find her, Im in NJ now, the life Im having now, I dont want to hurt her. I want to see her one more time for my last time as Im breathing. If I see her 10 second it will be fine for me.         I say to myself, what ever pain she has, I want to have them. I want to have her pain, and think about her. Not any other nasty ways.      I think before I die, I want to see her for last time.          One more time, I hope.         When I walk, and I see cars passing by i think she could be in the car, but its not. Something goes on human beings mind u know.       U can call me whatever u want. I wish my final time, I could see her.      I wish her best of luck.         I pray for her, and tell god to keep her safe all the time.      if I dont see her, well I guess 2yrs ago was my last time to seen her.         U can email me. Thanks            ur thinking I wont have her well, I want to see her one more time.         Ur saying right, u wont see her, u never know anything possible.         The person on pic, I was talking about her.                How u feel that ur single right now?

20090307191438AARKKVx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Don't you hate it when guys look through your bag or purse and find stuff?	God, this annoys me. Yesterday, on the bus I had my school bag with me and I was sitting by my guy friends, and they stupidly stole my bag and started looking through it and found a tampon and stuff, then made pervy jokes about it. I hate it when idiot guys do this. They're so immature! Do you hate it?
20090307191213AABKTw4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A lot of pretty fish in the sea, what would you do?	im 19, i love my girlfriend and she loves me.  but i constantly want other girls regardless of how much i enjoy being around my girlfriend.  if i was older i would know what to do.  but i need to know what an older person thinks.  should i stick with the girl im with who has a great body and is very pretty?  ive had a lot of fun with other girls while dating, but of course i didnt do anything.  Or should i go have some fun and ditch the relationship drama and the cravings that i must resist.  or maybe just do both, but of course noones gonna respond nicely to that bit.  what would you honestly do if you were 19 and surrounded by beauty, but in a relationship that seemed like it was never going to end, and you dont necessarily want to end it either?
20090307185207AARtaUA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Are the best type of woman the reserved ones?	Since I have been in college for two years I have only approached the woman who was aggressive and beautiful.  However alot of the times after I slept with them a couple times I noticed they left and they did the same to other guys.  I want to have a stable relationship instead of a fling do I need to seek a reserved girl.
20090307191309AA5m0a5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to ask a girl out?	I'm a little bit confused about how I should ask someone out now because my first attempts didn't get me anywhere. The first time, I walked over and said something like, "Hey, hows it going? Would you like to see a movie with me this weekend?"      I consider myself to be a nice person, and very good looking, if that makes a difference. Sorry I don't have a good pic right now
20090307190339AAaWVtX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problems and a long question?	Okay, so i'll start from the beginning. I dated this amazing guy. I mean, i completely was head over heels for him but we got tired of each other. I didn't talk to him much and neither did he, so we broke up but stayed friends. (he's in my group of friends). I didn't want tension amongst my friends and stuff so me and my ex decided to act like things were normal so our friends wouldn't feel like they had to pick sides. He dated another girl and i swear i wasn't jealous. they broke up and things were ok between us. And then, next year, he told me that i was his best friend. Him and i hung out more, talked, got to know each other. At that time, i would have chosen our friendship over anything. He knew me better than i knew myself and the same with him. Then, i think that was the time when i started to get a crush on him. and he liked me back. but i did't bother to do anything. Yeah, i liked him but no, i wouldn't go out with him. I still took pride in the fact i was his best friend. And then IT HAPPENED. I started to like this other guy. I flirted with him and palled around but when i looked back at what happned with me and my ex, i didn't want this to turn out the same way. So the guy i liked (not my ex) started dating this girl and they went out for 2 weks. i swear, that was the longest two weeks of my life. They broke up, so i took my chance and told him that i did in fact like him. Then he said that he wanted me to ask out this other girl for him. I told him no, and he got mad at me because i liked him. So, then, he started dating my best-est girlfriend. she had heard that i liked him, but she liked him too and she hadn't had a boyfriend in ages so i acted like i didn't like him anymore. Well, she broke up with him becuz of her own reasns and now, i think i might still have some feelings but i'm sad that he rejected me and mad at myself for even think that i do like him. And the thing with my ex? yeah, i like him. I know i like him. I like my ex more than i like the other guy. But i REALLY like my ex and wish we hadn't dated because i feel like it would be so much better this time if we did go out. so, some advice on situation becaus i am NOT going sit by and let these two guys go by, that are undateable! (can't date the other guy because my girlfriend dated him)

20090307185056AAFNqoR	Family & Relationships;Family	Can my mother take custody of my kids if my husband and I die?	My husband and I are going out of the country next week. In the event we should both die, could my mother get custody of my kids? She will be watching them for us while we are away and I was planning to leave a letter with her stating that if we should not make it back that she will be the legal guardian of them and have both my husband and myself sign it. Would that be sufficient or do I need to go through some kind of legal process?

20090307191111AALKGxL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it too early to say "I love you"?	When you're in a relationship, do you think it's too early to use the "L word" after one month? Even if you've known each other for awhile prior to the relationship? Furthermore, what needs to be present in the relationship for a person to say these words? A strong connection, a feeling that you would do anything for that person, loving every minute of the time you spend together? What else?

I love my boyfriend, but I'm starting to wonder if we're heading for a breakup or just going through a rough patch. For the past few weeks he's seemed distant. I got a new job and they have me working more hours and I don't get a lot of time to spend with him. He always seems so busy, himself, but I wonder if he actually wants to spend time together. I miss him a lot.      We've also been having stupid little fights. First example is just what I explained, I feel like I never see him. Second example, I feel like his sister hates me and is trying to break us up because she wants her friend to be with my boyfriend. He said I was trying to cause problems between him and his family.      I don't know what to do or say anymore it always just leads to another fight. Any advice?

Would this bother you if you were me? What should I do?
20090307201026AAlxf6c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if this girl likes me?	Well she's really popular and I'm...not. She always says hi to me in the hallways. She makes up little nicknames for me. I go over to her house sometimes with my friend who is like her best friend, and she says she likes to hang out with me. She always asks him if I still like her. She plays with my hair      But on the down side: when someone says that I like her she says "ew." She usually doesnt go out with guys that aren't popular. And also, idk if she has a boyfriend.   she hangs around a lot of guys though

What I really want to know is if you would be able to feel as romantic and turned on by a girl like this as any other girly girl.

Why do I want to reject him you may ask??      Because I like his best friend...         He likes me and he thinks I like him. His best friend knows he likes me but he knows I like him, not his best friend. I can't just be flat out with this guy because he's insecure and shy enough as it is. I know that whatever I do I'll end up breaking him.      What can I do?

20090307194559AAiDLnE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would have you done? Ladies and Men plz answer this question. =]?	Ok, here is the story...I was going out with a guy named Daniel over the summer (relationship lasted 2-3 months), until all of a sudden broke up with me. Found out by him that he was dating a girl that he worked with at his work. They broke up, and Daniel and I got back together. We have been together for almost 4 months. So here is what made me upset... I went to get a rabbit from this girl that couldnt take care of the rabbit, and it turned out to a person I went to school with. So we started talking and this and that. And I mentioned a guys named Daniel, and she said Daniel, yea my friend is dating him. I was like WHAT?! I told her that I was dating him for almost 4 months. So he has been dating this girl for 1-2 weeks without telling me or ending the relationship.So I called him and was like wtf are you dating this girl, and he said yea, like he didnt care yea. So I pretty much told him how I felt, and sent a couple of texts saying how I felt. Then he called me 3 times, 2 times i rejected the call, the 3rd call he left a message. He was pretty pissed off, b/c of what I texted him (Text message sent: Perhaps I should let that Tori girl whats going on so she doesnt get hurt like I did, and doesnt have to put up with your bull s***.) I never told tori, but just letting him know its not fair for her to go out with him if she doesnt know anything that is going on.I ended the relationship, and sent a text to him saying dont text or call me again, thankx, and bye. There is more to this story but this is the basic part of the story.What would you have done if someone went behind your back and cheated, and let a few girls know that your single when you really werent? And what do you think about what happend?

20090307193655AArNoSQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think         ?	I'm sorry this is so long!          Okay, so I’ve liked this guy since about the second week of school this year. He’s in my Spanish class. At first, I didn’t talk to him much because he sat in the back with some guys and I sat near the front with my friends –we got to pick where we sat. Then one day, he sat in the seat right in front of mine and when I walked into the classroom he said, “Sit here!” (Meaning the seat where I sat every day). So then for a few months he sat next to me and we’d always just kind of make small talk I guess. He always shortened my name and would call me by that and write it on my stuff. Every time I saw him in the hall, he’d say “Hey,    -Nickname-!,” and my best guy friend who had no idea I liked this guy said “He likes you.” Then, one day out of the blue he just went and sat with the guys in the back again. Then like a month later he called me by that nickname again and then he came back and sat with me again. I would always catch him looking at me and he’d always laugh if I said something funny. He’d play with my stuff and take pictures on my camera (I’m on yearbook staff) Then, a girl that he’s friends with asked me who I liked, and knowing that she can’t keep a secret, I said I didn’t know. Then she said, I think you and –guy that I like- would be really cute together. So then a few weeks later, I found out that one of my good friends that’s also good friends with him likes him. So then I kind of talked to him a little less. But now she said that she thinks that they are better off friends. And now this guy, who I used to talk to every day, doesn’t really talk to me at all. I think he still may like me, but maybe I pushed him away by not talking to him much for like two weeks. Then on Thursday, he was trying to balance his book on his head, and I cracked a smile at him and he smiled back. On Friday, we didn’t have classes so I didn’t talk to him. So what are some ways I can let this guy know I like him, because I think at one point he liked me also? What do you think is going on?      Again sorry it's so long but thanks for reading!
20090307193433AAc2jVc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Really Bad Situation?	Ok if you dont know the story already i have fallen madly in love with this guy and when i did fall in love with him he neglected to tell me he had a gf so i assumed by the way he was acting he felt the same way. then i ran into him and he said i have to tell you something so i said ok and he said i have a gf so obviously i still loved him but i needed to put some space between us so i did hoping the feelings would just pass but they didnt then i saw him in the jewellery store buying a ring for his gf then he told me a week later out of the blue. It hurt alot because im in love with him and i wish i wasnt and i pretended i was happy for him. Then he proposed and she said yes so once gain i pretended i was happy. Then i got drunk after i found out and stumbled down there and told him exactly how i felt stupid i know! then about 2 weeks ago he rocked on my doorstep to tell me that if i loved him he would call off the wedding because he has always loved me. I told him i had no feelings for him anymore but i do i just didnt want to be the girl who ruined that relationship then we had a huge fight and he walked off and hasnt spoken to me since. I dont know what to do?
20090307194327AA3kNtK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls eyes shake during a breakup?	Every breakup I've ever had, I couldn't help but notice that when girls get choked up their eyes tend to dart back and forth between yours.  Like, left eye contact, right eye contact, over and over and quickly, rather than just making eye contact.      Idk if there's an answer for this but oh well
20090307193203AAMe4OP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am not in love with my fiance anymore but im too scared to be alone?	My fiance and i have been together for 5 years. We have 2 children a 2 year old and a 1 year old. We had our problems in the past and have broken up and gotten back together to try and make it work. My problem is we both work full time jobs, but i feel like i am expected to do all the house work on my days off, all the diaper changes and baths, prepare dinner...etc. I have tried to talk to him in a mature manor about how i feel, and he shuts down and will not discuss it with me, nor will he change after i have expressed how i feel. Tonight i got off of work after a long day and he was on the couch, house was filthy, the kids were not fed yet and i approached the topic again and he gave me the finger. At this point i am not attracted to him anymore. He has gained 50 pounds since we started dating, and we only have sex maybe once every 2 weeks. He is VERY lazy and i am burning out fast. its hard to love someone who will not help or even listen. I do not make enough money to fully support my kids on my own. I know by law he would be required but i dont think i would be able to get much out of him. The other side of me really does love him and would be sad without him. I guess i just dont know what to do. He is too lazy to even go to counseling. Any suggestions  would be great

20090307195005AA21i7a	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does anyone want to be my friend?	My name is Melanie, and I'm a 17 year old girl, and   I am hurting for a good friend so incredibly badly it hurts.   I'm a class A introvert, so I have never known anybody that genuinely cares about me, and it breaks my heart every day. Anytime I am close to developing a relationship with someone, they leave me, and I just break down and cry. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I'm near the edge. Everyone my age goes to parties and has boyfriends and are practically sisters with their friends, and I'm left out. I have never had a boyfriend, or even kissed a boy for that matter, and I feel like my life is flying by me and I've missed out completely on being a teenager. I have never taken a drug, gotten drunk, cut myself or had sex. So I consider myself a good person on track.      Just what I want, more than anything else in the whole world, is a girl my age, someone I can tell everything to and not be judged, someone that will love me for who I am and will listen to me and simply understand.      Please, if anyone is out there?

There's this guy that I think likes me, and since I have trails next to my house and stuff we are planning on going on a walk or something... I'm 14 and he's 15... I'm white and hes black... I really don't care about color though because I do like him... but sometimes he acts so forward with girls (teasing) that I'm cautious when going into a relationship with him. I do like him though, but I'm not sure my parents will approve. I just don't know what to do :( I am going to give "us" a shot, I don't want to seem trashy though. And his old girlfriend was trash and had a hard life..I don't want to be like her...      what do you think?

20090307194853AA95Twh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is is possible to fall in love with a person without being physically attracted to them?	So two of my guy friends are very good friends and have been through a lot together. One of them has told me in private that he thinks he has fallen in love with the other, but he has no interest in his friend's body or having sex with him, etc. He just says that he feels so deeply attached to him to the point that he thinks he has literally fallen in love with him.      I know that sexually wise, both of them are straight. They are somewhat jockish in how they carry themselves. So it's sort of confusing. Could someone explain?          I mean, I can get it if it's just a very strong friendship. But he told me that sometimes he can't get the friend out of his mind and feels like he NEEDS to be with him.       And they're more physically affectionate with each other than normal...

20090307192227AAtWX0M	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys with emotional issues and lack of father figure?	I met a guy few months ago, and we really hit it right off. The problem is that he has serious intimacy issues, and always seems cold and unemotional. Its hard to figure out what he feels, whether he even likes me after such a distant behavior. the only way for me t have him say something nice is to provoke him, and put against the wall. I wonder if the fact that his dad  left family and his early age has something to do with the way he deals with intimacy? He also seems to freak out when we get too close...He says then 'he likes stupid American girls'

20090307195058AAmvfsX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Backstabbing Friend - What do I do?	Ok so I recently had a little injury...I slipped on some ice and completely wiped out on the ice & also some gravel. (ow!) my face was scraped up pretty badly, and my lip was huge and swollen and scratched. So I stayed home from school the day after this happened. And this "friend" of mine was telling everyone how "ugly" I must look (she hadn't seen me yet) and then I went to school the next day, but stayed home the day after (which was friday). On thursday, my "friend" had been pretty nice to me and I was nice to her back, and then decided to temporarily forgive her a little. So then I found out that she talking to everyone about it behind my back on friday. And I know the obvious answer would be to not be her friend anymore, but she is very dramatic and I don't really like the whole causing big drama thing...so what do I do?
20090307195216AAgvrWi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I approach this girl?	There's this girl at my school and she's really pretty and I really want to get to know her. She's a really popular sophomore and I'm a junior who's somewhat popular. I only know her from the PE class we had together last year, and we talked to each other a little bit but don't really know each other that well. I see her almost every day at school in the hallways, and she usually makes eye contact with me. She's always with her friends who I don't know, so it seems so hard to talk to her. Plus, I'm shy to begin with, and not very confident. I have acne too and I feel like that's holding me back. I'm almost 17 and I've never had a girlfriend or even been on a date. She's so pretty and I just can't get her off of my mind.
20090307195253AA5IDt3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I worry about this?	So, I met my army bf about almost 4 months ago. When I first met him, he had told me that he hadn't been with a woman in any shape or form for a whole year. Of course, I had my suspicions... It sounded to me like he was just making a clean slate. He just left for Afghanistan almost a week ago sadly. So, I got to hold most of his belongings at my apartment. (We didn't live together obviously) I found a box with a notebook with letters that he wrote love letters to a woman while he was in boot camp, lets call her *Amy... .a month or two before he had met me. He had told me that he was with *Amy right after high school and he thought she was the one blah blah blah blah but he's apparently over her. He had told me all of this before I had found that box with the notebook. Which, by the way, obviously weren't sent.. I'm worried that I might just be a rebound. Considering his fast-paced nature in this relationship. He treats me like we've been together for years.. and something doesn't feel right about that. But he treats me so so so well and I don't want to lose him over something like this. Any opinions on how I should bring this up to him, or how I should or shouldn't feel about this?

I don't do it anywhere near as much that he does either.  Does this ****** not realize how much this kind of thing hurts?  Or does he think he's the only one who has feelings?

20090227101701AAMve0W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Going out with 2 girls (sort of)?	Well after i dated a girl for something like 2-3 months i told her i got feelings for her and she replied she doesn't know how she feels about me and i should not be so into her cause i might have a shock ... I took that pretty hard (even if at the moment i didn't show it) ... Anyway for the past 2 weeks i've been talking to another girl so i can get my mind a bit off of the current one and try to think clear (i stop dating my current girlfriend for a while)... I went out with this girl about 3 times and i pretty much like her... In a couple of days im going to have a talk with my girlfriend and try to sort things out ... Anyway if we will not break up and try to sort things out i would like to go out with both and decide in the near future ...I want to add that even if we went out almost 3 months it was nothing serious yet (i mean no sex) ...Is this wrong ?

20090227101112AAlk8XY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	As a married couple, what would you choose in this scenario?	You and your husband's rent is due on Sunday.  You have $1100 in your bank account.      Your rent costs $1100.  You can pay your rent, but you leave all your bank accounts at $0, and that includes NOT purchasing any groceries for the week.  You do have a child.  You have some food in the house, so you won't starve -- you'll just be eating pasta, PB sandwiches, etc for the week.      Would you pay your rent, with the EXACT $1100 you have, and be broke until Friday, or would you tell your landlord you're sorry, you'll have to pay late (never paid late before in the 2 years you've lived here) and go get groceries and leave yourself with a little buffer in your bank account?      Which would you do?  Thank you.

20090227095257AAzDn3h	Family & Relationships;Friends	'LOVE/HATE RELATIONSHIP' WITH BEST FRIEND!! HELP!?	I'm torn in two thinking about my best friend!   On the one hand she is amazing, we've been friends since FOREVER and we have so much in common. We've been through so much together, so many good times, a few bad ones, and tons of funny ones. She makes my life more interesting as she encourages me to do things I wouldn't have the confidence to do otherwise and it almost always pays off.       But on the other hand, I feel like I'm a better friend to her than she is to me. I've missed oportunties because I was busy 'being there for her' and I have cut ties with people who are unkind to her. Yet, when she is invited out and I am not, she cancels plans with me and leaves me completely alone. She also thinks that she is superior to me as she is prettier and is always quick to point it out or subtly undermine my confidence. I feel so let down by her sometimes.       I don't want to lose her because I love her as a friend and we have so many great memories together and I don't really have many other friends. But I don't want to let her hold me back and I feel like she is doing that. Please help!!

20090307201328AAkS8K1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do spouses want to blame each other when both are at fault.?	I have a girlfriend who wants to blame her husband for cheating and, yet while it happened just once, she insists every woman is chasing her man.  She found out he had cheated by going on line, violating her sister's phone account, lying as to who she was.  What my friend doesn't mention, when she is telling others, is that this snooping began before they were married and were just seeing each other.  Is it possible that her actions could have caused a reaction in him that was not right but he felt justified with all her nonsense.  And what she doesn't tell others is she is just as guilty in  the infidelity game.

20090227100751AARO5HA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it a strange relationship?10 points!!!!!!!!!!?	I've got a teacher where I study with whom I've always had a very good relationship.I've known her for 6 years,and we use to talk a lot.   The thing is that after a lot of personal problems I had,I've realised that she's controlling me more than she used to do,asking other teachers if I improve or not,watching me,etc...The other day I had an exam near her house and she offered me to sleep there with her..or everytime I said something about my ex she puts a long face...   I've always thought that she could have developed a maternal instinct,since she has no children and she's not married either.But I'm not a child(I'm 24) so I don't know what her feelings are(and she's not an affectionate person) But I'm sure that she hasn't sexual feelings towards me.   This is my last year in that centre however she told me we would still be in contact...or that she could give me particular classes so that I pass the exam I want to do next year
20090227101534AAsbMFx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Fallen out with friend what do i do....?	well today my friend said she was meeting a boy in town and i asked her tonight how it went. But she said she didn't see him and that she would next week. i asked if he was a potential date and she said 'i dont know i was gonna see when i met him' and i after that asked just out of interest how old he is. then she said 19...and i am shocked at that becasue she is 13 and told her what i thought and that he probably wouldnt be interested in a girl 6 years younger.  i then said that a man that age and could easily rape her and do whatever he wanted to if he so wished to, which is true but i dont stereotype all lder guys like that but you have to be careful, as can a teenager but hey. I just think she is child and he is an adult...its not right in my opinion and she shouldnt even attempt it. I just think that a 19 year old is too big an age gap for teenage dating.... and she then accused me of shrinking her and treating her like a 2 year old when i wasn't at all i was just looking out for her. what do you think, did i do something wrong? all i was trying to say to her was be careful....but she got really mad at me. Then she said that she never said she wanted to date him but i did ask her if she was thinking about it and she said she was going to see how it went which would mean to anyone that she might do if she liked him. to be perfectly honest i think she is a bit big headed to even think that a 19 year old college guy would go out with a 13 year old. I did not say this to her obviously. I just dont think i did anything wrong.

20090227095428AATh7n0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I right to miss the funeral?	My wife has been terribly upset all week, due to the passing of her aunt. The funeral takes place tomorrow morning and I'm expected to attend. Trouble is it clashes with the annual wet blouse competition for the ladies of the Raffles club, which takes place at the Heath. In all fairness, I found her aunt to be the most irrepressible bore. She frequently visited the estate to take tea and have a dip in the lake. On the occasions when I couldn't avoid her company, she droned on about her life experiences and always expected me to take an interest. She also took time out of these long winded anecdotes to admonish me for my constant heavy drinking and debauchery. So I was thinking, would it be frowned upon if I missed the funeral and spent my time drinking gin whilst appreciating natural beauty, as opposed to blubberations and miserable sallow faces?   My wife is no help whatsoever, all she can say is 'just do what you want'.

My close friend also knew my online friend and I asked her to help my online friend because she's a good adviser.So after that my close friend talked to my online one...she didn't answer me on msn and  when I told her "can I call you?" she was like "I have a low phone battery" [obviously,it seems like she doesn't wanna talk to me!]:@    And my empty brain made me ask her after she answered me on msn "Did *my online friends' name* tell you that I said there's no true friends? because you are I'm really sorry if I said that" and I think since then she started treating me like crap (like never before)   Is it just me imagining I lost her or I really did?

20090227100651AAQbyCs	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please Help! Friend problems!?	I'm in ninth grade and, just this semester, met another freshmen who seems pretty cool. We don't have any classes together right now but I'm shooting to be with him a few periods next year. We text and Facebook a few times, and this week, on Tuesday, I decided to ask him if he wanted to go to the movies. He said sure and that would be fun, but that he was busy this coming weekend with baseball. I figured we could try for next weekend (March 7) so I texted him Wednesday night and asked if that would be good. No reply. I tried again yesterday with the same question, waited about an hour, then got irritated. I asked him if he was ignoring me or if he didn't want to be my friend. No reply there either. Finally, I just said, "Wow. Great talking to you. NOT." He replied with, "Dude, I just got out of a freaking baseball game. Calm down." Obviously, he'd been busy, so I should have trusted him. Instead, I told him I was calm, and that if he was going to be like that then he should just delete my number and that we should not talk anymore. All night I felt bad about it, so this morning I sent a quick "Sorry for the way I acted. My bad" message to him. I haven't seen him today in the halls, only because the power was out in the school and the schedule got screwed up (It's not that he's avoiding me.) What do I do? I really want to keep this friend, because I've lost a lot of good buddies over my impatience. PLEASE HELP.

20090227095258AAd8mVE	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Someone at work is asking very private questions.?	I got a guy at work I rejected about a month ago, because he was married. We are friendly to each other, but man, he has not relentlessly let go of an issue. He keeps asking my salary. He found out that I work 2 other freelance jobs besides the full time one I got now. I don't make a lot, so I don't like to answer those types of questions. I have had it pretty rough financially for the last two years. I have told him numerous times to stop asking, and he won't. I know the guy earns three times what I do, even with the job. He already knows that I earn significantly less than he does. He knows my salary. I think he just wants to hear it. I ask him why he wants to know, but he always says he's curious. I think it's rubbish. Anyway, he guesstimated what I earned and went into this huge lecture on my life, and I was ready to kill him. He just went on how I look like I don't sleep, how miserable I look, how my life is all about money, how living in my neighborhood will get me killed, etc... I told him it was a matter of perspective. Since then, he has ignored me. What the hell is going on?

20090227105326AAT7aFx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to deal with wife's sister and boyfriend?	Hi there!      I have a situation that is both troubling and difficult to deal with. If you have a moment I will outline the situation:      I own a home where I live with my wife. She is from Europe and has a twin sister that I fixed up with the guy across the street (who rents and will have to move eventually as the home is in foreclosure). Her sister has been in Florida for 4 years and in a bad marriage and when that ended she came here to live and we helped her find a place to rent. She is 25, and in 7 years of being in the USA she has really done nothing but exist at the expense of others. While in Florida for 4 years she never worked, nor went to school. She never got a driver's license, nor learned to drive. When her marriage ended we had her come stay with us with the understanding it was very temporary. We helped her find a place and she moved into a room-mate situation. She eventually got a job at a sandwich shop and I introduced her to the guy across the street who I had just made friend's with after he moved in.       Well, in her classic style she quickly moved in with him. It was OK for awhile-the guy is fairly nice when he's sober (he's about 28 years old). Eventually I saw that when he drank a lot he became belligerent. He snapped on me twice over trivial things, mostly related to his insecurity or when I would ask my wife's sister things like when she would look for a job, etc. By snapping I mean he would be verbally confrontational, almost to the point of a fistfight. I would be mature and just leave with my wife, only to have him try to apologize the next day. I brought a friend over once for a UFC fight and he nearly got in a fight with him-my guest! Another time he was close to fist-fight with one of his best friend's over my wife's sister again.      Finally he got into a fist fight when we went out to a musical gig downtown, and I ended up in the middle of it! I had to walk home, too. Well, then the reports of him getting physical with my wife's sis began. She told my wife he pulled her hair, slapped her, and on several occasions choked her. Now, I am very uncomfortable to say the least! I now hate living across the street from them. I won't talk to the guy, but he thinks everything is OK, and wonders why I am avoiding him. I don't think he knows that my wife's sis told her about the physical abuse. My question is-how do I proceed? The police were there once. He drinks every day and has a cush job Mommy gave him. I am actually equally disgusted with my wife's sis because she is lazy and sponges off men, hasn't worked since quitting the deli job 7 month's ago, and still has no license or car, so she can't really leave him, and I'm not sure if she even wants to.      What should I do? Should I continue to be uncomfortable and ignore him? Should I confront him and tell him I know about the abuse, and risk him getting mad at my wife's sis for telling her? Should I tell him perhaps that he needs to quit drinking and go to anger management before our friendship can continue?      It was a big mistake having my wife's sis come to Calif, and an even bigger one setting her up across the street. Any insight into a solution is appreciated. I really am torn because we have been to his folks for Holidays, and this guy is pretty cool when he doesn't over-drink. I'm not sure I'd hang out with him if it wasn't for my wife's sis being his girlfriend, but frankly I'm tired of them both!      Thank you so much!

I feel like its reaching the climax but then stops suddenly. any suggestions to how to complete it? How close am I?  Could it be a mind thing? My thoughts are solely on how good it feels until I start to feel it build up and then my mind goes to thinking almost there, should i move it to left, keep circling. etc.
20090307210236AAP8miP	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this not as big of a deal as I think(teenage, high school problem)?	I'm 16 years old, but unlike most teenagers my age, I really dont have a social life. Its not that I'm unpopular, its just kinda complicated. Like at school, I get along with everyone, but I dont really belong to a group of friends. The few friends I'm really close with are like me, they keep to themselves out of school. I basically go to school, come home, and am alone by myself all the time. I have my family though. This used to not bother me before, but as of late I just feel like even when I'm older like in college I won't have any true friends and just sit at home by myself. Really what I'm askng is this, did anyone else have this problem in high school, like having no one to hang out with? If so, did it get better in the future, and if not, how did u deal with being alone? Also, please dont say anything like just go hang out with friends after school, bc that's not gunna happen soon (just trust me, I have very good reasons). Thanks in advance.

ANYWAY! i broke up with my boyfriend the other week before this dance thing at my school. since i had no one to go with, i asked him if he'd go with me.      he me a corsage and everything, it was really sweet. we slowdanced to three songs. when we were dancing to the last one, he kind of pulled me really close, so that we were more hugging and.. swaying than actually dancing. then, really slow, he kissed my forehead. and he kissed my cheek. and then he kissed me.      we stayed like that for like 3 more songs, even though they weren't slow.. he just held me. and every now and then we'd kiss. he asked me, "me or mike?" mike was my last boyfriend. he was joking. he also said, "i'm not high this time."      so, over the next week, i don;t get to talk to him much. but i hear from one of his friends that he's not going to ask me out. that friend USED to think he liked me. now he doesn't. he says maybe he only did what he did because he wanted to make out and i was the only one around. but that's bull too, because we didn't even 'make out'.      anyway, the guy told him he didn't like me.      so my question is... WHY did he do this??      and should i talk to him about it?? what should i say?
20090307203148AAAlEvc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need some advice please help?	My sister just got married; both she and her husband decided to safe themselves for their wedding night (meaning they were both virgin). After the wedding, my sister doesn't allow her husband to have sex with her; she says it is too painful, every time they try she faints. She has gone to several doctors, they all say it is all her fault and they surgically removed her hymen, and it still hasn’t help yet. They have used several sexual enhancement products but none has worked yet either. She is too scared and she says it does not  interest her. Do you think she got some kind of mental problem or it is kind of normal?      Any tips of what they should do next?      btw the guy is totally fine the drs say but sometimes i think it is his fault too,

20090307201645AAkcJjg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would You Give some Ideas On What To Do about This?	I have been medically discharged from the Marines for a severe depression. So my wife has been taking care of me, while she is working overtime as RN in the hospital as well as taking care of our 5yr .  So since I got medically discharged I hardly get paid, so I pay only $20 a week for child support by court orders and my ex is harassing me for more. Also, my 11yr daughter needs a mouth surgery ‘cause her mom never thought her how to brush her teeth. The things does not have insurance and my ex does not have job as always. So I told my wife take our 5yr out the private school which she pays $1200 mo for it. My wife went ballistic saying that I should not ask her to do such thing and she is getting sick of doing everything and that my ex needs to get a ******* job etc. I regret ever having sex with my ex and having a kid with her, I wish I could do it all over. What should I do any ideas. Please do not say mean things about my wife I know she should not pay for my mistakes I just do not know what to do.

20090307204715AAHjfZz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys and girls with experience: The confusing world of guys... does this mean anything at all?	So, he is my best guy friend. He recently broke up with his girlfriend and told me, about three weeks ago, how much he really, truly likes  me and how he wants something to happen between us, but wants to take it very slowly and ease into it. Just about one week ago, we were driving around and holding hands, and I asked him if he still liked me that way, and he said "Of course, I wouldn't be holding your hand if I didn't like you." But just this week, he's been acting a little different. He hasn't been hugging me quite as tightly, or calling me as often. This morning, he texted me telling me he wouldn't be able to see me today because he was on a day trip with another girl, who is his ex's best friend. Now, he has many female friends that is not romantically interested in, and he's a good Christian boy and is not a player. I'm just kind of wondering... do you think I'm being paranoid, or do I have reason to think he's not interested in me anymore?

20090307210405AAkEtpW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I guess its not possible to be friends with an ex...?	I texted my ex today if we can go to watch Twilight because last week sunday I asked him if there's nothing to do on Saturday if he wants to hang out and he said yes. So I asked him today and he said he couldn't because he's going to his friend's karaoke and he's going to this one bcuz he didn't go to the last one. I was like, "Yea, I'm going out late at night too. Just wanted to see if you are free at 7 to hang out" He was like, "Sorry yo... I'll be out all night if anything hit me up.." So I just said no worries, I've just been feeling sad lately and just wanted to talked of what you did when you were depresses. Have fun tonight" I've been depressed lately and I just needed a positive person to talk to and I was hoping he could help me. I wonder if he make me more upset by not hanging out with me, I know I'm depressed with school and work and not him. Did he make me feel more upset, and what did he mean by "hit me up if anything?"      I guess we don't really have this friendship thing, because it seems like he does not care that I am feeling down.  No concern at all as a friend.
20090307210517AAjgNax	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does he LIKE LIKE me?	AHH, i am in a huge funk! I am having mixed emotions about a guy...      So this is why i think he likes me:   He calls me butter scotch   Winked at me   Looks at my butt ;-o   Randomly stares at me   He shows up randomly   Writes dumb letters and tell people to give them to me   We joke around      Why i think he may not like me:   He keeps on telling me he hates me   Won't look at me anymore   I was like "what did i do?"   and his friend was like "Oh, Macy,   he really hates you."      R they playing a prank on me?!?!?   Like when he motioned his hand like he was hitting my butt, he said "I'm sorry Macy, it was a joke." Andhis friend told him to do it.   And when another friend asked him if he was going to the dance he said yes, and then i was like i am going!!" and he never showed up!!!      But my friends, "He LiKES you, and i mean like, like. HE will get over it, he was just embarrased....cuz of what your friend did during class"      So, when i was at the dance, all i could think about was what happened in 5th hr. And i could not sleep Friday night!!!      Does he like me?!? i am having mixed emotions!!   The reason he keeps telling me he hates me is because my friend was like "Macy,when u went up to the board to write something he was staring, and he always stares!! and he winked at you on Tuesday! He likes you...but when he stares and its creepy...." So i was like "yea...i think he likes me too!" Then he claims he was staring at his friend , but my friend was like "Mrs.H, he keeps staring at Macy!!!" And mrs.h was like "Then look the other way!" So, he got all red, and i guess he was embarrassed, so he was not talking to me Friday, and saying he hates me, when my friend started it!! So i was talking to his friend, and he was like "oh macy, u did something wrong, he hates you now." But idk if they are telling the truth because all that day they were teasing me..and he would like stare at me then laugh..and idk if he really does like me...cuz i like him! jhorugb;oEVWbdfweoibg;ufvew i am so confused!

I'm in love with my best guy friend and I don't know how to let him know. We're exactly alike...we both have the same outlook on life and the more time I spend with him the more I fall for him. He's the only person I can see myself being with forever and I'd like him to figure it out on his own without coming right out and saying it. Sometimes it feels like he feels the same way about me but then there's other times when I think it's just wishful thinking. He has 3 really close friends and they're all female (me being one) and it drives me mad with jealousy when he talks to the other 2...even though they're both in a relationship with other guys. How can I hint around at my feelings without coming right out and saying it and how can I get over the jealousy? I've gotten better at it but I'm not totally cured.

20090307202133AAc3Uws	Family & Relationships;Family	Domestic family help! mother/daughter?	So, me and my mom have a very different type of relationship. Out of her three kids i'm the only one who isn't exactly like her (excellent grades/manners/respect) but im the only one who can make her laugh and take her stress away. We always get in fights every day (sometimes i think she really likes to fight with me) but about a week ago we got into a big fight and for the first time EVER i went to her and said sorry. not once, but a couple of times even though it was a fight over what we should have over dinner.      So now she hasn't talked to me in over a week, because i disrespected her. And my whole family is going against me now. My whole life is getting ruined!! Im seriously crying right now. Shes decided not to talk to me but shes going around telling my dad and siblings that im not taking the initiative to talk to her!  Shes telling them she wants to talk to me and asks about how im doing and all this other crap!      I'm a college student and i commute everyday to save my parents money! I never even ask them for extra cash (and they dont want me to have a job). I clean and cook and do everything. The last thing i need is this drama!      how should i handle this situation?

20090307204845AA7X3UB	Family & Relationships;Family	Are you a stay at home mom, and if so do you ever plan on working?	I am a working mom who sometimes thinks about being a stay at home mom. I like working because I like interacting with other adults, and I'm proud of my job.  However, sometimes I feel like I spend too many hours away from my child (even though I barely work full time). A part time job would be ideal, but then I wouldn't make enough to cover child care. And in this economy, it seems selfish to quit. Staying at home, I fully know, is not easy. A SAHM never gets a break. But my main question is, if you are a stay at home mom, do you ever plan on working again? How will you get back in into the job market? Do you plan on going back to school? Do you worry about not building your social security or IRA or 401K up? Thanks. And by the way, this is not a judgemental question. I understand and respect both sides of the stay at home/working mom dilemma. And so, please, if you're a crazy zealot who thinks women who work are evil, get off it, and don't reply to my question.

Whenever I compliment on her clothes/presentation/whatever, she looks down at the ground and smiles. She seems to think of answer for an answer and just says thanks. The other day, I gave her gum. She walks away, but turns back with a shy smile and says thanks. But instead of walking with me, she walks away. Whenever another guy talks to her, she responds easily. What's wrong and how can I break her out of her shell?

20090307202152AA2lvOK	Family & Relationships;Friends	A Bit Complicated, 59 year old said she is really 49, but she is 59!?	So, my dear friend "Blanche" is almost 60 years old. She is dating a 49 year old married guy, "Jack"  who is seperated, but still lives in the same house with his wife and children about 2 states away.      Blanche told him that she is 49. Jack thinks she is 49 or at least he has not hinted that he may think otherwise.      Now Blanche has come to me for advice. She doesn't know whether she should reveal her age to him or not!   *She said that she is thinking about this because he is thinking of moving out on his own and not living with his wife any longer. Blanche says that they have gotten to a deep level in their relationship where they are both in love and have talked about having a future together.      *She is deathly afraid of telling him the truth, she believes he would think everything has been lies and would never trust her again and would dump her. She has also said that if he does leave her, she has nothing to live for and would kill herself. And I believe she would do this.       Ive gone over the PROS and CONS of not revealing and of revealing but we could never come up with one answer that gave her some reassurance.      *PRO: revealing her age, she might find out he wont be as upset as she thought he would be and will continue to love her.      *CON: he will feel betrayed and want to break up with her.      Please help me help her. What do you suggest?
20090307203622AAyaXyA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Was i too harsh with them?	Ok so there are these two annoying twins that i used to be really close with but then this year they started being mean towards me. Anyway they are really annoying and mean and ignore me but like getting in my business. I was supposed to have a sleepover with one of my friends (they are friends with too). For some reason they knew and the moment i was on chat the first twin asks how was your sleepover? I'm infuriated because i don't like them, they are up in my business all the time, and that is like the 5th time they've asked that when i've planned something to do with that person. I was in a bad mood and they are annoying as heck. I responded with get out of my d*mn business and get your own. They said what? You need an attitude check! B*tch! And i responded with mind your d*mn business.The second one is even more annoying because we haven't talked in about a couple months on chat. She says hey. How was your sleepover? Right away. And i responded with so and so already asked me this. And she said ? Then continued to say so how was it? And i said why don't you go ask your sister. I know it's very late and that might seem incredibly rude but they won't mind their own d*mn business! Looking back it seems harsh. But thinking of they way they act towards me...they want to be in my business and one is willing to chat on the computer to get inside my business or to chat nonsense, but when it comes to public its like a competition and a hate game. What do you think? I think i'm a person that they messed with one time too many.

So my boyfriend and I have been going out for about a year and a half and its now our senior year in HS. When I found out he was going to the same college as me I thought I would be really happy but I actually wasn't. I don't know why.. I think its because I was hoping to use our distance as an excuse to break up. But at the same time I don't know why I'd want to break up with him! He's sooo sweet and I really really care about him! And another thing is that he always says he wants our relationship to last after college but I don't think that's what I want. I don't know what to do, I feel so bad!! I really like him but at the same time I don't think I want to be with him for that long. I feel like such a bad person..

I have a friend, almost every time we talk in person he is always looking at something else or messing with and object.   But the thing is he only does this when we are around other people, people we don't even know.   But when it is just the two of us he seems to be more open and he will look me in the eye more then he normally does.   What does this mean?   Does it mean he is embarrassed to talk to me in public?   Or is it something else?

How can I let them know or should I rather just show them and eventually word will get around? Thanks.

When a married woman receives a text message from a "classmate" saying "So what are you gonna do if you don't back to your husband", and you find out the man doesn't even go to school but met the married woman at a club. Should the text message be perceived as false as the wife claims or is it a high chance that the text message is true and the married woman has told this man she is single???

20090307205644AA0EgpG	Family & Relationships;Family	Really Upset...Parent's Views of Boyfriend?	My boyfriend and I met in college and have been dating for 5 months.  In those 5 months we have become amazingly close. He treats me better than anyone ever has.  But my parents just think he is 'ok' and claim they 'don't know him very well'...although they see him every couple of weeks or so.  I always ask my mom why she doesn't like him and she says it doesn't matter what she thinks and 'well it's not like youre going to marry him'.  I really think the only reason she doesn't like him is because he has some tatoos on his arms- but they aren't trashy at all or excessive.  This guy is really great and I am close to his family and his family loves me......how can I make my family feel the same?      *My mom is weary because my past boyfriend treated me bad and it ended really badly.
20090307203656AAYGdqX	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to deal with the other BABY MOMMA?...?	My boy friend and I have been together since 2004. In 2008 we separated for 1 month. During that month, he started seeing a striper/prostitute who was trying to sleep with his friends for money. We got back together and I came up pregnant right away and so did she. We were 3 weeks apart. Her choise was to continue her pregnancy which I was not too happy with but there was nothing I could do. During our whole pregnancy she did nothing but stress me out, wanting me to force my boyfriend to go bond with her and rub her belly. My boyfriend made it very clear to her from day 1 that he did not want anything to do with her, and that he will be there for his child & his child only.3 days after her baby was born she began to ask for money. My boyfriend has been there for his child ever since, but she refuses to let the baby come spend time with us because she does'nt want me playing mommy with her child as she puts it. This brings stress and arguments between him & I. The mother wont let the baby come until she's 8 months, and when he tries to see her she always comes up with an excuse or she claims she's busy.He has only seen the baby 6 times since they were born in Oct. He faithfully pays half of her daycare and delivers diapers, clothes and everything the baby may need. She calls at lest once a month with something smart to say.This situation stresses him out and causes us to argue. My myspace page is private because of a previous incident where she printed & edited some of my pics back in May of last year. There had been no more incidents since it became private. For Valentines we had planned  a trip to vegas and I made the mistake to Post it on my status line. Thats when I found out she was still trying to visit my page. She called him and told him that she had an family emergency and needed to travel on Valentines weekend but could not take the baby. We immideately cancelled the trip & prepared for baby girl to finally come. the day before Valentines she called me and laughing she said " Are u mad because your romantic trip was cancelled" She ended up not answering the phone when it was time for us to pick the baby up. Im really getting tired of this situation. I need to know what I can do to make our relationship work and stay strong. I have a feeling she's doing this to break us up.

20090307203506AAfXyjM	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best guy friend is Jason Ferrill but there's more.?	Well Jason and I used to go out for at least a week it didn't work out so well and then 2 years later we're in 6th grade and we're best friends! We've known each other for about 3 years. He is so awesome I can trust him with anything! He's always there for me. I cried because this bitchy girl told me my boyfriend was breaking up with me and he wanted to know what was wrong. He's super sweet (Not as sweet as Logan , my boyfriend) But I hate that when I go up to him or say yep this is my bud *laugh* then the person sitting next to me (EVEN IF THEY KNOW I'M DATING LOGAN) says "Hey Jason your girlfriend wants you!" And Jason and I are both like "Ew, excuse me while I barf!" We're close friends he knows my mom, she used to teach him in 4th grade. But why does everyone think/say I'm going out with him?! I mean he is my best guy friend ever! But, the thought of going out with him again is EW! We always joke around like the other day at school he was asking me if I had his cell phone and he goes up to me and he says Oh I hear it ringing. He did it 'cause the teachers were sitting there staring at us! Then "Old Fart Austin" says "Are y'all... you know... together, going out?" And we're like "God no!" So, she says "Oh I understand" Why does everyone think this?         P.S. He's like a brother to me we hug and everything and we say "Love you too little sis" and I'm like "Wow, Love you too big bro" and everyone's like "Awwwwwwww" and we have the brother/sister fights i gave him a grape i threw on thre ground and stepped on and he ate it. Then I told him and he's like "Damn you Chyann Closson Damn you!" but it was hilarious because he was smiling while he was saying it :D
20090307210403AA86hTt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when your teacher even thinks your dating your best guy friend?	I know, I know. "What the hell? Chick why do you post so many crap questions about Jason if you don't like him and you have a boyfriend!' I am confused about him he's like a brother to me.      So don't say Oh you love him I do but he is a brother to me. I have a boyfriend, Logan and he is the best ever!!!!      My teacher even says I am going out with him!! We are just effing best friends! My teacher is an old fart and what not. But it bugs me and Jason that everyone thinks/says we are dating. IT'S DISTURBING!!  I love Jason. But like a older brother. So, when people say oh yeah your his girlfriend it's weird picturing dating your brother!!!! WHY DOES MY OLD FART TEACHER SAY WE'RE DATING!

20090307204756AAoYvQ5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does anyone else feel that mainstream 'dating' is flawed?	I mean, it's the same thing, a guy likes a girl and asks her out on a "date."  Now with this date being declared, the whole event becomes a sort of "proving grounds" where the dude/girl show how great of a person they are, and the sole purpose (that both parties know) is to see if a relationship can come out of it.  Then when they become "exclusive" they drop the "act" (this goes to my fellow guys especially, lol) and relax and the girl see's it's not what she imagined and then the break up and the cycle starts again, but with more drama/baggage.  To me it seems that the best way would be to become good friends with a girl, that way there's no distance or "proving grounds", and you can just be real with her. Then if you like her, you ask her directly to be your girl.  (unfortunately, about 70 percent of the time you'll be in the "friend zone" by the time you ask. heh, women... am i right fellas? ) but it's still better than just going out with someone for the sole purpose of a possible future relationship.  I know it's not really a question per say, but share your thoughts on this

My husband loved me before marriage but after marriage Idid not find any chemistry between us.  It was all about sex and after sex he would become a person who do not care for me.  Now I recently find out that he looks nude girls and lesbians on the internet.  What do I solve this problem.  We have a 7 month old togetehr.  Why are emotions not important for men?

20090307202926AARLnDx	Family & Relationships;Family	My family is prying into my life through Facebook?	We all act differently around our families, right? Either you are completely yourself, or you put up an act when you're with them. Well I put up an act. My political views, choices, style, tastes, everything is different from them. Anyway, I made what I'm beginning to think is a mistake of adding my siblings and in-laws to my Facebook friends. So now they're kind of seeing the real me and taking it too far. For example, today I became a "fan" of the political film "Religulous". And one of my in-laws freaked and sent me private messages. Just last week another in-law did something similar. A few brothers/sisters join in sometimes as well.    Anybody else have this problem, and what would you do about it? If I just delete them that will be too obvious.

It was over the phone and she said she doesn't want to be friends anymore. But before she said that i said why don't we just stop fighting but she insisted she was done with me. Now i know that i was wrong but so was she. Then on myspace she said we could be friends again soon but then just now she says we can't be friends again. Now, i'm confused! Idk what to do and i need help. She is driving me nuts but i've known her my whole life. We have everything in common and she is my best friend in the whole world and i wouldn't replace her for anything in the world. What do i do?      Post a letter that you think i should do:      A= Completely forget about her and just go on with my life   B= Be depressed and turn emo   C= Pretend it never happened and we both turn back to the way to everything was before the fight and become best friends and not let anything stop us.

20090307205245AAP6Fh7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Lonely in the relationship, what do I do?	I've been in a serious relationship for a year and a half, honestly it had been the healthiest relationship I'd ever been in. My boyfriend is mature and responsible, generous, considerate, he loves and respects both his own family and mine, really he is a very good man. However, I recently found out that he is unhappy in our relationship. He is under a ridiculous amount of stress at work, in his family life (his parents are going through a very difficult divorce), and financially (having to provide for his mother, his brother and for me, partially, however I pay my own rent and food). We also took a substantial hit when the market dropped. He was feeling a lot of pressure to get engaged to me. Last month he dropped the bomb that he noticed things about my personality that drove him crazy and he tried to stop focusing on them but they bothered him so much he became resentful to the point that he was no longer attracted to me. I know this has to do with my lazy and depressed behaviour during the strike I was a part of for three months and also all the stress he is under, but is this something we can get past? I don't want to abandon the relationship, but he made it clear that he does not have the time or energy to work on our relationship. I feel so lonely, having to support him constantly while he is under stress but not recieving any support myself. It is as if he has no sympathy or understanding for my situation at all. He is never romantic or affectionate. I don't know what to do. Should I wait until his situation settles down a little and see how things go when he is under less pressure? I recently went on a business trip for five days, and when I returned he was loving and affectionate and wonderful, but later on he revealed he acted that way out of guilt because he truly enjoyed the time I was gone. He says he loves me very much and that I deserve better than this, but he's happier being alone when he doesn't have to worry about being accountable to anyone. It's hard on us because I only recently moved to this community, and I have no transportation (or friends) except through him, so he feels obligated to take me with him, he told me tonight he wishes I would take the initiative to make plans without him, but he doesn't seem to understand that just isn't possible under my circumstances. I don't have any friends to make plans with, and public transit stops running at 11pm anyway. I know I'm ranting now, I'm just very upset. Can someone please offer me some comfort or advice?
20090307201659AAKJd35	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl friend after 2 years breaks up with me and has no good reason. Explain please...?	We were each others first everything. We cared soo much about each other and spent so much time together. We didn't get bored of each other. She broke up with me just before our two years. Her was   ----I want to enjoy my senior year    -she said she did enjoy time with me    -she said she was already enjoying it   I want to know why she would feel the need to get rid of a good bf. Not to sound ignorant. I never pressured her into anything. Cared about her. and Let her do her own thing when needed.

I went to his friend for advice, and he always helped me with my problems and tried cheering me up every way he could. I learned to trust him, we would talk about other things, getting to know each other in the process, and became really good friends but we never flirted.    My boyfriend and I broke up a few days ago.   Ever since then, his friend has been flirting with me a lot, and we've been having a lot of connections.       He has gone out with all of my boyfriends ex's.      I think I like him, but I don't know if or how I should tell him?

I'm not afraid of "something" happening. I just don't want to give him the wrong idea since I don't like him that way. My mom made a good point that boys are stupid and no matter how much you make sure its a friend date its always a date date because they just don't get it ha ha...no offense to any guy who reads it but its totally true. so how do keep it strictly friend date? and I would just not go but I told him I would and I'm a girl of my word....and if I put it off he will just ask me out the next weekend ha ha. lol so just any advise for any of it thanks!      ps we are both 13 but please no comment on how we shouldn't "date" this early...if MY mom said its ok...haha and my mom is a strick strick mother i'm 100% sure its ok!

20090307202349AAG0fbI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend OBSESSED with Yahoo Answers?	I have a friend who just discovered yahoo answers a few weeks ago.  Now she spends most of her free time on here.  That might be okay if she wasn't completely lying in most of the answers she gives.  She tells some people she has a six pack, others that she has fat rolls, some that she's had a few husband and kids but most that she has a really amazing and serious boyfriend. She keeps adding details about these fake lives and its almost all she talks about now. Should I say something? It's starting to interfere with her schoolwork and social life.  If so, what?
20090307202408AAJyeg5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I a whore? I had sex with him twice and I'm 15.?	Okay, so I dated this guy and the farthest that we went was to kiss while we were dating. We then broke up and became friends with benefits, but for a while, that only got as far as making out and feeling up on eachother. Then he got with one of my friends, and still he acted sexual around me, such as feeling and when we talked on the phone we ended up doing it on the phone. Then we got together and we had sex at his house. Now, he's with this other girl, and today we had sex again. We're not together and he's with this other girl. Am I a whore?
20090307202739AA2g7MD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should my husband and I stay in the US or move back to Ireland?	My husband and I are currently living in the US. I am a US citizen and he is an Irish citizen. We are trying to decide whether or not to stay here or go back over there. I've been there and love it. He is not so happy here. We haven't filed his green card application yet cause we are still trying to decide where to live. We have a month old baby boy. It is so hard to find a job over here even for me, add another 6 months or so on top of that waiting for his work number. Stress. In Ireland both of us can work and make decent wages. The best I can make over here is $10/hr. The same goes for him. I come from a very tight knit family that feels he is taking me and the baby away from them if we move back. But if we stay I fear that they will all grow to resent one another. I already see it happening. We know we have to do what is best for our family. But the decision is tough. I get along with his family very well. Any input would be appreciated.

She is anal about everything and always has to make her point known and always has to be right! I am living with my father and her now at the age of 19 in Florida (because he made me move out here with him) I am originally from Idaho but i am going to school right now. I would move home right now but i still have to finish out the semester. My parents have been divorced since i was 2 and my dad has been divorced twice. He just got remarried this past July. I was happy about moving out here at first because i thought that me and my dad would have a chance to bond, but it has only made it worse because he always puts her first before his children (which i know is right) but it gets ridiculous because she doesn't really like me or my sisters and brother. What do i do?????

He has never moved out from his mom's house.  He was raised in a latin american household, so I feel that this culture fosters more acceptance for men to live at home until their 30s.  Am I wrong?  He is El Salvadorian.  Anyway, he's perfectly functional in every way, but why does he still live with his mom?  This really bothers me, but I don't want to be rude and bring it up.  He's so sweet, educated, has a great job, etc., so what is the problem?  Furthermore, am I wrong for being so annoyed with this?  I mean, think about it, what if we go out to a bar one night and things began happening.  Is he going to take me back to his mom's house or are we going to be like teenagers making out in a car?

20090307211010AAfhOmn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I control my anger towards my husband?	He did something which has caused me to have some very severe trust issues. He apologized a million times and I do believe he will never do it again but sometimes I remember and the pain is fresh all over again.  I told him I do forgive him, but what he has done hurt and scared me so bad, and I can't just forget it happened.  I have nightmares about it because I was so traumatized.  I still need to talk about my feeling and to cry but it makes him feel guilt and he says I'm torturing him. He shuts me down when I try to talk and sometimes that makes me so angry I start screaming at him and I say terrible things to him.  Sometimes I think I want to kill him.  I feel crazy, my chest hurts, I'm crying all the time, its impossible to be the happy person I used to be.  I've hit him twice and he hit me back once.  He knocked me to the ground.   Sometimes he cries too.  Everything is such a mess. I tell him everyday how much I love him and I feel like I'm clinging to him and pushing him away at the same time.        He did something very bad which is hard to talk about.  It involves putting me into a very dangerous situation and I was so scared.  Ever since I have developed so many fears.  I'm scared all the time. I still cry... I'm crying now...  I don't know what to do...

20090307215145AAcaWTp	Family & Relationships;Friends	Girls would you ever date your best guy friend?	I have a really close friendship with one of my girl- friends. And she says, am like the only one she talks and tells her personal problems too, And that I am the only friend she really got. Anyway after not seeing her for about a yr and a half, that she had to change schools. I told her to hang out today, and go watch a movie. So we did exept that she wanted me to meet her mom and she told me to go to her house and meet her mom. Which was really strange to me. Oh we are both 17 BTW. We been friends since freshman yr. Anyway, i went to pick her up, and when i first saw her, i felt Flabbergasted! She looked so cute! So she hug, me, and we both told each other i missed you, and she told me i have really, changed. Then, in the movie theater, i really wanted to kiss her. So I actually ask her. I said. " Can i kiss you". Then she just looked at me and said. " Are you serios?" and smiled. Am like " yeah, i really liked you since freshman year" and she told me " You know your my friend, you are like a brother to me" and brothers dont kiss each other. After that i just stayed shut. I got mad a little, because, she dates other guys, who are uglier than me, and treat her like crap, and she gets naked for them, and kisses them. But me, her best friend, who treats her with respect, and is kind to her, she wouldnt even give me a kiss? Why would a girl do that?

I'm in the process of losing weight (have lost 25, have 12 to go to my goal of 125!) and I Know my bridesmaid dress will be big on me by the wedding, which isn't until summer.

20090307212805AAa6Itu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: please help me!!!(need some damn characters)?	ok so earlier i asked a question on how much makeup they like on a girl. someone said this: "Also, if I was to meet a girl and she was wearing make-up and looked stunning in make-up but below average when the make-up was taken off, that would be a huge turn-off."      i dont wear a ton of makeup, i do it pretty naturally, but i look like CRAP without it. and im nto saying i look stunning with it, but i look a hell of a lot better! this is me w/o makeup:  http://i429.photobucket.com/albums/qq15/...

20090307214051AAUDbJw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls really care what type of underwear a guy wears?	like, if you started dating a guy and then found out he liked to wear something besides boxers, would you care.  Like, if he wears bikinis or thongs.  Would you find this cute?  It seems like girls only like guys to wear boxers, but boxers are not very comfortable, to me anyway.  I like bikini briefs and prefer thongs (I think they are comfy).      just wondering.      would you tell your bf what type of undies to wear?
20090307214036AAZ1hLm	Family & Relationships;Friends	At what point do you stop trying to be someone's friend?	Ok, well I have this one friend that's older than me by 10 years. But when we first met we got along really good and had sooo much in common and shared our secrets with each other. It was almost like we were twins. Then at one point she stops calling me. I called her a few times and she would speak to me, but she'll never call me. Recently she sent me a myspace, and we spoke on there but that it. With her, I just feel like she's not putting in any effort and I shouldn't be doing it by myself. Should I just stop calling her until she calls me??      Then I have another friend...well associate. She's my age. We were best friends, although sometimes I felt as though she was taking advantage of me. I did mess with her ex boyfriend once, but I apologized sooooo many times and that was waaaaaayyy before we stopped talking. I figure she probably didn't stop talking to me because of that b/c she would have stopped talking to me right after I told her what happened. But I was always there for her and she knew it. When she started having trouble at home and fighting with her mom, I was caught in the middle. She ran away from home with a boy and I encouraged her to go home. She didn't want to hear it and stopped talking to me. She admitted later on that she wasn't trying to hear that.  That was a couple years ago. We would communicate every now and then on myspace, but now that we have each other's numbers she doesn't call me either. I spoke with her once and then she said she would call back and didn't. I called her again tonight and she didn't answer. Should I just give up?? I feel that I have done my part and shouldn't have to beg someone to be my friend

Like "talking".    And I'll be like g2g I'm getting in the shower, I'll call you later. And they'll be like have fun with that cold shower. Or they'll be like "sucks I'm not there, looks like you're taking a cold shower". Or when i get out they'll be like "So how was that cold shower?"      Its obviously something sexual.

They'll pay for things, they'll help me out, they're always interested in what's going on with my life.  They're great people.  But I can never give them back as much as they give me even when I try my best.  I don't know how else to rectify the situation except to get away now.        What's the best way to go about it?  I don't want to upset them, just get away.  Can't physically get away though because I work with some of them and the others are in grad school with me so I'll still be around them regularly.

I didn't feel bad about it, was kinda fun actually, but I was wondering if it was a good idea.

20090307211540AAia6mv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Women, would you ever marry a web designer?	I assume most women would find web designers as lazy because they don't go out much.

20090307214136AARDAax	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ehhh, boyfriend help?	well, i've been dating my boyfriend for a couple months now. and we're somewhat really serious, he's in the army and what not, and i was curious to check his myspace out. (we both have each others myspace pw and email) and so i went on it and went to his ex's myspace (his ex is pregnant with his son, she's due in may.) i only went to it because i wanted to see what he has said to her in the past when they were dating, i know i was setting myself up to be upset, but i did it anyway.       well sometimes he calls me "momma" and one time he told me he doesnt know why he calls me that, because he's never called any of his other gfs in the past that, yet i saw he called her that once, back in october. (they dated for about a year.) that bugs me, because something so small and he lied about it? maybe he doesnt remember calling her that, idk. but should i be irritated about this?  i want to ask him to not call me that again, but he'll ask why and idk how to tell him that i looked back on her comments and saw he has said it to her before. he'll think i dont trust him, which i do, but i just was curious to see how serious serious they were.
20090307214239AA6nUws	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Starting to get depressed?	i'm starting to get really depressed about the whole dating thing. i just ended my first real "serious" (it was only one month, but it had really been going on longer than that) relationship a couple months ago, and i'm beginning to doubt that i can have another relationship at all. i'm not the type of guy girls tend to be interested in - i'm the "nice" guy, and i tend to be pretty quiet and reserved until you get to know me.       i pretty much never even talk to girls. i just tried to start up a conversation on facebook with a girl i know recently, and that was a miserable failure. i never really get the opportunity to talk to girls (i'm in college right now), and i don't really know what to do about that.       I feel like i'm pretty much just gonna be alone from now on, and that really sucks. the one thing i want the most right now is to have a girl to be with and to be able to talk to, and it seems like i just can't have it. that's all it would take for me to be happy, but right now, i'm kind of miserable.

20090307215218AAXTtLl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it that some people kiss ***?	Okay, I just don't get why most people Kiss ***!! Especially the boys.   I just don't get it, what are ya hiding or what are ya afraid of. To me, Kissing ***= Being Fake.   *Isn't that right?*      Let me tell you this little situation my friend its going through. Well her name is Michelle and she met this guy for like 9 months already. But what sucks is that they both went to different colleges and they live about 6 hours away *which is not that bad*.    BUUUTTTTT when he talks to her in the phone, he would tell her how much he wants to see her and can't wait to see her.. blah blah blah..   There were times he would tell her that he would like to work out a relationship with her and stuff like that. Until all of a sudden he losses contact with her for like about 5 days & then decides to call her again. But at that time he started to act different and he would still tell her that he wants something to happen between them. *the only reason they lost contact was because she works and goes to school and him in the other hand has school too.*   Sooo what happens is that when she decided to go and visit him and he didnt even want to hang out with her or anything. So she just ignored him and hanged out with his roommate and his roommate's girlfriend.    Now when Michelle comes back home, he calls apologizing and ****. You know, any typical guy that comes up with excuses!   So she forgave him and she decided to go and visit him but this time pretending she was going to visit his roommate's girlfriend so they can chill...but this time he was all up on her kissing ***, pretending he was excited, when he had the chance to react like that when she first went overthere to see him. He was sooo kissing *** with her. So obvious and annoying.    I just dont get why you guys do that.   Not only guys in general, there are also some girls that do the same thing!!

My fiance' cheated and broke my heart   he wants me back, but i know he didnt really love me even tho i loved him with everything.. how is it possible i can still love him? we still talk here and there and i always think about him and miss him, but then i always end up crying when i think about him.      i know i truly loved him i never had one thought of him cheating on me, i always trusted him, if i didnt like a girl he was talking too he'd immedietly disconnect him self from her, and he never flirted or made me feel insecure around other women, i have no idea why he cheated seems so out of character for him, he promises to never make that mistake again. and i don't know how i still can love him, after he broke our trust.. i forgave him, even tho his love wasnt real even & mine was.. so should i give him another chance? and if i don't give him another chance how can i get over him? i don't want another guy for a while, should i even be talking to him? a my friends hate him now.. and tell me not to talk to him but i secretly do..oh and we dated for about 4 years.. and then got engaged.. and then he cheated! makes no sense! what would YOU do?

20090307212959AA7pveq	Family & Relationships;Family	Am i wrong for doing this to my dads side of the family?	this may b long so just read what you can:      basicaly my dads family is a bunch of rich snobby people who cant keep there noses out of anybodys business. everything in that family is gossip and being rude, and they hold grudges on people for YEARS over absolutly NOTHING   for instance:   this christmas we went to my gpas house with the rest of my dads side. everyone was riding snow mobiles, i didnt want to go so i didnt, and neither did my older brothers (they are 22 and 20) my little brother is 12 and he wanted to go, but since my brothers couldnt take him he asked to go with my cousin. my mom said yes, but my uncle threw a fit about it bc TWO years ago my mom wouldnt let my lil bro go with him bc my cousin was really immature then. the sec my brother was out of the house my uncle started blowing up at my mom, and she actualy broke down crying! my older brothers were pissed, but they let my dad handle the sitch and me and them went to calm down my mom. after she calmed down she came back out then me, my mom, my dad, and my older brothers sat on the couch in hte living room ignoring people (just incase you are picturing this in your mind and wondering how we fit 5 people on a couch, lol, i was sitting on my oldest brother lap and then we all fit)  so after my little brother came back we gave hugs (wether we wanted to or not) then we left to the hotel. and they were OFFENDED bc we didnt invite them to go swimming with us at the hotel!!   they always pull this kind of stuff, like we were invited to my cousin megs communion party my dad rsvp's 3 times to make sure they knew we were coming a week b4 it at my lil brother communion my uncle tells us he didnt set up our reservations so we couldnt go. then 2 years later my cousin boby had his so my dad contacted them in like 4 different ways and called them at least 6 times (boby has brain cancer so every minute with him is a big thing) and then the day of it my dad called to tell them we might b like 20 mins. l8 bc we had to drive 2 hours to wear the party was and they once again said we were uninvited.      this year is my 8th grade graduation and i have the option of inviting them or not, and i dont think i will. im upset and hurt that they would do all of this stuff to us and then expect us to always b nice to them.  im pretty much fed up with them. my dad has diabetis really bad and the doctor isnt sure if they he will make is 5 more years so my God father (my dads brother) mentioned to me once that he will prolly end up walking me down the aisle, so i told him that if my dad couldnt do it i was going solo and i dont care what anybody says and that i will give myself away. and thats wat i intend to do. i dont want them at my wedding somday either.       how do i not invite them? my parents really dont want them there either but my little brother has a big mouth and i know that he wil tell my cousin andrew who will tell the whole family and knowing them they will crash it and ruin everything. what do i do??    am i wrong NOT inviting part of my family? if i dont invite them that basically means they wont b a party of my life anymore and i know they wont, if i dont invite them they WILL cut off all connections and my family will probably b taken off my grandpas will and everything. i want some of my aunts form my dads side there (some of them are the best) but i dont know how to just invite them and not everyone. please tell me what to do, my parents just say its in my hands.      thank you sooo much and sorry this was like an entire book

My boyfriend cheated on me (he kissed this other girl, and dirty texted this other one) over the course of a year and four months.      i broke up with him, and he begged for me back. And i took him back but the girl he kissed is being a really obnoxious snob, saying that he was going to break up with me over the holidays...       Yet he was truly upset when i broke up with him. I don't know what to do, but i truly love him and he promises that he loves me.       What happens now?
20090307213314AAHUFOk	Family & Relationships;Friends	My cousin told me she would get a ticket but she gave it to her other friends. it hurts me. what do i do?	Okay Kylie here.    so my cousin Hannah kept telling me how bad she wanted to see Brittany spears concert. she knows i wanted to go too very badly. she told me if she gets her hands on a ticket i will be the first she asks to go with her. So i saw her yesterday with one of the family friends and she so happened to "casually" mention how excited she was for the concert. i thought maybe this shouldn't get me too down then i stayed positive. But 5 minutes later i found out she got her hands on like 3 or 4 tickets total and she invited her private school friends when she clearly promised me first! (like 2 months or so ago not recently) she told me how the plan was her, me, the family friend, and her mom or sister. it hurts me so bad because it makes me feel like she dosent like me that much or anything. i was telling her that i was kind of upset in a casual way today and she kept saying how the tickets weren't even that good and i should just go buy myself a ticket on ebay. i am really upset. what should i do?   (she also told me that she had no way of getting tickets)
20090307220050AA7FxPJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Calling all men... I really need advice.?	My boyfriend works a lot... and of course I always want him to spend time with his daughter and I.  But of course he needs his guy time too.      See, I understand all of this but i think it comes out wrong.      It seems like I barily get to spend time with him, but he says "he never gets to hang out with his friends"  as it stands he goes over there at least 3 times a week.  But he says hes only there for an hour or less usually.      How can I help him feel like im not forcing him to stay home.. but I want some time with him too? idk.. any ideas suggestions and advice please.

Okay, so I like this guy, and I know he likes me because he stares at me all the time, walks really close to me when we pass eachother, and he just shows all the signs of liking me, we have just barely talked.

20090307213554AA32Rtp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this is cute? And is this normal for us to do? Its just a friendly joke.?	Me and my boyfriend play jokes a lot. This one may be a bit too much, but it's kinda cute. Me and my boyfriend have always talked about having a baby of our own one day. He wants a girl to be his first born child. Lately, and sometimes, he jokes around pretending like i am pregnant or something. One day when me and him were just talking, he took his hand and placed it on my stomach and said he felt a kick lol. Then he leans over and says "hi baby girl" and stuff like that. Then i was sitting in a chair and he pulls up a seat next to me, and he started rubbing my stomach saying "in a few more years, his baby will be born soon".       Then recently on a Friday (this was last week), we were playing around, and suddenly he poked me in my stomach and i was like "oww that kinda hurt". He kept apologizing because it hurt me, and then he said "i'm sorry i hurt the baby". It goes on like this sometimes. And if it's not the girl, its his "newborn son" that hasn't even came yet, or ain't coming anytime soon.      Is this a bit disturbing? I think it's cute. I'm just curious.

I like this guy, and hopefully he doesn't know.   Today I was in the bus every time he said something out loud he would turn to look at me, but I pretended not to see him even though i did.   When he said "Hi" to me i just gave him a quick smile then looked at a girl which was my friend and gave her weird faces like giving her a sign that, that was weird. When I turned back to look at him he was still smiling at me which that's really weird.   Later he turned to and said "I Play The Piano" i nodded my head and smiled.   Then when I was leaving he said "Bye (my name), have a nice day." i just left.   He also pronounced my name wrong, he is like 2 years older then me too !      So Do You Think He Is Interested Or Just Being Friendly?      Any Advice?

20090307220331AAJnjc5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy jealousy issues :/ [HELP ?]?	so theres this guy. i started liking him last year but this year ive liked him more than ever. the only problem is that he has a freshman gf and i get kinda jealous. :/ even though i know that he isnt being him when hes with her.      occasionally we talk on myspace and msn but not so much at school if ever. and when we talk the convo ends just after a few msgs. [im not that great at talking with guys either]      ive tried getting a boyfriend of my own but whenever i did it was just to fill the empty space because of the guy that i liked.       occasionally the guy that i like will look at me in the halls whenever i walk by but that doesnt help the situation even though it makes me smile.      it also doesnt help that i know his current gf [she went to my church and shes a BIG stuck up snob] she is really controlling and even his friends say that he doesnt act like himself when hes with her.      ive tried to tell myself that id get over him but i always end up liking him everytime.       if possible help :/ [sry this got so long]
20090307212301AAMQ5ni	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I'm calling my boyfriend too often...?	I dunno.   He can't talk until like seven thirty at night and has to get off at nine thirty. (he's fourteen, i'm twelve)    He used to call me the second he got to his dad's (which is at sevenish) but now I have to call him. I usually call around eight. And then on the weekends, I call like three times and there's no answer. he doesn't have an answering machine. and then i wait like an hour or two and i call back. on saturdays, it's like around three or four before i actually talk to him.   am i being to clingy? he hasn't acted any different or seemed annoyed; i might just be paranoid.

20090307212028AA3XSAo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband dosent want sex, what's wrong?	My husband and I are young in our mid 20s we haven't even been married a year yet but we've been together for 8 years. We were eachothers firsts and neither have ever been with anyone else. Our whole relationship I have pretty much always been the one to initiate sex (when we first had sex we did it quit a bit) but over the years I have watched our sexual relationship diminish to nothingness. its gotten bad enough in the past couple years that I would say we have sex maybe 4 times a month, and recently I have found we have been having sex only 2 to 3 times a month. I have asked my husband many times if there was something wrong. I have asked if there was someone else and he says no I have asked if he feels that I am no longer attractive and he says he still thinks I'm pretty. I have even went as far as to quesstion his sexual orientation, and he says he's straight. I have approached him lovingly and I have gotten mad a few times as well. He still does not change, this makes me feel rejected not worthy sad angry disgusted embarassed and lonley. I mean it hurts not to be wanted in that way, I love sex I love the feeling, the one ness of it. And I have told him I would do ANYTHING he wants! Still nothing. When we finally do have sex it lasts for maybe half hour 45 mins if I'm lucky. So I wait and wait and usually end in let down. I do "service" myself to keep me some what sane. I don't want to leave I don't want to cheat but I don't know what else to do? Anyone out there with the same situation or advice would b much appreciated.
20090307214716AAmh45y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS: Do you really like the "bad boy" image or are you more attracted to "nice guys"?	I hear that girls really like "bad boys" but honestly it confuses me to no end...  They always end up getting hurt in the end...      I would consider myself a nice guy...  If I like a girl, I treat her with respect and I'm very caring towards her...  There's a girl in my life right now that I'm absolutely crazy about and I would give her the world if she would just see something in me too...  We've become pretty good friends in the past month...  It seems like she's starting to like me, but I'm not getting my hopes up...  Just trying to take it slow.      I'm 18, by the way, and my feelings for this girl are genuine...  I'm not the kind of guy that is gonna go off and use girls for sex.  I'm very mature for my age.  That's just not me and I believe in a little something called "respect." And idk if girls that age tend to like a certain 'classification' of guy more than the other or not.      Do girls really like the "bad boys" or do I have a chance with this girl because I'm a "nice guy?"      Thanks!
20090307210753AA4xOuW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do i Show my boyfriend that sexualy attracted to him?	Im very shy when it comes to this kinda thing.. like should i rub him arm.. feel his chest when were together??
20090307213323AAKkRS1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if this girl likes me?	There's this girl that I've got a crush on and I've already told her that. Anyways what's bothering me is that shes showing me signs of liking me and signs of something else;I don't know if its rejection...      Here are the signs she shows which I think is positive:   > she always has a smile ready for me whenever I approach her   > whenever I'm not looking at her(coz I'm talking to someone else & she's just right next to me),she looks at me & keeps her gaze at me   > she allows me to touch her   > (does this count?) she's a bit shy whenever I'm around her   Now the other she signs she showing me(which I consider sort of negative) is this:   > she doesn't look at me that much whenever I'm trying to talk to her(she just glances at me from time to time)   > Whenever I stare at her she doesnt get offended but she giggles and asks why I'm looking at her, but can't look at me   > Whenever I'm near her she doesn't mind me unless I start a conversation with her      From what I can come up with I guess she's shy but wants to be flirted around with. I'm doing the best I can to focus all my attention on her but the negative things she does kind of makes me lose my confidence because I don't know whether she likes what I'm doing or not.It's like at some times her actions would encourage me and give me hope that she likes what I'm doing and then other times I get the feeling she's not interested in me. If any of you girls know what's going on in her mind by trying to empathize with her please tell me I'd greatly appreciate it. Guys are sensitive too whenever they're trying to court a girl...

20090307214110AAwMI1i	Family & Relationships;Family	My parents and sister mean nothing to me!?	No matter what i do in my families eyes its wrong. I always got good grades in school (As&Bs). I never played sports. My family always compared me to my sister. They always tried to force me into playing basketball because my sister did. My mom used to take my sister to the mall and places like that and when i would call my mom would just say "what do you want" in a mean way and wouldn't even say hello when she answered her phone. The only one that would ever take me places or take me to dentist appts. and stuff like that was my brother. My mom bought me sister a brand new car when she was 16. but when i turned 16 she wouldn't even let me take drivers ed so i couldnt get my licenses till i was 18. When i got my licenses I asked my parents if the would lend me $300 for 1 week till i got my paycheck because the car i had saved money for i had to buy that week or they were selling it to someone else. I needed a car because i was starting collage and would need it to get there because me parent already told me they wouldn't take me and wouldn't help me pay for it. Even though my sister went to a big school and they paid for everything(plus she went to private school in high school). When I was 19 I got pregnant with my boy friend who i dated since i was 13 but when he found out i was pregnant he left me. I never asked my mom for anything execpt to be there the day i had the baby but she didnt even do that. I managed to finish college and keep a decent job. My sister already had 2 kids and my mom would babysit them 6 days a week 10 hours a day for free but she told me she didnt want to watch my daughter even when I offered to pay her. My brothers wife watched my little girl while i went to school and work because she didnt work and she had a little boy. I payed her because i felt like i had to, I managed to buy everything my baby needed (my mom wouldn't even let me have a baby shower because she said i didnt need one), I payed rent and all my bill. When I gradutated college my brother and his wife gave me all the money that i had payed them for baby sitting as a graduation gift(every time i would pay them they would put it in a seperate savings account). I am now 25 and my daughter is almost 6. Im engaged and getting married next year. I am planing on having my brother walk me down. And i wasn't playing on having my parents or sister there since theve been out of my life so long but now they say the care and my dad wants to walk me and they all want to be there what should i do?         and do you think its bad that my parents and sister mean absolutely nothing to me?      should o go to consuling?                   sorry allot of misspellings i had to type it fast.

20090307213134AAqKUvb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel extremely isolated...should I see a therapist?	I'm wondering what other people were or are in their mid twenties do if they feel socially isolated.  I have a few good friends but it seems they are all getting seriously involved with girlfriends or getting married.  I can't seem to successfully date, and I feel left behind.      It was some what the same in high school and college but I always felt if I just kept working towards finishing school and didn't worry about it that by this point in my life I wouldn't be single anymore.  I seem to do less now socially then ever before.  I'm tall, have a good job, people tell me I'm funny but I can't meet girls or even new friends.  I ask the few friends I do have for help or advice but mostly I just get be patient or things will happen, kinda just sounds like they don't know what to say.

I have come to the conclusion that my husband and I have totally different goals and priorities. I gave up my social life to be a mother and he wants to maintain his party lifestyle which clashes with my children's schedule. I have maintained my marriage buy compromising my life 100%..   I feel hurt that he would rather dump my kids at a babysitter rather than wait for me to get off school(i;m going part-time..)   in other words the word to describe this is DISAPPOINTMENT.

20090307215231AAbkD55	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do you just pick up and leave?	I have come to the conclusion that I am not going to get anything more out of this relationship of 4 years. We just are not compatible. I try to change the things about me that he does not like, but when I try to suggest some things that he should change, he shrugs it off, but still demands that I chage for the sake of the relationship. My family that I would be going back to lives like 9 hours away. I have a life here with school, and a job, and we have 2 cats. I have a life here. But I feel that the relationship that it is based around is forced... I have to force the feelings. That is not natural. How do you get the strength to leave when you know you have a 9 hour drive away from you? And also that you know how crappy the job market is and how tough it will be to find a job. Everything is in place here, but I just cannot stay. I must leave, completly... leave the state. I only work part time, cannot find a full time job and even if I could it would not pay enough for the high cost of living here. I just don't want him to have the satisfaction of knowing that I depend on him. I have tried 2 times to leave but turned around because I felt like I was giving up... but since coming back nothing has changed and I am at square 1... more like -1. How do you find the strength?

20090307220005AAJ0mCe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any advice for an unwanted crush?	This is a long story, so beware. Two years ago I met this guy, let's call him Charlie, and we became friends. I developed this crush on him for a while, and apparently he liked me too but i was unaware at the time. He's a grade above me, so the next year he went to the high school, and i stayed at the junior high. We started emailing each other a lot, but we couldn't hang out a lot because the distance between homes and school. We both started liking each other again i guess. The one time we hung out, we talked about liking each other, but not knowing why because we didn't know each other very well. So we decided to get to know each other and hang out and see were that led us, but it never really happened. To be honest i kind of avoided hanging out with him, because i kind of fear relationships. So we stayed distant friends.    This year, we are at the same school, and we still email. We don't hangout at all but we say hi and talk when we see each other. For some reason, i care about him a lot, even though i don't have those special feelings for him.     Charlie has this best friend, let's call him Johnny and he's on the swim team. i joined the swim team this yea, so i've talked to johnny a few times, and he's super nice. Gentlemenlike and caring and all. So needless to say now i have developed a crush on johnny. None of this would be a problem, but my friend has just informed me that charlie has started liking me again. Charlie and johnny are the BEST of friends, and i know myself enough to kn ow that my crush isn't going to go away anytime soon.    So what can i do? I don't want Charlie to find out, because it might hurt him. i just want to stay friends with charlie. And with johnny i would at least want to become friends with him because he's so cool and kind. but i'm afraid if i do that, my crush will just grow deeper. And i don't want to put johnny in the middle of this mess.  Any advice at all?

She started hanging out with one of my other friends that I introduced her to(whom I dont associate with now for certains reasons).But she never calls me, she took me off her myspace list, and when I text her or call her she never sounds happy to hear from me.Is it just me or did I lose a friend?

20090307214549AAQKZCx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl Troubles, I need advice?	Shes in my math, and science classes, both of which the teachers talk a lot. So I can't just go sit by her. She sits pretty close to me in my classes, but out of talking distance. I'm not really the "cutest" guy but i'm not ugly, and i'm a lot of fun to be around. I'm 14 and so is she. I think she lives within (my) walking distance. (BTW i'm hopefully going to be on track so my walking distance is like 2 miles. Would a girl like me that much better if I was on the track team?) I'm around 5'8" 130lbs, in great shape, shes like 5'4" prob around 110lbs. So far she doesn't know I exist. My school has a spring dance, I was hoping to be able to ask her to it, but if I had to now.....obviously would get shot down. Is there anything I could do to improve my chances? (Getting her number I KNOW would, cuz I hang out with almost everyone in my phone-book) How would I get her number? How long do you think it would take? And what conversation should I use when talking to her? Should I smile??? I know a lot of questions....

My parent don't let me do very much of anything. I have never given them any reason not to trust me. I have never snuck out. I have straight A's in school. I have held a job for a year and a half. I tell them who I am going to be with the whole who what where when and how thing. But now I am not allowed to do anything past 9, like I can't leave my house. This has never been an issue but it is becoming one because so many of my friends drive.   Well now I will ask to go see a movie at 10- No I can't go   Ask to go see a movie with 5 friends all guys during the day at 6- No I can't go   Ask to go to a party, they ask have I met them I say no- No I can't go   I ask to go to a party- They have to drop me off meet the parents scout the place out make sure theres no substances etc. (usually there's no parents and there will most likely be alcohol, I mean one were teenagers two some of our friends are over 21 so mean hello, but that doesnt mean I will drink.) (also if there is alcohol it becomes a sleep over so no one drives drunk)   I am just really sick of not having a social life, and I am not into the whole little lets get together and dance to lame rap music while eating chips and dip.   How can I convince my parents to let me do more stuff.   Also I don't drink or do drugs etc.
20090307212254AAWuMVG	Family & Relationships;Family	Problems with my father?	I am almost 16 years old, so still a teenager and you might think well then all teenagers have parent troubles, but this is a little different. My parents have been divorced since I was 7, so nothing new there, but about a year ago my dad got married, she seemed pretty nice, but now i know that she is definitely two faced. My parents went to court a little over a month ago because my dad is kind of rude to my brother and I, but primarily my brother, also he is an alcoholic, that's primarily why my parents got divorced, and he got clean for a while and then just started up again about 4 years ago. And after they went to the judge and such and I came back to my dads house, him and his wife sat me down and she yelled at me for ruining everything and blamed it all on me, it has the least to do with me out of everyone. This has all blown over now really, but I constantly have problems with my dad, he doesn't listen to me, he gets drunk and gets really stupid or is just saying things that bother me such as asking me if I have done my homework yet, I am a really good student who always does my homework I even got a 4.3 gpa last semester and it's like he still doesn't trust me. All of this makes it so I don't want to go to his house on the weekends (the only time I see him) but also he lives over a half an hour out of town away from all my friends, and since i can't drive and don't have a car and there is no bus stop anywhere near his house I don't get to see my friends on the weekends. I can't see them during the week either because I dance 3 times a week and have lots of homework, so I have friday and that is all. I am a teenager, I want to go hang out with my friends and party (I don't do drugs or drink and he knows that) but he won't let me out. So what I want to know is how do I fix things with him and his wife and how do I maybe get out of going to his house, or get more time with my friends?

20090307211544AANbXrK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	HELP! I need advice. Fiance insists on staying 'friends' with all exes and females he's ever known...?	I'm very close to making a big step and moving in with my soon to be fiance. For a long time it has bothered me that he insists on staying friends with all of his ex girlfriends and all females he's ever dated or known. (He talks to some on holidays and other times, too)      I have access to his facebook (he gave me the password due to my jealousy) and he is constantly adding females as friends. Just a heads up, there is one picture in his album of the two of us together so it's not that he's hiding me. Just today there was a new addition to his friends on facebook. (of course she is young and pretty which tends to be the way it always is -- I'm older than they are by a good 7 yrs) It turns out that this was a 'friend' he met online a year and a half ago and he had never met her but he wants to stay friends with her and claims there's nothing that he is hiding so I should either live with it or move on.      The trouble is, he and I met online as well about 8 yrs ago and he 'kept in touch' with me for many years before we ever got together. I can't help but think he's keeping in touch with all his exes 'just incase' and I feel extremely upset about it. He feels that since I have his password and have access to his account it shows that he's not hiding anything. Yet, he won't tell me where he met this girl he just added as a friend except for 'online'.... (By the way he met her online when he and I were still 'friends' mostly.)      I'm very close to thinking this is the final straw with me but I'm looking for others opinions, too.      Thanks.
20090307213221AA6qVCD	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does everybody think they can replace my mother?	I am 23 years old. My mother passed away 6 months ago. Since then my fiance and his mother think they can replace her. Over Christmas there was a trade show I used to go to with my mother. My fiance told his mom to take me. I kept telling him I didn't want to go because it wouldn't be the same, but he insisted. I cried the whole time we were there, hating the fact that I had to entertain her. I am also in the midst of planning a wedding and my fiance keeps inviting his mother to things I would rather just do with my sister. If he doesn't invite her, he tells her about an appointment and then she makes me feel bad for not inviting her. I hate the fact that I don't have my mom there to help me plan, but I don't want his mom to think that she can replace her by being there instead. What can I say to them to let them know that, although I appreciate what they're trying to do, it really only makes it worse?
20090307212117AAccVwc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think of me?	Sorry there's no picture! I'm 5'5", I'm mixed (black and white). My hair is dark brown, straight and a little past my shoulders. I'd say I'm pretty fit (I weigh 120), have a C cup. My eyes are almond shaped and chocolate brown, I have pretty full lips, and a good face structure. I seem really shy until you get to know me. I love reading and I'm smart (my friends joke that I use really big words). I'm pretty fun at parties and I love dancing at them. I'm really attracted to tall guys with ripped arms (it's my weakness lol) there's just something about them that makes me feel protected! Chocolate and ben and jerry's are my comfort foods! I'm terrified of Freddy Kruger!!! I love when people tell me their secrets it makes me feel closer to them. Umm this is getting really long. . .I should probably stop pouring my heart out. So. . .what do you think?

My name is Jenna- My children were raised to be strong catholics and not support satanic beliefs.      Now, for my question to you.      My son was watching spongebob square pants.. he is 7 years old, and I heard this show promotes homosexual beliefs and tolerance for these unchristian animals. I think my son is a homosexual, should I ask the good father at my church to speak with him?    I am just totally baffled by this, I thought my son was a good christian, he just made his first communion.

20090307212719AA4oh8a	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does this make her beautiful to everyone?	I have known someone for a period of time who thinks that she is beautiful and wanted by everyone. She acts as if she is perfect and seems to have no physical flaws. Whenever men look at her they always comment on how "beautiful" she is.   She looks like Linda carter actually.  Anyhow,  she is full of herself and has severe mental issues.  She is unable to function without heavy medication. Also, she manipulates men. Not so long ago she told me how she always loved me and so on. Yet when the time came for her to meet me she stood me up. She's into reeling men in then casting them out emotionally. To make things more outragous. She recently married a woman. Who she met 4 weeks prior on the internet.  Her companion is quite ugly and looks and acts like a man.  Yet, everyone around them loves them and she is very popular and is featured in a lot of places all because of her 'beauty'. But she is not so beautiful inside.  Though I am the only person who can see that.  It makes me feel bad, like I am ugly. Does being pretty on the outside make someone perfect?  Even if they are not so kind on the inside?  She is always surrounded by people who admire her.  She hasn't worked for anything in her life and works full-time as a beautician type person.
20090307211353AARfMFi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Cheating Husband & Wife?!?	I have been another man's mistress for a little under a year, I was aware at the time that he was married, and I admit it was my dumb mistake to go along with it. I ended up having a threesome with him and his wife, his wife doesn't know that I have been sleeping with her husband for a year, as her husband left for work she told me that she'd been sleeping with other men behind her husband's back. I found this out because she asked if I was willing to have another threesome with her and this other man. I'm stuck as to whether or not to tell her husband. The wife has been sleeping with other men for the past 3 years, and her husband has no clue. I don't feel as if I'm in the position to tell the husband, both of them (on seperate occassions) have told me that they only cheat because their sex life is crap, should I leave it and not tell the husband?

20090307211748AAUibJz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy Prob.- Did I do the right thing?	Well, my ex-boyfriend (lets say Nathan) liked me. So he asked me out again about a month later, and I said yes. But I don't really feel happy because I said yes to not break his heart and because I also like another boy (Adam), and he's really nice, caring, compliments me and laughs at my jokes, even if they suck. Nathan doesn't do that. I've known Adam for a year, he's like my diary, and I really like him, and I found out he liked me too. So 1 day later I broke up with Nathan, and Adam asked me out…5 hours later after I broke up with Nathan. And I said yes. He's been really sweet to me lately, and when I told Nathan, he said he was fine, but my best friend said that he's been talking trash about me behind my back after the break up. I also saw proof. Did I do the right thing?

My ex got married to some mormon chick he got pregnant and I have't spoken with him in quite some time. I know he still has feelings for me... and I did for him but I have moved on for obvious reasons (he is married). Well he contacts me out of the blue and says he misses me so much and asks me to send him pictures. I hadn't responded to his text and I just got an email from him saying he is having another baby with his wife...      WTF? Why contact me and ask me for pics, tell me that you miss me, then drop a bomb on me that you are having another child with your wife? I am trippin here. Is he that stupid? I just want to know if I have a right to explode becuz I am about to rip him a new one. I mean why not just let me go? And then to ask for pictures and tell me you miss me... oh by the way we have another baby coming.       What do you think about this? What is his motive?    Do I have a right to explode?

Me and bob are Bestfriends, he is more like my brother, he knows that I'm Bisexual and all he is straight but somehow we worked that out and we are seriously like brothers, if you see me then you know he is around the corner. Anyway back to the question. We are hanging out with a bunch of friends (6 or 7) and he comes over and sits in my lap( Not facing toward me). Now i'm already sitting down so its just extra weight on me. So he leans against my chest and makes himself comfortable then, we just go on hanging out with friends. So my question is, Did that mean something? Or is he just comfortable around me?
20090307212434AAyu3jD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in middle school, but I think I am in love, I need relationship advice.?	I'm only in 7th grade at Liberty Middle School, but there is this girl, Caitlin, and every time I am around her, I get this really weird/good feeling in my chest, and my stomach, even in my head. We have gone out on and off several times, and broken up every time for unknown reasons. Now we are okay friends, but I really want to be more than friends. But I don't know how she feels. Every time I try to talk about us, she sort of changes the subject, but I don't want to antagonize her about it, so I just let that happen. The first time we went out, my friend hooked us up on sort of a blind-date. And she really liked me, but I knew absolutely nothing about her other than her name, Caitlin Nunn, and after about a week, I broke up with her because we never spent any time together but walking to school. After that we became really really good friends, and I went out with this girl Paige for like 3 months, then we broke up. And it was really obvious that Caitlin liked me again, and I liked her, more so than the first time, so I asked her out again, and she said yes. Every thing went flawlessly for about 2 months, we went on frequent dates, we went to parties, and birthdays together, we went to sleep-over-ish parties together, and we even slept together like 3 times (NOT SEX), we cuddled a lot, we did everything together, and then one day after school I came up behind her and kissed her, and said hey. Then she turned to look at me and gave me a kind of...feel bad face, I guess, and I knew that face, and I slowly said, are you going to break up with me? and she frowned and nodded yes slowly. So I said can we still be friends, and she smiled slightly and said yes.   So we hugged, and sat down, ready to go outside during the YMCA after school program. Next couple weeks were horrible, due to the fact that I still really really liked her, and I wasn't sure about her feelings. Then one day I went out on a limb and asked her out suddenly while at the YMCA after a game of kick ball with my friends. She said yes.   We went out for 3 days before she broke up with me again. That was about 3 months ago. About 2 or 3 weeks ago, she told me she liked me again, and if it led somewhere, she didn't want it to be weird between us in any way. But apparently her feelings for me passed again, and she told me we could be friends. And now, she gives me a look every now and then, that makes me feel like she may have feelings for me again, but I don't want to get to hopeful, so I try and try and try to ignore it. But every time I see her, and every time I talk to her, I get an amazing feeling inside of me, and I just want to hold her, and never let go. I think she likes me again, but I am not entirely sure. She still gives me that look every day or two. And I want her to like me, but I don't know what to do.       Please help me?      And please nobody say "Love isn't possible in middle school" or, "forget love, and do your homework or something"

The only thing that i ever want to do is get out of the house and hang with friends. Even then my parent control me, like wen they make me go home at like 7pm and never let me out at night. It really pisses me off and makes me wish they were put of my life. I have started experimenting with drugs now with my friends, partly to make me feel better about my situation. I dont do crazy ****, ive only tried weed, ecxtacy, and shrooms, but the way my parents make me feel , i probably wont stop doing drugs anytime soon. I also dont have a girlfriend and i kinda want 1.

20090307213340AAAa3jP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Regret getting married but want to save it. Pl Help?	I got married when I was just 22 years old. I dont know what attracted me to my husband. He treated me like a princess, loved and cared for me the way nobody did. He was very intelligent and had big ambitions and a very great career. But that time also what I saw missing in him which unfortunately is very important for me was "style", attitude, general smartness, leadership qualities. But somehow I overlooked all that and after three years of long distance dating we got married. He still loves me more than himself. Gives me priority above anything in his life. But now all things which I overlooked now keep coming back to me. We have varied personalities. I like to be a leader, life of the party and he is opposite. I like attitude and smartness, for him those are too materialistic. Now when i go out, meet people I compare other guys with him. Compare him alot with others which hurts him atimes and I hate to do hurt him. I know that I cant get any other guy who will love me like him but since he has been the only guy I have ever dated I cant convince myself enough. I want my marriage to work so much but at the same time I want him to change, become into a new person with all the qualities i wanted in my "right guy". He supports me in no matter what I do. Always stand behind me which makes me even more guilty because I keep comparing him and regretting my decision of getting married. Whereas for him its the best thing ever happend to him. Please help me save my marriage.
20090307213354AAWDvb1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this guy, but I'm not sure if he's gay...what should I do?	I'm a gay and in high school and I've really liked this one guy for two years now, but I'm not sure if he's straight or gay. He does/acts in ways that could allude to him being gay, but at the same time he could very well be straight. I'm not even sure if he knows what he is, but my question is: what should I do if I want to possibly have a relationship with him (if he's willing, of course). We're both in a musical which has its closing night tomorrow, and I feel like I might want to tell him how I feel in the high of closing the show. What do you think???      Thanks!!!

20090307214220AAAolP7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why does my mom want me to be perfect?	My mom always wants me to be perfect. She always compares me to  my little sister. "Why can't you be like your sister? She can sing and is a top student. Why can't you be like her? Don't become like your dad!" she'll say. My mom always blames me and my dad for everything. You see, me and my sister don't live together. She seems so nice to my mom and dad, they think of her as an angel, but when we're alone together, she let's out her true self. It's really annoying. My mom wants me to be perfect and gets angry if I make one mistake. She used to be a poor girl so I thought she would understand. She always says "Don't be like those other people. We are filipinos! When I was young, my mom never hits me.". So why does she hit me? She's always being racist and comparing me to her childhood. I've read many books to help myself from this situation, I've tried everything, but she won't understand. I make up stories that I got high scores for tests in school so she can be proud of me. I tell her that I got 49 out of 50, and she'll say it's not good enough. I got a okay part in the play, she'll say the lead character is better than me. Also, she always gets angry that I'm thin and forces me to eat everything. Can somebody tell me what to do? I want to make my mom proud of me for once.
20090307214347AA9eKLj	Family & Relationships;Family	Why doesn't my mom understand me? Why doesn't she listen?

She doesn't like the way I dress, she doesn't like the way I talk, and doesn't like the ay I text, she doesn't like the way I walk! She always thinks I'm doing drugs or something, but I'm NOT!!!(Seriously, I'm not on drugs) I also am asain, but one of the laid back, people. My mom has "friends" that have smart little asain kids, (that are my friends, they're the best, they don't care if I'm laid back) and just because I don't study as hard as them doesnt mean I'm some kind of mental person! My mom is always all like demanding for answers, and 100% of the time I have one, when I start talking she yells at me for talking back to her. I just want to know if moms always do this and why she isn't listening or understanding me! I mean, teenagers have they're own worlds and problems too deal with too, and she doesn't seem to get that!

20090307215332AAA7s1T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me! Relationship ending? Please take 10 minutes and read and help me.?	Ok, So I met a girl about 6 months ago and I the day I met her i couldn't believe how amazing she was. Funny, super smart, outgoing, everything a guy wants in a girl. But I found out she had a boyfriend which was of already two years. So we started talking just as friends and eventually were texting everyday, seeing each other for lunch and talking on the phone late at night. I started to really like her and ended up telling her. She told me how you had feelings for me too but was still in a relationship and loved him as well. Her boyfriend recently dumped her because he had some problems going on and as his excuse "needed time to chill out". Its been a little over a week and me and this girl have hung out twice since then and cuddled and held hands as we watched a movie then had dinner. She came over just last night to meet the family and spend most of the night hanging out. Everything was amazing and we had the best time in the world. Today I was talking to her and brought up about how she told me she liked me when she was still going out with her boyfriend and how she could prove that she wouldn't do it to me. It turned into how she still has feelings for him and how it wasn't going to be a while until she was over him. I understood that part until she told me she had a box of his stuff that she kept for memories. I told her if she wanted to get over him she should give it back to him and move on. She then said how she was going to keep it cause it meant a lot to her and he wouldn't remember most of the things that she kept anyway. I asked her how she could be doing this all to me when she says she still has feelings for him and stuff. We ended up getting into a huge fight and she ended it by how she didn't think it was good if we hung out tomorrow. Any ideas on what I should do? Thanks!

20090307220004AANpauO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does this girl like me based on this...?	I've know this girl for about a year, but not very well.  One day, she decides to text me and ask what's up.  From here we start to talk more to each other, and recently we have gone to two basketball games together.  She invited me to ride up to the games with her if I didn't have a ride, which I didn't.  So we drove up together, and now we have gotten to know each other a lot better.  During the games though, we don't sit by each other, instead we sit by our own friends.  Do you think this girl would go on a date with me or does she just want to be friends?      The other half of this story is that she is good friends with a girl who competely blew me off, and this girl's friends will not speak to me, accept for her.        I'm trying to take things slowly, but I worry she will lose interest if we don't see each other often enough, so what do I do?

20090307220227AAJ2Avr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do with my boyfriend?	We've been together for 5 years and moved into our own house, and recently bought a puppy. Lately, however, we've been coming to a hault emotionally and physically. I love him to death, but it's frustrating to me that he is not affectionate and refuses sex (it's been 2 months). I always put the first move out there, but he simply replies "Eh, not right now" or his body language is just plain dismissive.      He gets very snappy at me at times, and for no reason. His job isn't stressful, and he gets plenty of sleep. In fact, I am the one up early with the puppy, constantly taking him out... making dinner, cleaning up, laundry, yada yada. I feel like I'm married, and we're not. That's a whole other *nothing* that he doesn't feel is necessary. I need help. I don't know if I'm depressed or just overreacting, I don't know. Any advice?

We always said that we love each other and that is all that matters. I understand that sometimes I can be difficult but so can he. We have definitely had our ups and downs. Now after ten years he says that he needs a break to find himself. He says he's lost himself somewhere and wants to rediscover himself. I feel hurt because I understand where he is coming from but I want to be with him and help him. What should I do? Do you think he wants out or do you think that everybody just needs to focus on themselves every once in a while? Am I just being a jerk because I'm thinking about my feelings?

This one girl who is 18 gave me her number, told me to call her and said she liked me. I am wondering if it is alright that i go out with her? I don't think I'm considered to be in a position of authority since I am volunteering, she is older than me, and the children aren't at risk, it's just sort of a western culture-intigragtion program. I like her and think it could work but am also wondering if the supervisors of the program would care, if they found out?

20090307222019AAomxa5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I stop the pain from abandonment and the effects it is causing in my relationships?	I never met my father. He abandoned me before I was even born and this has played a big toll on my life and my feelings. I had my mom contact him a few years back and we talked about getting a paternity test. He said he was going to call but never did. I wrote a letter to his job(only address I have) and no response. I tried to convince myself that maybe he just didn't receive it. So I finally decided to call his job and leave a message. I thought that Maybe me calling would somehow make him care. and he did call back. He asked me when I was going to go over there so I thought he cared. He said he was going to call back but never did.  Now I've noticed I've been very emotional and mean towards my boyfriend and I feel so bad because he truly is a good person. I know he loves me but I feel like I'm pushing him away and I feel so bad.

20090307222049AA7IK3k	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I kick my sister out the house?	My sister moved in with me after college. We have now been living to together in my home since 2004. We lived in an apartment together two years before that. Living together has been mutually beneficial. It allowed me to save for a home and become more financially stable. I'm now at the point where I'm feeling the itch to start living by myself. I love my sister but there are some things about our living situation that I'm tired about. One she doesn't really help in cleaning the common areas and two she's always here in the house. So there is little time for me time unless I go hide in my room. I've mentioned several times to here in the last year that she should think about getting her own place. Now she's all worried she can't afford it with the harsh economic times. It sucks because I don't want to kick my sister out on the street but I think there are ways for her to make it work but she doesn't want to. Am I being too harsh?
20090307222740AAtZJFw	Family & Relationships;Friends	My two friends always make fun of me... why?	Ok well my best friend Hannah, became really good friends with my other good friend Katie, out of the blue. Whenever im around them im like a third wheel- and all they ever do it make fun of me..like jokingly- but it goes on for a while so its really irritating. Ill tell them to stop but then theyll just keep at it like "your so stupid!" or when they see someone ugly (on tv) "thats brittney!" And they laugh so hard on and ON AND ON!!!!  But then when im with them seperatly, theyre prettygood friends... Its like the only thing they have in common is making fun of me....         Why do they do that?
20090307222210AARa2f7	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I follow my instinct or my heart?	My daughter's father smokes marijuana; for years before our two year older was born. He smoked marijuana. I used to when we were 19 and 20 years old. I began to grow out of it  and I saw that the effects of it was not something I liked anymore, but he continued. Now he has got to where he smokes 4 or more a day. If he does not have money he will ask for my last dollar if I decline he becomes irritated and argumentative this has been for years. For a while he will take my debit cards or my money without asking, and he does this also so he can play all of the money on keno. Me and him have grown up together within the 7 year relationship and still are but it is like i am watching him go down hill and our daughter is getting older. Me and him come from the same backgrounds. His parents were on drugs his mother recently died  at 43 from all the drug and alcohol abuse, My mother  left me and i went through foster care I found out she died from aids and drugs during my H.S graduation. So I guess we went through our little drug abuse stage, but he is still smoking me and him are now 26 and I can not stress over him anymore and I look at him as my only family after my grandmother died everyone else just looked the other way. I really don't want to just leave him where he stands but my mind is telling me I will get sick if I keep stressing over him. I have told him how uncomfortable he makes me when he gets upset With me over not giving him money so he can buy marijuana, It's like I have to talk to him like a child telling him what the money I earn which is not much; school and a baby and part time waitress can not support a drug habit. I tell him I need to keep the money I earn to support the household, but he begins to tell me I should not deny him the money since he does not ask all the time. I tell him he should respect the fact what I tell him and my reason if valid and not try to bully me out of my money because i  get uncomfortable and also I feel the need to keep my money in clear sight I have to hide all my money that I earn because i know he will take it, I am deeply saddened to see how bad this drug has made him he has a big heart but know all he says is I see him as a drug addict and I look down on him, I tell him I do not look down on you I just get upset because I know you have potential to better yourself, but choose not too. I mean if you saw how drugs destroyed your parents life why try to follow? I just thought we were in it together but I guess we just grew apart through life's stress and I just feel I will be raising our daughter mostly by myself, I am just so disappointed in how my life has turned and now to know I have to break our family apart because he just causes so much confusion with me I cry from the things he does just hurt because someone that I see as my family is stealing from me, I just needed some advice on which road should I take next?
20090307222702AA3n9eX	Family & Relationships;Family	My boyfriends daughter hates him...?	Ok, for you to better understand let me give you a little background...      My boyfriend (we'll call him Joe) and baby mama #1 had a little girl when he was just 18 and BM was 15. She got scared after the baby was born and packed up and moved to Cali to live and have the support of her mom. Several years latter he and BM #2 had a little girl. BM #2 started cheating on him when the baby was just a few months old and they split. Again, several years later when he went to Cali to visit baby #1 he ran into his highschool sweetheart and married her. Together they had baby #3, #4, & #5. When baby #5 was just 6 months old baby #2 came to visit dad in Cali and his wife didn't want to deal with his daughter. So, while he was at work she called him to come get his daughter. When he went to get her his wife had all his and baby #2's thing packed and kicked them out. He moved back to texas but stayed married to his wife and begged her for her and their kids to move here with him, to no avail. So eventually they divorced. He has never missed a child support payment for any of his 5 daughters and he loves them all very much.      So, for the past year baby #1 (who is now 15) has been acting very distant from him. He tries to call her, but she refusses to take his phone calls. Anyway, he e-mailed her telling her how much he loved her and misses her and that he he hopes that she will call him sometime. She e-mailed him back and told him that she hates him and that he has ruined her life. She also said that she hates him for what he has done to her sisters, who she lives close to but never sees. She accuses him of abandoning her 3 half sisters.      Now I know that it maybe a "teenage" thing that she is going through, but what can he do? He loves all his girls very much and hates not being able to see them as much as he would like. With baby (or now teen) #1 living so far away what can he do to help their relationship? And what can I do as a partner to support and encorage him?

Our house is running out of space and my mom wants to donate most of his clothes to charity. But she doesn't want to be the one to fold the clothes and put them in a bag, since it'll make her sad. So she wants me to do it. I guess it'll be fine but I just think there's a better idea. Its hard letting his stuff go.    What do you do with the clothes of family member that has passed on?

20090307234835AAmVulX	Family & Relationships;Friends	PLEASE HELP! I desperately need advice about this guy?	Ive been talkin to this guy a bit. We hooked up a year ago and didnt talk much since cos i moved away. Now i'm back we're talkin but only over msn and text msg on phone.       I work at a club and he came in last nite but it was so busy i could hardly talk to him. I msged him today and said sorry i couldnt talk, and he said i looked really good last nite and he understands it was really busy.       Then i msged to him "im pretty sure u were the hottest guy at the club.. u should ask me out somewhere haha" and he asked wat days i have work this week. I told him but he didnt reply.      I was thinking of msging him tonight and saying "so mister, when u takin me out? haha" so it sounds kinda flirty/joking but it also gives him an opening to ask me out. We always joke and flirt with each other and act like we like each other..       I dont want to sit around waiting for him to ask. I'm a model and a lot of guys r tryin to get with me so it's not like I can't get another guy.. i just want THIS guy but i dont want to seem desperate/easy..      He came over to the bar just to say goodbye to me, and was always smiling when we were talking. Maybe I'm overthinking this..    Am i pushing too hard?    Should I sit back and let him do the chasing?     Does it sound like he likes me?

20090227115246AA7qT9Z	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I don't know what to do..relationship + uni.?	Sorry for the long question..but I'm in a reflective mood and am thinking a lot of things through at the moment.      I am 18 years old and I will be going to University in September, which I am really looking forward to. I will be moving away from home, and don't plan to come back every weekend or anything like that, maybe once a month or something. I have been with my boyfriend for 5 years in may, and I can't help thinking about what will happen when I go away.       This has been playing on my mind for a few weeks now, but I am unsure whether I can stay with him whilst I'm away studying. He's adamant that we will stay together whilst I am away, and I'm agreeing with it, but not really feeling it. He's always said that he will never split up with me, ever. I do love him, but deep down I don't think that I will be able to keep myself from having fun and, well you get the idea..      He will be devastated if we split, and I would be sad too, but I just don't know whether it will be worth staying together when I won't really come home that often, or be able to speak to him much because of my work and obviously going out partying with friends etc.      I want to be able to have fun, and so on, but I can't help thinking about this. I'm quite a flirty person, and I can easily turn on the charm to people which I enjoy doing, but I don't want to do this all behind my boyfriend's back whilst I am away, because that's just not right.       He's very close to my family, and he will be gutted if I split because he wouldn't see them anymore. He is coming on holiday with me in the summer to spain for 2 weeks with my parents, which everyone is looking forward to, so I won't be leaving him before that.      Should I just go to uni and try and get on with the relationship? Or should I go to uni and give it a few weeks then call it off? I don't want to be a b*tch to him and leave him hanging whilst I'm doing things. I'm a natural born flirt (thats my aries personality for you) and I know I will be flirty when I go away, because I'm flirty towards people now. I am really confused, and I don't know what to do. No matter what I am going to university, nothing will stop me doing that.      Any advice you can give me would be great, I really don't know what to do. My career comes first, and that is definite, I just want to be able to have fun and stuff. I don't know :( help me please!      Sorry for the long question, thanks for reading and answering :)   xx
20090308000046AADSOqE	Family & Relationships;Friends	So i feel like everything is falling apart?	This is the exact same way i felt this month last year.   and its tearing me apart.   Last yr this month, a friend died, my bf almost died, it was just falling apart.      This year, i am so sick of all this drama.   My closest friend and I are fighting, and its the breaking point.   My best guy friend, years of friendship, thrown out the window, he doesnt care about me anymore, he doesnt want to fix things, he doesnt want to apologize even tho hes the one being an a** to me, and everyone sees that.      Me and two of my best girlfriends are fighting, beause i started hanging out with this other girl, they dont. My closets group of friends are mad cause i hangout with her alot, they thing shes a bad influence on me...and now its this big fight thing...   i hang out with her cause she and i have the same personality.      My bestest friend moved away 2 years ago, is still away, i need her and miss her like crazy.      My other bestest friend, moved away last year...and now shes moving on with her life, and i feel like she is forgetting about me.      It just dont want to deal with this bullsh*t anymore.      I just want to go out.   dance.   get drunk.   it relieves stress.

She is now asking me if she should get an annulment?? i know they waited to have sex before marriage but I honestly think her husband must be gay or something and is using her to cover up... i mean i don't know everything going on in her life, but do you think this would be considered grounds for annullment?

20070403191701AAL7TSy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He sent me music.  Why?  Do the songs speak for him?	This is kind of complicated.  A guy I really like & I had some big misunderstanding (were we friends or were we more)?  I asked him not to talk to me for awhile & once I calmed down I e-mailed him & said I was sorry & would like to talk to him again if he wanted to talk to me.  He didn't answer.  So I e-mailed him again & asked him if I'd messed up so much he didn't even want to try to be friends anymore.  No answer.  So I took silence to be my answer and assumed he wanted nothing more to do with me.        Then, after about a month, he e-mailed me and a few of our other friends a link to a band's website.  There was always the possibility of him moving away when we were still talking & I'd always ask him to try & stay.  In the first few lines of the first song on the site the lines are---you just want me to stay here so I'm just going to stay here.  Part of how we got to know each other was sharing music so is it he can't talk about things but would send me music to give me a clue?
20061124204219AA6FnN2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys---if you want a girl to meet your friends is it a good sign??	A guy I like and am good friends with wants me to meet his buddies.  He brings me cd's he likes and showed me a website his buddy has and was telling me about who all the people in the pictures on the site were.         He seems to want me to know more and more about him even though we haven't gone on a date yet.  Does he want to see if they give their approval?  Or does he just like me and want me to know his buddies because I might be around awhile?

20090227111833AAHPf7k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many girls date multiple men at a time?	I know many women go on dates with several guys, but as in, they go on one date with a guy, and then another the next day and then go on a 2nd with both guys again, etc.      BUT, my question is how many women date two or three men at a time for 2 weeks or so.      I know some women sleep with a guy after a week, but many women especially if they go on one or two dates a week with a guy will have a dating process.      Other people will only date one person in particular at a time.      So again, how many women date multiple guys as in 3+ dates before choosing one?

20090307232531AAgQeKX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are your honest thoughts?	I’m sick of people telling me that you cannot have a decent, healthy relationship with someone without you loving yourself—finding happiness within.  I find that I hear that from people who have not done this themselves.  I’m hearing this from people who fear loneliness or who have a fall back position with their families, friends, religious organizations, etc. when things get rough in intimate relationships or marriages—or they find an addiction to numb their feelings.  I want to know honestly how many people have actually found this inner fulfillment BEFORE entering in a successful relationship?  I think this is totally different from eventually finding a fulfilling relationship.  I think it takes serious work and effort to accomplish inner fulfillment first.  I also think that most people go through life without ever having achieved true inner fulfillment….What are your honest thoughts?

20090307223759AASgblS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you mind if your boyfriend wore lifts?	Say he put lifts in his sneakers to make himself taller.       I put lifts in my shoes, I'm like 5'6" naturally and am around 5'9" with lifts. I wear a really big shoe so I can put in more (size 13), and there's a bump in my sneaker which is my foot, because it barely fits in. I also do walk a bit slow and awkward with these shoes, but they make me about average height.      How would you feel if your boyfriend did this? Is it a turn-off?      Here's some pics of the shoes, so you can decide better:        http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa62/...        http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa62/...

And when I 1st moved in he came over for dinner and we were making fajitas me and my bf and I asked my bf if he wanted more cheese then I asked his brother and he said I can put cheese in his tortilla anytime and he's always trying to talk with me when my bf isn't around and always offering to do things for me, asking me if he can buy me something and when my BF is around he will make fun of him or get mad for no reason like he's trying to pick fights on him when I am around and tries to point out my bf's flaws in a very mean way. This is making me uncomfortable and I KNOW this could end in disaster, I love my bf so much!

A week ago tonight I was talking to my friend on the computer and he lives 8 hours away from me (columbia south carolina) all of a sudden he logged off and whenever I text him to see what was wrong he said that the power was out and then I wasn't able to reach him anymore. several days had passed and I still hadn't heard from him and I found out that they had a bad snow/ice storm where he lives and alot of people's electricity was still out. I kept calling him and sometimes it would ring maybe once or twice then give a busy signal, sometimes it would ring and then go to his voice mail and now every time I try to call him it just goes straight to his voice mail. Does anyone know if they got the phone lines fixed yet. what could it mean if every time I call him it just goes straight to his answering machine? thanks :)

20090505205018AAVArsT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to flirt with a really cute boy?	Okay well I really like this boy and he is so cute.   We are both in eighth grade and he is in all of my classes except like gym, art and etc. He sits at my lunch table also. And we've been talking casually lately and I really like him. The thing is I think he may not like me the same and he might have a girlfriend. And in my one class, he sits right behind me, I usually talk to him most there, and his maybe-girlfriend sits right next to him. And the same girl lives right across the street from him. And he told the girl that he likes her and they might go out but I'm not sure. I've had other boyfriends but the boy's usually asked me out and when I moved to where I live now, it's not the same. So I at least want to get his number casually. Flirting tips? I was thinking, I usually walk to the store and I have to pass his house, and I was thinking of walking and if he was outside start talking to him or something. But sometimes his maybe-girlfriend is out there with him :P So it's kind of hard. Help please?

I was ok with that, but since then, this has turned into a 3 ring circus!  Now, not only are all 3 of his brothers (1 has an arrest warrant in TX, where we live) coming, but his sister and her husband (they're pregnant with TRIPLETS), as well as his grandmother, and 4 of the exchange students that go to University with his brothers.

20090227115633AAT3oHe	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Friend vs. Fiance????	I have a good friend of mine who I didn't talk to for about 7 months because of an issue we had. My friend is a guy who at one time had a thing for me. I was never interested in him and he understood. We hung out regularly and my finace never had an issue with it (he literally doens't have a jealous bone in his body). I stopped hanging out with him regularly because one night we were at the bar with a group of friends watching the game and he got drunk and kept trying to hold my hand and put his arm around me. I got him home, he tried to kiss me good night and it was just aquired. We never talked about it but I thought that maybe it wasn't a good idea to hang out with him so much because I don't want to disrespect my finace. We still talked and hung out in group settings but stopped doing the him and I things (we used to bike ride alot, walk our dogs, etc.) do to how aquired we both felt. Well recently his father passed away unexpectidly and has left lots of pressure on him. He shared a house (he owns it) with his father and essentially it was the 2 of them since childhood (his father raised him alone and he is 28 now). I want to be there and help, and I have, been there by his side since I found out but how much is too much and do you think this is offensive to my finace (my fiance says he has no problem with all of this). My friend is in a bad place and he doesn't have many friends, especially as close (geographically) as I am. Should I draw a line or should I just put the drunk bar night behind us and be there? Is this inappropriate behavior for an engaged women?

But the thing that drives me crazy is his *********      In chem class, I just can't stand him. I always get the second highest test mark in the class (not to be cocky or anything) but don't show off. He usually gets average marks, but once he gets a good mark after like 4 tests, he tells everyone his score to everyone in our class. In fact, it sometimes pisses off my other classmates when he does this.    And he like smugly tells me tells his score, implying he did better than me, when he gets around 80% for the first time in his life...when i usually get 96%      And for courseworks...omg...i always get full marks but don't tell anyone. when he somehow gets a full mark, he tells EVERYONE, to the point that we know that he's rubbing it to their face   but teh funny thing is, he only gets full marks because i send him my coursework....(i never want to send it to him again, and besides the only reason i send it to him is because he bugs until 1 o clock at night by calling and begs me for it)      and in class, he always treats me like a retard, as if i was  a stupid student, when i always beat him every single assignment.    what should i do about this guy???

He was raised by a domineering mother that treated him less like a son and more like her man (no abuse). Our sex life used to be great. He sometimes looked at porn on the net.      Now he can't seem to get enough of it. I think he is addicted...what do you think?      Re: Domination. He shows up with this bag full of stuff he has been buying over the past 3 months. Clothes pins, cat tails, cuffs, chains, etc. So I experimented with him last night. But I felt no love. It was like he wanted to punish and humiliate me.  Like begging, and get on your knees, and ask permission, etc.?  No sensuality.       He doesn't get off unless I'm saying some degrading things about myself or he is and I agree. This feels sick and I don't know what to do. I don't mind D/S sometimes but there was no love there.      Do you think he has woman hating issues?
20090307232451AA5yjMz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Randomly giving out number...how many people will call?	Well today a mate and i just drove around our city and whenever we were at a red light and a decent looking chick was along side us one of us would get out, give her a sheet of paper with ur number (if her window was down) or just stick it under her windscreen wiper.      We gave pur numbers out to about 25 girls each, how many will respomnd do you think?         A secondary question is what time do most people go on yahoo answers (im guessing the country with msot number of people is the usa, but what time for them)
20090307224547AAXyUr4	Family & Relationships;Friends	What did this guy mean when he said this?	I was out with my friends one night a few nights ago. And my one friend and I tend to flirt a lot. We met in september last year. I don't really see it going anywhere though. He flirts but never calls or anything. I figure he isn't that interested, so I never call him, then he makes a serious joke about me not trying to contact him. Anyway, that's beside the point.       The one night I was out with my friends, and he came up and pinched my waist (like he always does) and I said to my other friend (in a joking way) "He just loves touching me". And he said "Love is an understatement". I know what that means, but if someone said that to you, what would you personally think if he or she said that? I hope that made sense.       Thanks!

I'm really into my boyfriend.   we've been together for 4months and things are basically awesome   he makes me really happy, and i always have a good time with him.      Here's the thing though: i laugh at basically everything he says, because thats kinda just how i am. But he rarely laughs at anything I say.       And i pride myself in being pretty funny. This wouldnt bother me, because he's kinda a quiet guy, but when hes with the people he works with, he laughs at everything they say. And they say pretty stupid and unfunny things.      Is it anything against me? or do we just have different senses of humor?

20090307224544AATfcyT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you be 100% honest with your partner?	My husband is still friends with his ex-girlfriend (they split after she decided to marry someone else). and i have never been completely ok with it, but i have let it be. but last year i discovered that he still had photos of her. and that got me curious (or suspicious) and i spied on his email when he was away from his computer. about 99% of the emails they shared were buddy-buddy. but there were a couple of mails there where he was wistful about their time together.       i was terribly upset, and still am about these emails. But here are my doubts:   1) the emails are 2 years old, but were written while we were seriously involved. is it worth it to be raking up the past? we are in a happy marriage now, so should i just let sleeping dogs lie?   2) telling him about the emails means admitting that i went through his email - which could cause him to lose trust in me altogether.       what do you suggest? should i just let the past be, or should i demand to know what these emails meant?

20090307225853AApBw4X	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How long do I have to live in California for a child custody case to be filed.?	My daughter and I just moved to California a month ago. I have been trying to work with my husband in regards to visitation - he lives in Idaho. I have been cautious of how much time he spends with her unsupervised as he was suicidal in November, and even indicated he regrets bringing her into the world in his note. He has told mutual friends that he is going to take off with my daughter the minute he gets his hands on her. I know that I cannot get a divorce until I have been here for 6 months. What about a legal seperation and a custody order?
20090307230003AAzS8Kl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I modify child support order?	I am 29 and have a wonderful 8 year-old child.  I was 19 when I got pregnant and the 'father' was 27.  After I learned I was pregnant, he and I married.  Shortly after my child was born, he started having an affair with another woman.  Long story short I moved out when my child was two months old, filed for divorce and a few months after the divorce was finalized, he and his mistress got married.  So there I was, 19 years old, living with my parents again, with a new born child.  He saw my child about five times in the first year and since then, has not seen or had any contact/interest in the child whatsoever.  The only thing he has had interest in is the amount of child support he’s obligated to pay.  Because I spent years watching him haggle with his ex-girlfriend about child support (he had a child before mine, another unplanned pregnancy), I was afraid he’d put me through the same thing, and therefore was very lenient (naive) and requested that the State’s calculation of child support be lowered.  He paid 325 per month for two months (he had a 70,000 salary) but after the two months, stopped paying.  It was then that I had to have the government garnish his wages.  In the old custody order, it stated that I had to ask him permission to move the child out of the area.  When I asked him, he said he would only allow it if —again— I lowered the child support amount.  Because I needed to move, I had to agree, and from that moment on he has (garnished wages) unwillingly paid $150 per month (2003).  After almost nine years of struggle as a single mother, I feel that he should pay more.  As any parent knows, the cost of a child is great, and while I have taken the full responsibility of raising and caring for my child, he has walked away unscathed as if the child never existed.  Now that I face attorneys and all that comes with modifying the support order, I find myself scared and unsettled.  I feel as if I’m opening an old wound and wonder if it might be best to let it be.  My mind says (at the very least!) he should pay more.  However, my intuition seems to be nagging me.  What am I scared of?  I am confused and any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.
20090307230115AAOH2BL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Stripping father rights?	My ex went to court over a year ago to fight for joint custody of his 3 year old daughter. He was awarded weekend visits, sat 2pm to monday 6 pm. How ever shortly after he got custody he got a second job the second job made him work saturday overnights so he would sleep all day, leaving his mother to pick up his daughter then keeping her until sunday 5 pm because he got off at 7 am. and he wanted to get a little sleep. Well when she was at the house he would either make her sleep or she would spend the whole time with me. anyway when i was 2 months pregnant he cheated on me, he had the other girl come to the house while i was at work. While his daughter was there. the other girl got pregnant and had her baby 2 months after me. I didnt leave him i tried to make it work because he told me he wanted me to stay, he didnt want the other girl. so i stayed. Well that drama never ended she was so annoying and wanted him to be with her and evern threatened him that she would get an abortion or give the baby up for adoption. So the more he told her he would rather have the baby if she didnt want it the more she twisted him around her finger. He assured me he would never leave me because i was the only person in the world to put up with his crap, so i stood by him while they fought and he asked me repeatedly if i would stay with him if he took the baby away from her i said yes. Well he was working 2 jobs coming home to me and sleeping so i took care of his daughter, payed the bills bought the food, made sure the house was in order, and reminded him of the important dates and events he had to be involved with with his daughter. he was mean to her, he didnt want her to talk, if she did he ignored her and i would get mad at him for doing that. if she cried he yelled at her some times cussing at her. And when he did actually go out with her it was to his job to show he was a "good" father. After i had my son he pushed us all away, he because mean even to his daughter i asked him why he was acting this way he said he was keeping eveyone away to protect him self and he threw him self in to work. a few days after the other girl had her baby he pushed everyone out of his life, he told me he didnt like coming home to us and he felt guilty for everything so i left. I warned him that if i eft he wouldnt not see his son because i would not ask him for help with anything. he said that was fine. Now he is threating me to take me to court to get visitation, I have stable living arrangements, i have a car, i provide everything for my son food clothes dipers im working full time and my mom watches him while im at work. I never leave him with anyone for any reason (except once when i was take to the emergency room 2 weeks after he was born and that was one night.) people see me with him all the time. The only reason im not gonna get him for child support is because hes currently paying child suport for 3 other kids... so yes thats 5 kids for 5 diff women. He skips jobs every 3 months so that his wages dont get garneshed. Right now the only way his bills are getting paid is because he moved another girl in to the house 2 days after i left. his bills are more than 2000 a month he only gets paid 800 a month with both jobs combined. how ever his first job, has never notified child support he is working ther mainly because the rgm is his best friend. He also receives tribal checks every 3 months he dose not claim as income.

I fell in love with a man I work with last year.  We've both been kind of shy around each other, but he's implied he wants to marry me several times. ...      We both teach Korean students at an English school.  He's been dropping more hints, and so I thought I'd come to the school on the weekend to see if he's been up to anything...       On the computer desktop, the picture has been changed.  There's a pink heart, and inside it, written in Korean, I think it says:      Love, marry me!      ... but I'm not sure because I've been using those online translators to try to figure out what it says.      Can anyone type "love marry me" in Korean?        Or can I send a copy of the picture to someone to translate?  I don't think I can post it on here -- and I don't have the ability to write in Korean on my keyboard.      Thank you!!!

(major hint: yes, i will marry you. ask me now so we can start planning for a year from now). anyway, it got to a point where he mentions it less now, and although we still talk about it seriously he jokes saying things like, "i was going to ask you but nahhh" and so forth. it's really hurtful and i've told him this but he says i like to get mad for no reason. he's only joking.  so, he's still undecided while i have made it perfectly clear that i am decided, without screaming "marry me already."  everyone i know our age  that has been together for as long as we have or shorter has already taken their relationship to that level.  i love him very much and i have no doubt in my mind that he loves me, but how long do i wait?  how do i know he's had enough time? i don't want to wait around long enough for him to decide 'no'? i'd rather try to move on before then.

We work together, but we don't always see each other. Recently, we were both working nearby one another.  Ok, as soon as he saw me, I felt that he started acting really weird, but in a funny way.  Well, he started singing loudly, all different kinda songs.  But not the same music that was actually playing.  He told me to sing with him.     Than he kepted calling out my name.  It seemed like he was trying to get my attention constantly.  Anything to make me look at him.  He would just say silly things that didn't make any sense.  And he kepted looking at me constantly.  Even when I was facing down, I felt he kepted looking over my way.  He later told me that I should come over to help him because he had so much work to do.  I've never really seen him act this way.  Not sure if his behavior had anything to do with, me not talking to him recently.  I was upset with him.  Or maybe it could be something else?   Does anyone have any ideas why he was acting like this?  Thank You!

I have been in a serious relationship with someone for almost 6 months now and his best friend is a girl and she just happens to be his ex girlfriend.  I have been having funny feelings lately about their relationship.  He and I are together alot, she calls and/or texts him all the time and to be honest I'm tired of her interrupting.  Is it time to make him choose?  And am I the only one on the planet who thinks this relationship is VERY strange?  I don't think he's cheating on me, that's not my point.  Shouldn't I be his best friend?  He said that she is the only person he can "talk to about things".  Why does he feel like he can't talk to me?  He has never given me any reason to think he's cheating so am I just jealous or paranoid?  Any mature advice is appreciated.

So, then later they decided to go to a bball game together later. i was not asked to be included in this. then, later i txted my friend and asked her if she thought i was mad at her, and she got smart. I assumed the other were with her. then we just had it out (not badly), but i told her she was nvr there for me, and that they all acted as if they hated me. well, today she started talking about me at school and all this crap. i AM TIRED OF IT! all i tried to do was tell her what was wrong with me, and she acted like a bi***! is this my fault? was i being whinny? idk. i told her the smart attitude wouldn't cut it.

20090227115732AAztM1x	Family & Relationships;Friends	Falling Apart By The Seams Because Of Cutting?	It's becoming practically an epidemic! So far five, yes five, of my friends (Two of them my best friends, four girls and one guy) Are cutting or have started cutting very recently. It is taking a toll on my entire group, about three of us started openly crying at lunch because of it. Those of us who haven't cut yet are trying to help the other's by being supportive and lending them a shoulder to cry on...but they haven't stopped (Except for one) I asked my Mom and she told me to have them get proffesional help and "talk to an adult" but I don't think that's a good idea because we tried a Cutters Hotline and that did nothing to help and because of their family situations they don't trust adults. I don't know what to do and it's hard watching my friends hurt themselves. Help, please?
20090227120040AAYE0qX	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Has anyone ordered their wedding flowers online from theflowerexchange.com?	We went to the florist and were shocked by the quote. We have a "healthy budget" for our flowers, so that's not the concern. It's just that we thought we would get a lot more for our money.       I did some Researchat local wholesalers and then online, and theflowerexchange.com has terrific prices. I was thinking about ordering a box in advance to check out the quality, but since they don't send samples it'll be $98.00 for a box of 100 roses.       Also, I read their testimonials and of course they're all positive. I'm not worried about ordering in bulk or online, just wondering about this particular vendor.

20070104155403AAp9nwa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do??	Well, I hadn't talked to the guy I like since before Christmas break.   And today during lunch I had to go to one of my teacher's rooms to get something...and he was there with a group of people.   He leaned foward and said "How's it goin'?" And I said the most stupid reply...."Hey" and I smiled..I don't like being asked What's up or how's it going', I never know what to say..   I know that sounded stupid, but whenever I see him unexpectedly, I get really nervous. Heck, even when I know I'm going to see him I get nervous.   But my question is, will he think anything of me for saying that instead of a better response?

He has commitment issues-his past....foster homes and his mom died at 14 and he still hasn't resovled that with himself. I totally love this guy but it hurts when he pushes me away. I've known him 7years and gone out 2-3. I'm 20 and he's almost 22. He is in a stuck position now also-lost his liecense,living with his friend,and juss lost his job. He also got over his addiction with meth-clean almost a year. Yeah bad list but honestly he does keep going and trying. I juss feel left out a lot-I am always there for him to talk to and chill with-don't get me wrong I hang out with a lot of guys-juss I don't wanna always bring him up and annoy them ya know? Broken record type deal. So any suggestions on how to get him to confide in me and maybe spend some time together-I feel so distant and yet we are very close when together-that every so often though :(

20070530172255AAVgUnF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I caught my boyfriend chatting inappropriately...Is this cheating?	I happened to come across my boyfriend of 7 months posting inappropriately on a bulletin board he did not know I was also a member of.  I was offended b/c he was disrespectfully calling me his "ol lady", making up situations that didn't happen that made me look bad, and bluntly flirting & dirty talking with a girl he met on the board & had once gone & had a one night fling with years back.  My main concern is trust and honesty.  I confronted him about it and he swears that everyone on there knows its BS, it was just joking around and nothing to take serious.  He also said he wouldn't post like that anymore.  I want to believe him but now I feel leary and distrustful of his online "friendships."  That maybe he will just try to hide it better.  I try not to be a jealous g/f but this sure got under my skin!  Any advise???

I email men that seem very well matched to my rather stringent criteria and usually get no response.  I'm attractive, well educated, slim and successful.  Is this experience common?  People tell me its a numbers game.  But I'm curious, how many emails does the average Minnesota man over 50 get  and if they are not interested in the likes of me, what are they interested in?  And are they experiencing success out there?

20090307160243AAz11DT	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am getting annoyed with my friend (amy) .....?	ok here is my story, ill try and keep it short...   me and my mate amy have been friends for 2 years, nearly 3. and her ex asked me out i asked amy if it would be ok with her, seen as they had been together with him for around 6 months. she said yes its fine and good luck, she said that in a sarcastic way. so i said yes to him. we've been going out for around 3 weeks and we get along perfectly, we haven't kissed or anything yet, just hugged but i'm okay with that... anyway... and amy has been calling him names like "goofy" and all this bad stuff and i feel really really awkward about it so i told her "look, can you keep all this to yourself because you know he's my boyfriend and all" and she said "ok i wont mention his name again unless it's really important" so i was like ok fine fair enough but she keeps going on about how horrible he was, but he's not at all horrible, he's awesome! i haven't really proper talked for ages because he had a fight, a proper one (in the field, mud, pushing eahother over, pulling hair ect...) and all because she called me "double glasing" because i have glasses. so i got really annoyed and havent spoken properly for a couple of days. and i hear she's got another nickname for me now but really cant be @rsed to find out what it is. although i'm really annoyed at amy for all this i still kinda want to be friends. she's never really been that nice to be honest! she keeps backstabing me ever since she joined this group about a year ago, and they didnt like me and she has "become one of them" what shall i do / say? shall i still be friends with her?      sorry the keep it short thing, as you can see didnt work out sorry       please give me some answers      nia xx

20081005172127AAJTwNY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it inappropriate to tell my BF that I will not have sex with him?	unless he loses weight?   For centuries men have stated they do not want a fat GF.  Well what about us women?  Aren't we allowed to state our preferences?   My BF needs to lose like 50 lbs.   We had sex today and it was rather gross for me.   I think I want to tell him No more sex till you lose the weight.   He wants sex like EVERY day btw.   I know I will get slammed for this.  I am not trying to be rude, seriously.    
20081004141852AAgVC8G	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I dont know how to kiss my boyfriend! HELP!?	I took my boyfriend home from a football game last night and he was going to kiss me. He tried to kiss me once and I turned my head and he ended up kissing my neck. Then he got out of my car and came around to the drivers side where I was and he kept asking me if I would let him kiss me. Then he kept saying you're nervous aren't you? (it was my first kiss) But he ended up kissing me anyways. 3 times, on the mouth; but they were just little pecks. But i just sat there like an idiot and I didn't kiss him back. Partly because I didn't know how. We have been going out for a little over a month and I really like him (we have a little bit of history though).  How do I kiss him back? I really want to, plus I think I should return the favor. HOW DO I KISS HIM?! HELP!!!?

20081013120544AA4DPPH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you suggest about my heartbroken situation?	I'm 26 & this guys is 24. We only dated for two months but the connection & chemistry was deep and we broke up in a nice way but still we both got hurt. He really loves me for myself & never pushed me to have sex (I can see his honest feeling for me). We had to finish up the relationship just because of his situation in life..He's a Medical Student(first year) and not used to the new position in his life as he said. He doesn't want to waste my time & hurt me before it's too late(Very reasonable). He also wanted to make sure that I'm not angry at him since cares a lot. He told me that he never had this much fun with any other girl before. It's really strange but in a short period of time I had true feeling for him. We're good frineds now and he's there for me as he said.What does this mean to you? How do you see this?   Do you think there will be another chance for him & I someday?

20090307132906AAyOqmQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I went to see my husband in jail today! We have been off and on. Please Please tell me what you think?	So, My husand is in jail. We got into an argument the other night on the phone. He called and said he was done, did not want to be with me anymore and wanted a divorce. So I cried...and cried and cried....Then I disconnected the phone and threw my wedding rings away and called attorney's...Days passed. He had someone call me and ask me to connect the phone so that he could talk. Now like a dummy I did. So he called me Monday, we talked and of course he was rude and hateful to me. So I just hung up. He hurt my feelings bad. So for the next day or so he called and called. I would not answer because I didn't want to hear how bad of a person I was and how always something was wrong with me. So I have not heard from him since then. So I got up this morning and went to see him. When he walked into the room he asked what I was doing there. That because I did not answer the phone he was done. He didn't want to be with me anymore. He asked if I had anything to say. I said no. He said ok, and we got up and I left. He broke my heart again. Why did he even come into visiation if he was going to do me like that. Why didn't he just not come into the room? Why did he still have his wedding ring one? What is his deal? Do you think he will call again? And if/when he does how do I build up the courage and strength to be Done?? Enough is enough!!!!!! Please help me. I am confused and do not understand his actions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20090307163624AAqYFgZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	I Dont Know What to do (girls... help!!)?	Im an 18 year old guy and I have this friend whos a girl that I met on facebook, and we’ve been talking online for months. She gave mer her cell number, and wants to hang out JUST AS FRIENDS, but when I ask her to hang out, she keeps coming up with stuff to avoid hanging out. for instance last friday we were gonna hang out but her girlfriend (shes gay) left her for someone else and she wanted to be alone. and then 4 days later her mom lost her job. thats a lot to take in 4 days. She then blocked me on facebook, so i cant contact her. After finding out she blocked me, i texted her and called her and she ignored them all. my theory is that she just has too much going on, like too much drama and doesnt need me talking to her, asking her to hang out, cuz she said she feels bad when she blows me off like last week with her girlfriend leaving her. I then told her if she doesnt want to hang out with me, then she could just tell me. i've told her this numerous times and she keeps saying that she didnt say that, meaning she would want to hang out. plus she suggested we hang out and promised she'll make up for the time she blew me off last week. i just think she needs space for a little while. so, do you think if i dont call her or text her for like 4 days, and then on the 4th day just text her, do you think she'll reply??? do you think she'll ever talk to me again?? any other ideas?? GIRLS ONLY PLEASE!!! THANK YOU =)=)=)

20090307155557AAwqbEC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I get over what he has done to me?	My husband cheated on me last year and although it has been a few months since then, I can't stop thinking about it and obsessing about the time he spent with this other woman. I decided to stay with him (not looking to be judged please) because I believe him when he says it was a huge mistake. He has demonstrated true remorse and actually our marriage is stronger than ever now. I still don't trust him 100% but am working on it, as is he in a big way. He has let his life be an open book for me so there are no more secrets.   The bigger problem I have is the "getting over" what he did to me. How am I supposed to forget about this woman who is haunting my mind on a daily basis? I picture them in bed, I think about all the times he lied to me....it is ruining my life.   What can I do to move past it?

20080929193424AA1nBaG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married women- answer this! When you abandon your man?	Pre divorce or just leaving-Why do women feel it is their right to steal all the jointly owned contents of the home, empty out the bank accounts, steal the auto and even the mans personal items.  The law states 50/50 equal division.  This does NOT translate into the man getting all the mortgage, taxes, bills and a bag of leftover tupperware, while the women cash in selling all the belongings.  I need some truthful answers why women feel this is acceptable behavior.  Note:  My wife turned into the village whore and pulled this stunt on me while I was at work.  Still refuses to answer why?

20081013073451AA3xha3	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I cut off communication with my Dad?	Trying to make a 20 year story into a paragraph - My Dad has been addicted to pain pills for over a decade.  A very bad addicition that has caused him to lie, steal, and cheat.  He destroyed his marraige to my mother and our whole family because of these pills and one God awful woman he chose to cheat on my mother with.  He had back surgery, got addicted to the pain pills he was prescribed, and met this woman because she was a nursing aide.  He then went on to have an affair with her, and she continued to help get his expired prescriptions filled one way or another.  After much heartache and pain, inlcuding being extrememly broke and almost losing our house, my mother divorced him.  She was the only one working, supporting my brother and I, and she was so heartbroken she lost a drastic amount of weight very quickly.  He decided to stay with this woman, and went through phases of being on and off pills.          My Dad now has VERY POOR health, and was forced to live with his mother (my grandma) as he had no money and no home.  He got surgery done to replace his hip, and was off the pills for about 3 or 4 months.  During his 'sober' time, he was done with the woman he had been with for so long.  This was all temporary, as he is with that woman everyday now, and yells and curses at my Grandmother (as he has for months).  There is so much more to the story; he has taken money form me and my Grandmother, and this woman has cursed my Grandmother in her own front yard.  He makes my Grandmother feel like everything is her fault, and that she shouldnt hate this woman he is with, and that the reason I dont want to talk to him is because of things my Grandmother tells me (which is so obviously not true).      All this said - I have ignored his phone calls for over a week.  My Dad has always loved me (I was always Daddy's Little Girl), and always SAID he would do anything for me.  I have no doubt that he loves me, but he is not the same person anymore.  I have no desire to have a relationship with him.  And now that I am 23, I am really grasping the unbearable hurt he caused my mother, and I just can't forgive it.        I just wanted some outside opinions on my choice to not speak to him anymore.  Look at it from the outside and then imagine if it were your family...

I have been with my Girlfriend for 6 months now and everything is good, we have had are fair share of bad times but recently I feel like I am always giving, giving, giving and not getting much in return. We are both in college and I am always doing nice things for her, filling her car tank up, buying dinner, all good boyfriend qualities but for some reason I feel like she doesn't appreciate it. She says thanks but things she knows bothers me she could care less about. I understand she doesn't want to be with me all the time that would be too much but she likes to party a lot and just forgets about me a lot. She will come home late and not say anything and just recently I only saw her for about 30 minutes today and she left to go back home. I know I don't own her and I don't care that she goes out but I feel like she just doesn't give a **** like I do. Any advice on this would be great it really sucks. Thanks.

20090307163827AABtb4V	Family & Relationships;Friends	I love my grandma, what should I do?	My grandma raised her own five children then some of us grand children.  One of her kids died, the other is a drunk, another who  only cares for herself, ones a pill head, and the other is my mom who is bipolar skitzaphrenic and lives in Florida somewhere.   My grandmother  has me, my cousin, and his wife that care about her and love her.  The drunk and the selfish one dont want to help her when she needs it most.  She is 69, and goes to the hospital all the time due to pain in her legs.  SO they wanna automatically say she goes for drugs.  She raised me and I have taken care of her.  She is prescribed one low dose pain killer and she does not abuse her meds.  I live in Mo and she lives in TX.  I have been trying to get her down here, but they end up taken her money.  She gets ssi, and she pays everyone elses way.  So, I send her money and they take it to.  We talk on the phone every day.  I have a place here for her, and I promised her I would take care of her until she passes.  I went and got cna certified to learn to care for her.  I learned post mortum and how to care for dying people so that I could keep my promise.  I decided yesterday I would go down there and pick her up.  I find out today she is in the hospital because the drunk called her and was so mean to her, she flipped out and started throwing stuff and screaming and couldnt stop.  I think she had a mental breakdown.  She called me this morning and told me she loved me and couldnt wait to get here.  Well, I call the hospital there and the stupid nurse tells me I have to get info from the family ( who now wants to put her in a mental instituiton, and they wont talk to me because they know I will stop them from doing that)  they told the hospital I wasnt a member of the family, which is bull crap.  I dont know what to do.  What would you do?  I love her and want to take care of her....I cant let her go to a nut house.
