20090223130950AAmweKx	Pets;Rodents	Can I feed my rats lunch meat?	Hi, I have read that rats are omnivores and that they can indeed eat meat. I have some lunch meat, turkey meat to be exact, that I want to feed my rats. Is it safe?      My rats current diet is Pellets, millet, rolled oats, bananas, celery, apples, lettuce, broccoli, and on occasion (about every 4-5 days) they will get a small portion of yogurt. All of this food isn't fed to them every day, and I don't feed them anything but pellets every other day or so.      Thanks for your help. A food list would also help a lot :-)

20090223135618AAg4WSu	Pets;Dogs	Why don't people want to invest in training their dogs?	I see so many posts with "my 150 lb mastiff/shepher/pitbull ect jumps and snarls at people and other dogs. How do I make him stop without making him mad at me.  I don't want to pay for a trainer.     or.   My super expensive (name the breed) runs out the door & into the street and doesn't come when I call.  How do I make him come back.      Don't these people understand that obedience training is the best investment you can make?  There are many classes that you can take for under a $100.00 but they would rather chance a lawsuit than pay for one.  Or pay the huge vet bills when the dog is injured.  I am not talking about people who already know how to train their dogs.  I am talking about the ones that have no control so it is evident that they don't have a clue.

20090223141942AA9cJyP	Pets;Dogs	Renting a House-what should we do about getting a dog?	We're currently renting a house, and have just signed a further 1 year lease on the property. We get on well with the agent and they have basically said we can do what we like with the house, the garden etc. When we moved in we had a cat, and she is written into the lease. However, recently for a whole number of reasons we'd really like to have a dog. I am only away from the house for about 10 hours a week so the dog would hardly ever be alone and hence I could monitor it's behaviour for the most part. We've rented houses before with our old dog (he died at 15 a few years ago now) and had no trouble but I guess I want to know what people would recommend that we do. It's more confusing because when I asked the real estate agent about the cat, she basically made out like she would prefer I just did what I liked without making her ask the landlord anything (the house is in a weird situation bc the couple who owned it died of old age and they're not entirely clear about who the landlord is). Should we just get a dog and not mention it to anyone? I get the feeling that is what the real estate agent would prefer, but I don't want to get into any trouble. My mum says that she never told the places we rented when I was younger about our dog, so I'm just really confused. Any advice or previous experiences would be most appreciated.

We have observed that my quaker parrot is picking at the feathers around its feet, and we were informed today that she is beginning to pluck her feathers. I know that it is from stress, and I really want to help her before she engrosses herself even more in this behavior. As of now it shes not missing a lot of feathers, but I know it will incline if we do not do anything. Has anyone had this problem before, and corrected it. I have given her tons of new toys and they keep her occupied and I have been staying in the room, and talking to her quietly to distract her from plucking. It has been working, but I can not stay with her 24/7 but she does get a really good amount of attention from about 4 other family members. Please tell me about your experiences I have read just about everything on the web. Any information about how to stop this behavior would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance.

20090223143820AAUS93j	Pets;Birds	My rooster had white ring shaped spots on liver? What causes that?	Today I slaughtered one of my roosters. When I made it ready for soup, I noticed that it had several white ring shaped spots on its liver. The bird was a year old. I slaughtered it, because the bird refused to join the rest of the flock in the hen house, after I had allowed them free ranging through the garden during the warm spell last week. The bird seemed a bit weakened, - most likely from spending a couple of nights outside, and being beaten up by the other roosters, when I put him back into the chicken coop - but otherwise healthy. What could have caused the white spots on its liver?

Today Blue had a bit of diherria for some reason...and there was blood in it. I don't think there has ever been blood in his poops before. I don't know what to do!

Chino is my first male kitty, and I don't know how to tell if they're... getting involved.. ha. They're major cuddle bugs (esp with each other), but recently they've been wrestling a bit, and Lacey will hiss and growl. I'll look, and Chino (who is part maine coon, and already 8 or 9 lbs) is sitting on her back. I don't see him going after my other girl cat (who is fixed), which makes me wonder.. What do you think is going on? Does anyone have any advice about how to deal with this? The vet has been verrryy adamant about not wanting to spay either yet... Not sure how to handle this one!

20090223143435AAvA2kB	Pets;Cats	Getting my two cats to get along..?	I've had my female, Oreo, for almost fifteen years now. She's my baby, to put it simply. Sleeps in my bed, always in my lap, follows me around, etc.  Though she is an indoor cat (declawed), she got along great with my stepdad's large outdoor male. It took a little while because she's shy, but they eventually began wrestling and playing constantly.   My parents are getting divorced, and my stepfather has taken his cat back.  Because Oreo was pining so much, crying all the time, and was a bit depressed, we adopted a new cat.  He's a large orange male, also declawed.  When I first brought him home, I locked Oreo in a separate room to allow him to feel at ease in the house and wander.  He heard her mewing, and walked up to the door, sniffed it, and eventually left it alone.  After a few minutes, I let Oreo out. Though Jackson didn't move from his relaxed position laying on the ground, he did immidiately start hissing and....growling, in a way.  He kept on making a very low-pitched grumble.  Oreo just stares, and seems to be the one trying to bond, though she is scared of him. She leaves him alone, and he has never made an aggressive move towards her, but still...   I'm curious as to whether there is anything I can do to have Jackson accept Oreo more quickly.  Should I reprimand his aggressive noises? Or should I just leave them be to sort it out?

There is a horse at my barn that i have been spending time with because he doesnt have an owner technically and has a navicular and no one really gives him love, anyways ive noticed he seems to trust me alot better than other people most likely bc i am always grooming, giving treats, hay grain etc from him.. when i have him around some of my friends sometimes or even when i first started grooming him and stuff he was headshy like sudden "scary" movements would freak him out, now he lets me touch his face etc, when before he would hold his head high, my friends scare him because we will all sometimes gather together and just give TLC to our favorite horses and when they accidentally reach up to get something etc it will scare the living daylights out of him.. i know thats proibably because of lack of trust etc, im thinking his previous owners abused him? Maybe because he's new in his field and the horses are kicking at his face or something? Also hes new becasue his owners gave him to my lesson barn for free, we found out later he had a navicular.. is there anything i can do to get him over his headshyness? One of my friends suggested scaring him over and over so he got used to it but i dont really want to do that i feel like i might loose his trust.. Any ways i could get him more confident?

I've seen some amazing links in regards to doggy backyard breeders and reputable breeders show up on this site and I invite everyone here to share.

I’ve seen people use the term “hobby breeder” but I’ve seen that to represent both sides which causes some confusion in my personal opinion.

20090223152703AAm2oFv	Pets;Cats	How can I get my cat in a relaxed enough state to trim his nails and apply "Soft Paws" without a fight?	I have a wonderful male cat, approximately 5 years old.  However, I have recently had to find him a new home because of my fiance's allergies.  Luckily, my niece and her father have agreed to take him, thereby keeping him in the family and allowing me to still see him from time to time.  However, they will only take him if he does not have the potential to destroy their new furniture.  Since I feel declawing a cat is extremely cruel and risky, I have found an alternative product called "Soft Paws", which are harmless plastic caps that are glued over the cats existing claws in order to protect furniture.  The problem is he absolutely will not stay still long enough for me to put them on.  I need to find a way to relax him enough to apply these claw caps once every 4 weeks, along with trimming his nails.  Is there some type of sedative or tranquilizer I can purchase that will chill him out long enough to do this periodically??

20090223160150AA9WDui	Pets;Cats	Why won't my cats drink fresh water?	I have 2 cats, who have been mostly indoor cats, but are now more indoor cats since it is winter, and we let them come upstairs to 'be with the family.' We have this little indoor pond with fake rocks that we had fish in, and the cats would always drink from it. Since then, it has gotten very dirty and the fish have died, and I fear something could happen if they continue drinking it, especially since it has some weird foam. Either way, how can I make them drink clean water? I brought the more 'social' cat a bowl of clean water, he tried it, and went back to the pond. How can I change this?       **also, we are moving, so the pond won't be an option for them, so I need to 'prep' them for this.**

20090223155705AAr2gc4	Pets;Fish	Ammonia problem with new axolotl setup?	First of all, if you are going to tell me I screwed up - don't! I already know I screwed up - I don't need the re-iterating just some help please.      It was my daughter's birthday last week and she has wanted an axolotl for 2 years or so. I finally decided to get her one. This is where my mistake began - I went to a petshop! I know nothing about fish or axolotls and made this very clear to the girl who served me. She sold me a filter (which I later discovered to be too small), a heater (which I later discovered I don't need), some plants, dechlorinator and an axolotl. She advised me to go home and set the tank up first and pick up the axolotl the following day. She didnt mention anything about cycling the tank and as I said - I know nothing about aquariums!      Everything was fine for the first 2 days but I noticed the axolotl was more lethargic than normal and wasnt eating. A few hours later i nudged him and he didnt move - i thought he was dead, so i went to a proper aquarium this time in search of a replacement. The guy there has been very helpful and refused to sell me another until we discovered why the first one was so sick. He then explained to me about the whole cycle process and I shouldn't have got my axolotl for a few weeks until the bacteria built up in the filter. He suggested I go home and bring in a sample of water. So I did this (and discovered the axolotl was not dead). Just as he expected, the ammonia level was really high - measuring about a 2.0. I also took in the box of the filter I had installed and found out it was way too small for the tank (3ft x 1ft x 1.5ft), so he sold me a bigger filter and explained that we would be starting the whole cycling of the tank once more. He also sold me some 'Prime' and 'cycle'.      I did a 50% water change and after 3 days, took another sample back in - the ammonia is still high and now the nitrates and nitrites are climbing. He explained that with daily 25% water changes, these levels should eventually start dropping.      This poor little axolotl is still living but I really want to make things more comfortable for him. Would it be a bad thing to do 25% water changes twice a day? If so, can I do 40 - 50% water changes twice daily? I know I'm not to touch the new filter.      How long will the axolotl be able to withstand these horrid conditions? I have spent $200 trying to help this little guy and would hate to see him die. He hasnt eaten in 9 days. His tail was badly curved but has straightened out a little bit. I heard curved tails indicate stress.      Please help.

20090223155959AAykKpW	Pets;Dogs	Teaching my puppy good manners?	I have a 10 week old black labrador male puppy, and like most puppies he jumps on you when you walk into the door. and tries to get food from you when you're trying to eat (I've never fed him human food before and don't plan to). Also, like all labradors he LOVES food, so before i can even put his bowl down he attacks it. I would like to train him to sit, and allow people to greet him, instead of jumping on them, to leave you alone when you have food, and when it's time for him to eat for him to wait until you tell him that he can eat his food. Any tips? Thanks in advance!
20090223160109AAzeLMn	Pets;Reptiles	Painted Turtle Question?	Okay, well I "rescued" two painted turtles from my cousins house. They weren't being treated the greatest, and well I rescued them. =) So, right now they are in a pretty nice aquarium habitat. But in the summer, would I be able to just let them swim in an area in the creek they were found in? I will watch them, and make sure they do not get loose. I will always keep them because I know I cannot release them back into the wild. I was wondering if I could just let them swim in a natural creek for a little bit over the summer. I know that they are small, but I am looking toward the future. So, when they are bigger will  I be able to keep them outside? Like make a fake pond thing you know with the kit, and put a little fence around it, so they have more of a natural home. Would I be able to keep them out there year-round since I live in very cold Ohio winters? What size will they be able to live outside? Thanks~

El me recibe supertranquilo, se estira o me mira y no va hacia mi, o se acerca muy tranquilo y se tumba para que le acaricie, pero nunca demuestra alegria. A mi me da mucha rabia que no me reciba contento. Por la ma?ana cuando abro la cocina donde duerme nunca me recibe alegre, siempre muy tranquilo, si se acerca es para que le acarie y si no le acario se va a otro lugar, se tumba y se queda tan feliz. Mi ilusión era tener un perro que al verme se pudiera contento, pues tengo ese recuerdo de peque?a que el perro que teniamos se volvia loco de alegria cuando llegaba a casa y eso que no hice nada por el, ni le daba de comer, ni le sacaba de paseo, ni jugaba con el, ni me preocupaba nada. He probado a acariciarle menos o no hacerlo cuando me levanto por la ma?ana, pero no veo en el ningun cambio, continua igual, siempre RELAJADO. No expresa emoción si le digo "calle", y eso que en la calle se lo pasa genial, jugando con los perros o conmigo. Es alegre pero no al recibirme

20070519214317AAs1oIZ	Pets;Dogs	?no se si sacrificar a mi perro?	Hola, tengo un perro de 13 a?os, lo tengo desde los 7 a?os, es muy callejero, nunca pude encerrarlo porque lloraba mucho y apesar de que esta viejo, siempre sigue haciendo lo mismo, pelearse con perros y perseguir a las perras alsadas, simepre a estado lastimado y yo siempre lo he cuidado y sanado, el perro parece indestructible, pero hace unos dias, un auto lo choco, es el tercer auto que lo golpea, pero esta ves, es la peor de todas las heridas, se fracturo la cadera y los huesos de las patas, el veterianrio me dijo que esta bien, debe estar en reposos unos meses y hay que ver que pasa, posiblemente vuelva a caminar, el punto es que cuando lo veo, me doy cuenta que esta sufriendo, moverlo de lugar es dificil, llora, y siempre intente volver a la calle, pero no puede, me da mucha lastima, pero no se que seria lo correcto. si se cura va a ser complicado, no se si se recupera de las fracturas de cadera. bueno, gracias,

Hola que tal,      Tengo un problema con una perra que tengo de 13 a?os, es de raza french poodle      En todo el día no ha comido absolutamente nada, lo poco que le pudimos dar al poco rato lo devuelve, al defecar no puede ya que se tapa y sangra, ha vomitado en casi todo el día, se encuentra acostada en su rinconcito y no se mueve para nada en todo el día no ha salido y se encuentra en todo su cuerpo fría.   Un día antes de lo que le esta pasando por la noche todo su sistema digestivo se oía muy activo por toda la noche esta así. Realmente ignoramos que haya comido antes.      Espero una respuesta pronta y eficaz, y así como también una posible solución, por ya se que la tengo que llevar al veterinario pero quiero conocer diferente opiniones.      De antemano muchas gracias de lo que me pudieras ayudar.                                                                                      CZV

20070802125455AAow7Oh	Pets;Other - Pets	!apoyanos con tu mascota y todo...?	los que sientan participar de una campa?a a nivel continental para acabar con las jaulas de los zoológicos públicos. La idea es sugerirles a sus respectivas directivas que vayan reemplazando los hábitat de los animales de una manera que primero se considere el bienestar de cada especie, luego la imagen que se le de a los visitantes. Nadie busca pagar una entrada para ir a ver sufrir los animales. Hay localidades inapropiadas para emplazar un zoo por sus altas o bajas temperaturas, su falta de agua y vegetación, ect. Con la ayuda que nos den los integrantes de la red cibernética estaremos informando una dirección que nos sugieran para centralizar los informes e investigar los lugares y tratos inadecuados que sufren los animales. No escatimaremos acudir a Organizaciones Mundiales, públicas y privadas, como las mismas Compa?ías televisivas de Animal Planet y de Australia. Disney y Green Peace entre otras, parques nacionales y de safaris, como los africanos buscando asesoramiento y apoyo.
