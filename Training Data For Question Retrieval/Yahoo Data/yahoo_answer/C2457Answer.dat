eEgyo9rFaa	It's probably a breath support problem.  Make sure to blow faster air, not forced.  Or it could be a problem with the side key on the left side that you push down on high A-D.  Take it in.  I don't think they'll charge you for a quick checkover.

w13Zbnk7aa	you probably have a c foot if you don't know. Look at the foot joint. How many roller keys do you have? If there is one, you have a c foot, if there is two (sometimes with a gizmo key), you have a b foot.  If there are 3 circle keys controled by the roller keys...you have a b foot...if theres two, you have a c foot.     A C foot allows you to do three octaves on the c scale  A B foot allows you to do three octaves on the c scale while giving you a low b (the first b below the staff).    If you have the b foot, your flute is (most likely, but not always) higher quality in terms of material. If you know that you're flute is solid silver, there is a higher chance it is a B foot. If it is only silver plates, it may only have a c foot.    Some brands specialize in performance level flutes (flute with b foots for example...NOT c foots). Gemeinhartd, Sonari, and Trevor James make fancier flutes, while yamaha makes less fancy flute.    The price of your flute is also an indicator. If it is worth less than 700$, it is probably a c foot, if it is more, it probably has a b foot.     (these extra examples are vague and may not ALWAYS be correct, but this is if you are confused about my fist answer)    Hope I helped!|`|aNfGqkrpaa	Look at the foot joint.  After the Roller Keys (that you hit to get low c) how many round circles are there (uniform, large) if it is 2, you have a c foot joint.  If there are 3 you have a b foot joint, and if there are 4 you have a bflat foot joint.  ALL band flutes are C COncert, but some can go higher/lower a few notes depending on the foot joint.|`|6kWsM5LEaa	probably a b flat..  i used to play the flute but ive forgotten all that stuff|`|l2mJxB1Caa	if you don't know, how are we supposed to|`|9nU2aas6aa	I have a skin flute....lmao... sorry i counldnt resist|`|tM6xoexWaa	3 keys on the footjoint = C foot  4 keys on the footjoint = B foot (b natural, not b flat)    If that doesn't make sense, what's the lowest note your flute will play (or should be able to play if you can get all the notes out)?  That's your answer.|`|sLFoPTp0aa	Bb flute.....i think that's what most bands use|`|3FUyAeKjaa	all the flues here are c flutes. is in the same key as piano ( like you can play piano music sounding the same note)? or ( assuming you have b flat clarinets a school) are u in the key of b flat. but c flutes can go from a ledger line below the staff to more than 6 ledger lines above the staff. course if u r in your 1st year of learning flute @ school you won't learn that yet.|`|2xOF70S1aa	well, this depends,  when you look at the foot joint are there two or three keys.  if there are two keys then you have a c foot, if there are three then you have a b flat flute.  most likely you have a c foot since it's a normal school flute.  i started out on c foot and then went to b flat foot.  if you have any questions or just want to chat about flute stuff you can e-mail at fluttietutti@yahoo.com i'd be happy to help.
UtKdzK6kaa	Try DeviantArt. (www.deviantart.com) It's a community for artists, so you can post your poetry. You're going to have to meet and talk to a few people before you get consistent feedback.  My advice would just be write, write, write. You will gradually develop a style and improve. Meanwhile, join a creative writing class and just see where everything goes from there... Do you want to do it professionally or just for fun?    Oh, and if you set up a DeviantArt account, I would be happy to comment/feedback on all your work but I do need to know your username to be able to access your account. But, I am not exactly the greatest poet ever and I can't do critiques! :P    Also, if you are still at school, give your English teacher if you like/trust them some of your work to look over and see what they suggest.|`|FCgF4G7Raa	In addition to writing a lot and accepting lots of feedback even if it's negative, read lots of poetry and learn what kind of poetry you like.  Analyze it, and find out why you like it (i.e. does it have a consistent meter, does it rhyme or not, what sorts of themes, how are metaphor and simile used, other structural elements such as found in haiku or acrostic).  Then practice incorporating these elements into the poems you write.  Some say that anything written from the heart is good, but the fact is that a sharper knife cuts better, and it's good to develop your tools.  Then, when you produce what you honestly like to read yourself, chances are others will like it, too.|`|PUeD0llHaa	write a good peom and show it to all your friends and ask them to be completelty honest and tell you what you need to improve on!
3TqPF1zMaa	I have included a link that should be helpful.    A bank is private property which means you can't go inside and do whatever you want - including photography.    Standing on public property (like a sidewalk) is diffferent. You can photograph anything you can see. You cannot obstruct other people while doing it, however, like setting up a tripod that gets in people's way.    Bank security might not like you making pictures of the bank, but that's too bad for them if you're on public property. They can't legally make you stop, you go away and they certainly can't take your camera or make you erase your pictures.    If confronted, take out the print of your rights from the link, below. Heck, bring two copies with you so any one bothering you has a copy to keep for themselves. Be friendly, smile, explain that you're a hobby photographer and this is a personal project to photograph the banks of your city. Don't act like a jerk. But be firm as well. You are free to photograph what you want from public property for your own personal, private use.    Disclosure: I am the owner of http://www.lenslenders.com in Canada.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	more than likely they are going to be suspicious of you anyway... since you are casing all the banks in your area.  Right now you would be the prime suspect if something did go wrong.  Because of security reasons I do believe it is illegal to photograph the insides of them.    Do the easy thing... call the bank and ask for the branch manager.  He will know better than anyone if it is OK. I just asked my other half... works in bank... she says it is each branch own policy if they allow it.  Hers doesn't allow it.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	Inside the bank is probably fairly out of question, same as taking pics on the casino floor.    With increased security all over the states these days,  yah you could be safe photographing the structure from a public standpoint, but do you really want guys in suits checking you out and breathing down your neck?  Give the bank a call and see what they say.  Doesn't always hurt to ask, sometimes it can.|`|PWwKcjwFaa	IANAL but I don't think it's a question of legality, but a civil matter - they can sue you if you publish those images because you were inside their private property without their permission (unless it meets 'editorial' Fair Use guidelines). If they catch you with a camera they can detain you until the police arrive and charge you for trespassing, or escort you out of their premises but they can't take your camera or memory card (that would be theft and you can sue them back, but not worth it). Remember, parking lots are not necessarily public grounds; make sure you're on a sidewalk or somebody else's parking lot.    If you photograph their exterior, it's fair game (except military bases and nuclear facilities).|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	You can take a picture of pretty much anything, as long as it's visible from public property.  "Public property" generally means municipally owned property...so public streets, sidewalks, parks, etc.  (Property that is owned by the city).  Just because something is open to the public, that does not necessarily mean it's public property.  Like muxis said, NOT the parking lot because that would actually be on private property.  Just take your pictures from the sidewalk or across the street.    Basically, the law says that you can take pictures of anything that's visible from a public street, even private property.  You just can't take pictures ON private property without their permission.    It might look a little "suspicious" and you might get a few people giving you strange looks.  But taking the pictures of the bank from a public street would be perfectly legal.     However, taking pictures INSIDE the bank would definitely be a no-no.  As far as I know, there is no law that specifically prohibits photographing the inside of banks...it's just that since it's private property, you would have to get their permission.  And I HIGHLY doubt the bank will give you permission to take pictures INSIDE!  They'll probably think you're casing it or something!      I wouldn't even bother trying.  Go ahead and take your pictures of the outside of the banks, just be sure you're on a public street.  But don't bother trying to take pictures inside.|`|VkKS8nQuaa	There are considerable concerns for this question, among them is bank security.  They are photographing you when you go into the bank and, since you are on their property, they can.  However, without their permission, you may not photograph the inside of the bank for security reasons... placement of cameras, vaults, layout of the floor and windows... all are concerns that someone who might wish to commit a heist would want so they are well within reason to insist that you do not photograph inside the facility and they can confiscate your camera if you do.    They cannot, however, prevent you from photographing from the street... a public place.

ziPUFLFaaa	I haven't read Dreamland but eyed it the other day at the bookstore and wanted to check it out!    But I have read Just Listen and it is a great book full of life lessons and the hardships that high school girls face. Annabel Greene was once a popular girl who went to many parties and modeled since she was little, but one summer changed her entire life. Something happened to her at a party and isn't revealed to the end of the book, but whatever it was turned her best friends against her, made her a social outcast at school, and whenever she is faced with the memories of what happened she ends up getting sick. One day she meets this strange guy who she's always seen around school but has never talked to. He is seen as a bad boy and dangerous and is never seen without is ipod. Through him, she learns to face her fears and finally talk about what happened that one night.    Its really good and I finished it in about 2 days.   Hope you enjoy it! :)|`|V780bRMRaa	The Truth About Forever  Just Listen (awesome book)  Lock and Key    You can go to her website, just google her name or books and it will come up to the official site.|`|7585zXZIaa	Someone like you..or at least I think thats what its called. it has a picture of two peoples feet on a beach.. its realllly goood|`|e9zopZE0aa	the truth about forever.  her best one!!  about this girl macy and she meets this guy, the cutest love story.  great plot and characters, all working together in a catering crew.  but all of hers are great!|`|sWz9cDnyaa	just listen was one of my favorites    http://www.sarahdessen.com/|`|q3YMpcDgaa	The truth about forever.

4JppzNYeaa	Well, you'll be fine.  The notes are exactly the same for tenor as they are alto.  Of course you know their in a different key, but that doesn't really matter.  Exams (if your australian, AMEB) are still the same scales and so on.  The notes are the same on the music, still treble clef and all.  And if you ask me, its easier to play, more space, and you dont have to squish it in your legs.    How do I know all that?  I started on alto for about 6 months (i know its not very long) then switched to tenor.  All saxophone are played the same.  Same notes, same clef and so on.  I've played alto, tenor, soprano and baritone.  Its all the same.      Good Luck,  Matt|`|e9dCXeuNaa	Yes they're the same notes on everything but the scales.  Like the b-flat major is a c major on tenor.

The notes are the same on the music too. It's not harder to play. It may take a little more air, but it's nothing big. You would use they same brands as you would with your alto like Selmer.
xJoMSkI5aa	Reconstruction was America's first experiment in interracial democracy for men. It tested the central philosophies and traditions of America's society and institutions.    1. Schools, churches, and political parties gave blacks an opportunity for leadership roles and self expression. This taught them how to lead.    2. Jim Crow laws separated balck from whites.    3. Reconstruction is often called a failure.    4. In reality, most so-called carpetbaggers were investors in railroads or Union soldiers who remained in the region after the war was over. Some were attempting to reap financial gains, but they were doing so in a region that badly needed the infrastructure, especially since its principal labor system had just been radically transformed. The North went through a period of continued growth and industrialization. There was also the transcontinental railroad, which moved the country West.    From Shmoop
HzVE4kz1aa	yeah, or action.  you can raise the bridge and that will solve the problem or get a fret adjustment, which you have to take into the shop to do.  if it's a n Electric guitar, turn the wheels under the bridge to raise it.|`|7VpDEkC6aa	Wow. I don't think I've ever heard of something like that before.   But logically, I agree with the other guy that the 15th fret wire is probably too high, so that when you press on the 14th fret, the 15th fret wire comes in contact with the string, causing it to misfire.    That's a frickin' $2000 guitar!!!  Take it back to the store you bought it from, tell them to fix it ASAP at their expense, or you will return it, and buy a Martin somewhere else. That will get their attention, I guarantee that .  Better yet, exchange it for a different D28 and they can keep their lemon.  If you can't return it, It should be under warranty by Martin, and they should also bend over backwards to make it right for you.  I would not tolerate such sloppy treatment if I bought a guitar for over 2 grand. Go in and raise some hell !!!!!    This is a PERFECT example of why one should NEVER buy guitars online or get a guitar they haven't played first at the store. (I'm not saying that you bought it online, it just goes to show that even a Martin guitar can be a piece of crap, so be careful)  I always played the guitar I bought. Except once, when I played a Fender acoustic at the store, and then bought one. But I got a new one in the box, not the demo model I played. WORST GUITAR EVER!  I love my Strat, but I'll be damned if I ever buy a Fender acoustic guitar.    EDIT:  To Ramshackle, No I've never heard of two frets playing the same note before. I'm not a moron.  I have heard of guitars needing adjustment. The point is this is a brand new guitar, from a reputable company that charges an arm and a leg for their guitars. You'd think their Q.C. would be better that that.    To  Josh-  That's very strange the way it happened.   Perhaps the fret wire was actually not embedded properly when it was manufactured, and it measured OK at the plant, but after you bought it and played it a little it sunk down to it's real depth.  It does look like it has shifted a bit compared to the previous fret wire. you can see it doesn't fit in the binding like the other one does.    If you can't  return the guitar, I guess you should take it to get a new fret wire installed, but the neck binding may make that a bit more costly.    That's really a strange occurrence.|`|nQjICPAJaa	To Russel E: you have never heard of bad action or fret height problems or even a neck needing adjusting?    Take it into a music shop and have them measure the frets, unless you can do that at home.    They can either adjust the fret or tweak the truss rod in the neck to straighten it.    The problem could also be at the bridge or headstock.    I think a quick set up at a music shop would fix this problem.    2000 dollars or not guitars are wood and need maintenence.

soYTXBKaaa	The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield.    Awesome book about 9 'insights' into our modern world and modern relationships told in a mystery style involving Peru, the Mayans and 2012!    Two specific insights have really changed the way I think and led to some wonderful results - although all the insights have value;    First one in a nutshell is about coincidences. When they happen, do you just let them go by or do you act upon them? I now act upon them and it has opened new avenues and restored old friendships.    Second one relates to the energy flow between two people. If it's not in balance, the relationship will suffer. Very simple, but until I read the book, didn't think about it and this has helped with many relationships, both personal and professional.

AA10729675	It is both.  But it is up to us to see it as an event with a purpose.  Sometimes we are proved right, but long time after the event.  We should not be discouraged and at least decide arbitrarily that what happens will be a cause: the cause of our learning from that event.  If we see it as just a series of random events, then, it is all non-sense, there is no direction, no logic, and we are lost in a capricious chaos, or universal whim.  If we see a direction and a meaning, then we are not lost and it makes life lighter to live.|`|849d6b13631f1ba99a0c1e7655b40d5faa	The purpose of life is found in biology.    The short answer is, quite literally, that the purpose of life is to procreate and to learn.    In fact, science supports this.  The two main drives of evolution, on the cellular level are, for the short term and long term survival of the organism.  Which means, two things are important, learning about the surrounding environment in order to identify food and to identify and avoid danger.    Since we are made up of approximately 5 trillion cells, all with the same drive to achieve and continue the above two goals...we have proven that the meaning, or rather, the point to life, is to survive by learning.    The pursuit of knowledge is not only an admirable goal, but the only one worth chasing.|`|ZSRD5L1Zaa	the purpose of life is whatever you want it to be.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...with experience learned and lived i channel all my series of random events, through my mind and on a pad of paper listing the positives with the negatives then eliminating the negative list...  ...with confidence and my responsiblilities for all my choices and actions i move forward with my positive list with a purpose to accomplish my goals in Life...  ...thanks for asking...
AA10729675	There is a scientific right and wrong:  2+ 2 = 4 is a right answer.  For the rest, again, the proof can be seen:  if you go into the rain, you will get wet. So if somebody tells you: 'you will get wet', they are right, and you can verify this.  But most of the times, we cannot verify what is wrong or right, or at least not immediately.  Sometimes, it takes years to see that something that looked wrong was in fact right.  And viceversa..  However, it also depends upon the meaning you give to right and wrong.  Right being something that is logic, or something that feels good.  Wrong being something that is not logic and makes us feel bad.  It also depends upon the volume you give to right and wrong.  If you really cannot tolerate a mistake, a wrong doing, then you can see that something is really wrong at least for you.    But the Great Tao tells you that there is no such thing as right and wrong because there is yin in the yang, and there is yang in the yin.  This is very optimistic, because it leaves us space to make right what has been done wrong, and it helps us to lighten the wrong by giving more volume to what is right... in a person for instance.  Yet it could be delusional and that person could never let the right develop in her, and we cannot afford to fool ouselves.  So we truly have to take everything with a grain of salt and relate it to ourselves and how we feel about this or that.  Our subconscious mind knows what is right and what is wrong, independently from what we see, what we hear, and what we have been fed (like prejudices, religion, etc.).    That is why it is important to meditate: in the silence, everything appears as it is, either right for us, or wrong for us.    We cannot determine absolutely what is wrong or right for everyone and the whole universe.|`|kQStNgzUaa	I just know. That which hurts others for no reason is wrong.

What is right and what is wrong do u even know the differance...    If there is right then there is worng...    There is death then there is life...    Right or worng is a subject matter of being judgmental..., it is the concept of either being right or wrong...    Being right or wrong comes from a higher authority... ( God, Ruler, Dictator, Adults etc..)    if we were to do things doesn't matter right or wrong we won't understand our actions... it is either taught to us or u learn from experience...    Two ways in my opinion u can tell if a thing is either righ or wrong...    1.  Conscious    2.  Common Sence   (religious point of view)    Concious is a thing that God made to aware u that in this world there r right or worng things...(right or wrong things r taught to u at School,Religious Places, Basically studying Theology)"study of religin"  Then u have a choice when u see a wrong thing... u concious kicks in...then it is ur choice what u wish to do...      Common sense: it is the ability of make senstiable decisions... Common sense is givin it to u by god so u can judge the diff between righ or wrong...  When u go to a School and educational place they teach u "stuff"... So basically the more education u get u become smarter at judging the things from right from wrong...  (The older u get u don't get smart u become wise)   when wisdom kicks in then u r a professional at judging things from right from wrong...|`|LWpUjTHmaa	Logically speaking, right are wrong are the opinions of the society. To make it simple, majority wins. If everyone in the world were to start calling dogs "cats", and cats "dogs. Then dogs would now be cats and cats would now be dogs.

Everyone knows there is a right and a wrong answer to all questions. It differs in how you narrow it down.     It is not wether there is a right and a wrong because there is..... it is wether you have the desire to think it through to the conclusion.    Right is what moves you toward more intelligence and purpose.     Wrong is what destroys intelligence or purpose.     It is not a question of do they exist it is a question of which will you choose and why (oh and who is measuring your progress)?    Some 'right' answers are personal like a donut, but that does not mean there is no 'right' answers that apply to everyone.     The question is how do you know right from wrong... because it does exist.    If you hit someone innocent it will hurt them and you will have lied to yourself in thinking you had a 'right' to hurt them....and lying to yourself will make you lose intelligence causing your life to be less meaningful and leaving you empty inside and in future. Thus it is deemed wrong because it leads you to an existence without true purpose. You will not be free... freedom is decided by right and wrong. Choose the right and you are more free. Choose the wrong and you are less free.|`|h9AaGIYEaa	yes.. but i think every thing has to do with the circumstance of the situation also.|`|bpgxWYKRaa	--Logically speaking, everything Sauron said is right.  However, right and wrong aren't about logic, are they?  For example, slavery is extremely logical; cheap labor at the expense of the few, and extreme benefit to the many.  That doensn't mean that it's right.    --How do I know: people have been asking that question for decades, if not centuries, and nobody's been able to explain it.  It's one of those things that can't be conveyed; it can only be learned.  It's like the feeling one gets when you see a truly beautiful girl--not a "hot" girl, we ALL know what that feels like...but a beautiful girl.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you haven't seen a beautiful girl.  If you have, then you know exactly what I'm talking about; your heart starts beating faster, you wonder whether or not you might be able to talk to her and make her laugh, you wonder how her singing voice would sound, all in the same moment of time...  --I mention this because it, like proof of the existence of right and wrong, cannot be logically conveyed; philosophers have been arguing for centuries about what IS right and wrong, and we still can't prove it LOGICALLY.    --Digressing a bit, while Sauron has it right from a logical perspective, is that what "right" and "wrong" is about?  Again: in the 1800s, the majority of people were okay with slavery, but that doesn't mean that it is right, or that it was right.  I understand that I'm playing the role of skeptic here, criticising without offering an alternative theory.    --Wounded Duck offers a good analysis: anything that causes adverse consequences to someone, unless those consequences are retaliation for a transgression or they are to prevent one from transgressing, are wrong.    --That's my take.|`|7gq5a4rpaa	Depends on the majority, your ethics and how you were brought up as.

I recommend Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure, though I have never read one I don't like.    I also think you would probably like the Scarlet Letter.  Some people like it and some don't.  But, I love it.  Also, check out Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  It's one of the best books I've ever read.    And, if you don't mind something a bit depressing and you like these other books, you might also like some Dostoevsky.  Crime and Punishment is my favorite.

I tend to do that with cameras movies and TV shows because I take pride in knowing more useless facts about entertainment than my friends (Sad, I know).  I've seen the Nikon D100, D200, and I'm pretty sure I saw a D40 being used in CSI:NY  I remember that in the earlier seasons, back when film was more commonplace and the studios didn't feel like spending money on a camera that hardly ever gets used properly, they used the Nikon F100.    Yeah, I do have too much free time on my hands.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Sorry I don't watch the show enough to have noticed what brand they are but they are digital SLR cameras usually with a macro ring flash.

Chris|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Most police drama shows do NOT show the name brand of the camera on the screen. Typically they will simple take some black plastic electrical tape and carefully tape it over the name of the camera so that it name is not revealed to the audience. Two reasons for this:    1. Many camera companies don't want to pay thousands of dollars for the advertising or promotional endorsement.    2. Many T.V. and movie producers feel that the Nikon (or Canon)camera is THEE professional choice but don't want to give Canon or Nikon free advertising either. Of course the camera reps and sales/advertising professionals at Canon or Nikon KNOW their model when they see it (even if their name is covered up). It might make them think twice about paying for the advertising of the camera in the future.    3. Macro photography plays a BIGGGG factor in choosing which name brand model to pick for the police department. Both Canon and Nikon offer excellent choices in macro lenses. Typically they would always choose the model which offers the BEST and HIGHEST resolution digital sensors such as the Canon EOS 1D, 5D Mark II or the Nikon D-200, D-300 or such. Some agencies might even have the budget to purchase a $30,000 Hassleblad which offers 30 Megapixels or such.|`|VkKS8nQuaa	Remember the Movie "Bridges of Madison County" starring Clint Eastwood?... well, Canon did try to get the Producers to use them in the making of that movie but Canon's weren't used by Photographers during that time period and they ultimately used Nikon (F2, F3hp, Nikkormat) in the movie.    Crime Scene Investigations (CSI) also uses Nikon.  Why?  Because most Crime Scene photographers use Nikons.    It's nothing against Canon... it's just a matter of fact.
AA10729675	That is a crucial question.  Not just interesting, but really crucial.  It should be at the core of our life every single day.  I am responsible for the little space where I live:  so I keep it clean, unpolluted, and without chemicals as much as possible.  I also clean around my property whenever I can and whenever needed.  cleanliness is so important.  Then, I am responsible for the space within me, my body, my heart, my organs, but also my soul.  That is really the most difficult part:  the soul.  I am very angry, and I know it creates bad vibs.  So, it is an everyday struggle.

C77c0OE2aa	Ok everybody... read the question... Moz said he is using a LOMOGRAPHY camera. That means he likely has NO ability to adjust ANYTHING for proper exposure. I know I can't with my Holga. Light meters and grey cards are totally worthless with this style of camera.    Now, to answer the question with that in mind, it is correct that there is no film that particularly is better for dark skinned people. I will suggest though that you use Ilford XP2 black and white film ISO 400. This is a C41 process film and has very good latitude so that the negative can be scanned and you will have lots of room to mask and up the levels on the dark skin. This is about your only recourse when using a lomo camera that pretty much locks you into one exposure set.    steve|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Sorry there is no film that will make dark skinned people photograph better.

It's all about light (photo+graphy) and knowing how to shoot darker tones even in nature requires knowledge of concepts in light.      If I give you a hammer, do you become a carpenter?

D9dmgk5Oaa	A massive question here, but in short, the homestead act allowed a pull-factor to engage, therefore pulling people from east to the frontier west with the promise of cheap or free and available land, something that no long existed in the east.  See Frederick Jackson Turner's "Frontier Thesis".  What determined success more than anything else, if the farmers truly meant to farm rather to invest, and then cash out with a profit as soon as they could, was the availability of water.  Too many farms in the "Great Desert" were too far removed from sources of water, rivers, and therefore, they were forced to rely 100% on rain.  This failed massively in the great dust bowl era of the 1930s.

You might add 'like a cop' my teacher said it was a crime....    there's your similie    'like a victim' I didn't know what to say    add a word like 'very' before 'the next day' (it has two syllables)    But the teacher said no no no    You will have to add some more syllables to the last line.    Good luck and keep on writing, don't judge it as good  or bad or great or awful.

Obviously, you may be an amazing dancer and therefore defiantly apply there...another I'd recommend for the more dancy people is Arts Ed.  Equally, Mountview and Guilford are excellent schools producing allot of the leading actors and actresses in the west end at the moment, so not quite as dancy.  The most important thing is to apply for as many as possible,  All the ones i've listed are very respectable drama schools for musical theatre and any of them would be great!

The greasers Johnny and pony boy hang out with some Soc girls at the theatre and the Socs boyfriends get mad. One day the Socs take it too far trying to drown pony boy, so Johnny takes a knife and kills one of the leaders named Bob. The Socs are ushually let of easily when it comes to crime but the greasers always get it big time. That is what caused Pony boy and Johnny to run away to the school house where they live on bollony for a few weeks. One time the church where they were hiding started on fire and Johnny and Pony boy run into the church to save some youngsters that were playing there. They did a heroic thing and the farmer was amazed that greasers could do something like that.|`|YORoyQlPaa	www.sparknotes.com

eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	First, get rid of the stereotypes that the Scots and Irish necessarily like to drink, although some do. If the truth be told, they like to "have a crack" (talk) more. The love of drink just like the use of drugs for the most part stems from poverty, and until very recently both Ireland and Scotland, for the most part, have been very poor countries, indeed.  Becase of their dire straits, they have exported their peoples. These groups are also responsible for the origin of country-western music.  Otherwise, about the only thing they have in common (for the most part) has been a profound dislike for the English.    Another stereotype to guard against is the stereotype of the red-headed, hot-tempered, green-eyed Irish and Scots, although admittedly there are more redheads in Scotland (13% of the population) and Ireland (10% of the population) than anywhere else on earth.  Most of the above have brown hair; some, of course, are also blondes. Skin-tones range from very fair to olive skin tones.    Next, you need to determine if you are Scottish and Irish or Scots-Irish because there is a difference: The Scots-Irish are Lowland Scots who came to Ireland in the 17th-century after James I of England (and VI of Scotland) came to the English throne. The British refer to these individuals as Ulster-Irish rather than Scots-Irish.  They originally didn't describe themselves as Scots-Irish until large numbers of Roman Catholic Irish started coming to the United States in the 1840s because of the potato famine (more on this later).  Ordinarily, the Scots and the Irish didn't intermarry because the Irish were predominantly Roman Catholic, and the Scottish were primarily Protestant (and usually members of the Church of Scotland (Presbyterian).     If you are Scottish, you need to determine whether your ancestors were Lowland Scots or Highland Scots because each group had a substantially different life style.  Most Lowland Scots were small tenant farmers, although many of them also were skilled craftsmen.  Ordinarily, they immigrated to the American colonies earlier than Highland Scots or the Scots-Irish.  Many originally settled in Virginia because of Scotland's ties to the tobacco industry.  It was much faster to ship tobacco from Norfolk, Virginia, to Glasgow, Scotland, than it was to ship tobacco directly to England.   Most Lowland Scots were also usually higher on the socio-economic ladder when they came to the American colonies than their Highland Scots, Scots-Irish, or Irish cousins.  They blended in very easily with other Americans in part because of the high level of almost universal literacy achieved in Lowland Scotland. Prominent Lowland Scottish-Americans  include Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens), Andrew Carnegie, John Paul Jones, Alexander Graham Bell, Lyndon Johnson, and Thomas Edison.    Most Highland Scots came to what is now the US between about 1750 and 1800, even though some would continue to come to the US and Canada throughout the 19th century: 1)  Most of these families were small crofters (tenant farmers) who were forced from their land because their landlords wanted to "improve" the land, meaning that instead of growing crops like oats and running cattle, the land was primarily reserved for sheep.  Sometimes, the lairds burned their cottages; sometimes they strongly induced their tenants to move to America or Canada.  2) This movement started after the Jacobite Rebellion in 1746 where after anyone who fought for Bonnie Prince Charles and against George II of England was either killed or transported to the New World. Highland dress and culture was prohibited. 3)  Finally, many young men were conscripted to fight in the British army in the Napoleonic wars.  Accordingly, some Highland families also moved to the Americas because of this.  Most Americans of Highland Scots descent have probably intermarried with Lowland Scots as well as the Scots-Irish.    Anyone who lived in Scotland above present-day Glasgow or in the Inner or Outer Hebrides would have been considered a Highland Scot.  Lowland Scots looked down on these peoples as hillbillies. Many of these families originally settled in either the Cape Breton or Nova Scotia area of Canada or in North Carolina.     The Scots-Irish were for the most part Lowland Scots who moved to Northern Ireland in the 17th century because the rents were longer and less expensive than the rents back in Scotland.  This wasn't a long-distance move because in some instances they could see the shore of Ireland from Scotland and vice versa.  The English Crown discriminated against these Covenanteers (or Presbyterians) because they would not join the (Anglican) Church of Ireland just as it similarly discriminated against the Native Irish, who were Roman Catholics.  The incoming-Lowland Scots forced the Native Irish off much of the land until rising rents in turn forced many Ulster Scots to relinquish their tenant farms and move to the New World.  These families settled in North Carolina as well as in places like New Hampshire and Massachusetts because of the Industrial Revolution.  More often than not, in addition to being farmers, these people were often skilled craftsmen.  They often formed the vanguard of the pioneer movement within the United States since the land on the Eastern seaboard was already taken.  Prominent Scots-Irish Americans include Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, and Jim Bowie, Bill Clinton, George Patton, Richard Nixon, and Andrew Jackson. These peoples on the frontier became Baptists and Methodists.    The Native Irish were Roman Catholics who like their Protestant counterparts were also farmers. In the 1840s, a potato famine struck Ireland forcing many of the Irish to move primarily to industrial areas in England as well as Lowland Scotland (Glasgow) as well as to industrial areas in the United States (New York, Boston, and Chicago).  Until that time, the Irish would have probably immigrate|`|D9dmgk5Oaa	A good deal of both here, Irish and Scottish ... yes, drink, but also who love to talk, chat, enjoy conversation; people who love to eat simple foods from the land, lamb and salmon, and corned beef and potato, and also people who are immensely faithful, love God and their Church, love to welcome people into their homes, love music and a wonderful story.|`|0HAn67yZaa	i'm scottish, along with 10 other things, i have dark hair, medium/olive skin and no freckles, on the other hand, my little sister has reddish hair, pale skin and freckles, scottish people enjoy eating haggis which is a stuffed sheep's stomach, 67% percent of scottish people are christian, they are also known for scottish whisky, they play highland games which is an athletic competition, if you want more information, here is a great link.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_cu...|`|AA11053540	Better for you to google your query.

vqJVj83Paa	Existentialism deals with the theme of existence, what it means to exist, as well as how one should exist. Broadly conceived as a practical and poetic project of self-creation, existentialism articulates a fundamental human need - to find meaning within ourselves and within the world. The father of existentialism is Soren Kierkegaard, a Christian existentialist who was the first to comprehensively explore what it means to be an 'individual' as opposed to being apart of some larger social or religious force. Following Kierkegaard was Friedrich Nietzsche, who probably doesn't need any introduction, in contrast to Kierkegaard, Nietzsche would be best views as an atheistic or at the very least a nihilistic existentialist. If you've been following your philosophy you should know that he promoted the 'ubermensch' or 'superman' (e.g., the next stage of evolution in man). His work is heavily saturated with references to rising above the 'herd' mentality of the time, to take a hold of yourself and become the master of yourself. The next significant existentialist was Martin Heidegger, and what he does is synthesize both Kierkegaard and Nietzsche into a complete philosophical system. What he does is lay out the 'structures of existence' or another way of putting this is that he wants to analyze the structure of experience itself. Heidegger is too complex to get into but to answer your question about the 1950's it will be sufficient to say this: Jean-Paul Sartre is the person who everyone remembers as the quintessential existentialist thinker - him and many other french intellectuals - what he does is attempt to complete Heidegger's project by creating a companion work to Heidegger's own creation called "Being and Time" - Sartre names his piece "Being and Nothingness" - So there you have it - Sartre was a masterful literary genius more than an existentialist and had a very large role to play in 'popularizing' existentialism - these days most people carelessly toss the word around as if they knew what they were talking about - categorizing it as a movement that has outlived its usefulness - it is in fact very much alive - and if we look at the entire philosophical project - a strong argument can be made for existentialism being the key theme in philosophical thought - east and west - all the way back to Socrates and the Buddha.|`|qt9rrk6xaa	The essence of existentialism is passion and action.

AA10144492	Searching for designs on the USPTO site is a bit tricky. I'll explain it step by step.    First, go to this link: http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin80/gate.exe?f=... This is the searchable design search code manual. Type in simple keywords that describe your logo. For instance, typing in telephone brings up the 6-digit codes for telephones, telephone poles, answering machines, etc. Make note of all the 6-digit codes relevant to your logo.    Second, go to this link: http://www.uspto.gov/main/trademarks.htm This is the main trademark hub page. From here you'll see 2 columns. Look at the right hand side for a link that's titled Search. Click on that.    Now click on Structured Form Search (boolean). In the first search term box, type in the 6-digit code, no spaces & no dots. Change the field to Design Code. Stopping here will likely result in too many hits to look at so let's use the rest of the search boxes to narrow it a bit.    Change the operator to AND. In the next search term box, choose one keyword that describes your goods/services, e.g. clothing, software, etc. Change the field to Goods & Services. Now click Submit Query.    You should then see a listing of marks that you can view in more detail.    Regardless if these marks are filed, those bands likely have first use or common-law rights to them based on usage alone.    Hope that helps! I wish you much success & happiness in all your ventures!|`|vtototRlaa	they're both trademarked.

05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	If you live in a 114-room estate in York, you are the eldest son of the Duke or Earl and it is carved over the mantle in the room you use for formal dining (and soccer games, when your mother the Duchess is not entertaining) it is accurate, all right. No doubt about it.    If not, you know by researching your family until you get back to a fellow who had a C of A issued to him. Here is my standard C of A answer; I paste it 3 - 8 times a week.    House of names -  http://www.houseofnames.com  will probably show you a Coat of Arms that was (probably) once issued to someone with the same surname as yours, BUT:    Coats of arms were designed so knights could tell each other apart when they were buttoned up in their suits of armor. They were given to individuals, not families. If, for instance, every knight named Smith used the same coat of arms, there would be a crowd of knights riding around with the same coat of arms painted on their shields. It would be as confusing as a basketball game where both sides wore blue uniforms and all the players were number 12.    The eldest legitimate son inherits his father's Coats of Arms. He passes it on to his eldest legitimate son, and so on; that's where the myth of a "Family" Coat of arms comes from. Only one person can PROPERLY (See below) have a given coat of arms at one time.  People who sell T-shirts and coffee mugs, however encourage the gullible to believe Coats of Arms are for a surname.     Below:    If your surname is Smith and you come from Shropshire, you may find that Sir Albert Smith, Sir Bruce Smith and Sir Charles Smith, all from Shropshire, all had C of A. If you do your research, you may find you descend from Sir Charles, but you are nowhere close to being the eldest son of the eldest son of the . . .. Now comes the question - Is using his coat of arms proper? Opinions differ.    Some say it is like demanding "your" room in the ancestral Smith estate in Shropshire, from the current owners - ridiculous and illegal.    Some say it is like wearing a Regimental tie if you didn't serve in that regiment. (Land's End sells those by the thousands to Americans. I would never buy one.)    Some say it is like wearing a Scotch Plaid shirt when you don't belong to that clan. (LL Bean sells tens of thousands of those; I have Lindsay myself.)    Some say it is as harmless as wearing a Detroit Tigers baseball cap when you didn't play for the team, or a UC Berkeley T-shrt when you didn't attend the University. (Or an Ohio State one, but as long as you're going to wear a University T-shirt, why not the finest?)    So, there's the facts and three opinions about using a "Family" coat of arms. You can make up your own mind, after you do your research.|`|AA11138176	Most of the time there is no coat of arms.It depends on the family mostly if they were  royalty then they do have one but,the majority of families don't have one|`|LwW1wacHaa	I would check more than one source then compare them. Or you could go to your country of origin and check it out there so you know its definitely legit.|`|lmVDvmMCaa	You can obtain a coat of arms in one of two ways: inherit it or adopt a new design.  If you inherit arms, then you inherit them from a particular individual in your male-line ancestry, i.e. your father, your grandfather, etc.      You can verify the arms with one of the registration or granting agencies in your ancestor's home country.  The American Heraldry Society maintains a complete list of these on their website. http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index....    If your ancestry does not include an armiger, then you can adopt your own freely in most countries or you can pay the state heralds in the UK.    If you found your surname family crest on the internet, then you fell for one of the biggest genealogy scams in existence.  Here is how it works.  A clever marketer took some heraldry books and made a database of many coats of arms. Instead of recording the actual person who bore the arms, he just associated a surname with each one (often the surname of the original armiger). The point of this scam was to increase the number of people who would identify with a particular design, even though by tradition using an unrelated person's arms is theft. This clever scam has made millions for the con artists and made fools of many people.|`|AA12343309	Coats of arms do not belong to surnames.  Actually, they normally don't belong to families.  I think in Poland and France they do belong to families but no way do they belong to surnames.    When you see one of those little walnut plaques with a coat of arms on it on someone's den wall,  they might think it belongs to them but actually they are usurping another man's identity.  They were granted or assumed by an individual man and are passed down through the direct legitimate male line of decent. Each son obtained one with some differences. Only the oldest son inherits his father's upon his father's death.  Sometimes a female inherits one if there is no male heir.    Now it is possible you have more than one in your family tree. That doesn't mean you are entitled to any one of them.  It just means if after doing research you find more than one ancestor that were granted a coat of arms and if you have a book printed or even published on your family history, it is quite legitimate for you to put pictures of your ancestors' coats of arms in your book.  However, it wouldn't be valid for you to put pictures of those that just happened to be granted to someone with your ancestors' surnames.    If you are an American and you have any English lines that goes back to early colonial days in the American South, you have a good opportunity ov finding several in your family tree.  Some in the South have the ones their ancestor brought over from England 300-400 years ago.  They aren't those little walnut plaques either.  As a rule, they don't display them. They are any good for buying groceries or gasoline and they don't help their 401k.    See the links under source regarding heraldry in various countries, England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland and Italy.|`|374454263905c6f155f2456921d31d26aa	There is no such thing as a family coat of arms, and as each is changed as it goes down the hereditary line( the sons would be slightly different then the fathers to distingush between the two.

R5UIMBvcaa	He's a GREAT king!  Curiously (since I'm sure the author knew nothing about Plato), he seems to have been an example of the Philosopher King described in the Republic--a leader who sacrifices having a personal life so he can devote himself to his people.  As he dies, he remarks to Wiglaf, who is evidently just some sort of cousin, that they are the last of their line, so clearly Beowulf has no children, and there's no mention that he was ever even married.   (If he has any shortcoming as a king, it might be his failure to provide a son to succeed him.)    Of course there's also the simple fact that he was King for fifty years.  Long-reigning monarchs usually foster ages of peace and plenty, and bad monarchs seldom reign for long.  (Which is NOT to say that any monarch who doesn't reign for long is a bad one!)    And then there's the fact that, surely eighty years old, he automatically assumes that it's HIS responsibility to protest his people from the dragon--and he does, even at the cost of his life.  Yes, he needs Wiglaf's help to kill it, but without Bewoulf's example and the memory of Beowulf's kindness and generosity to him, Wiglaf probably would have fled with the rest of Beowulf's followers.  So Bewoulf was the kind of leader who treated his followers well and who inspired at least one of them to continure his fight against evil.    Finally, there's his funeral, at which people speak of what a great King he was.  The fact that they mourn so extravagantly also testifies to his greatness as a ruler.

These are the people who love you because of who you are, not what you look like.  Listen to them.    Your question is why, when you ask a bunch of older people if they'd like to be young again, they all say "NO!"  And, yes, it does sound like you're a tad depressed.  One of the great things about being young is also one of youth's greatest problems: your emotions go from highest high to lowest low.  There's a big range. It always seems like your emotions are tearing you apart.  We've all been there, believe me!   As you get older, those pesky emotions tend to level off - Thank Heavens!      Here's a secret: those cute, cool, perfect kids are having a lot of the same feelings you are.  They just hide them away behind a big show.  When some of them are feeling like slug spit, being mean and snotty to other kids makes them feel like they're better than everybody else. Of course, it doesn't make the people they're picking on feel very good. But when you're all self-involved you don't care about how somebody else feels.    It sounds like you recently moved.  Does your school have a peer counseling program?  Are there any clubs you're interested in?  One sure cure for the "Poor Ugly Me's" is getting out and involved with others.  Have you ever considered volunteering at the local Boys and Girls Club or Hospital?  And, please, try to stop looking at yourself so much.  Nobody looks at you with the same magnifying glass that you use to look at yourself.  Yeah, I know....it doesn't feel like that to you, does it?    And never forget this:  the little bit of depression you're in right now only means that you're a kind, caring, feeling, loving person. Instead of picking on those around you and making their lives miserable, you're picking on yourself.  You just need to be a little more kind, caring and loving to yourself.     Hugs and Wishes for you!|`|0ljM5Ye7aa	it maybe depression, but in a different form.   You just always have to remember: who cares what other people think? I look fine.   and when you think of yourself in a positive way other people will and   you will feel better...    and dont go with teeth whiteners and tanning beds,   they'll just make you feel like your adding on to your fakeness, which will not help your self image,   but exercising and things like eating ealthy will make you feel better|`|NVs2dprzaa	well all these girls in your school who you think are "pretty" probably try very hard to look that way. So you cannot really call it natural beauty. If that is what people consider beautiful, (tanned, straight hair, expensive clothes, very toned body etc), then it shouldn't mean anything since its not real. I bet if ANYONE did all these things to their body and face, they would be just as beautiful as the girls you see and think are pretty.   plus looks are not everything. a beautiful personality is what is attractive...not really your outside appearance.|`|27949975b7dfebab0f8828ee15e487a3aa	You may not be as pretty.  Your teeth may not be as white.  You may be ugly.  It doesnt make those girls any better than you,  just as your positive traits dont make you any better than anyone else.    And that is how you improve your self image: By saying that in spite of what the world sees wrong with me, in my own eyes Im just fine.

46zxsu1haa	NYCB has several dancers who are French or studied in France.  Principals: Sebastien Marovicis,  Benjamin Millepied  and Sofiane Sylve.  The other French dancers that I know of are in corps. de ballet, which makes them not as famous. There is a famous french ballet teacher  who now teaches at Manhattan Youth Ballet, who was trained at the Paris Opera Ballet and comes from a long line of famous French dancers. He became more famous as a teacher than as a dancer. That would be Francois Perron.   That is all I can think of now. If I think of more, I will add some.    How could I forget my absolute favorite dancer: Sylvie Guillem! She is Very Famous and very French!

I also think you could use some lessons because I think you just aren't sure of yourself enough. Lessons will help you with that. You will learn different tricks to help you sing your best. I'd teach you some tricks but they're too hard to explain by writing. One thing you should try though is making sure your mouth is open enough when you sing. That can make a huge difference.

Z0v6G0Kgaa	1.  Technology has always improved and been integrated into war.  But this was the first war where several technologies radically shaped tactics.  Stuff that Alexander the Great or the Romans or the Crusaders or Napoleon had used tactically suddenly because foolish.  Examples:  --rifled muskets.  This allowed killing at a longer distance with far more accuracy.  Suddenly, massed frontal assaults became down-right foolhardy.  --use of the railroad.   The ability to move troops quickly (especially cannon or infantry--forces not usually associated with quick movement) great distances quickly.  So the technology since then has changed by the basic principles (airlifts, helocopters) brought in a whole new set of tactics.  --communication.  Before, you relied on riders or runners or what you could see.  But instead you had spotter balloons, signal towers and telegraph wires now.  The technology has evolved but the idea of communication not dependent on direct human sight or human movement (runners, riders) is now a part of modern warfare.    2.  You saw the first widespread use of trenches as part of a mobile battlefield.  Sure, there were sieges in the past going back to pre-Crusades.  There you dug trenches to sneak in closer to undermine the works or launch mortars over the walls.  But here two sides would race to a crossroads and the first one there would throw down fence rails and dig rifle pits.  And then a day or two later they'd move and the first side to get to the critical ground would dig in.    3.  The first wide-spread use of military medicine of fulltime professionals with large hospitals, traveling surgeons.  Before, wives would care for the wounded or only generals had surgeons (personal ones at that).    4.  Then there were other innovations that did revolutionize elements of warfare but I'd argue didn't have the same impact that rifled muskets or medicine or the railroad or telegraph had.  Those were:  --ironclad ships  --the submarine (which actually was first used in the Revolutionary War but it's a misnomer to really call a 1-person vessel with a screw as it's weapon a sub).    Edit:  No-it wasn't the first war to see guerilla fighting (there was a lot in the French and Indian war, the Revolutionary war, in Spain against Napoleon).  And it's not accurate to say that the revolutions happened with Napoleon and we just saw upgrades in the Civil War.  For centuries, the direct frontal assault (make with some kind of pointed device--be it a pike or a lance or a bayonet) had been the way that your broke the other side.  Maybe you used mounted soldiers (cavalry) to flank him or exploit a breach in the line.  But what the Civil War did was to radically shape tactics because of the innovations.  Every war has seen technology advances.  But with the Civil War, you saw tactics that had been used for centuries and as recently as Napoleon and the Mexican-American War suddenly become obsolete or foolhardy except in extreme circumstances.  You saw successful use of impromptu or quick trenches and fortifications (separate from sieges or forts).  You saw communication and trains that were more than just upgrading the cavalry or improving the runner system.  Warfare changed dramatically in the Civil War.  That is why it was so damned bloody--generals kept trying to use tactics from just 10-20 years earlier that had been wildly successful in Mexico or with Napoleon and instead they were costly and often failed.  And the mistakes of WW-1....the technology of the Civil War continued to upgrade up for the most part, sides failed to learn the lessons of the Civil War (and were still fighting with Napoleonic tactics).|`|pv8RjqzOaa	Such classifications appear artificial to me. Where do you draw a line between modern and non-modern? IMHO modern warfare started with the napolean wars.|`|732c53bd23ec21418e9a02c0dff8ef43aa	Technically it is considered such because it is the first major war to rely primarily on firearms and other modern technology (like the railroad). Many wars before also relied on primitive muskets, but the Civil war was the first where modern-style rifles, mortars and cannon were widely utilized and relatively easy to transport. It also saw the emergence of new weaponry like ironclads (not used hardly at all - simply an innovation). New forms of communication were also used for ready communication between forces and their commanders (the telegraph).     It also marked the emergence of newer tactics in battle - more guerilla style warfare instead of the "hold the line" style battles of the generations before. This type of battle was still prevalent, but the majority of the war was fought by militia men in small groups as opposed to a large single force.      UPDATE  In response to Agility Man - I am not saying that the civil war marked the ADVENT of guerilla warfare - simply that it was MUCH more widely used. You stated the same exact thing in about 100 more words.|`|eFjy1f2paa	The start of the use of ironclads in naval combat for one.  Higher firepower led into trench warfare on both sides.  Instatanious commucincation between different theatres of war by use of telegraph  The use of trains for transportation and supply.  Total War such as in Shermans March to the sea, destroying anything that might be of use to the enemy (rather than just fighting on the field of battle)|`|9XJLlPaEaa	Napoleon started the age of modern warfare, but technologically, the Civil War saw the first gattling guns, submarines, iron clad ships, etc...
sc4BtGxGaa	Most dealers will do this - they put them all on your credit card, and if you do not retiurn them in excellent condition by the end of the trial , THEN they charge your card.    BEST is to go to a convention.  I will be at the National Flute Association convention in NYC this August - every single flute worth playing on the PLANET will be there.  Take a really good set of extra ears with you - your teacher, etc - and try things.  THEN, if you are confused ( ya think??) have the top contenders sent to your house.  They do not all have to be from the same supplier  - each handles certain brands ( think car dealers and their franchises - it works the same way,almost).  Good luck!!
G4a8Yfjeaa	You're a female, you aren't supposed to lead, so no worries. But if the guy is so bad at dancing that you end up having to lead, do basic steps. Neither of you can dance (or so I'm assuming), so if you have to lead, start of with your feet together. Take one step forward, then one step back. He should take one step BACK then one step forward. Switch feet and do the same. Try moving your hips to the beat or spinning yourself around a few times. If my advice isn't helpful, I suggest looking up "Ballroom Dance Instruction" at     http://www.youtube.com    and following their instructions. There is no way to guarantee that you won't lead, even though you really shouldn't have to, so be prepared for the worst (and highly unusual) :D|`|ESYH0Xoxaa	slow dancing at a dance is usually pretty low key, you dont have to know how to do much, just sort of sway around with your arms around each other. but as for not leading, i've done ballroom dancing and had to dance as both the lead and the girl, and mostly when you're being led it's important that the leader do his job (basically be the more 'assertive' one) and the follower learn to be responsive to your partner and just go with what happens. its more of a mindset than anything else.|`|0cf4Qja5aa	Choose a partner that knows what how to frame a dance position.  If you start dating, invite the guy to take a dance class or go take one yourself and  hook up with someone who is already engaged at improving his social dance moves'

Of the two you mentioned, I'd go with the Leigh Michaels one simply because if you look on Amazon, she has a whole slew of published romances, while I really couldn't find any for the other author.  I've personally browsed through that book and it does seem to have a significant amount of useful information for the beginning romance writer, especially about choosing and analyzing your genre and doing research.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

RrB51Mq4aa	They say 'Out of the mouth of babes' this time it was through the eyes of a babe. An infant not knowing what it was he saw. Two shapes, he knew them, mummy and daddy, though still it was enough to confuse. The other two unknown and moving about the room tipping out the contents of the cupboards and rifling through the drawers. The babe just watched, mummy slumped, her clothes mostly the colour of Elmo. Daddy was messily dressed the same. The babe reached out a plump fingered hand and gripped at the air in the direction of mummy. No one reached back. When the two strangers left the only thing that moved was the babe's arm as it waved to attract a much dead mother.

NYU37jfGaa	In 'Prince Eddy and the Homosexual Underworld', Theo Aronson makes a very convincing case for John Montague Druitt, who was the chief suspect at the time, for having been the Ripper.  Druitt was a failed barrister and schoolteacher who apparently belonged to the same secret homosexual set as Prince Eddy, older son of the Prince of Wales.  Druitt committed suicide in December 1888, after which there were no more murders and the investigation seems to have been quietly dropped.<br>  <br>  Mr Aronson believed that Druitt's possible identity as the Ripper was hushed up due to his close connection with Prince Eddy.  If their association had become public, it would have been a source of major scandal and embarrassment to the royal family.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I doubt it, but I kind of like the theory that it was the English Prince, although I don't think there is any proof and I think somebody came up with that for sensationalism.<br>  <br>  But some stories will never die.

Since that time, the identity of the killer has been hotly debated, and over one hundred Jack the Ripper suspects have been proposed.[1][2] Though many theories have been advanced, experts find none widely persuasive, and some can hardly be taken seriously at all.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper_suspects" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ri...</a>       Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution is a non-fiction book written by Stephen Knight and first published in 1976. It proposed a solution to five murders in Victorian London that were blamed on an unidentified serial killer known as "Jack the Ripper".<br>  <br>  In an attempt to solve the mystery, Knight presented an elaborate conspiracy theory involving the British royal family, freemasonry and the painter Walter Sickert. He concluded that the victims were murdered to cover up a secret marriage between the heir to the throne, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, and Annie Elizabeth Crook, a working class girl. There are many facts that contradict Knight's theory, and his main source, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press that it was a hoax. Most scholars dismiss the theory as a fantasy, and the book's conclusion is now widely discredited.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, the book was popular and commercially successful, going through 20 editions.[1] It was the basis for the films Murder by Decree and From Hell, as well as other dramatisations, and has influenced crime fiction writers, such as Patricia Cornwell and Anne Perry.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper_conspiracy_theories" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ri...</a><br>  Many theories about the identity and profession of Jack the Ripper have been advanced. None have been entirely persuasive, though there have been many theories based on the letters sent to the Central News Office. Some have encompassed the theory of a young man who was heavily influenced by Jack Sheppard, a burglar who died in 1724, who read pennydreadfuls. Other clues from letters sent determined that the writers of the most convincing letters were written by a man of the lower class, with only a rudimentary education.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ri...</a>|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	If we ever perfect time travel, then sure.....but then, how many OTHER mysteries would we solve???

They don't have a book you want, then you find a completely different book that you would've never found of you were to buy the book that you wanted. And, when you buy a book, you are most likely to read it once, and never read it again. Granted, you might use it as a reference at times, but you never actually go around rereading the same old thing, I do, but most normal people don't. (Yeah, that's right I just dissed myself. You got a problem with that?) Still libraries are always free if you go to your town one. All you have to do is get a card, and voila, any book, anytime.... Renewing? Usually libraries have websites where you can enter the book number and your library card number and you can click a keep or renew button, my library does. Due date? No problem, once you get the book, get a post it note, scribble the due date, and whammo. You have got a bookmark and a reminder-er. Why would you go to Borders and spend a perfectly good twenty on one book?|`|lrZSzvxuaa	It all depends. If you can find it in the library go and check it out. Maybe but a reminder on your phonw or get a small notebook and write down your due dates for the book. If you can't then I suggest that you go online. If you ever find time go to your nearest book store or a borders or a barnes and noble and start reading it. If it looks worthy of buying then go ahead. That what I would do.|`|zSEs5kUqaa	You can renew your books online.     I, personally,  like to buy my own books. I like to support the authors. I mostly buy paperback, because they are cheaper.

Also, did you know that libraries have book sales...and they are really cheap (Cheap as in $0.50 to $1.00, or, on the last day, $3.00 for a whole bag of books--at least, where I live it's that cheap)?|`|AA11165686	If you can find a book in a library, get it there. Then, you can set your phone or something to give you a reminder before the due date. Even if you do hand it in a bit late, the late fees won't be anywhere near what you would have paid to buy the book, only to never look at it again.    If it's a book you can't find in the library, then buy it online. Try to look at a variety of websites and see where you can get them cheaper and where you can get free shipping. Here are some suggestions:    http://betterworld.com/  http://powells.com/  http://amazon.com/|`|GOa2gtGZaa	If you are the forgetful kind, i suggest you buy the book.

bpgxWYKRaa	--Under the kind of logic you expressed regarding Hitler, then murder is acceptable; after all, no murderer THINKS what they're doing is wrong...but it is.    --And good and evil don't need each other to exist: if everyone on the planet started to hate Jews and systematically exterminate them, as did Hitler, that doesn't meant it's right: that just means that what everybody wants is wrong.  If evil were the sole moral system left, the only ethical system in existence, it would still be evil.  People may not be able to identify it as such: but it is.  If dogs were the only pets in existence, people might refer to dogs as "jelly-fish," but a dog, regardless of its name, is still not a marine invertebrate.  "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet."  Evil, by any other name, is still evil.    --However, to end on a light-hearted not, there are many things that are indeed neutral.  I personally disapprove of polygamy, for example: it detracts from the husband's (or wife's, depending on the system of polygamy) ability to express true love for one, specific "soul mate"; it is only conducive to expressing a mediocre sense of sexual attraction to multiple people of lesser compatibility with you.  In short, by choosing polygamy, you won't be as happy.  But, people keep choosing polygamy, so there must be something to say for it.  But then again, most people have been taught that polygamy is the only acceptable form of relationship between husband and wife, so it wouldn't exactly be a choice...The point is that I am agreeing with you; some things are simply neutral.    --Conclusion: good and evil exist.  Some actions are right, some are wrong, regardless of opinion, universally, objectively, and patently; evil is the inability to recognize this distinction.|`|KhOx6oTMaa	good is balanced, fair, unifying and true, benefiting more, evil is benefiting fewer and is based on lies, selfishness and/or ignorance. these qualities seem objective|`|flWyyWgraa	Yes.... there is good and evil.    Good is linked to right    Evil is linked to wrong    Right is the choice that brings you more intelligence and purpose    Wrong is the choice that does the opposite it takes away intelligence and purpose    Some say that what feels good is not always what is right, but it is a misnomer of the word 'good'. What it should say is what brings pleasure is not always right.    There is opposites in all things. Sour and sweet.     In able for good to exist there must be evil to compare it to. Hitler was evil, he was not right, his actions did not lead to gaining more intelligence and purpose.  Instead his actions destroyed intelligence and purpose. He was not good because he thought he was good, it is not an opinion. He tricked himself, he lied to himself. And a lie is not part of intelligence. He was intellectual maybe, because he thought about life, but he was not intelligent.|`|AA11635601	Yes indeed - religious beliefs or not - good and evil are real and are revealed to anyone who is mature enough to take love in - when love touches, we learn a lot of things, including right and wrong, good and evil, which are universally true.|`|XxDQGEalaa	The idea of good and evil is a human creation. They ARE  opposites and dependent on each other to exist. They are terms we use to explain different extremes...but the animal kingdom doesn't have good and evil, so why should we...as animals?

shVgCizBaa	One of the two great influences on the thinking of Charles Manson, along with the Book of Revelation, was the musical group the Beatles.  According to Family members, Manson would most often quote "the Beatles and the Bible." The two influences were linked, in that Manson saw the four Beatles members as being the "four angels" referred to in Revelation 9. Revelation 9 also tells of "locusts"--the Beatles, of course--coming out upon the earth.  It describes prophets as having "faces as the faces of men" but with "the hair of women"--an assumed reference too the long hair of the all-male English group.  In Revelation 9, the four angels with "breastplates of fire"--electric guitars--"issued fire and brimstone"--song lyrics. <br>  <br>  Manson believed that the Beatles spoke to him through their lyrics, especially those included in the White Album, released in December 1968.  Several songs from the White Album crystalized Manson's thinking about a coming revolt by blacks against the white Establishment.  He interpreted many of the songs idiosyncratically, believing, for example, that "Rocky Raccoon" meant black people and "Happiness is a Warm Gun" was a song about getting firearms to carry on the revolution rather than--more obviously--a song about sex. <br>  <br>  The White Album played a key role in forging Manson's warped ideology.  According to Family member Paul Watkins, "Before Helter Skelter came along, all Charlie cared about was orgies."<br>  <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansonbeatles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects...</a>          CHARLES MANSON AND THE BEATLES  Charles Manson, the infamous cult leader and murderer, as you know, led his cult to commit the Tate and LaBianca murders. Manson believed in an idea called  "Helter Skelter," which like the Beatles song's theme, total chaos. Though regarded as an amusement park ride in England, Helter Skelter was regarded differently by Manson. "Charlie" believed that a race-war between the whites and the blacks would soon take place in America. He committed the murders to show the  blacks how to rise. Manson labeled this war Helter Skelter. He also believed that the Beatles were Gods, or at least angels, sent by God to show Manson himself about the race war.<br>  BACK TO TOP<br>  <br>  First of all, Manson and his cult studied the White Album over and over, and they came to the bizarre song "Revolution 9."  Manson and his followers thought the song not only described the sounds and utter chaos of the black-white war, but opened the door to the entire cult reading the chapter Revelation 9. Manson thought that the similarities between names Revolution 9 and Revelation 9 were highly significant. Revelation 9 begins with the fifth angel blowing on his  trumpet, and star falls to the earth and was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit. Out of the pit, locusts were released. Locusts. Locusts, Beatles? Revelation 9 describes the locusts hair as long (as the same with the long-haired musicians), having iron breastplates (the electric guitars), having crowns of gold upon their heads (possibly the Beatles receiving their MBEs), and "the noise (made by the locusts) was like the noise of many chariots . . . rushing into battle." The last note about the noise was about the song "Helter Skelter," no doubt the Beatles most heaviest song and closest they ever came to what is now heavy metal. One unusual quote from the Bible is "they (the locusts) were told not to damage the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree, but only those people who do not have THE SEAL OF GOD ON THEIR FOREHEADS." This, explains Manson's grisly "X" and later a swastika crudely tattooed by himself into his forehead. And now to the individual songs of the White Album...  <br>  BACK TO TOP<br>  <br>          "Honey Pie" - lyrics: "Oh Honey pie you are driving me frantic/ Sail across the Atlantic/To be where you belong." Charles had written many times for the Beatles to come visit him in California, all of which didn't work. Now Charles believed the Beatles were calling him to be with them. <br>  <br>          "Yer Blues" - lyrics: "Yes I'm lonely, wanna die." Manson believed the Beatles were calling for him again. <br>  <br>          "Sexy Sadie" - Manson had long nicknamed one of his followers, Susan Atkins, "Sadie Mae Glutz" before the White Album was released. Manson believed he could communicate telepathically with the Beatles. <br>  <br>  <br>          "Rocky Raccoon" - The "coon" part of the title referred to a black man of the race war. <br>  <br>          "Happiness is a Warm Gun" - The Beatles telling the blacks to get guns and fight. <br>  <br>          "Blackbird" - lyrics: "Blackbird singing in the dead of night/  Take these broken wings and learn to fly/ All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise." According to Manson, the Beatles were urging the blacks to commit to the race war. <br>  <br>          "Helter Skelter" - lyrics: "When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide/ Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride." The first verse of Rev|`|izXIAxXGaa	There is enough on this subject to write a book. There have been several books in fact. One of my favorites is Vincent Bugliosi's Helter Skelter. There have been several others. I am surprised that, like interest in the 1960s music and culture there are still many kids in high school and college that are fascinated with Manson. <br>  But, your question, Did Charles Manson think the Beatles' songs were telling him a message?<br>  When asked, he denies this.<br>  His followers stated that he told them what the Beatles were trying to tell the kids to rise up and start a revolution.<br>  It is hard to say. Charlie was a con man. He used so many things to get people to do what he needed them to do. <br>  He used girls as a pimp.<br>  He manipulated many individuals in our correctional system into getting him into areas of the correction that he preferred and one wonders if Sharon Tate and many others would be alive today if the powers in charge had been less lenient in their sentencing and parole and release decisions.<br>  In 1968- 69 the Beatles were at the height of their world wide popularity. Many kids already believed that the Beatles were telling messages to the "tuned in people." It could have been a rumor that Paul McCartney was killed in a car crash, or that the Beatles were saying that taking dope was all right, or that the US should withdraw from Vietnam.<br>  That was already there. So Charlie just added it as one more gag in his bag of ex-con's tricks. He used pimping, drugs, Scientology, and music. <br>  When still in prison, Charlie told a prison inmate when the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan that "I'm better than them."<br>  In some way, Charlie was envious and even jealous of the Beatles, of their popularity and the fact that they had their music on every radio station in the world, and he couldn't get his records produced.<br>  What is really interesting is that he was a friend of Beach Boy Dennis Wilson at the time the White Album was released. I thought I saw in one book I read on Manson that he had the privilege of listening to an advanced released tape of Beatles White Album songs before they officially released their album. As one of the Beach Boys, and one of their premier recording artists, Dennis Wilson may have had access to the Beatles acetates.<br>  I have not seen anything were John Lennon states that Revolution 9 has anything to do with the Book of Revelation 9  in the New Testament of the Bible. Lennon  had joked about the popularity of the Beatles being "bigger than Jesus Christ" in 1966 and in 1969 he added the lyrics "Christ you know it ain't easy . . .they're gonna crucify me" to his "Ballad of John and Yoko."|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Fa Sho...|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	That was his claim in court. He said the Beatles were the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and the White Album was telling him that it was time for the "White Man" to stand up and force the "Black Man" back into their place as a subversive race. His plan was to kill rich White people, blame Black people and start a race war.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	They thought the whole White Album was about an apocalyptic war between black people and white people.
fc6d53d49cee8a18bcc6f405be062a50aa	Get away from your mother, first of all. If she is that much of a negative influence, you need to stop letting her get you down. If you can't get away from her, tell her she is trying to control you, and that's not what you need right now.    If you don't know what you want to do with college, and you have already taken all your general education courses, talk to an academic advisor about what you should major in. They talk to thousands of other people about majors and such, so I'm sure yours will be able to help you.    "Wage-slave" is about the most ridiculous term I have heard. Get it out of your head, now. Working is what people do so that they can have the money to live and enjoy life.    Life is not a bad thing. It is not something we just do every day. Life is a beautiful thing, but there is not much to it if you're not living. Don't die on us before you even start to live.    You need a break, I would say. Get up, take a city bus (or drive) to the other side of town, find a park or something of the sort, and take some time to yourself.     And, most of all, lift your chin up. There's a world around you filled with beautiful things, beautiful people, and beautiful places. No matter how much life has gotten you down, know that some of these beautiful things are inside of you. You just haven't found them yet.    Good luck.|`|wINFcB2oaa	Once you talk to people with experience about life, you should then learn the meaning of life. If you don't, you'll get experience as you go through life to understand what life is.|`|AjUEFyvKaa	So it might not be a bad idea to talk to a councilor type about this. However, I've got a couple other ideas.   Your second paragraph caught my attention. You had some very good points and it sounds like counseling might be something you'd be good at. You've got a grip on life that a lot of people don't have. You don't need to be in a relationship to be happy, and getting into one won't make you feel better. However, everyone needs to be loved. (Society has just warped that into the whole "must have relationship or DIE" thing)  And about your mother, one fo the big reasons parents pressure their kids is because they love them and want them to be happy, but they have the wrong idea about what will make them happy. Many parents also try to live through their kids. That might be what your mom is doing when she suggests jobs.|`|RwfwcS94aa	Take an unreasonable amount of hallucinogens and downers and then strap yourself into an isolation tank and try to focus on the center of your mind.|`|e9adf83d87be6ce67e66ff59ef0e4a91aa	Create an illusion for yourself and then seek it. Just like the rest of us freaks.|`|AA10529146	There's nothing much I can tell you here except to suggest you start looking into counseling for depression and most likely anxiety since they both run hand in hand. You obviously are not very happy with yourself. You just need to find someone to confide in, perhaps the  counselor at the college you attend would be a start. Best do it before those dreaded thoughts you are hinting at in your details start creeping into your mind.|`|v1xDXHG5aa	Ah, but there is meaning in life.  Maybe you're leaving God out of your life.    God, the author of life, says:     "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." (1)    Related to that, Jesus said, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent." (2)    He also said, "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly." (3)    Follow this link http://www.livingwaters.com/good/ to see how you can come to know God and Jesus Christ.|`|wig4qCeJaa	I think your last sentence exposed the real problem.    Maybe she should read what you wrote ...|`|ESYH0Xoxaa	a lot of college kids get here eventually i think.   there are no solutions to this problem. i have it too. it's hard to find the motivation and direction to will yourself to do something meaningful when really, everybody's direction is ultimately towards death...   i don't know if there is any answer for this feeling. but many people out there find a calling, sometimes later in life, and it's not a lost cause to just keep going through the motions until something like that comes along. you just have to keep hope that life has something non-boring to offer, and go after any chances you see. my mom actually graduated with a social psychology degree and then realized she wanted to become a lawyer, and now is a successful one. so stuff like that happens.  and about your mother, that does suck, probably the reason nothing seems appealing is that you don't want to do whatever she's pushing you toward. the way i deal with that is, make at least an effort to pursue her suggestions, because that way she'll be satisfied and you never know, it might work out for you. at least when you do get a job and more independence you can just ignore her if you want. it sounds like she's exacerbating your insecurity about your future (no offense to your mother).  good luck... you have a lot of fellow travelers.|`|c5b60ac3242a47478e9f3294c17cf65faa	It's hard to be 21 and not be self-centered.  It's hard to be as self focused as you appear  to be, and be happy at the same time.  Give life a chance.  Give yourself a chance.  Sometimes when we can't find purpose in  life, purpose finds us.  Good luck to you.

czHD5tPwaa	When your serious about it, it's not really possible. Even just writing the word 'love' is...well, corny. But it's because of the reality of your work. The main thing people are up against is how others would look at this. They usually ridicule, which happens to make the poet themselves to ridicule their very own work. Poems are words that come from the heart, if not,it's not exactly a proper poem. So, yes, it is corny, but that's what makes it beautiful.|`|62OGLZfpaa	Well, never use the words "I love"  When writing poetry "obfuscation" is you best friend   i.e. Don't be clear, ever.

This is why poets, great poets, are so few.|`|ZsKrYCYCaa	do you love me?  you could've warned me.  now this love poem is  looking quite corny.  and I myself  am getting quite horny.|`|YFKwT1owaa	Its always cliche|`|AA11627844	love makes you corny  lol      i know..cuz im deeply in love here|`|vjwkeGxMaa	use personal expirinces that you've had in the poem.

I looked down paths that traveled from afar,  but it was never you I expected.  Suddenly I've felt you flying through my soul  in quick , lofty flight,  and how beautiful you seem way up there, far  from my always idiot heart!  Love me that way, flying over everything.  And, like the bird on its branch, land in my arms  only to rest,  then fly off again.  Be not like the romantic one who,  In love, set me on fire.

SjTAVdcKaa	Good convincing by Ben Franklin.|`|avVdKiWKaa	They didn't like the British either.      The French Indian War (1689-1763) is the name given by American historians to the North American colonial wars between Great Britain and France in the late 17th and the 18th centuries. They were really campaigns in the worldwide struggle for empire.      To the settlers in America, however, the rivalry of the two powers was of immediate concern.    The French and Indian War, fought between 1754 and 1763, was not a war against Indians, but rather a fight between Britain and France for control of North America.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Cause King Louis XVI or maybe XV, if I got that right, wasn't all buddy buddy with Great Britain.

The two countries agreed that if France was to enter the war, both would fight until the Americans won their independence, and that neither party would sign a truce or peace treaty without the consent of the other.

Independence for the colonies would seriously damage the British Empire and create a rising power, the United States, that could be allied with France.    In early 1778, shortly after an American victory at Saratoga, France entered the war against Britain; Spain and the Netherlands joined as allies of France over the next two years. French involvement proved decisive, with a French naval victory in the Chesapeake leading to the surrender of a British army at Yorktown in 1781. The Treaty of Paris in 1783 ended the war and recognized the sovereignty of the United States.    See the links below for additional information.

MlLEOvAaaa	It is one of those series that is ageless.  I first read them when I was about 11 or 12, but I didn't really get into them until I re-read them in university.  The whole series is really well done.  It does start when Anne is still a child (11) and finishes when she is a grown woman married with children.  (Rilla of Ingleside is about her daughter).  Anne and Gilbert's romance is alive and well (starting with their flirtation as youngsters).  It gets very agonising as you root for them.  Two of the books were written out of order (Anne of Windy Poplars and Anne of Ingleside) purely because of the demand LM Montgomery received to have more of Anne written.      Here's the order and Anne's age (book, year and age) :  1 Anne of Green Gables 1908 1116   2 Anne of Avonlea 1909 1618   3 Anne of the Island 1915 1822   4 Anne of Windy Poplars (US&Canada)  Anne of Windy Willows (Other) 1936 2225   5 Anne's House of Dreams 1917 2527   6 Anne of Ingleside 1939 3440   7 Rainbow Valley 1919 41   8 Rilla of Ingleside 1921 4953     She also appears in Chronicles of Avonlea and Further Chronicles of Avonlea (but they aren't about her)|`|TkPJYlaMaa	The whole series is good.

From movies, you could be -   The Blair Witch (your take on her, since you never get to see her in the movie)  Michael Myers  John Doe from Se7en  Jigsaw  Leatherface  Hannibal  Jason  Regan (From the old Exorcist, not the new one)  Freddy  The Swamp Thing  Pinhead (good luck pulling that off, lol)  Frankenstein  Chucky  The Creeper  One of the Zombies (pick any zombie movie)  Scream  A Gremlin  That one from Eyes Without a Face  The Thing  The girl with the white eyes from The Others|`|QMaMWDiEaa	Uhm, well i love horror books/movies.

3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	I say the a basic rate of 50 bucks per hour is good. so 75 dollars for each seasion you speak of!|`|jvPToF4Laa	You are a professional. See what they are charging now for car mechanics and plumbers in your area, probably about $70-80 per hour. You can charge the same, if your clients can handle it.<br>  <br>  Here, plumbers are $75, the garage is $83, and ice skating is $86.|`|nRN8ou3Maa	Although you're a professional, you're not mending anything like a mechanic so you should charge similar rates to someone such as a piano teacher.  Maybe $70 for an hour and a half. That's if they bring their own materials.  Obviously more if they're expecting to use yours.  Although I wouldn't overcharge them.  If you charge a little less than expected they might ask for lessons more often.

qg11igznaa	Open with a death of a character. That way you can either back track (explain how the person died throughout the course of the story--see Chronicle of a Death Foretold) or continue in a linear fashion. <br>  <br>  Otherwise I would suggest opening with a surprise, something ironic. Books that begin with lines like "The sparkles danced across the table as the nearby window flooded the room with light" are brilliantly boring and depressingly common as untalented writers commonly mistake their triteness for poetic imagery. <br>  <br>  Of course it all depends on what kind of story you're writing: fantasy, fiction, science fiction? Do you already have a basic story mapped out? The way you begin a story is heavily affected by how you want to end the story. What are the themes? What kind of journey are the characters taking (physical, emotional, coming of age)? Who or what is the antagonist?|`|KTNqah9eaa	It's a good idea to write something that will immediately catch the reader's attention but is not too flashy or outrageous. For example - "As he opened his eyes, John looked out the window. Nothing looked the same as it did yesterday or any day before that." If the reader's not asleep a sentence like this has a good chance of encouraging the reader to look further. <br>  If you're a bit uncertain, write the story and then go back to the opening lines when you've finished it.|`|pbw7chpyaa	It was a dark and stoprmy night, Suddenly, a shot rang out...|`|Dy8e5CdDaa	once upon a time ..........................|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Pick up some of your favorite books and see how they opened. A lot will depend on what your story is about.
X6nQFXj6aa	I don't want to write a paragraph because if I'll really like it I won't want to give it to someone else XD<br>  Usually I start with something very intriguing about the character or situation. If you heard this thing, would you be immediately eavesdropping on whoever was talking about it? Like starting a conversation with an awkward silence makes you want to know what just happened that was so embarassing. Or why a man is sitting on a bench in the park with a sealed box with no address written on it. Or making a character think 'Not again' and dread something upcoming, making the reader wonder what's happened to the character. Hope this helped. Have you ever walked into a room in the middle of what seems like a very interesting conversation and was dying to know what's going on? Usually write from experience!|`|ivejg4whaa	Use a strong quote or ask a question to the reader. Or use a statement that is bold and intruiging.|`|AHuBqplbaa	If you have not yet written your story, you are ahead of yourself searching for a perfect opening line.  If you want to write, you should have an idea in your head, so just start writing it down.  Later, the story can and should be rearranged, and you can use a more exciting part to start things off and word it so it really hooks the reader.

f4Nn0W1xaa	The scene in Gone With the Wind (either book or movie), after Ashley's birthday party, would be perfect for your first example. From the wiki article on the movie:    ' At home later that night, while trying to sneak a drink for herself, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk. Blind with jealousy, he tells Scarlett that he could kill her if he thought it would make her forget Ashley. Picking her up, he carries her up the stairs in his arms, telling her, "This is one night you're not turning me out." She awakens the next morning with a look of guilty pleasure, but Rhett returns to apologize for his behavior and offers a divorce, which Scarlett rejects saying it would be a disgrace. '    Authors and film makers can be very skilled at implication and the use of symbolism to convey passion without resorting to any insert tab A into slot B play by plays. A major cliche of the technique involves cutting from a kiss to a crackling fire.    I'm having a much harder time with a baptism example, which is driving me crazy because I know that there are a few obvious and well known ones that are escaping me. I'll edit if I come up with some.    As far as irony goes you could use Romeo and Juliet or any of a number of other works. The wiki article lists several good candidates.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony|`|aaNZZKLraa	What do you mean by suggested, but not described?    Okay, well in Flowers For Algernon, the guy is going from being mentally reduced (retarded) and he's going through processes to be intelligent, and he has sex, but he doesn't really know what it is, since he is just actually learning about life.        I guess that's what it means?|`|M2EKtjIbaa	All about sex except sex:    -Breaking Dawn  -All American Girl book 2    Loses innocence, but it doesn't affect Bella's character in BD b/c she waits until she's married. While in American Girl 2, Sam (girl main character) seems to think of sex as a very casual unimportant thing now, since she did it as a young teen.    Baptism  -well, in A walk to remember, the main character really grows in faith and becomes a better, more responsible person...able to endure    Irony  -The Hunger Games: Katniss and Peeta are entered in a fight-to-the-death Hunger Games but at the end, they threaten suicide (b/c they were going to be forced to kill each other) and they BOTH won the hunger games. ironic==> creators of hunger games end up letting them both win to stop them both dying, when it's a game where one person tries to kill everyone else.

Try all different angles.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, change the hue/saturation digitally.

gW0nD5cEaa	In the US, it was the first time women in large numbers worked outside the home, including women whose husbands were overseas in the war, not just single women. <br>  <br>  In Europe and other places, the war was a real danger to their lives,  as they had to also work in factories, etc. in many cases but also go through air raids and other dangers.<br>  <br>  In the US, they had spending money often for the first time. In those days, many girls went from high school or college to marriage, with little or no work experience. Possibly a little money she made if she  were living at home went to her father who gave her a small allowance from it. She now actually had a little spending money (though with war time rationing there might not have been a lot to buy)<br>  <br>  Sometimes the freedom led to problems when the husband returned from the war. Many women liked the idea of working and their husbands were totally opposed to the idea. Other women went back to being housewives happily, glad to be out of the factory or whatever.|`|shVgCizBaa	The Role of Women in WW2                    Background <br>  Before the war few women followed careers. Most jobs for women were ‘traditional’ roles such as nursing, secretarial or caring jobs.  <br>  Women in industry <br>   Millions of men joined the armed forces, more <br>   workers were needed to fill their places in the <br>    factories. This changed the traditional views <br>   of women. Job opportunities in munitions <br>   factories for working-class women allowed <br>   them to earn a much higher wage than before. <br>   Women became machinists, lumberjacks, <br>   dockers and railway engineers.<br>        Attitudes changed – people supported these changes. <br>   In 1939 only 36 women were employed in shipbuilding. By 1943 the number was 200,000.<br>      Women in the armed forces <br>  Some 300,000 women served in the army, navy and nursing corps, and a quarter of these served overseas. <br>        How did the role of women change?<br>   Women were portrayed in the traditional ‘young <br>   and good-looking’ way in beauty parades for <br>   women in the armed services. <br>   However images of working women were also <br>   used to help change the stereotypes –  Rosie the Riveter was a fictional character used  in propaganda and news reports to encourage <br>   women to take up ‘man’s work’.<br>   <a href="http://www.learnhistory.org.uk/usa/womenww2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.learnhistory.org.uk/usa/women...</a>       Women and War 2   <br>  Women work on a Vultee Bomber <br>  During the 1930s, a woman’s place was most certainly in the home, but the invasion of Poland changed all that. When WWII began in 1939, the British government started campaigning for women to assist in the War Effort. Two years later, in order to meet the spiralling costs of war, all women over the age of 18 faced conscription. <br>  <br>  Rather than bear arms, however, women were required to manufacture munitions, work the land, or perform civil defence duties, as air wardens, or fire fighters. It was a huge scale operation. In fact, in the early 1940s, women were responsible for a third of all British manufacturing, with 80,000 women working in agriculture. <br>  <br>  In addition, 500,000 female volunteers from Britain and across the Empire performed duties in the auxiliary forces. These included the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRENS), the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). <br>  <br>  Apart from nursing, these women carried out crucial tasks, like anti-aircraft surveillance, and provided vital assistance in military planning. Of course, some brave British women joined the Special Operations Forces (SOE), dropping behind enemy lines to work as saboteurs, couriers and radio operators. <br>   <a href="http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/ww2_home/ww2_living_with_war/ww2_women_and_war/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/ww2_ho...</a>     Women in World War Two  As in World War One, women played a vital part in this country’s success in World War Two. But, as with World War One, women at the end of World War Two, found that the advances they had made were greatly reduced when the soldiers returned from fighting abroad.<br>  <br>  At the end of World War Two, those women who had found alternate employment from the normal for women, lost their jobs. The returning soldiers had to be found jobs and many wanted society to return to normal. Therefore by 1939, many young girls found employment in domestic service - 2 million of them, just as had happened in 1914. Wages were still only 25p a week.<br>  <br>  When women found employment in the Civil Service, in teaching and in medicine they had to leave when they got married.<br>  <br>  However, between the wars, they had got full voting equality with men when in 1928 a law was passed which stated that any person over the age of 21 could vote - male and female.<br>  <br>  The war once again gave women the opportunity to show what they could do.<br>  <br>  Evacuation:<br>  <br>  Young mothers with young children were evacuated from the cities considered to be in danger. In all, 3.5 million children were evacuated though many went with a teacher. As young children were normally taught by females, many of those who went with the children were women. The fact that women were seen to be the people who taught the youngest was something that had been going on for years.<br>  <br>  The Women's Land Army:<br>  <br>  As in World War One, women were called on to help on the land and the Women’s Land Army (WLA) was re-formed in July 1939. Their work was vital as so many men were being called up into the military.<a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/women_WW2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/wom...</a>       -----------------------     Women WW2 in Australia<br>  <a href="http://www.ozatwar.com/women/women@war.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ozatwar.com/women/women@war.h...</a>

SQkdULOlaa	1. D<br>  It's a stereotype against Mexicans who are steeped in their poverty and are uneducated, thus they were thought to be thieves.<br>  <br>  2. B<br>  I think it would be B because the whole play had been a kind of mockery towards the secretary (who is representative of the State Administration), until the part where we find out Honest Sancho is actually a mannequin and all the other mannequins were real Mexicans. This strikes us as it totally deflates the whole idea of Mexicans being the ones victimised and honest. We find out that in the end the Mexicans aren't that honest afterall.

When I was little and would think of something, butterflies for example, I would just think about how pretty they are and how envious I was of how they could fly.      Now, when I reflect on these sorts of thoughts I had, I can see how I was abstractly thinking about the "relationship" I had with them and the emotions they rose in me.  I was just too immature to recognize this, but I was contemplating life.    Thinking about life will always be a part of someone's life, they just don't always recognize it.

Jordan is embarrassed that she doesn't have a boyfriend and makes a decision she will soon regret. She invents a boyfriend. Only the boyfriend isn't totally imaginary. In fact, he is a boy that she has known all her life. To make matters worse, he soon moves to her town and stays with her family! How long can Jordan keep up the mysterious facade of a fake boyfriend?

They are actually dull and feel like metal, they may actually be made out of metal. I work at a high end mall in Atlanta so I have seen a few.<br>  <br>  Here is more information on the black card from American Express: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_card" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_card</a><br>  <br>  If you could live for hundreds of years then you would be rich as well.

Hence the popularity of nazism among many muslim "activists" (look up the official hezbollah salute)|`|B8Gwxo1laa	It's usually racists hoping to promote their own twisted views, and discredit the atrocities their beliefs have caused.|`|oKYB3Po7aa	The muslims feel that "how could the jews have been wiped out by the Germans, then take their land 3 years later and fight off all the muslim countries successfully."  They have a hatred for the Jews that didn't start until 1948, Most of the world over the last 2,500 had the same feelings up until the holocaust was revealed.      The Israeli's committed several atrocities to the palestinians and British using terrorism to control the rest of the land and to establish their nation.  This does not make sense to the Muslim world to "be the greatest victim of all time" and then turn around 3 years later to be terrorists and murderers.  So therefore they understate the holocaust.  Palestinian leaders who are for peace get stepped on by the Israeli's and lose face with their followers.  Israeli leaders who are for peace lose face with their followers.  The only leaders these two groups can look up to are fighters.

I'm sorry if you do draw a variety of things. BUT i love your drawing's and i think they are AMAZING so keep drawing and they are amazing no matter what!  |`|Xp6jtuMVaa	These drawings are GREAT!!!!|`|TOoNHNv9aa	those are amazing drawings.|`|GgkxvdgEaa	Great job, really! the only thing I would suggest is that you move out of your comfort zone and try drawing people, as it REALLY advances your artistic ability (trust me on this one), maybe try some color, though not essential, and another thing I would say is that you need to add some background. These drawings would really just POP out of the page if you gave them a racetrack or field or mountainous landscape to frolick on.  again, kudos.

It is flipping awesome!!!    The Summoning  July 2008  Chloe Saunders sees dead people. Yes, like in the films. The problem is, in real life saying you see ghosts gets you a one-way ticket to the psych ward. And at 15, all Chloe wants to do is fit in at school and maybe get a boy to notice her. But when a particularly violent ghost haunts her, she gets noticed for all the wrong reasons. Her seemingly crazed behaviour earns her a trip to Lyle House, a centre for 'disturbed teens'. At first Chloe is determined to keep her head down. But then her room mate disappears after confessing she has a poltergeist, and some of the other patients also seem to be manifesting paranormal behaviour. Could that be a coincidence? Or is Lyle House not quite what it seems...? Chloe realizes that if she doesn't uncover the truth, she could be destined for a lifetime in a psychiatric hospital. Or could her fate be even worse...? Can she trust her fellow students, and does she dare reveal her dark secret?     Honestly, when I read this ^...I was like WTF? Tha Sounds Weird...But Then I read the book and I was like " GIVE ME THE SECOND BOOK NOW OR I SWEAR O GOD I WILL SHOOT YOU!"

It's about a society where everyone gets surgery at the age of 16 to become "pretty". The series is by Scott Westerfeld, and the books are Uglies, Pretties, Specials, and Extras. The first three follow the story of Tally Youngblood, and the last one branches off a bit and though Tally is in it, she's not the main character anymore.    I read it a few months ago, and I'm 15. I loved it. It was really exciting and she involves herself in romances with these two boys. The romance isn't the central point as much as the action of taking down the corrupt society is, and it's all balanced nicely.|`|FK9GZblCaa	Try The Lioness Quartet, by Tamara Pierce.

If you like fantasy i strongly recommend any books by Tamora Qierce, her books have action and romance and really strong female characters. I also recomind the Uglies' series by Scott Westerfield, they are so awesome! A really amazing action series i love is the Alex Rider books by Antony Horowitz, which are about a 14 year old spy and are so intense and impossible to put down. I also love the Maximum Ride books by James Patterson, they also have a really strong female lead and are chalk full of action. I hope this helped, happy reading!|`|laAZbxNVaa	i loved the R.L. stine books when i was thirteen :)|`|AA11283598	Hmm, well i really liked the Uglies Series. Its really good.

QEexR4gjaa	women during the renaissance could not do much. they could not stuyd things that men did. they also could not hold important positions. Women during renaissance focused on raising their children and taking care of their households....however women had to know how to be elegant as outlined by Castiglione in "The Courtier"...Isabelle de Este was the first renaissance lady...she was an art patron (other women during that time could not be art patrons) because her father was a well known man. Another woman who took part of the renaissance was Christine de Pizan (she took part of renaissance because of her family's status) She wrote "a City of LAdies" in which she wrote that in order for women to enjoy the renaissance they need to create their own city. She together with Boccacio started during the renaissance what is known  as "debate about women" Focus of this debate was to find out why women are being discriminated and how to fix this problem. INtellectuals however continued to disregard women's rights.

Fy4s0dAkaa	Hi!  Piecing the puzzle together, you have   what appears to be a meeting hall with a photo  of Theodore Herzl, the founder of political Zionism.  As your painting does not evoke any particular  style, without knowing the location of this venue  makes it difficult.  She may have been a regional  heroine, founder or supporter of the movement   or perhaps it's simply a portrait of memorial.  I've   looked at the women who were forefront in the   movement and they bear no resemblance.  Can   you offer any further information as to the location?  The premises may be host to alternative functions  that could offer some clues.
AA10304847	It provided the so-called 2nd front in the war and the major significance was that it prevented the Iron Curtain from reaching the Atlantic Ocean...  That made alot of difference to the western democracies by checking the spread of communism, for as you know the Red Army was surging from the East prior to Normandy and their momentum would've carried them over all of continental Europe.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	why cant you do your own homework.|`|bdnMQnVHaa	By opening a front in Western Europe, rather than Southern Europe as Churchill wanted, the United States was ceding Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union, thus creating the roots of the Cold War.|`|OmSJR5UFaa	It was the first western-front Allied invasion of Europe, and it spelled the end of Nazi domination of the continent.      Just under a year later, WWII was over.|`|28c0495788bedefa03a0bf8e36f5ed48aa	It hastened the end of world war 2 in Europe. The Germans had to divert military resources from the Eastern front. Resources that they could not afford to divert. So, from a German perspective, the Russian front suffered and crumbled even further.     It allowed the US to establish a beach head and from there a base of operations to bring more troops and supplies into battle.    It was a gamble. The invasion had been postponed i think twice(june 4&5th due to weather). Eisenhower had decided to go for it on the 6th. Many lives were on the line. The Allies knew the Germans were preparing their defenses for an invasion so there was potential for Allied disaster.  However, the Germans did not expect an attack on Normandy. At best, they thought it was a diversion. Hitler slept through the early hours of the invasion because his commanders were afraid to wake him. They needed his permission to send armoured units into Normandy to defend the coast.

MSEyXHFWaa	British books use British spelling:  Artefact  Organise    They also use the word "knickers" to mean underpants. Crazy Limeys!     The measurements will also be in metrics, but it's about time America caught up with the rest of the world in that regards. 12 inches in a foot? Really? Who the hell thought of that? What's so wrong with base 10? How the hell do you guys even do physics? It must be pure agony converting those units.    Anyway, the differences shouldn't negatively effect the book at all. I'd order it from the UK.    One thing to remember, though:  "hullo" does not mean "hello"  It is an expression of surprise. It took me a little while to figure that one out. : )|`|daza5A4vaa	Not really.  Some words could be spelled differently (theater,theatre) but other than that, it should be pretty much the same.|`|AA11165686	There are no differences that would bother you.

dbTPyM7Yaa	tekaro,  The wikipedia article is correct. Hues are made with less expensive versions of a color. If you can find two tubes of a color from the same manufacturer, one a hue, and one the more expensive original mineral, buy both and try them side by side. I'm sure there are artists working today who can tell the difference. It's not usually enough for most of us to switch.    The original minerals used for these pigments, which is the proper name of the coloring products in paints, are now very expensive. So much so that most paint producers don't even make the original version. If you can find a class that teaches how to make your own paints you can discover in detail how this process works. It's interesting, but very time consuming.    The paint companies found other ways to produce the same, or very similar, colors. They use synthetic materials or other minerals that are very similar to the expensive versions. If you're like most of us, hues aren't a bad thing.     A final consideration is that some mineral products are very toxic. Often a good reason to produce paint using synthetics or alternate natural materials is to avoid the often radioactive nature of the others, for both the manufacturers and for us.

In this sense, life in not really the result of fate but a giant Rube Goldberg machine that we call existence.|`|nyk6l3c5aa	I think the laws of the universe ultimately follow a chain of cause and effect. So even if our future may be set in a sense that it will follow this chain, our human understanding is so limited that it gives the illusion of free will and/or randomness.   So whether I think I can do one thing or another my brain still follows a process of reasoning that inevitably leads to what it does.  I only have the illusion of free will because I'm experiencing it happening.  I'm not saying I don't have any control over my future because for all practical purposes I do. I just think in the ultimate scheme of things in the universe its all part of cause and effect.

AHuBqplbaa	To tell the truth, I agree with the poster above, and would think in dialogue somebody would be more likely to say<br>  <br>  "Hold on.  I think I heard something"<br>  "Wait a sec.  Did you here something?"<br>  <br>  But otherwise sound and noise can be used interchangably, though there can be perceived a slight difference.  For sound I might picture something that is expected - a ticking clock, a radio from an upstairs room, the humm of the fridge.  For noise I might picture something more invasive - a strange scraping from the attic, a sudden wind knocking the shutters - even a silence lacking all sounds so that the silence itself is noise.|`|2XENlkJSaa	Sound is a form of energy that is transmitted by pressure variations which the human ear can detect. When one plays a musical instrument, say a guitar, the vibrating chords set air particles into vibration and generate pressure waves in the air. A person nearby may then hear the sound of the guitar when the pressure waves are perceived by the ear. Sound can also travel through other media, such as water or steel.<br>  <br>  Apart from musical instruments, sound can be produced by many other sources - man's vocal cord, a running engine, a vibrating loudspeaker diaphragm, an operating machine tool, and so on. Click on the demo buttons and you will hear the noise from different sources.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Noise is unwanted sound. Usually the sound of a violin is referred to as music - is something pleasing. Depending on other factors, the sound may be perceived as noise.<br>  <br>  Noise perception is subjective. Factors such as the magnitude, characteristics, duration, and time of occurrence may affect one's subjective impression of the noise.|`|3MfbnZMdaa	If you are going for naturalistic dialogue, I think this would be more appropriate (and you get to avoid the whole sound versus noise thing):<br>  <br>  "Wait, hold on! I think I hear something."<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  "Wait! You hear that?"|`|RrB51Mq4aa	"Wait, hold on! I think I heard a sound/noise."<br>  <br>  "Wait, hold on! I heard something, what was that noise?"<br>  <br>  That's how I may go about it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|YYJ2SlKbaa	Wait, hold on! I think I heard something<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now it can be anything|`|X6nQFXj6aa	I think both are credible, 'sound' implies anything from a breath to a bird, and I think 'noise' is something out of the ordinary that one notices out of place.<br>  <br>  So in your sentence, noise would be better. There are sounds everywhere all the time.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Yes they are pretty well interchangeable. Maybe a 'sound' might imply something quieter than a 'noise.' I would suggest writing the sentence and then read the paragraph aloud to see which sounds better.
oHO0XOQVaa	I think your diction could use improvement. <br>  Example: "He emitted a throaty chuckle and moved closer to her as the chilly autumn wind blew back his messy black hair, revealing a jagged scar that ran down his left eye."<br>   Not like I'm a great writer (actually a visual artist) but I'll try to improve upon this particular line.<br>  <br>  "Drawn aside by an autumn's breath, greasy hairs yielded to a twisting disfigurement sprawled over his left eye."<br>  <br>  The words: chilly, emitted, messy, throaty chuckle, revealing, jagged scar, are unremarkable. You don't necessarily need to use a thesaurus to find more interesting words but find more interesting ways to convey these ideas. I managed to show the idea of revealing without using a simile to the word.<br>  <br>  Another example, "moved closer" could be replaced with "closed the space between them," or "he drew near." Personally not satisfied with either of those because they still sound too generic to me but, yeah, I'm not a writer.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of generic writing.<br>  I was too young to remember when my mother died. It was a freak accident that took her away from me and all that's left of her now are photographs and memories of how she made me feel. Her older sister, Sybil, was a governess to my family. My father's cousin had been married to her but he abandoned her and my father himself was obligated to her in a way since he had loved her once briefly.<br>  <br>  Excerpt from Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita.<br>   My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of memory...<br>  My mother's elder sister, Sybil, whom a cousin of my father's had married and then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of unpaid governess and housekeeper. Somebody told me later that she had been in love with my father, and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather cleared.|`|FMcu6BNpaa	Oh my goodness... this book is...it is...it-t-ts....AH-MAZING!

ceBTTCPwaa	The Supernaturalist, by Eoin Colfer (author of the ‘Artemis Fowl’ series) is a science-fiction novel (influenced in many ways by film noir and other predecessors of the cyberpunk science fiction movement, resulting in what could be termed a cyberpunk novel). <br>  <br>  In the book the transportation isn't that much different from ours today. Eoin Colfer states in the book when they get on a Clarissa Frayne truck they say it's a hundred years old because it still uses rubber tires instead of modern plastic treads. <br>  <br>  So the book dates at least a hundred years from now.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supernaturalist" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Superna...</a>

0AUPrCMZaa	yep it would. all wood resonates differently.|`|577076a28e3180e6d74e269d0d346d57aa	Fretboard wood doesn't change the sound, as it isn't really considered tonewood. It is more of a aesthetic and texture deal - maple is the hardest to refret, though. The fretboard wood doesn't resonate much, well, not enough to affect the strings vibrations.<br>  <br>  The amount of sustain it has would probably be different, as the pores and densities of the wood will be different. Some may have heartwoods, some may be more than one piece... It will be even more different if the amount of contact the heel has with the neck pocket changes.<br>  <br>  A pro to multipiece necks is that it tends to resist twisting and warping more than a single piece.<br>  <br>  Another thing it will change is the tuning required. If it has a straight string pull from the bridge to the tuning heads, tuning will be required less often, in my experience. Ymmv. Strings trees also make bending behind the nut more difficult.|`|aw2xkdSbaa	The head not so much, but yes, absolutely, different woods for your neck and fretboard color your tone. The "big 3" for fretboards are maple, ebony and rosewood. Maple gives you a brighter tone/sound, ebony is warm with a brighter attack and rosewood is a nice warm tone.  The woods used in the neck are important too for sustain and tone. The thicker and denser the wood, the better the tone. Most don't like thicker necks, but it does give a better tone. Most shredder guitars have thinner necks for ease of access.|`|nDcSY8UQaa	ever heard of teats on a butterfly? putting a Gretsch neck on your Squire wont make a Rickenbaker.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	it changes the way you play<br>  for example<br>  Ibanez Wizard II necks are known for it's skinniness and speed, while the Les Paul necks are really big and heavy<br>  you'll have to adjust your style of playing a little if you do change the neck

But you use some trite language and dialogue.  And the plot is overdone.  I think it might flow better if you write in third person.  I think it's great that you are writing, and I don't think you should stop, but make it intriguing, make it fresh and new.  <br>  <br>  I don't want to read the first few lines and think, "oh hey...they made a movie just like this called Clueless..and another one called Mean Girls.."<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|KLTktDV1aa	It sound like a very good story can u send me the rest plz??|`|W3nCHPUtaa	I like the description of the characters and i think that it could turn into something really good but you have to make it unique from all the other mean girl stories out there something that really grabs the reader because this is kinda just like a lot of other stories sorry its pretty clever and i think teenagers will like it  i just read the additional info and ok i hope i helped good job so far

VM9Vsf9naa	The goal in life is not as important as the inward journey we take through life. Well, put in other words, any goal of outside success is an illusion unless you have discovered your inner self, which is what gives your existence meaning, true? The world's praise may seem worth capturing but in the end your own worthiness is how you view your growth as a human being, not as a big moneymaker or whatever else.<br>  <br>  Learn to be a kinder person, help to bring gladness to other people's lives, see where you can contribute instead of taking. That's the ticket!<br>  <br>  ;- )|`|2qOOSdFRaa	do you really think you've tried everything? If so, then I'd suggest you try the untrodden path. Take a new way, a unique way in your life.

In my experience I found that if I base my idea of success strictly on making money and material gain, I will never feel satisfied.<br>  <br>  I love this exerpt from one of the Carlos Castenada books regarding the Shaman Don Juan. He puts it this way:<br>  <br>  From Carlos Castaneda: "Don Juan's Teaching"<br>  <br>  Don Juan said:<br>  <br>  Anything is one of a million paths. Therefore you must always keep in mind that a path is only a path; if you feel you should not follow it, you must not stay with it under any conditions. <br>  <br>  To have such clarity you must lead a disciplined life. Only then will you know that any path is only a path, and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you to do. But your decision to keep on the path or to leave it must be free of fear or ambition.<br>  <br>  I warn you. Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary. Then ask yourself, and yourself alone, one question. This question is one that only a very old man asks. <br>  <br>  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young, and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it. Now I do understand it. I will tell you what it is: Does this path have a heart? <br>  <br>  All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. They are paths going through the bush, or into the bush. In my own life I could say I have traversed long, long paths, but Iam not anywhere. My benefactor's question has meaning now. Does this path have a<br>  heart? If it does, the path is good; if it does not, it is of no use.<br>  <br>  Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart the other does not. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens you.<br>  <br>  The trouble is nobody asks the question; and when a man finally realizes that he has taken a path without a heart, the path is ready to kill him. At that point very few men can stop to deliberate, and leave the path.<br>  <br>  A path without a heart is never enjoyable. You have to work hard even to take it. On the other hand, a path with heart is easy; it does not make you work at liking it.<br>  <br>  For me there is only the traveling on paths that have a heart, or on any path that may have heart. There I travel... and the only worthwhile challenge is to traverse its full length.<br>  <br>  And there I travel looking, looking, breathlessly.|`|6UyDKkj9aa	try school, business like experience, specially when it's a bachelor degree|`|RD7A4NAtaa	Every morning you wake up is another success in your life.<br>  <br>  Every breath you take is another success in your life.<br>  <br>  Every time you make someone smile is another success in your life.<br>  <br>  You only stop succeeding when you stop trying!|`|AA11089617	You climb it again! you will have to fall many times and remember the higher you are the more it will hurt. it gets easier by time; learn to like to live in a challenging world!|`|kTc3bfrRaa	try   the  trampoline  trick!|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...don't stop, correct yourself and move on...

KHSOVxViaa	The Incas were a people living in the highlands of the central Andes in South America.  They started out as a relatively small tribe, but steadily managed to conquer and absorb neighbouring tribes, eventually carving out a large empire stretching from Ecuador to central Chile.<br>  <br>  The empire was connected by a network of roads and administrative centres, often perched high in the mountains.  They were still expanding when a devastating civil war occurred.  In the aftermath of this, the much weakened Inca state was conquered by the Spanish after a protracted campaign.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A thousand miles away in the forested highlands and limestone plateau of Central America's Yucatan region, the Maya were (and still are) and ethnic group.  They evolved a civilisation consisting of a plethora of city states; sometimes in groups and alliances, sometimes independent, but never forming a cohesive empire.<br>  <br>  The early major centres were in the southern highlands and valleys of Guatemala and Honduras, but the fashion for city building spread Northwards into the Yucatan plateau.  The southern cities suffered some sort of collapse, being largely abandoned in a short period, though the northern cities continued to flourish before finally declining prior to the Spanish conquest.|`|c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	The Mayans use Mayo and The Incas use ink-Didn't you know that ? :-)<br>  <br>  (=)+++++++++++++++++++(=)  <<<<<<<<Two eltrical Sockets with a wire connecting the two!!|`|t1NTGuIZaa	a thousand miles
kfWi9ZkEaa	Comes as a shock when you can't trust the person you love.  You end up not loving them.  I think trust is a therefore a foundation of love.<br>  <br>  They do not, however, go hand in hand at all. One trusts prima facie those one loves unless previously burned, in which case one does not necessarily.  Trust has to do essentially with naivete when love is in a pre-proof phase, and experience of that person once it has been established that the lovee is trustworthy.<br>  <br>  They live in the same street, not the same house.

You love them IF they love you.<br>  <br>  How do you know they Love you?  Is it because they told you they did?

Vdout6sVaa	Money is not the problem. Greed is. <br>  So, what is the solution to greed? Trust.<br>  Trust that there is enough for everyone to go around now and forever..if we don't stop the flow....<br>   A good, "non greedy" economy is one that perpetuates itself.<br>  Thing is with greed (and all fears- greed being the fear of not having enough) is that it is a self fulfilling fear. If I stockpile something, for simplicity let's say apples, because I fear that one day there won't be enough, I garantee that one day there will not be enough apples. There won't be apples to go to seed in order to produce more apples. If all the money is put in gold plated toilets and bedposts of the greedy, opulent rich people, one day there won't enough in circulation to create ongoing, self perpetuating prosperity. In such a case, to keep the illusion of prosperity going, the greedy start overvaluing what is left, investing in "futures", creating false values etc...you know the rest. Eventually, the bubble bursts. POP! Goes the weasel!!|`|AA11818873	"TRUST" is the only solution. Whichever way we look at it.<br>  All other solutions are complexly manipulated forms of this trust (we even award degrees, certificates for the successful manipulations!).<br>  Remember, there was a time when word of mouth was trusted. And people used to lay down their lives to uphold the word of promise. Now we have loopholes in law, contract, banking, hedging, sub-prime crises-ridden-bailouts even! Somehow, people are scared to even trust themselves, that is why there is a sort of 'helpless' savings even. Scared to spend! We look at that inanimate currency helplessly, and 'try' to look at it as a problem! Money is a problem only when it reaches into our head! It is good to have lots of it in our wallets, pockets, credit/debit cards etc.|`|9545873f9308ee4850c589409030bda6aa	I agree with ME, when she says that the real problem is selfishness, but is easier talk about the problem to talk about solutions to it. I believe that people need to see around them and look to another people that don′t have job, school, health service. The world is on Crisis, but before it, people have money to buy and to save. I′d like to say that governement are spending money to save many companys that is broking, but this money from USA, Europe and Asia could be used to end hangry problem of world, but know they need the money to give food for who always have food in your home.

I think it's people.  In some cultures money isn't as much as an issue, relatively.  Some cultures may stress expressing yourself or helping others for the greater good.  I don't think this is a superior type of culture; it's one that's developed a certain way and has its own strengths and weaknesses.  You just notice the things wrong the type of culture you're a part of and how money effects the people around you, which you see as bad.  Maybe as you develop (maybe other people develop around you; maybe you develop in your abilities to change your environment, your thoughts, your views of how the world works, the commonality of people), money might mean something different to you.|`|0MunIx8raa	Get rid of money all together and go back to trading handmade blankets and food for the goods we need.

za9b8cHKaa	If Twilight is now an officially signed book in schools, then shame on the education department. Kids have the right to choose whatever they like to read outside of school, but English classes are one of the few places where students will ever be exposed to some of the greatest works of English Literature. <br>  <br>  Personally though, I think they put 'it's for an assignment' in the question to make their query sound more credible. Or possibly the teacher has allowed them to choose a book for independent study.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Okay, Don't Judge a Book ... I'll be thoroughly looking forward to seeing Breaking Dawn win the Booker Prize if it is such a great piece of Literature. The book may be entertaining, but the fact remains is poorly written with many, many grammatical errors. By assigning it in schools, the teachers are condoning those errors and allowing students to think that such work is worthy of literary merit. Harry Potter on the other hand, was well written, free of errors and had a lot of material that students could analyse.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	I think all the girls on here who ask for book report help just picked Twilight for their book report. My English teacher told my class after we got out first book reports of the year back that Twilight was not allowed as a book report option anymore because so many people had picked it as their book. Twilight doesn't have enough literary quality to become an assigned reading book.|`|e9DR6N1Paa	I've heard of one teacher telling her students they should read it, which seems rather odd considering the book is not the best for trying to teach students. Repeated descriptions, and ect. exspecially if the kids are young! Teenage pregnancy?! I don't think so!|`|HRRfZDQqaa	even though i like the series, i think it's wayyyyy too low on a reading level to actually assign for an essay or whatever assignment..<br>  personally, that whole series, has taken kids away from reading and loving books that are CLASSICS.|`|D20ue82Iaa	Yes.  Stephanie Meyer, whether people want to accept it or not, is a great and accredited author, so a lot of teachers have started to incorporate Twilight into their assignments.  Most people love it, so I don't get what the big uproar is about...it gets most kids to READ, which I don't see the harm in.  The books, aside from being popular to say the least, also have a lot of underlying themes such as abstinence on a variety of levels and instances (he wants to kill her, but doesn't, they wait until marriage to have sex, etc.), and is a classic love story of "star-crossed lovers"...just because vampires are thrown into the mix doesn't mean it's bad literature as a lot of people tend to think.  The book was written for ENTERTAINMENT purposes and it does just that for most people.  <br>  <br>  Also.  University of Kentucky has a Harry Potter course.  No joke.  Considering how Harry Potter is targeted toward intermediate school kids and is taught as a college-level course...I don't think that Twilight being assigned to its target age group (high school students) is that bad of a thing.|`|eTS2nd70aa	Unfortunately, yes.

The novel introduces an alien race, called Souls, who take over Earth and its inhabitants because they believe humans to be too violent. The book describes one soul's predicament when her host body refuses to cooperate with her takeover. The Host was released on May 6, 2008with an initial print run of 750,000 copies. However, an <br>  international version of the novel was released on April 2, 2008 in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, and Hong Kong by the UK publishing division. The prologue and the fourth chapter of the book can be found on Meyer's official website.<br>  <br>  The Host was named one of the 'Best Books of May' by Amazon.com, and also received praise about its ending saying, "Readers... will gleefully note that the story's end leaves the door open for a sequel--or another series."<br>  <br>  True to Meyer's other books, The Host includes a poem at the beginning of the novel. The poem is titled Question, by May Swenson, and ties into the idea of the mind's reliance on the existence of the body, just as Melanie experiences when inhabited by Wanderer.|`|AF8mfXQZaa	No. I haven't read it but I think Flowers of Algernon is better (i'm publicising this for Daniel Keyes).

I might have said so upon countless occasions, as for instance yesterday evening when I said, ‘I am grateful to Almighty God for life, and for the many good things that I have’. I am however not sure if my words alone could serve the purpose. I might have just picked it up from somewhere, form other people saying the similar things, and preaching. I might even have tried to secure my momentary sense of happiness by allowing myself to lodge myself into a sense of gratefulness towards someone I believe is the greatest and the mightiest in life, than everything. <br>  <br>  I could allow myself to believe that there are things that we do merely by habit, a mindless routines, for convenience or for security, i.e. without really knowing the true meaning and significance of the matters of our beliefs.<br>  <br>  I really do not think that the act of tanking God is an act bound in certain moments in time, or conclusive of certain of our proceedings in our lives, as for instance, only when we feel happy, or after we have achieved something, we ascribe our success to God. If so then why did we not thank Him at every beginning, in each middle, that if we were to come to thank Him eventually, then why did we not do so through out, for each moment?<br>  <br>  I believe that gratefulness is not merely an act bound in time, as tied to certain moments of happiness, or certain conditions in our lives. I think gratitude in its true sense is a constant state of mind, a way of life for the faithful that we might, every now and then, become aware of and express in words. I believe the proper way to thank Almighty God, if we believe in Him is to live faithful throughout, with every moment of our life filled with a sense of gratitude.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Last night, when I'd consumed 1/4 of a bottle of gin with the girls, had a couple of tokes on some remarkable female seedless, and I was sitting there hoping I wouldn't blow chunks.<br>  <br>  I didn't.

But you see, God 'n' me, we have our own personal relationship going:  or is it that I have my own personal God?  But my God has a sense of humour.

1jMwr6E0aa	It is easily the best graphic novel of all time. Certainly the most highly decorated. If you want to see the movie first (which is always inferior to the book with the exception of the Bourne series) then be my guest. My best friend told me to read it, if nothing for just the fact that I could share his disappointment when the film came out. Also there is a substory in watchmen "Tales of the Black Freighter" which is just as compelling as the graphic novel. There will be none of that in the movie, but that is being released as a separate DVD. It is a wonderful, thought provoking read. If you mind thinking just see the movie ;-)|`|OUtcHIm0aa	Read it you old pfffffttttt|`|mTSOJKlyaa	yes i would if i were you, it wouldn't help you understand the movie<br>  <br>  ive heard at the beginning they give like a opening origins sequence quickly telling the background, which some have said is hard to understand because of its fast pace<br>  <br>  or even better if you just read a plot summary of the book, which sounds kind of like ruining it, but its shorter then reading the whole graphic novel, you understand the general idea of what is goin on so when you watch the movie your not completely lost but the movie still will go a little deeper<br>  <br>  hope that helps at all :)|`|AA10065812	???<br>  It's never a good idea to read the novel before watching the movie based on it.

uth8Ztbdaa	Class prejudice is the same thing as social prejudice. How about gender prejudice? All male jury?<br>  <br>  You could use quotes that describe the setting, not just those that are spoken by the characters. <br>  <br>  Pay close attention to the settings in which their seems to be an abundance of males and no females. You can briefly discuss how this was a reflection of the perception of women during that specific time period.|`|SQkdULOlaa	What about class prejudice? think about how the less educated characters were portrayed and how the more educated ones (e.g. Atticus) could be so respected and also could do great things such as go to court and fight for justice.|`|2XENlkJSaa	Scholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex "than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash' ... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation."[51] Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia. Along with Scout and Jem, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community.

First off, sunlight burns, kills, or severely weakens them, not make them sparkle. If a Vampire were to sparkle that would make him, like The Pirate Alien said, a faerie. Vampires are not loving creatures, they are evil creatures who kill and feed off of humans, and do not drink animal blood? Wtf is that?! Ok Miss Meyer you are a God damn idiot. Truthfully, the Twilight Vampires are the exact opposite of real Vampires, and don't hand me that bullshit of, "oh Twilight is the newer and better Vampires." No there not there pathetic. Here's a scenario, I love KFC, does that mean i'm going to go and make love to my fried chicken? No that's what Twilight is implying, Vampires can't love humans, you don't love your food!<br>  <br>  Off of my little rant, now to break down both characters. <br>  <br>  Count Dracula:<br>  He has the strength of 20+ men, he can teleport, has super human speed, he is a necromancer, which means he can summon and commune with the dead, he is immune to conventional means of attack because he is undead, he can defy gravity to a certain extent, making  gliding, slightly flying and climbing any form of wall or ceiling possible, he has powerful hypnotic and mind control, which is much better than Mr. Edward, he can control and command nocturnal animals such as wolves and rats, he can also manipulate the weather, usually creating mists to hide his presence, among all those traits he can also shape shift into any creature of being, and that does mean werewolves. Among other ability's that i can't think of. The only ways to kill him are to decapitate him while stabbing him in the heart or shooting him with a sacred bullet and decapitating him at the same time. His only weakness is some holy items, garlic, and not having fresh blood which for him is not hard to obtain. <br>  <br>  Now for Edward Cullen:<br>  He possesses superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and agility. That seems about it. Oh wait he can sparkle! Yea no. <br>  <br>  Dracula would laugh while killing sparkle boy. Just look at all the facts Count Dracula is the King for a reason. <br>  <br>  Twilight fans really read this, all of it, maybe you will pick up Dracula and read some real literature if your tiny brains can handle it.|`|8DwxwhStaa	Dracula in addition to unearthly strength and swiftness can become mist, but Edward is more durable, a bowie knife cut off Dracula's head.  It would be a contest between who could tear the other to pieces first, Dracula getting through Edward's stone like skin or Edward while the Count is not mist.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	<a href="http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww308/TheAntiTwilightMovement/1230909741543.png" rel="nofollow">http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww308...</a><br>  <br>  This picture says it all.|`|H9v5l1Wmaa	Yeah I like Twilight but Dracula could whoop him.<br>  Hah I'm probably the only guy that answered lol<br>  eh guess not, but I liked the question.|`|AhzwAMxYaa	The Count from Sesame Street.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The Count would, of course, just keep on counting until Edward died of boredom.

WTF?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but the fact that the HORRIBLE OH NO THING about Edward was that he sparkles in the sun was freaking ridiculous. <br>  <br>  He's barely a vampire.

UXuGCgo3aa	It needs some editing.<br>  <br>  As a child, I used to wonder what dying would feel like. In my mind, when you died you inherited special wings. Those wings would sweep you across skies, pristine rivers. You breathed fresh air and flowers. I would spend my time in eternity laughing, eating the most beautiful food and clicking my fingers to welcome the magic. <br>  When I closed my eyes I was there. Mostly, I would be dressed in white. I would share my experience with my friends and they would join me in that place.<br>  It hit me suddenly when I was laying on the hospital bed. I was going to die. Excitement swelled inside of me at the thought of it. I knew I would feel the sun's glow on my skin; I would taste the rain drops. The room became silent as each voice moved to a distance. When I closed my eyes, I hurriedly tried to find the mountaintop I had always seen, only to be greeted by walls.|`|KLTktDV1aa	dude i want to read more! plz send me the rest asap!!!!!|`|kZPGTMA5aa	this is amazing. definitely continue with it! post more maybe? :)|`|8af66e0f5870ddabd93a1b53a6c77a62aa	Awesome I want to read more!

Or maybe "Your Daddy's Son" from Ragtime. And lastly, "I don't know how to love him" from Jesus Christ Superstar. I'm not sure of your vocal range so I'm not sure what will work for you. The first two fit a soprano range. But i believe the latter will fit both soprano and alto range. Listen to them on youtube if you can. Good luck!

But the United States (1776) started the modern trend among former colonies for independence, which continues up until today, I think. <br>  <br>  Others were Haiti from France, in the early 1800's, Mexico from Spain in the 1800's (sorry I don't know years, you'll have to look it up) Most of South America, from Spain or Portugal;  Many different African countries in the late 20th century from Britain, France, Portugal or other countries; India from Britain in 1947, followed by West Pakistan and East Pakistan breaking off from India a short time later (today Pakistan and Bangladesh); parts of China were under British rule until the early 1900's.

y8bFwXZEaa	Aristotle defined this with the word "qua." For example, that form of government which is best is best for man "qua man." This means you must first define the nature of man before you can know what form of government is best for him.<br>  <br>  What is the best food for a horse? Define "horse nutrition qua horse." In other words, we know we can't feed cheese and meat to a horse, but how do we know this? Men observe horse health and behavior based on what they've had to eat. Sometimes what they eat is under accidental circumstances. During Napolean's campaign against Russia, many of his men AND horses died from lack of salt in their diets.

No, that was an example.  okay, charging on through.<br>  <br>  You work your butt off, identifying those needs of an environment etc.<br>  <br>  You then see which form of government provides for those needs.<br>  <br>  you then deem this to be the 'best' within the terms of your understanding of those needs.<br>  <br>  it's all terrifyingly subjective.  It's dreadful.  <br>  <br>  I like aristotle's best: where you die, go to heaven and see perfection, get born and 'remember' this perfection, holding it in your head as an ideal - or was that plato?

shVgCizBaa	Singapore<br>      Independence <br>   -  Founding 29 January 1819[1]  <br>   -  Merger with Malaysia 16 September 1963  <br>   -  Separation from Malaysia 9 August 1965  <br>   Singapore   officially the Republic of Singapore, is an island microstate located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It lies 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator, south of the Malaysian state of Johor and north of Indonesia's Riau Islands. At 707.1 km2 (273.0 sq mi),[4] Singapore is one of four remaining true city-states in the world. It is the smallest nation in Southeast Asia.<br>  <br>  Before European settlement, the island now known as Singapore was the site of a Malay fishing village at the mouth of the Singapore River. Several hundred indigenous Orang Laut people also lived along the nearby coast, rivers and on smaller islands. In 1819 the British East India Company, led by Sir Stamford Raffles, established a trading post on the island, which was used as a port along the spice route.[5] Singapore would become one of the most important commercial and military centres of the British Empire, and the hub of British power in Southeast Asia. The city was occupied by the Japanese during World War II, which Winston Churchill called "Britain's greatest defeat".[6] Singapore reverted to British rule immediately after the war, in 1945. Eighteen years later (1963) the city, having achieved independence from Britain, merged with Malaya, Sabah, and Sarawak to form Malaysia. However, less than two years later it seceded from the federation and became an independent republic on 9 August 1965. Singapore joined the United Nations on 21 September that same year. It is also a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.<br>  <br>  Since independence, Singapore's standard of living has risen dramatically from Third World status to First World standards, bettering even those of most western nations[7]. Foreign direct investment and a state-led drive to industrialisation based on plans drawn up by the Dutch economist Albert Winsemius have created a modern economy focused on industry, education and urban planning.[8] Singapore is the 5th wealthiest country in the world in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita.[9] This small nation has foreign exchange reserves of more than US$177 billion.[10]<br>  <br>  The population of Singapore is approximately 4.84 million.[2] Singapore is highly cosmopolitan and diverse with Chinese people forming an ethnic majority with large populations of Malay, Indian and other people. English, Malay, Tamil, and Chinese are the official languages.[11]<br>  <br>  The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore established the nation's political system as a representative democracy, while the country is recognised as a parliamentary republic.[12] The People's Action Party (PAP) dominates the political process and has won control of Parliament in every election since self-government in 1959.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore</a>

Only the Brandenberg area, the state around Berlin, remains in Germany today.

afcd7d949de4a5073f2fc8e97bc1bdcfaa	Realization. After the numerous defeats, surrounded by Grants army, and attrition by Grant's army, and, knowing he couldn't escape without certain defeat and starvation, Lee did the only sensible thing. And Grant was magnanimous in his terms, which influenced Lee.  Lee realized that to continue fighting would be counter-productive. Also, there was a strong movement by other Confederate Generals to take the battle to guerrilla fighting, and with that would prolong the South's agony.  Lee was against those tactics, and surrender would go against that ideal.  Lee also trusted Grant, and knew there would be no retaliation against his troops if he accepted the terms of surrender.<br>  <br>  For an hour-by-hour account of the surrender, read Jay Winik's spellbinding book "APRIL 1865".<br>  <br>  UPDATE - Who is the idiot that is giving these previous answers, and mine,  negative ratings.

nynfdK4baa	you can learn any instrument at any age if you aren't physically impaired that would prevent the movements associated with that particular instrument. as for becoming proficient in it, depends on you as there are so many factors to the equation which includes dedication, and amount of interest, though biologically speaking, it would have been more advantageous to learn at a really young age because the muscle memory involved in instrumental performance comes easier, but you are 18, you still have time, around your 20's is when your brain reduces the amount of neuron connections and thus limiting your learning capabilities thus inhibiting overall efficiency in learning anything new, so it is advisable to start learning now, don't let anybody discourage you from learning an instrument, especially if they themselves don't play instruments, as the prejudices of such people are often unfounded and illogical|`|HOqTE23Uaa	Lol there is no limit at which you can learn to play an instrument.|`|n12caetcaa	I'm not even 15 yet and I learned how to play drums about 7 years ago. it doesn't matter how old you are and I still play mine, there fun and I love making the noise.|`|PcBnd3ataa	yeah you can learn at any age. dont let anyone tell you you cant do it. jst be patient and practice|`|oweQc1OBaa	yes it is true. i know some people who learned it older than that. <br>  <br>  if the problem is the money, i would get maybe drum pads to practice on. look for lessons online like on youtube or www.expertvillage.com <br>  www.craigslist.com for a used set<br>  if its the noise that's the problem, still get drums pads to put on your drums, sound proof your room, or get electronic drum set.<br>  if you love it so much try it! its really fun, even though i know only a few beats. good luck!|`|q34vCB3Qaa	i started playing drums/percussion back in 5th grade in school band|`|Jmvk4Udgaa	you can learn to play any instrument at any time<br>  you just have to believe that you can do it and have to love what you are doing<br>  i learned how to play the guitar (basic chords) in just about a month and it was because i loved it and i felt great passion for it <br>  <br>  good luck :]|`|0AUPrCMZaa	our society is so brainwashed into thinking when you get older you turn into a mindless moron.  no wonder when people retire they fall over and die.<br>  <br>  you can learn anything at anytime ;)|`|Zb0deAf4aa	You can learn to play an instrument at any time.|`|0gCEVaEfaa	psh yea as long as you set your heart to it and practice everyday and keep on trying your best you could be one of the best drummers

AA11826109	Don't listen to the guy that said everyone hates the bass. He couldn't be any further than the truth. The fact is, in spite of how many similarities between the instruments, they're totally different. The guitar is meant to be kind of like the back up vocal of the song. It leads you through all of the phrases and gives you something to follow along with during the chorus. <br>  <br>  The bass on the other hand, is meant to give the guitar structure and add more tone to the sound. Think of the two instruments like a person. Would you rather be the skin, hair and facial features or do you want to be the organs, spine and bones? <br>  <br>  But in some cases, it's the exact opposite. Take a guy like Victor Wooten who is a solo bassist. Every song of his, the bass is the main attraction. It really depends on how you want to use which ever instrument you choose. <br>  <br>  I personally am a guitarist of about 13 years. During that time, I have also picked up a bass here and there and personally, I prefer playing guitar. I know plenty of bassists who say playing guitar is garbage and the bass is a lot more fun. Bottom line is you really just need to try them both and and figure out which one you like. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LtIv573Daa	the bass guitar is absolutely boring compared to standard 6-string.

Bass guitars are always needed cause there isn't a lot *if i got this right* I play the viola and everyone plays the violin.

And guitarists are dime a dozen, but there aren't that many good bassists, so you'll never have trouble finding a band if you're a bassist.  I also think it's better to learn bass before playing guitar, since most people who play guitar assume they're able to play bass, but wind up treating the bass like it's a four-stringed guitar.  Since bass is part of the rhythm section, it's more about finding a groove with the bass drum and settling into it, which is quite fun.  So if you learn bass first, you'll have a better understanding of the bass's role in a band.  Plus, you can always learn guitar later.  Follow your instincts!  If you're leaning toward bass, you'll probably make a great bassist.  Good luck!|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Music is the voice of God so Pray about it . cheerio .|`|0AUPrCMZaa	do you want to play lead or do you want to play what is equivalent to drums in the guitar world?<br>  <br>  regular guitar - the front man.<br>  <br>  bass guitar - the backbone and timing of the entire song.<br>  <br>  the bassist for primus kicks major *** :p|`|NLwfMSJWaa	depends on what you want to play<br>  if you want to play the bass, then you should play it<br>  dont play something that you dont want to play|`|Zb0deAf4aa	guitar|`|q34vCB3Qaa	electric

The North never called the  CSS Virginia as the Virginia but called it the Merrimac or Merrimack (both spellings were used), as to recognize the Virginia as the CSS Virginia  would imply recognition of the Confederacy).|`|AA11758925	it was during lincolns term, neither won but fought for hours, the first answer is right i believe. one ship had multiple cannons that aimed in one direction while the other had 2 cannons that revolved to aim at the ship.

Todays battleships design are based off that invention, with a revolving gun/cannon|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	It was the Monitor and the Virginia (formerly the Merrimac.) It was a draw. This was the first ship-to-ship duel between ironclads.<br>  <br>  Oddly enough, ironclads weren't invented because someone thought to put armour on a warship. Instead, during the Crimean War, the British put cannons on armoured barges.

J4OxZZAtaa	Major General George G. Mead was General of the Army of the Potomac from June 28, 1863 – June 28, 1865 when he replaced Major General Joseph Hooker.. Mead was the General during Lee's Surrender at Appomattox.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	To add to the answer you already received.<br>  <br>  Meade was abruptly given command just before Gettysburg. He didn't want it based on the terrible track record of the former commanders. When Gettysburg began General Reynolds set up on the high ground South of the city. That set the Union victory.Meade and the Army of the Potomac fought a conservative battle. They dug in and stayed, making the Confederates come to them. Once the battle was over Meade received criticism for not pursuing Lee. However, it's likely that the Federal's were too exhausted to have pursued and won another battle.<br>  <br>  Meade stayed in command until the end of the war. Grant often overshadows Meade as he traveled with the Army of the Potomac.<br>  <br>  One reason that Meade was selected was he wasn't eligible to be President.

I have never used a fish-eye lens on mine though. <br>  <br>  There are some details that you are not giving though. First of all, you say you took the film to Wal Mart 1 hour processing. I know of NO Wal Mart that processes 120 film, so I have to assume you are using 35mm film in your camera. So... what camera are you using? Is it designed to use 35mm film or are you trying to use 35mm film in a camera designed to use 120 film? I know there are conversion "kits" that allow the use of 35mm, but I have not used one. It could be there is a problem with trying to use the 35mm film. You may be damaging the film in camera before it is even processed. <br>  <br>  The scratches and red line could be a problem with the Wal Mart processing machine. I suggest you NOT use them to develop your film. <br>  <br>  I suggest you use 120 ISO 400 Ilford XP2 film. I have always found this to be a good match for the lomo camera. You can still use Wal Mart for processing, but you will NOT be using the on site machine. Use the send out mailers and clearly write on the mailer... SEND OUT ONLY. 120 B/W FILM. The film will go to a lab that will be much more professional than the local Wally World machine operators.<br>  <br>  Another thing. How are you getting these shots into digital format? I know they are being scanned, but are YOU doing it or having it done at Wal Mart at time of processing? I had an older Epson scanner that always put at least one, and usually two,deep black streaks across every negative I scanned on it. The scanning process may be a source of some of the problem.<br>  <br>  As you can see, there are many variables here and it is hard to say exactly what could be causing the problem.<br>  <br>  When asking a question such as this, always give DETAILS. Such as the exact camera you are using, the EXACT film you are using, and how the negatives are being scanned.

VYCLwKwNaa	Alaskan Natives noticed natural oils seeps a long time ago. <br>  The Russians saw the oil seeps in the 17-1800's, but didn't develop them.<br>   According to the following web site, "The first oil claims in Alaska were filed in the 1890s, on the Iniskin Peninsula on the west shore of Cook Inlet, due west of Homer. In 1898 the first Alaska wells were drilled there, striking small amounts of oil, but also striking seawater.

VvajuBL9aa	For me personally, studying ancient mythology lead me to find the religion that was right for me.....I went to parochial grade school, and in 6th grade we studied the Greek gods... being a bright person, it struck me even at this young age that the stories I was being taught about "GOD" in my Christian religion classes were actually quite a bit like the Greek/Roman god myths/had the same functions in society... this actually started me on the road to atheism, despite attending 12 years of parochial school, and being confirmed in the 5th grade...in other words, studying ancient myths helped me to recognize modern myths that were crippling me.....although it took me until college to formally reject the religious beliefs of my youth...|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	Yes.

Greek mythology can be very interesting and a nice thing to read about.  Just don't let others make the choice for you... what is important to some isn't important for others. So think to yourself "Do I think its important?" and just take it from there. Good luck!|`|oyFlcOOWaa	yes, because it helps in philosophy, its kind weird but still

RxO3w4neaa	Louis XVI was the man who is believed to have said "I am the state!" if I am not mistaken. Considering he was a royal absolutist, any current dictator could be considered analogous to him. For example, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was until very recently the absolute power of his nation. Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, Kim Jong-il of North Korea, and Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya are all good examples of rulers who wield absolute power.<br>  <br>  In addition, Saudi Arabia's king Abdullah is one of the few absolute monarchs of contemporary society. <br>  <br>  Hoped this helped, and good luck with your project!|`|yJXlvFfeaa	well he was beloved at first, known for his conservatism and indecisiveness and then beheaded.

zN6CJ3tzaa	My best guess is that the photographer chose a certain light/time of day or did their own lighting behind the window/door. I believe that is why the silhouette is more lit -- picking up greater light -- and there is so little light on the rest of the body.<br>  <br>  As for editing the image in Photoshop, my best guess would be that they toyed with the brightness/contrast, as well as color adjustment. If certain areas were hit more, they probably used the wand tool to highlight and adjust just those areas to get the contrast and/or color just the way they wanted it.

Many churches used their doors as community bulletin boards. This is widely viewed as the start of the Reformation.<br>  <br>  Although his translation of the Bible and his criticisms of the Roman Catholic doctrines sparked needed reforms, Luther held strongly anti-Semitic views, seemingly at odds with his pious fervor.
mnIeK8q6aa	The naval problem was: close by or far away?<br>  Close by: short range cannons & boarding. The Spanish relied on this tactic.Big ships, short range artillery, lots of soldier for boarding.<br>  Far away: long range cannons. Blow the enemy to smithereens before he can board. The English relied on this tactic. Smaller ships, long range artillery, highly maneuverable, few soldiers.<br>  <br>  Too optimistic planning spoiled a lot. There weren't enough barrels to store food. The (Spanish) cannonballs were of inferior quality. Teaming up with the army in Flanders (an essential part of the operation) was impossible. <br>  <br>  It almost worked for the Spanish. But Medina Sidonia was an excellent administrator (that is why he got the job) but not a good fleet commander. He knew it himself. It wasn't his fault the operation failed, but King Phillips II. Against all advice he pushed it through.|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	The Spanish were more of a shoot once and then start hand-to-hand fight.  The English knew this.<br>  <br>  With its superior maneuverability, the English fleet provoked Spanish fire while staying out of range. The English then closed, firing repeated and damaging broadsides into the enemy ships. This also enabled them to maintain a position to windward so that the heeling Armada hulls were exposed to damage below the water line.|`|5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	Fascinating story. The intended commander died before the Armada set sail from Spain. Medina-Sedonia was not an experienced sea captain. Spanish ships were less maneuverable that the English ships. Spanish artillery was heavier, but had shorter range, and Spanish seamen did not reload rapidly. British ships stayed out of range, peppering the foe with smaller caliber shot. <br>  <br>  After the first skirmishes, the Spanish fleet sought refuge in Gravelines where the British scattered them with fireships. This also prevented the Spanish from meeting up with their land army that they intended to ship across the English channel. Then a series of storms scattered them so they could not regroup, and they sailed north, then west around Ireland. Many ships crashed along Irish shores.

The whole sun thing is just a fairy tale made up to help the humans feel safe. <br>  <br>  4) The sun could make them mortal during the day meaning they cannot use any of their powers<br>  <br>  5) They sunlight could make them appear even more grotesque and corpse like. Their skin could be see though when exposed to light. ( hey it's a little better than sparkling)<br>  <br>  <br>  all vampire books talk about different things because each author has their own spin on things. <br>  My suggestion as someone who also enjoys writing the vampire genera is to look up bits and pieces of vampire folklore and see what you can work with. Also know your history in regards to your characters.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	When you make your vampires make sure they stick close to most of the well know legends or else it will be difficult to think of them as vampires. Or if you want to be really creative then you can make up an entirely new species. With a new species then you can do whatever you like and nobody can criticize your creatures for not being true to the legends because you will have made them yourself. Read Bram Stoker's Dracula to get a feel of true vampires, and go off of those. Or you could use this book to research legends <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vampire-Book-Encyclopedia-Undead/dp/157859071X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236222307&sr=1-1." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Vampire-Book-Encyc...</a>|`|wKKxUNzyaa	Hi,<br>  Well seeing as its your story you can create your own vampire rules. Stephenie Meyer's vampires could go out in the sun but were obviously non-human and Scott Westerfelds 'vampires' in some cases could, but in others couldn't due to the anathema. It would depend what sort of vampire you'd like to write about. <br>  <br>  The main thing I will tell you is create a world in which you see the vampires as the way you want them to be seen by others. So if you would like crazy, dark-dwelling vampires perhaps give them either a fear or hatred of the sun. Or if you wish to create a more positive type vampire who lives peacfully amoung the humans pehaps give them the ability to walk out in the day. Create something unique and different from the other worlds of vampires.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you and good luck!|`|e1980e68b92e21f95ece91acc26ad696aa	They are YOUR vampires.  You can make them whatever you want.<br>  <br>  In Colonial America, vampires were thought to be people who had died of disease.  They would come back to life and attack only family members.

Make the vampires YOURS as well.|`|FaBx9W4Faa	My friend is also doing one on vampires but it sounds so much like the Twilight series.

1jMwr6E0aa	Lady Macbeth is not what I imagine a good wife being. She convinces Macbeth to murder Duncan with a vivid analogy of killing her own baby while nursing and by insulting Macbeth’s manhood. Not exactly Susie homemaker. Do you mean traitor or trader as in merchant? If we're talking traitor then I would say Lady Macbeth. Once she starts Macbeth on this violent rampage he doesn't stop. He becomes king and yet he is more paranoid and bloodthirsty than ever before. She even tells him to let it go and enjoy being king. She created a monster.

Tolkien, originally told in 1925. It deals with the adventures of a young dog, Rover. In the story, an irritable wizard turns Rover into a toy, and Rover goes to the moon and under the sea in order to find the wizard again to turn him back into a normal-sized dog. The author wrote Roverandom for his son Michael Tolkien to amuse him upon the loss of his favorite toy — a little lead dog. The work is in tone a children's story, but contains many allusions and references in the manner of "Farmer Giles of Ham".|`|hqaSMGD7aa	It doesn't sound familiar, but perhaps, if you're willing to, hunt around in a library?

Also, if you are going to work as anything dealing in writing then you can show them that you have proof "see, i published this when I was 13." there are not many opportunities when someone tells you to publish your work.

qlJ0anfAaa	I like the last style the best.<br>  The first two, the strands are too thick at the ends for my liking.<br>  For hair, I usually draw quick, curvy, wispy lines, starting from the part at the scalp. This will also help to create a realistic looking part.<br>  I start of with my lightest pencil, 6H, then go all the way down to my darkest, 8B ... focusing on highlights (near the part, and other places where light hits), and low lights. I also mix different shades throughout the hair. You might want to look at your own hair in a mirror to see which areas shine under light. This REALLY helps in adding dimension to the hair, to make it seem more realistic.<br>  Also, there are some useful websites out there for drawing hair, such as <br>  <a href="http://monologues.co.uk/Portraits/DrawingHair.htm" rel="nofollow">http://monologues.co.uk/Portraits/Drawin...</a> <br>  and<br>   <a href="http://www.dog-portraits-inpencil.com/howtodrawrealistichair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dog-portraits-inpencil.com/ho...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and keep drawing! Your stuff is pretty good ^.^|`|AetN96kiaa	Even though you use different kinds of pencils, it doesn't seem like you don't much bold each pencil enough. I mean, when I sketch, I do basic drawing with 2H or HB and then I start shading it with 4B, when I do it, I give it a little hard push on the pencil. Originally, you are supposed to overlay by shading over and over again. But your sketches lack toning, from dark to light. They all look about same bold.<br>  try to give it a more depth, by coloring light and dark on where you need them to be. Use your eraser to show light.

9b355e061fa6c3b030996f1809e2369aaa	The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe<br>  <br>  Plot Overview : <br>  <br>  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are four siblings sent to live in the country with the eccentric Professor Kirke during World War II. The children explore the house on a rainy day and Lucy, the youngest, finds an enormous wardrobe. Lucy steps inside and finds herself in a strange, snowy wood. Lucy encounters the Faun Tumnus, who is surprised to meet a human girl. Tumnus tells Lucy that she has entered Narnia, a different world. Tumnus invites Lucy to tea, and she accepts. Lucy and Tumnus have a wonderful tea, but the faun bursts into tears and confesses that he is a servant of the evil White Witch. The Witch has enchanted Narnia so that it is always winter and never Christmas. Tumnus explains that he has been enlisted to capture human beings. Lucy implores Tumnus to release her, and he agrees.<br>   <br>  Lucy exits Narnia and eagerly tells her siblings about her adventure in the wardrobe. They do not believe her, however. Lucy's siblings insist that Lucy was only gone for seconds and not for hours as she claims. When the Pevensie children look in the back of the wardrobe they see that it is an ordinary piece of furniture. Edmund teases Lucy mercilessly about her imaginary country until one day when he sees her vanishing into the wardrobe. Edmund follows Lucy and finds himself in Narnia as well. He does not see Lucy, and instead meets the White Witch that Tumnus told Lucy about. The Witch Witch introduces herself to Edmund as the Queen of Narnia. The Witch feeds Edmund enchanted Turkish Delight, which gives Edmund an insatiable desire for the chocolate. The Witch uses Edmund's greed and gluttony to convince Edmund to bring back his siblings to meet her.<br>   <br>  On the way back to the lamppost, the border between Narnia and our world, Edmund meets Lucy. Lucy tells Edmund about the White Witch. Edmund denies any connection between the Witch and the Queen. All Edmund can think about is his desire for the Turkish Delight. Lucy and Edmund return to Peter and Susan, back in their own world. Lucy relies on Edmund to support her story about Narnia, but Edmund spitefully tells Peter and Susan that it is a silly story. Peter and Susan are worried that Lucy is insane so they talk to Professor Kirke. The Professor shocks Peter and Susan by arguing that Lucy is telling the truth.<br>   <br>  One day the children hide in the wardrobe to avoid the housekeeper and some houseguests. Suddenly all four Pevensie children find themselves in Narnia. Lucy leads them to Tumnus's home, but a note informs them that Tumnus has been arrested on charges of treason. Lucy realized that this means the Witch knows that Tumnus spared Lucy's life, and that the Witch has captured Tumnus. Lucy implores her siblings to help her rescue Tumnus from the Witch. Guided by a friendly robin, the children wander into the woods, and meet Mr. Beaver. Mr. Beaver brings them back to his home, where he explains that the children cannot do anything to save Tumnus. The only thing the children can do is join Mr. Beaver on a journey to see Aslan a lion. Aslan appears to be a king or god figure in Narnia. The children are all pleasantly enchanted by the name Aslan, except for Edmund, who is horrified by the sound of it. Mr. Beaver, Peter, Susan, and Lucy plot to meet Aslan at the Stone Table the following day, but they soon notice that Edmund has disappeared. Meanwhile, Edmund searches for the White Witch to warn her of Aslan's arrival and of the Beavers' plan. The Witch is enraged to hear that Aslan is in Narnia and immediately begins plotting to kill the children. The Witch wants to avoid an ancient prophecy that says that four humans will someday reign over Narnia and overthrow her evil regime.<br>   <br>  The children and the Beavers, meanwhile, rush to reach the Stone Table before the Witch. As they travel, wonderful seasonal changes occur. First they meet Santa Claus, or Father Christmas, who explains that the Witch's spell of "always winter and never Christmas" has ended. The enchanted winter snow melts and the children see signs of spring. Simultaneously, the Witch drags Edmund toward the Stone Table and treats him very poorly. Once spring arrives, the Witch cannot use her sledge anymore, so she cannot reach the Stone Table before the children.<br>   <br>  When the other three Pevensies meet Aslan, they are awed by him, but they quickly grow more comfortable in his presence. They love him immediately, despite their fear. Aslan promises to do all that he can to save Edmund. He takes Peter aside to show him the castle where he will be king. As they are talking, they hear Susan blowing the magic horn that Father Christmas gave her to her, signaling that she is in danger. Aslan sends Peter to help her. Arriving on the scene, Peter sees a wolf attacking Susan, and stabs it to death with the sword given him by Father Christmas. Aslan sees another wolf vanishing into a thicket, and sends his followers to trail it, hoping it will

It's not really a conversation because it's only one person doing the talking, and it's not interesting because it's like listening to someone read a list.

The play Macbeth was actually written for King James I because he found witchcraft intriguing so I'm sure others felt the same way.<br>  English people were really impatient and the plays took like, 3 1/2 hours so the purpose of the first scene is to captivate the audience and get their attention b/c if they didn't like the play they would throw stuff at the actors (they even threw dead cats!).|`|AA10209040	The line "fair is foul and foul is fair" in the first scene sets up the theme for the rest of the play--just because something seems harmless doesn't mean it is.|`|d6e0e5782d5e38269e8cb13ac843b1c7aa	it establishes the evil and superstitious themes of the play and helps to set the ominous mood.

q6phm94caa	Prior to the Great War (WW1) both Germany and Italy had been divided into many smaller States and there was little sense of cultural or political unity in either country. Both countries got a pretty bad deal out of the peace negotiations following the war, and neither country was as successful as the other European powers in benefiting from colonialism (Overseas Empire building). Hitler and Mussolini both presented Fascism as a means of regaining national pride, and creating a national identity capable of competing with other world powers, and this was just what the citizens of Germany and Italy wanted to hear.<br>  <br>  Fascism and communism are generally put at opposite ends of the political spectrum, fascism on the far right (dictatorial leadership) and communism on the far left (committee leadership), but in practice they share the similarities of repression and state control brought about by the ease with which either system is open to corruption and greed.|`|BdDRkt7eaa	Fascism is basically ultra-nationalism. Fascism promises that the country will return to its previous state. Before WWI, there were a lot of disputes over territory, especially in Africa, during the age of Imperialism. Around that time, Germany had only just gained her independence and was beginning to make herself known.<br>  <br>  After WWI, the Germans were blamed for the war and forced make reparation payments according to the Treaty of Versailles. Many countries were decimated after the war and the cost of maintaining them was heavy. Many relied on the reparation payments to survive, and demanded them, even though the Germans couldn't even take care of their own people.<br>  <br>  In times of economic crisis, there are really only two options which appeal to the people: Fascism and communism. Fascism, like stated before, promises that the country will go back to the days of their glory. This ideal unites the people and therefore, it makes them feel better. Communism is taken because the people are willing to share what little they have amongst themselves to ensure their survival.<br>  <br>  The difference between fascism and communism:<br>  <br>  1) Fascists believe in only one leader/form of government that will lead the people for the rest of their lives. They believe in a single figure head. Communists work towards the time where there will no longer be a government. For them, they presently have to have only one form of government to lead the people to that state.<br>  <br>  2) Fascists are vast supporters of capitalism, while communists abhor it.<br>  <br>  3) Fascists support a basic class society, while communists try to abolish it

But if you look at this picture: <a href="http://www.jewishmag.com/59mag/einstein/einstein.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishmag.com/59mag/einstein/...</a> <br>  You'll see that his hair is quite white well Grey :P so you could use lighter lines for his hair but overall this is probably the best drawing in a while.<br>  <br>  Don't let all this get you down please don't. What you've done now is the best for a 13 year old. I don't know if you high school offers Art class, but I think you'll be really improve on your skills.<br>  <br>  Just keep up what your doing and you'll become an artist easily. :)|`|nHMtY7PXaa	Definitely progress for 13. I would suggest studying anatomy books. You don't need lessons to draw! They are means to take your money. The only benefit from those classes is being around different people and learning their techniques, which you can do in a classroom.<br>  <br>  There are tricks and tips to drawing anatomy and faces. My advice would be to look up tutorials. there are tons online.<br>  <br>  And practise! There's nothing better.|`|2mg0oZwtaa	Yes! There awesome, I couldnt of done better. :)|`|SXSkmwrQaa	i think you draw very good, i like the first one|`|AA11525569	i can see you have potential. the pictures here have a lot of emotion in them, i can feel what the subject is feeling... what theyre thinking, youre just lacking the technical skills.. which is actually the easy part. that part just takes practice. what ive found helps with technical skills is to carry a sketch book around with you and draw everything you see. eeeeverything. draw the garbage can, draw a door knob, draw your shoe, draw a picture out of a magazine, draw people if you can get them to hold still for you. focus on different things in each sketch.. focus on light in one, shape in another, practice using colors, different strokes, make some sketches with a lot of detail, others just focussing on one main feature. study other peoples art to open up to all styles. teaching yourself is a good thing, because you develope your own style.. but it never hurts to get advice and opinions from other, more experienced people. <br>  <br>  if this is what you want to do, you have to go all out for it, just dont give up.|`|nmejm9Nmaa	Wow, your case sounds just like mine. I loved my uncle, he's the one that inspired me to draw, he died when I was 10. I'm 23 now and your work looks just like what I was drawing when I was 13, I never took lessons and you wont need to either, the skill will come natural to you and you will be awesome, just take art classes in high school. I am an artist now and i'm making good money for my artwork, and you will too, just keep it up. Magnificient work.|`|dbTPyM7Yaa	Sarah,<br>  You don't have to pay for private lessons, just take art classes in school. Both your junior high and high schools should have art classes you can take. The key to success in anything is practice, practice, practice. If one drawing doesn't work out the way you like, do it over and over until you do like it. Draw everything around you to get good at it. Then try drawing things faster and faster. Keep your drawings in a journal and date them. A year from now look back at them, you will see how much better you've gotten already.|`|0cCZkuBOaa	not bad|`|Gg7iTAJtaa	Wow, and I rarely say wow, wow to what you said of your age. If you were older than I wouldn't be saying wow, I would say great job. To be ho nest, I do have a hard time believing you're 13, because you have perfect grammar, I mean, I've never come across a 13 yr old who typed like that. 2n'd, becuase yeah, the person who drew those carries dome skill.. but if you're really 13, and I'm here denieing that you are not, then what does that say to you? You have something unusual, and it has me at disbelief. Hm..|`|vejBlTO5aa	I think you really do have the makings of a true artist. I especially loved the pic of the baby. You are very good, and of course you should pursue training. I'm sure your cousin would be proud too.|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	For 13 that is very good :)|`|Rkg4CM9jaa	Are you 13 or 14 ? In your other questions you said you were 14 .... <br>  <br>  Anyways, you're drawings are quite good for a 13 year old, But you need more practice in getting the detail and proportions right. Drawing people is difficult, especially if they are standing still and posing for your picture.<br>  <br>  Take a photo of them first, then put the paper over it and trace the outline. This way you will have a basic shape to work with.<br>  <br>  Learn how to draw shadows and shades of light and dark. Start by drawing simple things like an apple, a flower jar, or a toy. This will help you a lot.<br>  Start simple and work your way up to drawing people and animals.
BjBkO0CSaa	Hands down, it would be the Cuban Missile Crisis. <br>  The Cuban Missile Crisis is commonly known as the "closest the world ever came to World War THREE."  <br>  <br>  In this event, the USSR wanted to store a missile in Cuba, which was (and is) Communist.  The US was totally against it > Cuba could easily point a missile at the US and shoot, so it was justified.  Anyways, the USSR didn't care what the US thought, and they sent a missile on a ship.  <br>  <br>  Both countries threatened each other for war: the US said if the missile was delivered, it would declare war.  And the USSR said if the US tried to impede Soviet delivery of the weapon, it would declare war.  In the end, the two countries negotiated (the US promised to be less controlling of Cuba, and the USSR agreed to send the missile back). <br>  <br>  Obviously, this story is very (VERY) summarized, but if you're interested, you can Google the topic and find tons of info.  Just some misc. info > during the time, the US was (justifiably) paranoid about a nuclear war against the USSR.|`|12zRozB7aa	Cuban missile crisis!!!!|`|JIMWL8vhaa	Well, if you think about it, the cold war was merely a standoff between Russia and the U.S.<br>  <br>  WE both had nuclear warheads<br>  <br>  Russia was telling us "do what we want or we'll blow you up"<br>  and we were telling them the same/
v5SXqxo0aa	1. The earliest cover is Sorcerer's Stone, where Harry appears flying on a broomstick. That means he has already started Hogwarts and been sorted, because his first flying lesson is quite a bit into his first year.<br>  <br>  2. I'm not JKR, so I can't say for sure, but it seems as though she had the prophecy worked out at the beginning of the story. The prophecy gave Voldemort the motive to  try to kill Harry specifically. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, but only because they tried to stop him from killing their son.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Unless you are talking about the British version of Sorcerer's Stone, Philosopher's Stone ( <a href="http://www.solarnavigator.net/films_movies_actors/film_images/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosophers_Stone_Book_J_K_Rowling.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.solarnavigator.net/films_movi...</a> ). In which case, I don't know. The illustrators are allowed to read the book while it is being published in order to draw the cover and chapter pictures, so it is probably a slip up or a hint of what's to come.|`|nHMtY7PXaa	It is being assumed that the reader has no idea about the colours, so there would be no reason not to have the cover as such. <br>  <br>  JKR, like most writers, probably had it sketched out in her mind well before the first book. You don't just make stuff up as you go along or you get a horrible, run-on series (like Twilight).|`|tHpxUaIcaa	The particular scene on the front cover is from later in the book when he first rides a broom. And J.K. Rowling herself said she plotted out the entire series before she even finished the first novel. So no she didn't need a reason because it was already there.|`|tZF1FO7saa	Well he is already flying on a broomstick chasing the snitch so he was probably already sorted since he knows about Qudditch.  <br>  <br>  No I do not know how JKR came up with the prophecy maybe it was to add more conflict to the plot.
6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	Even though Mary I (Queen of England and Ireland after he brother Edward VI) has a nasty record of 300+ deaths to her name for the sake of religious prosecution, I would say that Elizabeth Bathory (The Blood Countess) was far worse.<br>  <br>  Bathory was convicted (though not a court upheld ruling) of 80 deaths, but those numbers according to eyewitness accounts pushed over 600.  Furthermore, those deaths were for her own mere pleasure (although bathing in their blood still stands more along the lines of legend than fact).  Still, it was her hubris and stature in Hungarian society that made her worse than Mary I since Mary's whole reason was founded upon eliminating religious dissension in England.  Bathory was in it just for the hell of it (where I think both women are currently residing at this time).|`|qA6jD6igaa	bloody mary

The whole story takes place on a faraway planet, Austair IV whose economy is based around dragons who fight in pits. It is a former penal colony and people are divided up into masters and bonders. <br>  The bonders are the equivalent of indentured servants and they must “fill their bag” before they can be free. The bag is worn around their neck at all times and their coins are put into the bag until they have enough to be free. The masters are primarily dragon owners, breeders, and fighters. <br>  Jakkin works as a stallboy in the stable where the male dragons are kept for breeding. He helps to bathe the dragons and clean out their stalls. He dreams of freedom, though, and plans to achieve it by stealing a dragon hatchling and raising it to be a fighter.

I know how frustrating it is when you cannot remember something like a book or a movie and you really want to read/watch it again. Good luck :)
htBHCNDtaa	No I don't think so. Only because marriage is for people who are in love, and as much as I am positive a person who has a disability is capable of love, it's a different type of love.<br>  Also, if he/she somehow has a child he/she will not be able to look after it which would be unfortunate - cause though the person would love his/her kid, he/she might be sad.<br>  <br>  Although, when I think of the movie 'I am Sam', he was a good dad and a nice person, but I guess it was still difficult for him trying to live a normal life anyway.<br>  <br>  Even I can't decide lol.|`|AA11564934	i say let em marry and have fun and misery like all of us|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Marriage is about attaching a man's wallet to a womans offspring.<br>  <br>  It's the simple fairness that men are to be held accountable for the children they help create.<br>  <br>  Marriage & the Retarded makes no sense.   Should a woman marry a man with bad genes who can't support her?   Should a man marry a woman with bad genes who couldn't be trusted to care for children?<br>  <br>  If you never mentally reach the age of consent,  marriage is a bit silly.<br>  <br>  If you are past the age of procreation, it's irrelevant.|`|AA10023528	Both states deeply relate to each other.|`|AA10495187	no, you don't want to traumatize a young kid with sex.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	excuse me, can a heat stoke cause damages to our brain? lol....if so, i am excuseable yeah?|`|OKZbDbH2aa	I'd leave it up to the decision of his/her caregiver.  If that person feels the mentally retarded person in question would benefit more by marriage, then I'd say so.<br>  <br>  Let me clarify:  The real reason we don't allow children to marry is that their brains are not fully developed enough and THUS are not trusted to make such a decision.  When they reach adulthood, their brains have grown to it's peak and so they are as biologically capable as they'll ever be in making such a decision.  I feel that an adult mentally retarded person who's brain has grown as far as it can naturally can should leave such an important decision up to the caretaker responsible.  If caretaker feels it's a greater good for the mentally retarded person to marry, then I have no objections.|`|Z6sCMskNaa	I think it should be allowed, only if the person who they are getting married to has the same problem. Otherwise it'd be pretty wrong.|`|PleSPTMEaa	I don't think they should be able to get married, no.|`|HVVyfR8paa	It all depends on what the person looks like.
AA11199739	Well, it could be depressing to explore the darker side of mankind, but it could also be enlightening. Do you subscribe to the theory that ignorance is bliss or knowledge is power?<br>  <br>  School is for learning and there is nothing wrong with reading the classics and learning about all sides of human nature. I would have to say that everyone has a dark side including you and it's better to face it than run away. Why? Because then we will know how to cope and handle the situation. Pretending that life is just fun, funny and frivolous won't help. Don't you want to know, understand, and make a contribution to this world? If so, learn all you can and face the real world so you can help in the real world.<br>  <br>  By the way, Conrad is one of my favorite writers and he understands human nature very well.
H2bFiDNAaa	I'm the exact same way. You're just not used to it- practice reading in front of your pet :]|`|8QKgkOZfaa	Keep practicing your speech. You may want to look at difficult words, and repeat them until they become easy to say. <br>  <br>  All I can say is read a lot. No one reads perfectly or completely and totally fluent. We all stumble. Just practice. Sometimes write out something for you to read, and reread it out loud, or take your favorite book and read some of it aloud.|`|4eJpf7o2aa	Practice! I had the same problem as you did once and what I did is read out loud in front of my mirror, keep a dictionary handy if there are words I cannot pronounce. The trick is to go slow and easy at first, read every word and at the same time build up the confidence. Then gradually read faster and faster until you read aloud in the normal speed. Then challenge yourself, read in front of friends, family, anyone that would make you feel comfortable. Also, it's important to listen when people talk or better yet, listen to audio books. You can listen, pause and repeat what was said, confidently and smoothly. Last and not least, read a lot, it doesn't have to be overly difficult and academic books, it could be books you just read for fun and try reading them aloud, like you're reading yourself a story.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pgHlTuRnaa	HAHAHA! I have the same problem and it frustrates the HELL out of me! I'll be like reading to my friend or whatever, and I'll be like, stuttering! it's ridiculous! Totally maddening! I find that reading aloud, even to yourself helps a lot! just, maybe every time you read something, read ten minutes of it aloud, to yourself... Cuz I know, from personal experiance, I read in my head very fast, but out loud, it's different, almost like I have a block!|`|3MCPRNh7aa	I love reading aloud and I can tell you that your goal is a worthy one.  The first step is to practice!  No one likes hearing that, but it's true; there's no magic quick fix.  If you're not comfortable doing this in front of others, just give it a go on your own - when reading the paper, a book for leisure, TV ads, or whatever is around you.  Small children are also good to practice on because they aren't as judgmental.  I'm definitely more comfortable reading aloud to kids than in front of my classmates and this lets me be more relaxed and entertaining as a reader (doing character voices, making it dramatic, etc).  I recommend listening to audio books to find some good examples to follow and ideas on how to improve your performance.  Most libraries have them available for borrowing if buying them is outside your budget.  I advise against recording yourself reading because no one likes the sound of their own voice and you're bound to be overly critical of yourself.  I wish you luck and encouragement!  Happy reading!|`|HVVyfR8paa	Practice, practice, practice.  You'll get better quickly.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	I see someone gave you one.

Boo does something wrong and he is punished harshly. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I can't remember all the chapters... The Finches, their neighbors, Calpurnia and Dill appear within the first few chapters. <br>  Tom Robinson is introduced in chapter 12 i think, right before Part 2. <br>  The Ewell family is introduced towards the beginning when Scout starts school. <br>  Heck Tate comes somewhere in the middle. <br>  Mayella Ewell comes up during the Tom Robinson trial. <br>  Aunt Alexandra is introduced when the Finches have christmas with her, not at the start of the book but towards the beginning. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|GNf3tmguaa	go on sparknotes. it has everything you are asking for.|`|PTWnWkPRaa	try sparknotes.com

FeUmyxqqaa	the closer the lens is to the subject and the further the background is from the subject the easier it will be to throw the focus out<br>  <br>  if the camera is a foot from the subject and the BG is 20 feet away it will be out of the focal range<br>  <br>  aperture and focal lenghts play a major part also|`|YupMCYHlaa	Depth of field depends on the f-stop, as you know, and also on other factors like how close you are, and the focal length of the lens.  Digital cameras usually have very 'short' lenses because the 'film' is very small, so they have a lot of depth of field even at big f-stops.  In fact, years ago this was thought to be a big advantage of 35mm cameras over larger formats.  If you look in old books of portraits taken with a HUGE format, like 8x10, you often see that one eye is in focus and the other isn't!<br>  <br>  If you get closer you will notice less depth of field.  And use the biggest f-stop you have.<br>  <br>  When I was in school we all did experiments with picket fences.  We'd put little signs on one picket and photograph them at various f-stop/shutter speed combinations, and see the differences.   I learned a lot from this kind of fooling around.  And this kind of experiment is even easier with digital cameras because pictures don't actually cost anything!|`|cd4625ff61ead8fcaa3b3822fba1ac66aa	try this.. set your cam into av mode, set the av at the lowest number, now step back from the subject and make sure your back ground that you want blurred is not too close to the subject..the farther, the better..  zoom it on subject and shoot.<br>  <br>   it would also help us to know what lens you are shooting with.. focal length and aperture max size..

0oSCSbagaa	The Confessions of a Shopaholic are a series of books. The first one is called, obviously, The Confessions of a Shopaholic. The rest are also about Becky Bloomwood and her wildly spontaneous adventures with her credit card debt(s). Yes, I repeat "debts." She has more than one debt story up her sleeve. I strongly recommend these books, just for light reading of course. These books aren't meant for readers looking for in-depth lessons on how to keep oneself financially stable, but they do allow readers to enjoy Becky's naive decisions; sometimes we are left wanting to strangle her with her obviously stupid choices. Overall, I recommend the series to you.<br>  <br>  I have, most unfortunately, seen the movie that recently came out. I can understand that you might like the movie because you saw the movie first. But honestly, the book is nothing like the movie. I mean, the characters have the same names, but Luke Brandon does not work at Successful Savings. And Becky Bloomwood does not live in New York City, she actually lives in London. The book was written by Madeleine Wickham or also under the pseudonym Sophie Kinsella. This English author, obviously has a certain English vibe in her writing and therefore the actual writing style in the book series it different from the movie version. <br>  <br>  I hope that if you enjoyed the movie you will enjoy the Shopaholic series, but the series is not identical to the movie. The movie is more of just a series of events that occur in both the first, second, and maybe third books of the Shopaholic series meshed together. It's actually quite horrible if you look at it. I think you would enjoy reading each book with Becky's hilarious antics one at a time. <br>  <br>  Hope you enjoy them!

If they do not wish to do this, no-one can force them.  Parents who are wise, know this from day one and sneer at suicides when their kids are two, making comments like 'well, he improved the gene pool' and 'if that's what he wants to do with his life, that's fine'<br>  <br>  The first time our kid shows up and yells "I'm going to kill myself" we say "okay, but dig a hole first please.  I don't want to clean up any mess."  We then laugh in their faces.  This drives them insane but makes it quite clear that if they wish to kill themselves, they are sort of going to be the only ones that pay for this.  (Serve them right, I have no time for suicides.  Effing wankers.)<br>  <br>  But modern parents are of the opinion they must schmooze their kids at all times, be 'sympathetic' (barf) and 'understanding' (spew) and 'there for them'.

After tricking a family friend, Jacob Black, into telling her local tribal legends, Bella concludes that Edward and his family are vampires who drink animal blood rather than human.

BMxNOJ39aa	A friend wrote the following for a now defunct website:<br>  <br>  Andrew Jackson was elected President in 1828. He was known for his strong anti-Indian sentiment and chose to allow state laws to go unchallenged when they dealt with anti-Indian policies. For example, Georgia and Alabama made it illegal for an Indian to testify in court against a white person. Before long, popular sentiment supported the enacting of the Indian Removal Act by the United States Congress in 1830.<br>  <br>  The Cherokee, along with the other "Five civilized tribes" of the Southeast, (Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw and Seminole ), had tried to accommodate to white culture. In the case of the Cherokee, they lived in frame houses, farmed, developed their own written form of their language, published a newspaper, and even, in some cases, owned slaves. Nonetheless, Jackson's Indian policy was to remove all Indians to the "Indian territory" of present day Oklahoma--a land of radically different climate than the Southeast.<br>  <br>  Indian removal began to most powerfully affect the Cherokee when gold was discovered on Cherokee land in Georgia. The state of Georgia then passed laws forbidding the Cherokee to mine their own gold, authorizing the confiscation of Cherokee land, denying the Cherokee the right to hold their own courts except to ratify land cessions, and a number of other similar laws. Jackson supported these laws while simultaneously telling the Cherokee leaders that he was helpless to override the rights of the states. (State's rights were somewhat stronger prior to the Civil War and the passage of the 14th Amendment, but the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution WAS in effect).<br>  <br>  The major leaders of the Cherokee at the time included Chief John Ross, Major Ridge (who had actually served with Jackson during the Red Stick War), Oowatie and his son, Stand Watie, plus the editor of the Cherokee newspaper, Elias Boudinot. <br>  <br>  Jackson had stopped the annuities paid to the Cherokee nation on the grounds that the tribe's government was extinct, thus they had no income, but nonetheless were able to retain legal representation and took their case to the United States Supreme Court, where two important decisions were handed down. In CHEROKEE NATION V. GEORGIA (1831), the court was sympathetic to the Cherokee, but would not recognize them as a "foreign state" for the purpose of coming under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but nonetheless gave a solid definition of what an Indian tribe was, "... a distinct political society...capable of managing its own affairs and governing itself." The Court defined tribes as "Domestic dependent nations ..."  within the United States. It was a partial victory, at least acknowledging the right of the tribe to exist.<br>  <br>  Then in WORCHESTER V. GEORGIA (1832), a case involving two missionaries who refused to take an oath of allegiance to the state of Georgia while serving the Cherokee nation, the Court ruled completely in favor of the Cherokee position on the case, overturning most of the repressive laws against the Cherokee passed by the state of Georgia saying, "The Cherokee nation... is a distinct community... which the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter, but with the assent of the Cherokees... the whole intercourse between the United States and this nation [the Cherokee nation] is... vested in the government of the United States."<br>  <br>  However, Jackson is alleged by some to have said in response, "John Marshall [chief justice of the Supreme Court] has made his decision; now let him enforce it." He essentially ignored the court and allowed the state of Georgia to continue with their land lottery, giving Cherokee homes, land, and livestock to white people.<br>  <br>  Between 1832 and 1834, some Cherokee chose to emigrate west, while others attempted to hang on in neighboring states. Eventually, a split developed within the tribe. The Ridge faction signed a removal treaty. The tribe, as a whole, rejected it, and Ross, after some difficulty (including arrest by the Georgia Guard), went to Washington to plead the case of the Majority faction of the Cherokee. However, in spite of substantial public support for the Cherokee, the Senate still ratified the treaty, paid the Cherokee five million dollars for their remaining land (valued at over 20 million dollars) and told them to move west within three years.<br>  <br>  By 1838 the United States Government sent General Winfield Scott (who did not like what he was ordered to do) and 7000 soldiers to forcibly remove the Cherokee from Tennessee. They left in several waves, at first virtually herded by the soldiers, though later Ross was allowed to supervise removal on his own terms. Either way, at least 4,000 out of 18,000 people died along the way--including Quatie, the wife of Chief John Ross, who caught pneumonia after giving her blanket to help a sick child.<br>  <br>  A few bands of the Cherokee, numbering several hundred, escaped capture and hid in the hills of North Carolina unti|`|QUjJELtVaa	This except from Wikipedia gives a good basic explanation of the evolution of rulings on US Indian relations by the time the Cherokees were removed they were thought of more as wards of the state<br>  <br>  Before the American Revolution, tribes entered into treaties with the British Crown as sovereign governments. During the Revolution, the Continental Congress established three regional departments of Indian affairs, charged with negotiating treaties and alliances with native tribes, most of which sided with the British during the war. With the creation of the U.S. Constitution in 1789, the new Congress transferred those duties to the newly established United States Department of War.<br>  <br>  While government to government treaties, like the 1785 Cherokee Treaty of Hopewell,[4] were still relied on to define rights for the tribes, the legal status of Indian Nations as sovereigns began to change in the early years of the new Republic. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the rights of indigenous landholders for the first time in its 1823 decision, Johnson v. McIntosh, but the ruling did not answer the lingering questions of tribal sovereignty. Chief Justice John Marshall's decision was primarily concerned with establishing the doctrine that only the federal government had the authority to enter into land deals with the tribes. However, the Court did recognize an indigenous right to occupy and use the land, though the legal title was held by the U.S. government. Marshall explained that Indian lands in the U.S. were granted to the federal government through treaty with Great Britain and that "these grants have been understood by all to convey a title to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy." The Court acknowledged that, despite the U.S. holding title to the lands, tribal rights to occupy an area could not be extinguished unless the tribe ceded its right to the government.<br>  <br>  The question of the tribes' status as sovereign nations was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court's decision Cherokee Nation v. Georgia in 1831. In writing the majority opinion Chief Justice Marshall stated: "an Indian tribe or nation within the United States is not a foreign state in the sense of the constitution, and cannot maintain an action in the courts of the United States." Marshall characterized the tribes as "domestic dependent nations." He elaborated on this concept and determined that these domestic nations "are in a state of pupilage" and that "their relations to the US resemble that of a ward to his guardian." The next year, in Worcester v. Georgia, the Marshall court established the doctrine that only the national government of the United States—and not the individual states—had authority in Indian affairs.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the Treaty of Echota it was the treaty that traded Cherokee lands in the east for lands in the west, and the basic legal justification for the trail of tears.

TaGkV5hLaa	DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE PEOPLE!!! CHANCES ARE YOU WILL LOVE NEW MOON! PEOPLE TOLD ME IT WAS THE WORST BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND MADE ME FEEL A LOT MORE THAN THE REST OF THE BOOKS!<br>  <br>  DON'T YOU DARE NOT READ IT!!!!<br>  :)|`|xv7YlV29aa	honey if you want to read the rest of the stories then I advice you to read new moon. The story is not the worst one and it does not suck.<br>  <br>  You really have to read the story to feel what happens. I can't force you to read it but I promise you if you read the rest of the series you will regret not reading it.<br>  <br>  the story is very sad and emotional and ends good. The ending is ******* awesome. Also you meet a main character in book2. Shows a great friendship. <br>  <br>  I won't lie to you the first 300 or so pages has a lot of drama and sadness in it but so what, its life and a story.<br>  <br>  read it or stop reading twilight period|`|gkiyAgJ4aa	New Moon is my favorite book. you see a lot of development in Bella and Edward's relationship as well as Bella and Jacob's relationship. I think that you should read the book for yourself, or at least try. Know that Edward is in Eclipse and you will survive. If you really, truly can not read it anymore after the first 100-150 pages, then stop and ask someone to tell you about. However, if you are a true fan, you would read all of the books.|`|7QDDI7TFaa	I did not like New Moon however I managed to read it.  It was definitely the slowest Twilight book in the series.  If you have to read the first part and the last part of the book and then you can go back and read the middle. you will be able to understand Eclipse fine even if you don't read all of Twilight.|`|ZXisfTYTaa	You should definitely read it. The middle is kinda boring and depressing but  its really good. just get through about 5-6 chapters and you wont have to be depressed anymore and then you'll survive. trust me you'll think there's no hope but it's really good.if you cant handle being really sad for about 7 chapters than you should definitely ask some one to tell you about it. Or you can skip those middle chapters and and have some one fill you in and just keep going on. But it's definitely worth the time!<3|`|SULqkMfzaa	The reason most people don't like new moon is because edward leaves bella and the majority of the book is about bella and jacobs friendship. But yeah you have to read it if you want to understand the third book.|`|8D4Q1HLFaa	Read it. If u read it, things in eclipse will make sence. just trust me on this, READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|6vgTVPtEaa	yes read it <br>  i really liked it some parts are funny and will make you laugh|`|S4W7FojCaa	Read New Moon. It is interesting. I found it pretty good and it was nice getting to know Jacob and the werewolves.|`|AOQQYAeyaa	It was my favorite too.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Well you have to read New Moon to understand Eclipse and Breaking Dawn.<br>  It's not the best book out of the series but close to the end is really good.Read it so you can move on to the better books.|`|cgz85foTaa	New Moon is boring compared to Twlight!  I haven't read the last two, but I can see how people think that it is the worst book in the series.  The only reason why I would read it is because you might need it to understand the rest of the series.|`|49wnU3s0aa	I wouldnt say New Moon was the worst. You should, its not that bad.|`|pgHlTuRnaa	It was my favorite in the whole saga... read it!
7f7aa0ea5dc924471fffd54e742f67ddaa	Why ask a question and then answer it? "We" should have let the Vietnamese determine the fate of their own country.<br>  <br>  Or is this just your rant about a war that ended over 30 years ago with the Vietnamese victory in 1975?<br>  <br>  The air war over Vietnam was largely a failure. I can see the failure of the Americans to either understand the political nature of the war, or of putting all their trust in their B-52s has rubbed off on you. It is a shame in this day and age, with all the information available, that so many have to remain so ignorant about the course of events from the Vietnamese side.|`|WYngdeacaa	You're option is actually quite close to my solution.<br>  <br>  1) Mine all the harbors in North Vietnam.  Even though China and North Vietnam shared a border, the infrastructure was so bad that they couldn't import heavy equipment that way.  The harbors were the key.<br>  <br>  2) Allow the front line commanders a free hand to plan and execute the air war.<br>  <br>  3) Promote and place in charge ground commanders who where willing to fight a counterinsurgency war.  Put a Marine or Green Beret in charge.  Westmorland and the other top generals wanted to fight large, classic set piece battles like World War II.  Army Generals don't get statues in West Point fighting counterinsurgencies.<br>  <br>  4)  Dig out the 1930's Marine Corps classic book "Small Wars".  It works.  Among other things, it says concentrate on protecting the loyal population as opposed to chasing your tail in the jungle.<br>  <br>  5) 70% of those who served in Vietnam were volunteers.  Do not send any reluctant draftees to Vietnam.  Keep them in Germany, Korea, and other places.  There would be sufficient troops to fight a counterinsurgency, and protests at home will drop like rock once young men realize they won't be forced to go to Vietnam if drafted.<br>  <br>  That's the military side.  It basically worked in Korea.  It would preserve the status quo antebellum (state of things pre-war).<br>  <br>  The political is a bit more touchy.  This required learning from people the US Army never wants to learn from, the British.  This is dealing with the South Vietnamese government.<br>  <br>  1)  Give troops permission to "deal with" any corrupt local political authorities who are alienating the populous.<br>  <br>  2)  Make sure the national leaders understand, in no uncertain terms, that if South Vietnam exists only because the US wills it to exist.  If South Vietnam sees another dawn it's because the US allows it.<br>  <br>  3)  Raise, train, and equip South Vietnamese units under American officers who answer to the US command.  Keep corrupt generals in Saigon hosting dinner parties.  In time, this will become an alternate political force of citizen soldiers with stake in the nation.  <br>  <br>  4) Make sure all military and economic aid is tightly controlled by the US authorities at the national and local level.  Do not give South Vietnamese officials opportunity to send it to Switzerland.<br>  <br>  5) Deal very harshly with any South Vietnamese attempt to rig elections, intimidate voters, and generally piss off the populous.  Make it known that if local provincial governor rips off the people, the Americans will "handle" him.<br>  <br>  6) Make sure all police and courts operate above board.  Everyone, American and Vietnamese, must feel the system is not rigged.<br>  <br>  Basically, in Vietnam, we didn't hit the North hard enough, early enough, and we didn't keep the South government under control.  Even under Nixon, we were too politically correct.  We didn't want to seem like we were colonial power like the British.  Say what you will about the Brits, in confrontation after confrontation with insurgencies communist and otherwise, they won with much less men and money: Kenya, Malaysia, Brunei, Oman, and Northern Ireland (sure it took a while but its still theirs).

BjBkO0CSaa	The civil rights movement of the 1950s-1960s was about getting rid of segregation and discrimination against African Americans.<br>  <br>  Dr. King's most famous speech (I have a dream...) was about the general equality of African Americans and white Americans --- specifically, he wanted the two groups to interact peacefully, and he saw this vision through his children.  Though his generation would be unable to achieve such unity, he hoped that in the future, all children could go to school together without segregation and discrimination.<br>  <br>  He had a number of speeches, some about specific causes, other motivational to bring down segregation.  Hope that breaks it down for you!|`|UF9nXtiQaa	Martin Luther King wanted to have equal rights among Blacks and white and to attain the demand,he adopted non-violence.He was greatly influences by Mahatma Gandhi-Portrait of Non-Violence. <br>  The purpose of his speech was to bring people to the tack of Non Violence.He didn't want violence as he knew if Violence was adopted,rights won't be guaranteed for the further 100 years.|`|PoY7vcnQaa	The purpose of his speech was to encourage non-violent protesting and to provide the general public of the need for fair treatment to all people regardless of their race or gender and that to be a true UNITED STATES, we need to stand together and learn to treat each other fairly and justly.|`|jULxSOHcaa	Which speech? He gave many|`|S0zbFmcMaa	you like marther luther king??????????????????|`|SHE7SAGWaa	the I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH? <br>  i think the point of that speech was the fact that he wanted hatred and rasism to stop among whites and black. he wanted us to unite and be one and love one another not hate eachother. i think he felt like we were still in bondage emothionally and in some certs physically too. and thats why he wrote the speech. he wanted us to have freedom.
hl4kkvXhaa	The purpose of the speech was to bring about the ideal of Animalism...his vision is that animals live together harmoniously without the oppression or control of humans.  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/summary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm...</a><br>  <br>  I found an article that you might find interesting.

I don't read 2-3 books a week, but I still consider myself an avid reader. It's more that you don't read every once in a while, but you're always reading *something*. It takes me a while to work on books sometimes, especially with how busy I am, but I'm always reading something.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Don't stop.

8mbAoXyJaa	1. After his mother died when he wasn't present, Chick started to feel guilty for his mother's death. So, he went into a state of depression. I think depression was his mind and life, until he saw his mother after he committed suicide.<br>  2.

au1yFfuxaa	I completely agree. My favorite saying is, "normal is a setting on the washer machine". There is no such thing as normal. Everyone is unique and likes different things, that is what is so amazing about the world we live in.|`|be1979ce40b9ceceab7ad137e21ac660aa	Reach way down deep in your spirit and tell me that you do not know what being normal is. You prove that you know by asking this question.|`|wNJetCLEaa	HOW IS THAT EVEN A QUESTION, ITS A FREAKING STATEMENT MAN, YOUR ON THE WRONG WEBSITE!!!<br>  sorry, I just really wanted to write in all caps right then.

I'd say a very small proportion of humans are normal II.<br>  <br>  I remember mum saying she was perfect when I was a kid (she's a philosopher.)  We said "Nobody's perfect."<br>  <br>  She said "All I have to be, to be the perfect human being...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  wait for it....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .....

Game, set and match!|`|DWzhpsp0aa	I believe 'normal' is being the exact opposite therefore normal is being abnormal since we have no blueprint to what normal is or is supposed to be except from our individual societies.<br>  <br>  You articulated it the best bro!|`|Om7OhWRUaa	Well, it's a good thing that you've resolved all the mysteries of human nature.<br>  <br>  Not everyone is a relativist like you.

If people were born, knowing where they were, what would be the point? We'd get here and just be and that's all well and good, but it's not really living.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I am ALL for just being... but apparently this existence is NOT what that's about.

srjyBwbiaa	Well, Dostoevsky is notorious for using the dark in terms of his portrayal of the 19th century Russian society. Everything is gloomy, cold and poor - poverty level. There is a lot of crime and starvation and, basically, the human kind is a failure. But he brings in the light by providing really wonderful stories of those who prevail and strive through... like the reasoning behind prostitution and how it's a self sacrificing act in order to support a family. The act itself is ugly and dark but the reason behind it.. for the love.. that's where the light is. Dostoevsky I think is saying without the dark, there can never be light..
31e3aeeef48254ed515aa846df344c44aa	Accumulated fines can easily add up to $30.  And many library systems routinely send you to collection agencies when you reach either a threshold amount (sometimes as little as $10 but more usually around $50) or after a good long time elapses after your notification.<br>  <br>  Check with the library to see if they show the books returned.  If not, FIND THEM.  If you can't find them at home or in your mom's car, go into the library and check the shelves (if you're not good reading Dewey Decimal numbers, ask for help.  The librarians more than likely won't know you're a scofflaw unless you tell them).  If they're not there, pay the fine and be done with it.  You don't need that hanging over your head. <br>  <br>  Yes, the library could have messed up.  It happens more than we'd like for stuff to be returned and not get checked back in.  So make sure you get those shelves checked before you pay up -- but bring cash enough to pay it off if you DON'T find them.|`|tKb7i5jtaa	Call them! Check the website most will say if there is one missing on the books page.|`|BxpGdVTOaa	Call the library. Ask them to search the shelves--but honestly, after this long of a time they probably just don't have it--they might have something called "claim return" like my library does. They only allow you to do it five times,here, but it will take the fine off your account.

haPz116kaa	cute but not good... srry it doesnt flow not interesting|`|Lz26O1Uvaa	"a girl formally known as," do you actually mean formally or formerly?<br>  I feel like some of the dialogue was stiff. "I have a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach that something tragic has occurred.” For someone who is living with their parents (I'm assuming because they are there and she calls them "mommy" and "daddy") her speech is waaaay too uptight and stiff. Keep it simpler and more realistic by simply saying something like, "I feel really anxious. What if something bad happened to him?" Just try to make it more casual and believable.<br>  And maybe you should brush up on medical emergency scenarios. Choppers aren't really sent directly to the scene of an accident. Normally firefighters arrive, then police, and then the ambulance (my dad's a fireman, he says he's always on site before ambulances, and they are always last). And it's not realistic for a paramedic or whoever to call "all available cars." Just research a little about medical diction and what not; maybe ask someone you know who is involved with those kinds of thing?<br>  Hope I helped.|`|RE67KpFPaa	If you're five, then this is understandable. If you aren't, then I would suggest going to back to the first grade to work on your writing skills.|`|FaBx9W4Faa	It's good really. I really like it, you're off in a good start. You had you're plot and characters, but you need to organize the flow of your story. It's really good, you got the point but if you are trying to publish this you have a lot to fix. Ha:) don't worry it may seem like a lot to fix but if you really want to stick to this story you have to make it so people will want to read it. Oh i read how you added reality to your piece that's great because people can relate to it...a little, but that's due to how you organized/ formatted your story. Don't worry you are getting there, just try to fix it up more and in the end you will be happy and satisfied with your results. OH and another thing don't let people put you down to make you stop fixing your story up, keep on going:)

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	From Chapter 31:<br>  It was still summertime, and the children came closer.

94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	Why was it unfair?  Germany was blamed for being completely at fault for the war, and therefore made to pay financially for it.  And, she was stripped of all of her colonies...which were given to the wwi victors.<br>  In short, though the allies spoke of a 'war to end all wars', to the Germans the terms seemed so cruel - and so advantageous to the victors - that the terms just seemed a sort of revenge; paving the way for wwii.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	The Treaty of Versailles was one of the peace treaties at the end of World War I. It ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, one of the events that triggered the start of the war. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I were dealt with in separate treaties. Although the armistice signed on 11 November 1918 ended the actual fighting, it took six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. Of the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required Germany.|`|7e7cb48ca14510a1f4daeb63d56a4974aa	Before or after the War?<br>  <br>  Before the war they were made to pay the war dept to all the counties they lost to in WW1.
9f2732666ba02bb2086810593d884191aa	Once Hitler had risen to power he completely ignored the boundaries that had been set on Germany as a result of the First World War. For example, Germany was forbidden to have submarines or an air force, she could have a navy of only six battleships, and an army of just 100,000 men. In addition, Germany was not allowed to place any troops in their Rhineland, the strip of land, 50 miles wide, next to France. On March 16, 1935 Hitler denounced restrictions <br>  imposed by the Treaty of Versailles and resumed the draft - this was the first of all of those precincts to be broken. In complete violation of the treaty, Hitler invaded the Rhineland in 1936, claiming it was Germany's ancient homeland. He later invaded Poland in his quest for natural resources of coal and iron ore to strengthen his military. Germany was still impeded with enormous debt from WWI reparations.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  World War 2|`|ltqRlQOvaa	Not to sure of your question but here goes.<br>  Adolf Hitler fought in WW1 but led the German invasion in WW2<br>  <br>  The Treaty of Versailles was a 20 year truce which divided up Europe and set the stage for WW2. It demanded that Germany pay war reparations to the victorious countries, some $36 billion plus interest plus a 26% surcharge on exports. The Prime Minister of England at the time, David Lloyd George, said of the treaty, “We have written a document that guarantees war in 20 years ... When you place conditions on a people (Germany) that it cannot possibly keep, you force it to either breech the agreement or to war. Either we modify that agreement, and make it tolerable to the German people, or when the new generation comes along they will try again.”. Lord Curzon the British Foriegn Secretary said “This is no peace, this is only a truce for twenty years!”.<br>  Hitler wanted to free Germany from the stranglehold Britain<br>  and America had on it. He also hated the fact that British and American banks, many run by Jews, had made hundreds of millions of dollars from WW1 and were also likley to make hundreds of millions more from WW2.|`|1SrMF55Daa	Adolph tried to consume full world power in ww2.

70JBG23aaa	Well, in a nutshell, it ended World War 1, leaving Germany paying off huge debts to the Allied Powers. This in itself left Germany in some form of deep recession.

You have to believe you are sexy, and you will be.<br>  <br>  Go back to Marilyn's movies and look at her body language, her facial expressions, the way she uses her voice. Things like speaking in "breathy" tones, leaning forward to show interest, alternating between wide-eyed expressions and lowering your eyes demurely, looking coyly over your shoulder, hell, even just the way you stand are all indicators of sensuality.<br>  <br>  There is a difference between "sexy" and "slutty", though. Did Marilyn dress like a hoochie to be sexy? You shouldn't have to show a lot of skin to be one hot mama... it's better to *hint* and *suggest* the curves of your body than to put the goods on display, if you want to think of it that way.<br>  <br>  Try googling "how to be sexy".

Third, there just isn't enough story here to keep me interested.<br>  <br>  And, if you cannot take criticism when you ASKED if we would read your book, you will have problems getting published.

9iElNpSSaa	I have found that the Yamaha instruments are outstanding, from their student horns to their professional horns.  The Yamaha YAS-475 is an excellent intermediate saxophone and better than some instruments that considered to be “professional” saxophones.  The tone and pitch are very good and the mechanism of the instrument is outstanding.<br>  If you like that instrument, something to consider is stepping up to the YAS-62II.  It is only about $600 more than the YAS-475 and is as good as any saxophone on the market.<br>  <br>  Whenever one of my students needs a new instrument, I will go with them to try out the horns.  We typically play everything available, but each time we end out selecting a Yamaha.<br>  Yamaha is not the only good instrument out there, though.  I am drawn to them and obviously are very happy with them, but you need to go to a good music store that has a selection of saxophones and try them out to see what you like best.  It’s always a good idea to take your tuner and check the intonation of the instruments when trying them out.

Ay, where are they?  <br>    Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—  <br>  While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,         25 <br>    And touch the stubble plains with rosy hue;  <br>  Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn  <br>    Among the river sallows, borne aloft  <br>      Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;  <br>  And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;         30 <br>    Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft  <br>    The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;  <br>      And gathering swallows twitter in the skies. <br>   <br>  <br>  or I wandered lonely as a cloud by william wordsworth:<br>  <br>  I WANDER'D lonely as a cloud<br>  <br>  <br>  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>  When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>  <br>  A host, of golden daffodils;<br>  Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>  Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>  Continuous as the stars that shine<br>  <br>  <br>  And twinkle on the Milky Way,<br>  They stretch'd in never-ending line<br>  <br>  Along the margin of a bay:<br>  Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>  Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>  The waves beside them danced; but they<br>  <br>  <br>  Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>  A poet could not but be gay,<br>  <br>  In such a jocund company:<br>  I gazed -- and gazed -- but little thought<br>  What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>  For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>  <br>  <br>  In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>  They flash upon that inward eye<br>  <br>  Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>  And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>  And dances with the daffodils.|`|LPoDMC4Baa	the search continues|`|8qYvC8Qxaa	try typing best love poems in google

F32uPjAraa	Jacobins , political club of the French Revolution . Formed in 1789 by the Breton deputies to the States-General, it was reconstituted as the Society of Friends of the Constitution after the revolutionary National Assembly moved (Oct., 1789) to Paris. The club derived its popular name from the monastery of the Jacobins (Parisian name of Dominicans), where the members met. Their chief purpose was to concert their activity and to secure support for the group from elements outside the Assembly. Patriotic societies were formed in most French cities in affiliation with the Parisian club. The members were, for the most part, bourgeois and at first included such moderates as Honoré de Mirabeau . The Jacobins exercised through their journals considerable pressure on the Legislative Assembly, in which they and the Feuillants were (1791-92) the chief factions. They sought to limit the powers of the king, and many of them had republican tendencies.|`|7e7cb48ca14510a1f4daeb63d56a4974aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin_(politics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin_(po...</a>

Mark Twain, who wrote "The Diary of Adam and Eve," wasn't trying to stay accurate to Genesis. He was using the well known characters and settings totell a wholly different story.
lPxVt2XYaa	The military situation in Russia was very unstable after the February Revolution.  Arguably the first step towards Civil War was the Kornilov Affair in AUgust & September of 1917 when General Kornilov marched his army towards Petrograd.  They were turned back through negotiation and desertion (his Cossack regiments left his army).<br>  The next major step towards Civil War was not the Bolshevik seizure of power, it was the closure of the democratically elected Constituent Assembly - the body that the Bolsheviks demanded the Provisional Government establish.  The Bolsheviks did not gain a majority - nothing like on - so they shut it down at gunpoint: this angered many in Russia.  The next step was the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which ended Russian participation in WWI.  It gave Germany vast tracts of Ukraine, Russia and the Baltic - again angering many Russians.<br>  Russia was a country with a vast army because of WWI, the Bolsheviks had little control or support, outside of the industrial centres.  Many generals took the opportunity to turn their soldiers on the new government.  However, the anti-Bolshevik (White) forces were never unified.  Many were monarchist, some were anti-Jewish, some were anarchist and they often fought each other, rather than concentrating on fighting the Red Army.  White armies enacted the "White Terror" in areas they captured, killing suspected Bolsheviks and terrorising the local populations.  The Bolsheviks began to win the war because of the White Terror and because their enemies were not united.<br>  See:<br>  Russia, A History - Geoffrey Freeze<br>  Russia, People & Empire 1552 - 1917 - Geoffrey Hoskings|`|GqUFQmBkaa	one tyrant the tsars were replaced by another tyrant, stalin.
lPxVt2XYaa	The Soviet economy under Lenin had two policies.  Firstly, during the Civil War it followed War Communism.  This was state control of all large industrial concerns and the banks and ex-appropriating grain from the peasants (this meant the forcible taking of grain).  This was brought in to solve the food crisis in the cities.  After the Civil War Lenin realised that War Communism was failing - agricultural output was falling dramatically and small businesses were failing.  So he developed the New Economic Policy. This policy let the peasants work the land and sell any surpluses at the markets. And it allowed for<br>  small businesses to operate, whilst large enterprises and the banks were all nationalised. The policy was achieving its aims of kickstarting the Russian economy, ravaged by WWI and the Civil War but was seen by many communists as a retreat from socialism.<br>  Stalin implemented the twin policies of collectivising agriculture and, in industry, the Five Year Plans.<br>  The aims of collectivisation were three-fold; to create a rural working class - peasants were paid wages (lower than urban workers) and the land and machinery was now owned by the collective. Collectivisation as also designed to modernise farming practises to create a surplus to sell abroad for hard currency and to free up manpower as they were needed in the new factories; and finally it was designed to break the peasants as a political force. Peasants in the Soviet Union were deeply religious and conservative, and were seen, therefore, as a potential threat to the regime.<br>  The Five Year Plans built vast factories in places like Stalingrad, Leningrad and other cities across the Soviet Union. They also built hydro-electirc dams, canals, railways and other infrastructural projects. The aim of them was to modernise Soviet industry, to try to bridge the gap between the Western Democracies (including, after 1933 Nazi Germany). The Soviet Union before Stalin was still a backward, almost medieval country, roads were unmade, most people lived in villages in wooden houses and had no electricity, the five year plans changed all that - they created a massive urban working class, most of the country was electrified and in the cities most people lived in new apartments. And, most importantly, they provided the economic, political and social conditions that allowed the country to absorb the Nazi assault beginning in 1941 and to eventually push them all the way back to Berlin.<br>  Neither policy was without a human cost - millions died of starvation in Ukraine, and the Five Year Plans used slave labour. For ordinary workers the conditions were harsh - 14 hour days, 6 days a week were the norm.<br>  See:<br>  <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSnep.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUS...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSfive.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUS...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/collectivisation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/col...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.holodomor.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.holodomor.org/</a><br>  Martin MacCauley - The Soviet Union 1991 - 1917<br>  Alec Nove - Stalinsim and After|`|GqUFQmBkaa	stalins plan gave him more power, while i think lenin used a little of capitalism to try to improve the soviet union
qywhxSctaa	Jamestown helped to pave the way for English colonization in North America by discovering the cash crop of Tobacco, which lured many people Englishmen to North America. These settlers and their descendants would found to the United States we live in today.<br>  <br>  Also, the House of Burgesses, a governing body of Jamestown, introduced the concept that Englishmen living in America have the same rights as those living in England. This factored largely into the mindset of Americans leading up to the Revolutionary War, in which our nation gained its independence.<br>  <br>  Basically, Jamestown helped to attract people to America and began to shape a mindset which later led to our independence. Without Jamestown, the United States might not have become the country it is today. It could have been settled later by non-Englishman or remained Britain's colony to this day.

pI5jKfmaaa	Comparing the Ancient Empires of Rome and China <br>  <br>  The ancient civilization of Rome was far superior to ancient China in many ways, government and leadership being the two most important ways. Rome’s government was more detailed and left no room for error. It was well thought out and the structure was very defined all though out Roman history, while the Chinese government changed every time a new ruler came to power. Rome also produced better leaders like Caesar and Augustus. China’s government lacked the essential parts needed to make a great government and leaders; neither was as great as the Rome’s. <br>  <br>  The structure of the Roman government was far better than China’s government because the Chinese lacked many things the Roman government had. The Roman government was made up of the Senate, Emperor, the Consul and Proconsul, the assemblies, priests, and other Roman officials. The Senate was originally a board of elders who advised the king. Later it became comprised of ex-office holders and its decrees developed the force of law. Often it was understood that a measure had to be approved by the Senate before it could be voted on in the Assembly. The Emperor was like a president. A dictator was put in control over the state only for extreme emergences. The dictator could only hold office for up to six months and while in charge he had absolute power. This allowed the ruler deal with what ever emergences were at hand without having to wast time and go threw the government to get stuff done. The Consul, chief executive officer, could only (theoretically) hold office for one year, and couldn’t be consul for another 10 years. Eventually proconsuls were created, men who were given some of the powers of a consul, especially for commands far from Rome, such as being governors of provinces. The assemblies were the gathering of people to vote on laws and such. The priests also played an important role in the Roman government. There was a Pontifex maximus, and 9 other pontiffs which were like the high priest and other priests. The other Roman officials included Tribunes had the power to veto, Censor had the power to remove unworthy people from senate, Questors financial people, and Aediles supervised public works. There were many more jobs and positions in the Roman government and they all contributed to the success of Rome. <br>  <br>  Chinese government was not as detailed as the Roman’s government. “The Chinese started with the ideal that all power should come from above, from the center, from a single supreme ruler.”(Pye 183) This ruler was called the emperor but was more like a dictator. “Democracy was out of the question in China as it was around 200 BCE in other civilizations.”(Frank) The Chinese never had a permanent senate but during some dynasties there were courts, like the Court of Imperial Clansmen, that dealt with family, state and society matters. There were priests and such but they all answered to the emperor instead of answering to the people like in the Roman government. <br>  <br>  Roman leadership was far more advanced than Chinese leadership in many ways. The Romans has leaders like Julius Caesar, Augustus (formally Octavian), and Justinian. Once theses leaders found a system that worked for Rome they stayed with that system. While that Chinese change their form of government every time a new leader emerged. The leaders of Rome molded, shaped and made Rome a very successful and prosperous state. <br>  <br>  Julius Caesar was a great general for the army and a dictator from 61-44 B.C. He was a great military leader and won many battles. He is better known for his death. The Senate feared that he would disband them but didn’t want to do anything because the people loved him. A group of conspirators assassinated him in 44 B.C. His adopted relative Octavian, whose name is changed to Augustus, would becomes Rome’s first emperor. <br>  <br>  Augustus, Rome’s first emperor from 27 B.C. to 14 A.D, uncanny political abilities and his meticulous attention to detail provided a stable government that brought peace and prosperity to the Roman Empire for the next two hundred years. He wrote the Deeds of the Divine Augustus when he was seventy six. This essentially stated all the things he did in his life and showed how future emperors should lead. During his reign many images of power were built. The temples of Mars, Jupiter Subduer and Thunderer, Apollo, divine Julius, the senate house, the theater of Marcellus, and many more things. <br>  <br>  Justinian was the last great emperor of Rome. He was in power from 527 -565 A.D. He was known as a strong ruler and an excellent administrator. One of his most valuable contributions to modern society was his code of Roman law. He had the best legal scholars of the empire take all the Roman laws on the books from the time of Augustus and condense them into a uniform code of laws. Justinian taxed the people heavily to pay for his wars and for the construction of magnificent buildings in Constantinople|`|3buQDaRDaa	Technology advancements and large empires. These are two areas that could take up a few pages.|`|GbGP60jsaa	World Citizen seems to just talk on and on about Rome in detail while giving very little details and descriptions about China either because you have not or barely done your homework on researching on China or you have focussed only on points where the Romans were stronger.  You seem to just dismiss China altogether by saying that its leaders were dictators and kept changing, thus it was altogether less advanced.  I seriously doubt that you have researched on ancient China so based on bias, you have reached your conclusion and gave yourself a pat on the back for that.  Julius Caesar was a dictator and you called him a great leader while denouncing Chinese emperors as being dictator...  Lets look at some much more reliable source of information instead.

Pip suddenly feels guilt, understanding that he shouldn't have scorned his old friends and past life. I suppose his shame and the example Magwitch sets for him, inspire Pip to become a better, more compassionate person.

VtUPI9Lgaa	pretty good...considering your age and all. i can tell that an eleven year old wrote this, so in retrospective it is not the best piece of literature i have ever read in my entire life though it is not nearly as bad as some of the things i have read before!!! :) anyway, becoming a good author takes time, Patience and practice. you have to gain more experience with your style of writing, see what your highest and weakest points are and try to fix them. <br>  <br>  Anyway, keep working on this story because i think if you keep putting all of your effort into, it could really become something amazing. <br>  <br>  Here are some tips for your book:<br>  <br>  i think that the very beginning is pretty good, you opened your story amazingly though it kind of ran into the main portion of the beginning way too fast. <br>  <br>  You didn't explain very much why Georgia acts they way she is, i mean all of a sudden she starts acting so strange and all. That was confusing, because if Julia knew her since kindergarten than wouldn't she have noticed theses strange quirks by now?<br>  <br>  i think you need a little more description, slow things down a bit. Try talking about the roof they are on top of, the clothes your character is wearing, how old they are, what their personalities are like. Stuff like that!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8af66e0f5870ddabd93a1b53a6c77a62aa	is she a ghost?<br>  <br>  add the rest in details!<br>  <br>  its good.|`|xI8gcYdsaa	This is well written.<br>  Keep up the good work :]|`|EqZ0zBhDaa	I think this is amazing.

If you have intriguing twists and different perspectives, then it could be a good story.<br>  (How is she rich if she's from Pluto? I mean, is she adopted when she gets there or what?)<br>  I fear, though, that you are fast descending the same road that Meyer did, and that's not to say that you will become "hella" rich through nothing. What I mean by that is Meyer didn't really have a plot, and I don't really see one here. What's the conflict? The plot? I mean, where is this going?<br>  <br>  The goal of writing a book is to grip your reader from the very first sentence and promise never to let go. Take them by the hand and lead them through the world and lives that you created, and get them thinking over it and enjoying the journey throughout. Get them to feel for the fiction  and make them start to believe until, at last, you deliver them such a wonderful ending that, after reading that very last sentence, they can close the book with satisfaction. Something else that I always say in which you should remember: "A story is only as brilliant as its ending." So make sure that you know how it will end, for what's the point of starting a journey if you don't know where you're going?|`|GywOmWfIaa	The initial premise sounds intriguing, but I'm afraid I probably wouldn't read anything that contained the word "hella" multiple times. Needs some work, though you have a creative spark so just write it and see if people like it.

There's a good chance you can find it in your local library, otherwise it's 28 bucks(this is the fiction edition. I don't know the cost of non-fiction.). In it, you'll find contact information for agents and presses as well as useful information such as specific interests and wants an agent or press may have. They also list tips for submitting.<br>  Another feature is the sample query letter. Once you investigate, you'll see the importance of the query letter and would probably be best served by jumping right in and writing your own.<br>  A simple google search will also yield a great deal of information so check it out.

F32uPjAraa	The civilization that took root on the mainland is called Mycenaean after the first major archaeological site where this culture was identified. The Mycenaeans, an Indo-European group, were the first speakers of the Greek language. They may have entered Greece at the end of the early Bronze Age; in the middle Bronze Age, or in the Neolithic period. The excavation of exceptionally wealthy graves, and the size and spacing of palace foundations, indicates that the Mycenaeans formed an elite and a chieftan-level society (one organized around the judicial and executive authority of a single figure, with varying degrees of power) by the late Bronze Age (ca. 1600 B.C.). Mycenaean palatial society was at its zenith in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries B.C. At some point in the middle of the fourteenth century, Mycenaeans, whose society stressed military excellence, conquered Knossos and the rest of Crete.|`|U3j7oVflaa	Just read the Wikipedia article... it's too much to go into here.|`|a1PcWRQOaa	you got answered quite well below, but im just gonna add (though i cant remember if it is added there or not) that they were beleived to be warlike because of the massive walls of fortifications they had. the fortifications were much much larger than what was really needed to protect them against battle though so they may have been for prestige as well. the comparison with the minoan society (not the minoan-mycenean society btw) is that the minoan society had no fortifications pretty much and so the mycenaens were considered more warlike.|`|KtmbnW4Naa	They were an ancient greek civilization based of Crete

FLAtdWrmaa	If B&W oldies aren't automatically "out," try all the Errol Flynn movies, including "Robin Hood" and any number of pirate movies.  *Lots* of swordfights!<br>  <br>  A little more recent, and very good, are the Three Musketeers and the Four Musketeers movies made in the 1980's.  I don't remember the names and actors off the top of my head, but Gerard Depardieu was in all of them.  I believe there was a "Man in the Iron Mask" as one movie in the series.   <br>  <br>  They're historically past the Middle Ages, but since none of them are historically accurate, anyway, they're fun and swashbuckling, just like the medjeeval or medieavaloid ones.<br>  <br>  You want a comedy?  Mel Brooks' "Robin Hood: Men in Tights."<br>  <br>  Did you get the recent British television series of "Robin Hood?" (One of the merry men is a little Arab girl freed from slavery.)  It's so inaccurate the history is laughable (the Sheriff of Nottingham wears a Matrix-style Dryz-a-Bone leather coat, for example), but the stories are action-packed and loads of fun.  Each episode is sort-of stand alone, but it does help to watch many or all of them.  I think there are now three seasons' productions available.<br>  <br>  Also inaccurate but fun is "A Knight's Tale."<br>  <br>  A medieval murder mystery, not much (or any?) sword-fighting in it, but plausibly medieval, is "The Name of the Rose," with Sean Connery.  It's set in a monastery with one of the best libraries in Europe, where a series of bizarre and suspicious deaths has occurred.<br>  <br>  Any number of movies based on Shakespeare's plays!  For my money, the Kevin Brannagh ones are the best (his Henry V is excellent).  Remember that no matter how "elevated" an audience Shakespeare wrote for (aristocratic ideas, ideals, and dilemmas), he also was writing for the rowdy elements in "the pit"/the cheap seats -- so he had lots of slapstick in the comedies and lots of sword fights in everything (look how many there are in "Romeo and Juliet" alone).  One of the best "Romeo & Juliet" movies of all time, btw, is the Zefferelli version made in the '70s.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

81ff98a2b59a7150ffd94a3f4604b9e1aa	You have a lot of potential.  Reminds me a bit of Chuck Palaniuk's style, and he's doing great.  <br>  <br>  To find out how to get published, ask someone who IS published.  Sounds crazy, but this could pay off big.  Call famous writers you admire (you'll possibly get their assistant, first), and explain that you are an admirer and an aspiring writer and would like just 5 minutes of the author's time to ask just a few tips, and if you get that conversation granted to you (ask when it would be convenient, don't assume that it will be convenient when you call), only take 5 minutes, thank them at close to the 4 minute mark, and ask if you could call them again sometime - you'd be surprised, they might even say yes.  <br>  <br>  Also, start googling around to see what it takes to connect with an literary agent, how that process works, etc.  Agents know where to sell.  Research can help you find ones with a good reputations.   <br>  <br>  It is harder to peddle a first-time book on your own as an untried author, but of course you can submit books to publishers the old-fashioned way, too.  <br>  <br>  Join a writing club.  Many small towns have them, and I imagine most cities have at least one, if not more.  Writers meet, read their stuff to each other and critique it.  Sometimes they have published authors speak at their gatherings.  Some of the members may already be published, and give good advice and share info on helpful agents, etc.  <br>  <br>  Some people publish their work as e-books, but that is a whole other business to learn...and usually, it isn't fiction.  <br>  <br>  Writers Digest is a great resource, they might carry that periodical at your library, or you can subscribe to it.  <br>  <br>  I agree that many people don't read books anymore, but for those of us who LOVE having a book in our hands, don't give up on your dream of writing and having a book published.|`|Nq2HzAHgaa	i love the descriptions but its not necessary to desbribe the minor details likde pushing the button for an elevator. the beginning was kind of confusing but the whole plot seems very interesting. i would deffinetly read your story if it were published. great job keep it up:)|`|8jnGdTQ6aa	This is really good. Your style of writing is very unique. I've often wondered myself if teenagers can publish books, because I'm very into writing stories. Anywho, goodluck (:|`|qXREoORzaa	It is very good, but you can't just "get" published. You need to prepare a manuscript and send it off to publishing houses. My advice is to make it easy to read(font) and make it stand out so the publisher would be inclined to read it.<br>  <br>  I reckon what you wrote is very good, and i would be interestedd to read it :)|`|CsjQ8kIkaa	WOW I LOVED IT U CAN GROW UP AND BECOME A RIGHTER IS WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|hoGpOrOUaa	From what I've read you seem pretty good and although I think you can write I don't have much information about publishing.<br>  <br>  The plot sounds interesting and you have a nice variety of vocabulary which are the main two things really.<br>  The only advice I give you is to stop starting every sentance with "I" <br>  It's obvious that you like to be very discriptive but try going about it with a different approach and varied sentance structures.<br>  Other than that, good work. :)|`|Uaobd0ODaa	I wanted to be a writer too, but people don't really read books anymore. Try different media forms like film scripts, or even writing for computer games etc.|`|SiYgCLfUaa	wow!this is stupendous!its awesome and amazing! you may be the first 14 year old author i know excellent:]
ZsCAXId7aa	The poem can be better than that if you'll polish it a bit. The biggest problem of this poem is the repetition of "click click slide" - try to use this only once or twice, not so long ... otherwise your readers will get bored and this doesn't help you. The repetitions are good to be used in certain passages to create a certain flow or to point out different artifacts.<br>  <br>  Also, try not to use such words like "inexorably" in a poem where the rest of its expressions are quite simple of understanding.

The only thing he can move is his left eye, and he also uses this to communicate because he cannot speak, which you will find out if you read the story. He spends the last days of his life in a hospital with physical and speech therapists. He relies on his imagination and his memory to keep himself entertained. <br>  <br>  It's an excellent book, depressing but certainly meaningful. It makes you realize all of the things we as humans take for granted in life, such as simple things like verbal communcation, and just eating a meal.|`|9mLGFqdxaa	Not A Sparrow Falls by Linda Nichols<br>  <br>  its a REALLY good book.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mary Bridget Washburn was tired of running, tired of being haunted by the empty shell her life had become. How in the world did the little girl she'd once been now become a woman on the wrong side of the law? Determined to make a new start, she escapes to the quaint city of Alexandria, Virginia, where she takes on her mother's identity and finds sanctuary in the shadow of a decades-old church. But a little girl's plea proves her undoing, and the Reverend...well, someone's got to open his eyes before disaster comes calling. Can Mary Bridget hide her tainted past long enough to bring hope to a family falling apart?|`|Lz26O1Uvaa	The Road by Cormac McCarthy<br>  <br>  edit: the book is about a father and his son trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world.|`|6aNGt00Baa	I'd say 'Mao's Last Dancer', the autobiography of Li Cunxin. It was picked out as a novel for Year 9 English this year, but besides that, it was already on my list of books to read. I think the assessments and questions have only helped me further grasp the concepts and themes of the story itself.<br>  <br>  It follows the life of peasant boy Li Cunxin, who was brought up in poverty in a rural Chinese village during the communist reign of Chairman Mao. This man's wife decided to start up a ballet company, and so scouts went out all over the country to choose kids of all ages to audition for a spot. Cunxin gets chosen, and so, he's plucked out of his poverty, and taken to Beijing, where rationing food is no longer an issue, and he gets a single bed all to himself (things that we all seem to take for granted). He's only about eight years old or something at this stage, and the book follows him all through to when he's eighteen, as he becomes one of Madame Mao's dancers. It's quite cultural, and it gives unbelievable insight into the shock of a communist time and country; how they weren't allowed any outside "western filth" of influences and how utterly strict they had it.<br>  <br>  It's all about reaching one's dream and career success, as well as personal conflict and stretching further in order to help one's family. I was quite touched by it, and in between, it has quite a few fables that give some nice life lessons. I found it meaningful, and I'd recommend it to anyone. So, have a look. =]|`|g5SuUdCQaa	Try:<br>  The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger. <br>  - A love story about a man with a strange disorder that causes him to unpredictably time travel, and his wife, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences.<br>  <br>  Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami<br>  - Toru's reminiscences we see him develop relationships with two very different women — the beautiful yet emotionally troubled Naoko, and the outgoing, lively Midori.<br>  <br>  The Castle by Franz Kafka<br>  - dark & surreal, it is about alienation, bureaucracy, and the seemingly endless frustrations of man's attempts to stand against the system.<br>  <br>  Enjoy! :)|`|jPxJHZGqaa	The color purple its a really good book and it made me cry.|`|9MzouWVSaa	Bless Me Ultima, To Kill a Mocking Bird, The Last Don

I would advise you to highlight the actions of women who are less publicized. I mean you could go for the cliches (), but there are so many women who did great things that people generally don't know about. Here are some lesser known female movers and shakers:<br>  <br>  Indira Gandhi- first woman prime minister of India and daughter of Gandhi<br>  <br>  Valentina Tereshkova- the first woman in space (1968) beating Sally Ride by almost two decades<br>  <br>  Alice Paul- radical feminist and suffragist who formed the NWP and helped to ratify the 19th amendment<br>  <br>  Sojourner Truth- abolitionist and feminist known for her famous "Ain't I a Woman" speech at the Seneca Falls convention<br>  <br>  Coco Chanel- (who I adore after learning about her story)- revolutionized the fashion world by making clothing designed especially for women in mind of comfort and function rather that what men deemed fashionable-- definitely check out her back story though<br>  <br>  Mary Wollstonecraft- famous for her "Vindication of the Rights of Women" and mother of Mary Shelley- the author of "Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus" a book noted for its criticism of many ideals of the Enlightenment<br>  <br>  One that might be more funny for you to do is a report on "Lucy", our oldest living ancestor, an Australopithecus. Her discovery revolutionized the way we think about evolution.<br>  <br>  This should get you moving. Hope it helps. <br>  <br>  If all else fails, go to the library and see if in the reference section there is a book called: "The Women's Chronology: A Year-By-Year Record, from Prehistory to the Present" by James Trager. It only goes up to 1994, but it starts with Lucy and goes to the end of the twentieth century.|`|pFlvqhhjaa	Margaret Thatcher.

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	The squirrel refers to the term "to squirrel away" meaning to save. Squirrels bury acorns and other nuts during the summer and fall so that they have something to eat during the winter.<br>  <br>  The squirrel asks why people didn't save money during good times to help them out during hard times. The man responds, "I did," because people who kept their money in banks often lost everything when the banks failed. The FDIC was a New Deal response to that, where depositors' savings are guaranteed by the federal government.<br>  <br>  To change the point of view you might use a fat banker rather than a slim, middle class man.

And if you were just reading the New Testament, the first 30 pages of that is pretty much the book of Matthew, in which case you'd have the title. And I wouldn't call the New Testament a "well written story" exactly, it jumps all over the place. It also talks about Jesus in the Qu'ran, but I'm pretty sure he's not mentioned in the first 30 pages of that one either. Hmm...|`|2GNFQPdmaa	ur a funny guy.
