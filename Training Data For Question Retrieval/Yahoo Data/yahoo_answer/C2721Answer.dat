stCyrS4Eaa	Mongrel-<br>  Among pets, one whose parentage is of unknown or mixed breeds as opposed to purebred. <br>  Among dogs, this is also called a mutt or a mixed-breed dog. Owners of mixed-breeds in the USA refer to their dogs as "All American" when involved in competitive sports. <br>  <br>  Mutt-<br>  A mixed-breed dog, also called a mutt, mongrel, tyke, cur, bitzer, feist or random-bred dog, is a dog that has characteristics of two or more types of breeds, or is a descendant of feral or pariah dog populations. The term "mixed-breed" is a misnomer, as it does not indicate the offspring of dogs of known or pure breeding.<br>  <br>  Answer-<br>  Any of the above!|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	A mutt.|`|zeTGmB3faa	A mutt is a mutt, a mixed breed dog. Over mating periods different breeds and mixed breeds are involved so it winds up being a lot of something and something. It's all OK. My mixed breed is the best dog in the world.|`|24CFl7sjaa	another mutt.<br>  I do actually use the phrase 'crossbreed' for a first generation cross between two known breeds and a 'mongrel' or 'mutt' as a dog of mixed parentage that is undecipherable.. ie bit of this bit of that, 'bitzer' or heinz57.|`|icaatrmhaa	Mutt-tri-ation (dog mutation) or a tri-mutt. : )<br>  Really though, it's still just a mutt. No matter<br>  how many dogs it's mixed with.|`|YxGyd2yZaa	Still a mutt. You can have 4 dogs mixed and it is still a mutt.|`|qEOJzbJraa	A Mutt.. No more, no less.|`|bchci2Dkaa	2 is a mutt, three or more is a mongrel.|`|a2lDcOAXaa	A mutt is a dog that is more than 1 dog breed.|`|Qd3sjE3raa	a mutt it doesnt make a difference|`|OE4UYtWgaa	Mutt+Mutt+Mutt=Mutt|`|lpd6Zm1faa	Still a mutt|`|34uWa9kHaa	a mutt
QVP8zSuWaa	I would strongly recommend a professional trainer or behaviorist. It's good that you are recognizing the problem and want to fix it.|`|OE4UYtWgaa	Dog aggression sometimes just happens. It doesn't mean they will attack you or any other person. It just means they will not tolerate any other dogs in their presence. Contacting a trainer that offers individual training sessions should be your first step. Once your dog has mastered basic obedience training, then go on to intermediate training with a class of other owners and dogs.|`|x3okxXX4aa	It sounds like in the begging you didn't really have a strong discipline force, when the dog misbehaves, like attacking another dog or getting very protective over its ball, you need to scold the dog and make them understand this is a negative action, obviously by scold i mean a bold yell not hitting possibly using vinegar water in a spray bottle, but also u need to reinforce positive actions by use of treats and positive enforcing. hope that helps|`|I2szCBS5aa	I am having a similar problem with my dog. Try talking to a animal behaviorist. Sorry i can't help that much.
as3EF0BSaa	It's never too old to learn.  If they hear something they like, they pick it up immediately.  Take the time to talk to your budgie, when you clean the cage, whenever you walk by the cage.  Get one of the 'endless' teaching tapes and put your own phrase or word on it.<br>  <br>  It is recommended to teach your bird it's address and/or phone number!   Nobody plans to lose a bird but it happens.  There are many stories of birds being returned because they knew an address or phone #!!|`|9uEZSIvhaa	First, You need to teach them what to say. You just have to repeatedly say something to your budgie. My budgie can only say Mr pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee! (his name is mr peepers, so yeah) and he is 3 years old. It all depends :) Give it some time|`|QB0CnrmJaa	It is very hard to teach budgies to talk, so don't expect any fast process.<br>  <br>  If you would like it to say "hello" say "hello" to is constantly and give it a treat when it gets close.<br>  <br>  Wow, this is very hard to explain how to do, but good luck anyways! <br>  <br>  Hope this helped! :)|`|9NrjExV9aa	He might be too old... does he already warble in his bird language? By that time, it's usually too late since he's already learned another language...
lTeXIjpOaa	it might depend on the type of fish, when you travel from one country to another they are very strict about having plants, food, animals with you, some animals carry disease and some can become a nuisance species; with larger animals you have to have health papers and sometimes animals are quarantined; would you be buying the fish from a company or is a friend sending them to you?|`|xy1l1SNJaa	it depends on what type of boat or airplane you want the fish shipped on because im mean the coast guard dosent care about boats/airplanes going to india<br>  <br>  i wanted some fish from a website in the u.k. to get some red line torpedo barb (puntius denosonii) and their factory shipped from india and when i tried to order a disclaimer for the fish acts group or something popped up and it turns out that all (puntius denosonii) have to be bred in like pools and tanks now|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	It's a very expensive thing to do. On aquabid.com there are several worldwide shippers. What they don't tell you is that you may pay $5 for a group of 4 fish and then pay over $100 with shipping, re-bagging, import fees, handling fees, box fee, heat packs, more shipping. It's all hidden fees from the transhipper.<br>  <br>  It would also be a good idea to confirm which species are legally allowed to travel to the chosen country. There are species that aren't allowed to cross state or country lines. Apple snails are one example. I think you need a large stack of paperwork to ship those nationally.
QVP8zSuWaa	They are one of my favorite small breeds, I would say the main difference yow will encounter would be not stepping on it and you have to bend over more<g>|`|pc7ZjexJaa	papillons are great dogs!<br>  <br>  a big dog in a little dogs skin|`|eDySIDPQaa	They are little dogs, and love to please and be with their humans all the time..we have several in our dog club, and they are the class clowns,  I love their attitudes so much<br>  <br>  You will get use to it, a large dog in a small size body, but the heart the size of King Kong.......love them|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	I have a Papillon and they are great dogs!<br>  <br>  They are like big dogs in small dog bodies.  Don't worry about the size.  Also, some Papillons can get pretty big.  You could get a large one.  It will cost less than a larger dog, which is good, too!|`|stCyrS4Eaa	Papillons are wonderful little dogs. Keep in mind that some have problems with their teeth & they have little bladders and need to be taken out more often than a larger dog.|`|2Xr3m0X9aa	yah sure why not|`|MR4LFMY0aa	go for it!!! if it meets everything in your requirements besides size is pretty good! smaller dogs cost less to take care of too!
P8CBDLiKaa	It's just play, sorta like kids playing tag.|`|m81dfyOYaa	My two dogs are constantly chasing the cat, who by the way isn't afraid of them even if they tag team him. He's old and a tease. He goes in the basement to sleep and hangs out in the house at night when the dogs are safely put away and asleep.|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	It's just a form of animals communicating. Dogs are far more social than cats and if the cat runs away, the dog thinks that it is a game. Make sure your cat has a quiet place of its own away from the dog.|`|2Xr3m0X9aa	no he is trying to annoy her most likely kinda like a little brother just to have a little fun i guess or he may think since you don't he needs to two just an idea|`|VQlkO7lqaa	He'[s trying to play with her|`|AA10500537	its trying to play with her ,<br>  it doesn;t realize cats sleep all day.

Not sure how the danios will act with one being long finned..<br>  <br>  but that sounds like it could work, probably best to stay away from the frog...<br>  <br>  <br>  Also Cleaning a tank is easy.<br>  <br>  Theres water changes (W/C) you simply take out water and put some back in with conditioner.<br>  <br>  Theres Siphoning (Gravel Vac)  which you use on the top bit of gravel/sand to clean up stuff and in turn it takes water out. So siphoning is a W/C to..<br>  <br>  you should W/c once a week atleast.. and You shoud siphon atleast once every two weeks, to avoid cleaning out all the good bacteria..<br>  <br>  Some people recommend more, but I don't see the need with your stocking levels..<br>  <br>  The bioloads on the fish are low..<br>  <br>  Stay away from the frog, and best of wishes.<br>  <br>  Also you should probably go pick up 2 more long fin danios to..|`|jnzSz3tRaa	if you want the zebra danios, you have to get rid of long finned and dwarf frog or they will nip at their tales and toes|`|qGpiWuATaa	that sounds overcrowded...|`|xy1l1SNJaa	yes theyll work but you might want rocks (above the water line) for the dwarf frog to stand on and theyre extremely slow so i would get him some sinking carnivore pellets or only feed him when hes on his little rock pedestle. <br>  <br>  P.S. always remember it about 20 to 24 in of fish for every 288in sq of surface area (width X length) and you could probably make his little pedestal out of some thin piece of rock (glued to the side of the aquarium with non-toxic aquarium glue) and slanted down into the water so he can get onto it.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	those fish should be fine together i will say that the frogs are a pain at times. i have had one jump out of its bowl. see this vid. for cleaning a fish tank <a href="http://www.expertvillage.com/video/81723_keeping-fish-water-changes-two.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertvillage.com/video/81723...</a> this laddie gives good advice
hKXIeur6aa	They are suffocating. Go to WAL*MART right now and buy the biggest tank you can, preferably at least a 29 gallon tank. Buy a filter, heater, chlorine remover, gravel and some decorations if you like. <br>  <br>  Once you get home. Fill the tank and add the amount of chlorine remover needed(see the instructions). Set up the filter and set the heater to 76. Rinse the gravel and the decorations in the bath tub to remove dust and then add to the tank. Now, slowly add the fish to the tank. LEAVE THE LIGHTS OFF.<br>  <br>  This is your fishes' only chance at survival and they may not make it through.|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	Your problem is simple, No fish Not even a goldfish will live long in a bowl.<br>  <br>  A catfish no matter the type needs a bigger tank, and depending on the size, usually big tanks.<br>  <br>  They need heaters to.<br>  <br>  Expect your fish to die. <br>  <br>  Also.. Loose the bowl and go buy a 10G starter set.
97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Heaters usually takes 24 Hours before they reach the desired temperature, also make sure that the watts of the heater suits the size of your aquarium otherwise it will never come to the right temperature, but i am pretty much sure it's because the heater hasn't been operating for 24 hours, so be patient and it will eventually reach that 26*C.|`|AA11708471	the light turns off when it is at the right temperature. The area around the heater may bet at 26c but the other side of the tank may be 21c I suggest you create some sort of current to mix it all up. Or the heater may be faulty.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	heaters need to settle down from new .it depends on the type you have.the bi metric type take quite a while to bed in.so i suggest you wait for a couple of days on the setting it is on now.no heater is really accurate and a lot is trial and error to set.if it does not settle down take it back as faulty.<br>   hope this helps|`|FocBqCqlaa	Dont worry, the heater is working, because the light comes on when its warming up. It should. There's nothing wrong with it, its perfectly normal for it to act like this, the heat goes up and down all the time, it just means the heater is over heating and it has reached 26*c at that point, so it turns the heat off for a while, and then when it goes below 21*c it starts to warm back up again. Its fine dont worry!<br>  Hope this helped you ;) (p.s. mine is exactly the same)
AUD1wZ5Kaa	It might be a parasite that's sucking blood from her. A parasitic relationship. I had a friend who's goldfish had a small black dot on it and it soon died after a few weeks. Maybe it's something like at ich (sorry if spelling's wrong), and have you cleaned your fish tank's water?|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	No one, not even a the best fish keeper could tell you whats wrong,<br>  <br>  You have to provide more then that.<br>  <br>  Tank Conditions...<br>  Ph, Hardness, Temp .. Ect..<br>  <br>  and I will assume you don't do that and thats probably the cause.
pYF9KnNeaa	Are you positive this is a female bird?  It could be but the behavior you describe I see more often from male birds who are becoming sexually mature.  The covering is something they do with the female when mating or trying to.  Trying to position the tail over you hand is also sexual behavior.  Pretty much all male birds and some females, masturbate.  It's normal and you should not get upset about it.  At least don't show your displeasure to the bird.  It's only doing what comes naturally.  They may use a favorite toy, a perch or your hand.  If it is offensive to you, don't make a big deal of it.  Just set her/him off on a perch or some place until it passes.   Male or female, at least most of this behavior should pass as soon as hormone season is over.  But expect it again next year and from now on.  I hope this helps and eases you mind that there is nothing wrong.  Certainly no need to go tearing off to the vet, only for what you have described.|`|8zbSrlY3aa	aweee! She is probably trying to "romance" your hand.I've seen many parrots do this. This is usually how they act, she is sexually mature! It is fine if she does this but don't encourage her too much it can become compulsive =S<br>  Does she make little noises when she does this?|`|QB0CnrmJaa	I don't know, but maybe you should just let her sit on your finger with her feet perched on them and see if she still does it.<br>  <br>  That is very strange. If is continues, please see a vet for the poor little thing, she may be injured.|`|F5vsY4rOaa	Tell you a secret birds hump buy her a plushy perch and she will transfer her attentions to the stationary object|`|iPLKizKuaa	see a vet|`|fepR6vCUaa	i think your really lucky to have a bird like that i think she is being protective or just loves to be around you|`|HOJC9O2Vaa	maybe to keep himself warm or to leave his scent on you.|`|v6coHbIeaa	A lot of females do this she is romanceing you.
j2albguDaa	go to the dog whisperer website and look for help there.  you can even write him to see if he will come out to your house.  the dogs just need a good trainer that knows what they're doing.  none of them need to be put to sleep, so don't let anyone tell you that.  dogs that are jealous or protective do become a problem.  just ask around your area a lot for recommendations on a trainer.  it's going to take time, so don't give up on them.
AA10733253	make sure that you mantain its wait. dont leave food out all the time so that it eats as it pleases, b/c pugs are known to gain wheight to fast and it can be a health problem. try making a schedule like feed it in the morning, noon, and evening. but vet-reconmended portions at each meal. aslo, after it gets older, its good to keep the skin between the wrinkles clean, b/c they sometimes can get infections from dirt getting built up between the tight area of skin. hope thsi helps. :)|`|0b486a908f3be776bb0f48a9c29166d1aa	Never ever ever leave your pug outside in very hot weather for very long.

AA10001139	Eu gosto muito das dicas do site Bioterium: <a href="http://www.bioterium.com.br/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bioterium.com.br/</a><br>  <br>  Lá você pode achar fotos, trocar idéias e, quem sabe, até descobrir que tipo de lagarto ou calango você achou.<br>  <br>  Olha que legal o tipo de texto que você pode achar lá:<br>  <br>  Lagartos<br>  <br>  Os répteis possuem grande distribui??o geográfica e seu simbolismo é muito grande. As serpentes do gênero Naja apresentam diferentes conota??es que v?o desde a fertilidade à sabedoria.<br>  <br>  As Sucuris s?o temidas e mortas gratuitamente por "comerem até seres humanos" enquanto jacarés s?o criados como animais de estima??o no pantanal mato-grossense...<br>  <br>  Os lagartos apresentam uma distribui??o geográfica bastante ampla, n?o ocorrendo apenas nas regi?es muito geladas da Terra.<br>  <br>  <br>  A ocorrência de determinadas espécies numa localidade está diretamente associada a alguns elementos que s?o vitais para o seu desenvolvimento: temperatura, umidade, ilumina??o e alimenta??o específica. <br>  <br>  Lembre-se muito bem disso quando quiser ter um lagarto em casa e achar que é "simples" mantê-lo vivo... <br>  <br>  <br>  Os répteis diurnos, principalmente os lagartos arborícolas, necessitam de quantidades maiores de luz ultravioleta do Tipo B (cerca de 5 à 8 %, o máximo disponível nas lampadas especiais para répteis).<br>  <br>  <br>  Répteis de hábitos noturnos, anfíbios e serpentes requerem muito pouco (abaixo de 2 %) porém o excesso n?o é prejudicial.<br>  <br>  A pele dos lagartos apresenta uma série de pigmentos chamados de cromatóforos. Eles s?o os responsáveis pela altera??o da colora??o da pele (principalmente nos diurnos), que muitas vezes acontece em poucos segundos. <br>  <br>  A cor adquirida pela pele é importante pois, dependendo da colora??o, o animal recebe ou reflete a luz e os comprimentos de onda que ele necessita. Esta varia??o de colora??o também é utilizada para o mimetismo (a capacidade que um animal tem de se confundir com o meio ambiente).<br>  <br>  Os cromatóforos necessitam também de um outro tipo de luz ultravioleta, a UV-A (presente na luz solar), sem ela a colora??o da pele, dos animais esverdeados, torna-se amarelada com aspectos de ferrugem. <br>  <br>  Normalmente as lampadas especiais para répteis que emitem radia??o UV-B (fluorescentes) produzem UV-A mas as que emitem apenas UV-A (incandescentes) n?o produzem radia??o UV-B. <br>  <br>  Os lagartos possuem uma diversificada alimenta??o: vermes, insetos, crustáceos, larvas, flores, frutas, legumes, folhagens, ovos, peixes e outros anfíbios e répteis..., ra??es, etc....<br>  <br>  Devemos ter em mente que mesmo, por exemplo, oferecendo insetos a um animal insetívoro, a diversidade encontrada pelo animal na natureza é enorme e a nossa disponibilidade, normalmente, é pequena. <br>  <br>  Assim é importante mencionar a necessidade de oferecer, junto com a alimento, suplementos minerais e complexos vitamínicos. <br>  <br>  Podemos destacar dentre os principais as vitaminas A, D, C, B e E além de cálcio e fósforo. <br>  <br>  A frequência de alimenta??o varia de espécie para espécie e do tamanho do animal. <br>  <br>  Filhotes e jovens comem com menor intervalo. <br>  <br>  A maioria dos répteis e dos anfíbios s?o ca?adores por natureza e raramente aceitam alimentos inanimados. <br>  <br>  Precisam do movimento da presa para ativar seu instinto de ca?a e a captura do alimento. <br>  <br>  Artifícios para "balan?ar" os alimentos industrializados ou mortos, como pin?as e vibradores, s?o usados com muita eficácia. <br>  <br>  A administra??o de vitaminas e suplementos é praticamente diária para algumas espécies. <br>  <br>  A quantidade é semelhante a uma "pitada de sal num ovo frito", ou seja muito pouco. <br>  <br>  Deve ser misturado ao alimento ou aderido ao exoesqueleto dos insetos. <br>  <br>  Para fazer isto basta colocar os insetos dentro de um saco plástico, com um pouco de suplemento ou vitamina em pó, e agitar rapidamente. <br>  <br>   VITAMINA FONTES NATURAIS ATIVIDADE NO ORGANISMO<br>   <br>  A FíGADO, VEGETAIS VERDES ESCUROS E CENOURA Bom para a vis?o, pele e glandulas, refor?a o sistema imunológico e é fundamental para o crescimento e fertilidade. <br>  B CARNE VERMELHA E FíGADO Promove a divis?o celular e o metabolismo das células nervosas. Utilizada na síntese proteica. <br>  C FRUTAS e VEGETAIS Aumenta a imunidade contra doen?as contagiosas. <br>  D3 GEMA DE OVO e FíGADO Promove o crescimento e a regenera??o dos ossos. <br>  E CARNE Promove o desenvolvimento muscular e auxilia na postura e paridade dos filhotes. <br>  K óLEOS e GORDURAS ANIMAIS Ajuda na coagula??o do sangue. <br>  <br>  <br>  A SEXAGEM muitas vezes é difícil de ser realizada. <br>  <br>  Alguns machos apresentam caracteres externos bem definidos, como as cristas cefálicas e dorsais dos machos de basiliscos e os chifres dos machos de certas espécies de camale?es. <br>  <br>  Várias espécies de machos de lagartos apresentam escamas salientes e mais desenvolvidas, utilizadas para excitar a fêmea, durante a reprodu??o.<br>  <br>  Quando estas estruturas est?o presentes nas coxas s?o chamadas de poros femorais (principalmente em iguanídeos e agamídeos).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Quando localizados um pouco antes da cloaca s?o conhecidos como poros pré-anais (principalmente em geckonídeos).<br>  <br>                                                         <br>  <br>  As fêmeas também apresentam estes poros, só que  pouco desenvolvido. é necessário ter prática para reconhecer e evidenciar, com seguran?a, os poros dos machos dos das fêmeas.<br>  <br>  A forma mais correta e segura de se realizar a sexagem é através de sexadores.

AA10327148	Ask your pharmacist for postpartum perineal spray..it is over the counter, in women's health section..any that are recommended for spaying the bottom after women birthing is safe for your dog.  Just spray wherever she itches...<br>  <br>  You can give your dog an enema..but it is messy.. i don't know if you want to do that..but, using a small bulb syringe, just squirt about 1 Tablespoon of mildly soapy water in her rectum..<br>  Your vet sounds terribly uncaring,,to suggest that post surgical itching is allergy related.. In the future you should find another vet.|`|135f8e1b537022556ef4671dd836a765aa	I'm not sure how this problem is related to the surgery, but the poor dog sounds miserable.  Sounds like the dog either has hemorrhoids OR the gland near its butt is clogged up, which is a common problem with this breed.  The gland may need to be lanced. I would take the dog back to the vet asap and have the vet take a look at it, OR take the dog to another vet OR animal emergency place.  As far as Pumpkin...if that's what you use to treat the "runs", then I would NOT give this to your dog because your dog is having the opposite problem.  It CAN'T POOP as opposed to POOPING ALL OVER THE PLACE!! Good luck!  Poor doggie...:(|`|69b39bf7d317295b9731843d5736dc72aa	A spayed puppy should not have a swollen itchy rectum, and if she's crying, she's definitely having pain associated with it.<br>  <br>  Absolutely take your dog to another vet to check this out.  <br>  If she didn't have these problems before the spay, it's a little to trite to just start slinging "allergy" around.<br>  <br>  Spay surgery should be quick and painless for the dog. .I'm not very impressed with your vet, and I think the second vet should examine her really well.<br>  <br>  Also, the answerer below mentioned pumpkin, which IS helpful for diarrhea, but you would NEVER give it to a dog who is constipated or having other bowel issues!<br>  <br>  Best wishes - please let us know what happens.

The best advice I can give is to take the puppy to a different vet- this one doesn't sound very competent at all. Find a new place, let them run tests or do whatever. The fact that this is happening just after having been spayed suggests something really serious could be wrong.|`|AA10029366	Constipation can be a side effect of the anesthesia -- a little bit of plain yogurt in her food might help, or a pinch of Metamucil. You could also try a couple of teaspoons of Mineral Oil. I'm sure other people might have other good "natural laxative" ideas.<br>  <br>  The itching, on the other hand, should not have had anything to do with the spay surgery. Was she doing it before she was spayed, at all?<br>  <br>  If your vet isn't doing a satisfactory job, you may want to get a second opinion, especially about the itching.

ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I've never had any luck with Otomax, but that's just me.<br>  <br>  What has worked for me is a homemade recipe called Blue Power Ear Treatment.  Google it and you'll find lots of sites that have the recipe.  I was skeptical, but I finally tried it on my allergic basset after I'd tried EVERYTHING else.  Within two days I saw improvement, and I did get his ears completely cleared up.  This was a dog whose ears were so bad they were oozing yellow pus and you couldn't even clean them because if you dabbed at them gently they would start to bleed.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the ear infections will likely come back unless you are able to resolve the allergies issue.  I was able to do that with my dog using diet alone, but I realize some dogs are allergic to more than food.|`|39c4d35ef5b420dbf742cb6cf8ed9f4baa	Hi!!<br>  Telltale signs of the problem "ear mites" can be seen if you actually look into the ear. The ear may appear red and inflamed from all the scratching and although you will not see the mite culprit, there will be indications that it exists. You may notice a build up of wax within the ear as well as numerous black specks (likely spots of dried blood). In those cases where the ear mites have not been treated immediately or effectively, the mites will actually move down into the ear canal and cause an infection of the middle ear. This means that the animal may appear to be off balance and might be unable to hold its head up straight. Please look article: <a href="http://www.askedweb.com/askedweb/Remedies_To_Cure_Ear_Mites/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askedweb.com/askedweb/Remedie...</a> - Remedies To Cure Ear Mites<br>  <br>  Otomax is indicated for the treatment of canine acute and chronic ear infections associated with yeast and/or susceptible bacteria. It is a highly effective combination treatment for outer ear infections. This medicine contains a corticosteroid, a broad-spectrum antibacterial and an antifungal. Otomax treats stubborn infections, while reducing inflammation of the ear, but if otomax  is not working ....

But if you clean the dogs ear and then wipe the goop on a piece of white paper and you notice the goop moving, it would be ear mite.  The pet stores have good things to buy for ear mites.
df3d96f24e02c6eba3666207b89950a5aa	Gentle Giant Canines, just so you know (I noticed you live in America, I live in Brisbane Australia like the OP) in our country it is law that your dog has to be registered. The law isn't referring to your dog being registered as a breed, you just have to register with the council to say that you have a dog. The dog can be any breed whatsoever. Registering your dog here just means that the council can keep track of the number of domestic dogs living in the country. Like I said, it is compulsory and you will be fined if the council finds out you own a dog and it isn't registered.<br>  <br>  To the original poster, breed and age doesn't matter but the rego fee is more than double if your dog isn't desexed.|`|aa4aa2d316cccc52d7736fc1f640b655aa	Your town may list this price on their website if they have one. Mine does, it's around $16. if the dog isn't neutered and $9. if it is. Again, that's where I live. And you don't have to do it until they are older than 6 months.|`|821764557152878fb2168e2bc6aa01ebaa	Well, I would not waste my money on registering your female as she is spaded.

NO castrarlo es la más FáCIL, pero normalmente conlleva una irresponsabilidad grande, porque luego no nos hacemos cargo de la cría.

La opción de castrarlo implica, creo, una responsabilidad inicial respetable, a menos que -claro- te hagas cargo de las crías de tu gato y ayudes al due?o o due?a de la gata a colocar en un hogar como el tuyo, con alguien que los vaya a cuidar, a todos los gatitos.-<br>  <br>  Salu2<br>  .|`|0fc291da3dee6f602c8cd29f5d5d4c4aaa	Lo mejor es la castración...|`|783c9a6b939ec5bb0ff79807f9175a25aa	capalo|`|1f5f6c20f070c5aab9a14e0479560a9daa	definitivamente operarlo es la mejor opcion porque se enferman si no se cruzan (no es broma), y asi evitas que caiga en pleitos callejeros y que no te deje dormir por sus maullidos.|`|7962ee476b54977385435c9ff502b5ffaa	es una cosa que tiene que decirlo el propio propietario pues todo son molestias para si mismo y los vecinos, con mi perra tuve que hacerlo pues todos los perros se meaban en la acera y puerta de mi casa, con esta operación el animal está más tranquilo y nosotros también.|`|bab54eafd02ed1ebd744cfb03e1ec51caa	Castralo, es lo más recomendable, por un lado no sufrirá en el celo si no sale y por otro lado, evitarás que haya tantos gatos callejeros que sufren de hambre y maltratos, lo más humano es castrarlo.|`|cc3ce3cda6060517188dea10ec89a31faa	No por favor, no le quietes su virilidad....|`|efc77d7291b3e310cc7f11ef26fbeecbaa	si tu fueras gato te gustaria que te caparan?|`|118363bcadfc72e85dc00bf98ed72d6baa	Caparlo solo resulta en un bienestar para el gato, ya que evitas que salga a pelearse con otros gatos, se vuelven caseros, evitas que la poblacion de gatos callejeros y sus sufrimientos aumenten......Lo mas responsable y BUENO para  la salud  del gato (hembra o macho) es esterilizarlo...|`|16ed3625bc512ed1e8bcd1860cda034eaa	Si no quieres mas gatitos pues pobre gato ................|`|80276214430336ea151ce20f9f15b5f8aa	Para mí la decisión más responsable, siempre que no seas criadora y no te dediques a la venta de animales, es que le castres.

Te comento que tengo un gatito de 4 meses, no es de raza ni nada, alguien sin corazón lo dejó abandonado junto a sus 2 hermanos y yo me agarre uno. <br>  Respecto a tu pregunta, siempre hemos tenido gatos en mi casa, machos y hembras pero en el caso de las hembras cuando entran en celo y salen a buscar "pareja" a veces no pueden regresar a la casa y se pierden. Con ellas es mas compliado porque hay que ligarlas o poner inyecciones para no embarazarse o sino directamente para que no entren en celo.<br>  En el caso de los machos, no entran en celo pero las hormonas femeninas los llaman y se van también y muchas veces no pueden regresar tampoco o se hacen muy callejeros.<br>  El vete me ha recomendado que lo cape cuando tenga 6 meses de edad porque luego es muy dificil. Y también luego de capados y con una buena alimentación (preferible de cat chow y esas) se ponen bellos aunq no sean de raza.

Y me vi en la obligación de capar a los dos machos. Cada domicilio es un mundo y depende de cómo viva el tuyo. Que yo sepa los machos no entran en celo, son las hembras. Sus maullidos de celo recorren distancias, de ahi que el macho se escape siguiendo el sonido. Mis gatos no salen a la calle y no se relacionan con otros animales pero por recomendación del veterinario: peleas entre los machos, marcaque de territorio en casa, embarazos no deseados.....etc fue una de las opciones que mejor se adaptaba a nuestra vida en común. Yo no soy partidaria de las hormonas, pastillas e inyecciones en los gatos machos (tampoco en las hembras), y tampoco de la castración pero si te ves en la NECESIDAD de hacer algo porque te da problemas, yo te recomendaria la castracion. A mi Shimba le operaron con 5 a?os, y no le ha ido mal: ha cogido peso, bastante peso jajajaaa. A Rasty le operaron con 9 meses y también está fantastico, pero él no ha cogido kilos como su padre jajajaaa.

No todos los gatos tienen porque tener cachorros. Yo prefiero adoptar otro gato sin hogar antes que traer más al mundo... porque ya hay muchos... <br>  Además, lo sí que es muy malo es hormonarlo. Tiene más efectos secundarios que beneficios. Yo no le daría hormonas jamás. No sé porque hay veterinarios que las recomiendan todavía, supongo que porque con cada inyección... más dinerito... y hay gatos que necesitan más que otros, sabes?<br>  Desde luego si preguntas en cualquier Protectora de Animales, te recomendarán la Castración sin dudarlo. Es una operación sencilla, más que en las gatas que necesitan anestesia general. En los gatos es más sencillo. Es una forma de hacer que tu gato mucho gane en calidad de vida y tu con él, porque estarás tranquila de verlo bien a él.<br>  Yo tengo tres gatas, 2 esterilizadas ya y la tercera como es más joven, está en vías de serlo.

AA12321831	Yes.  Millions, if not billions, of mice are shipped everyday in the US alone.  The days of local pet shop breeding their own animals are LONG gone.  There are however, special procedures for shipping them that MUST be adhered to, both for legal reasons, and the afety of the animals.  They must be shipped in containers that allow airflow and must be shipped with a should of water, and also food, depending on how long they'll be in transit.  Most breeders place oranges or apples in the crates with the mice to keep them hydrated, and throw in a few lab blocks for food.  <br>  While they can be shipped in cardboard crates, plastic ones are preffered by most carriers because it lowers the chances that the mice will get out.  Look online, and you should be able to fine containers suitable for your needs.  <br>  Also, most states require that ANY animals being shipped nationally (i.e., state-to-state) be checked thoroughly by a vet beforehand, and have a certificate of health.  Call your local Fish and Game warden to find out, and the warden for the state you are sending the mice to.  <br>  You will also most likely need to send the animals overnight or same day, depending on local laws and the carrier's prefferences.  This can be very expensive, depending on where you're shipping them to.<br>  I hope this helps!|`|73f77b194908037a3f65b2843a8169d8aa	Don't see why not...

23f329ffe98e7257de7edb7b5830c597aa	The vet will just pull the tooth.  Assuming the infection hasn't gotten into the dogs gums she should be fine.  Try giving her more bones to chew on.  The all natural ones are best as they are more easily digested.  You might also try a higher quality food.  Some of the kibble in the cheap food breaks easily, so it doesn't have time to rub against the dogs teeth and help clean tartar off.  With a better quality kibble, the dog has to work harder to crunch it, which in turn helps clean their teeth.|`|71783851fe5dc2fe65326b65ad6d4ddaaa	try pepsi max, less sugar|`|AA12068914	dont give `em rock hard stuff to chew duh!|`|77ec1fe114e0ce87fb36a08fb7534c37aa	Does she chew on bones, rocks or other hard things? The tooth broke sometime and the pulp is exposed leaving it open to infection. It is very painful! Even if she seems normal, you can bet it hurts her. The vet will probably recommend sedating her, removing the tooth and cleaning the rest of her teeth.

1b61754c59c3b1c5287ab3638ae2fe21aa	First you need to add some information to your question. One: is the dog male or female? Two: Is the kitten male or female? After a life time of owning pets I have always had cats and dogs. The number has been as high as 3 dogs and 5 cats. They all got a long well with out any problems. <br>  <br>  If your dog is young and just wants to play with the kitten you must remember that the kitten dosen't know that. If your dog is a female she may just want to mother the kitten. The age of the kitten is important as an older kitten has been exposed to more than a younger one. <br>  <br>  Try holding the kitten as much as you can after you have handled your dog. The dogs sent on you the kitten will smell. As you pet the kitten the smell of the dog will go from upset to pleasure while you pet it. The kitten will not want to run from the dog as it will be used to you petting it and the smell of the dog. <br>  <br>  An other thing you can try is to hold the kitten and have some one hold on to the dog and as you pet the kitten slowly let the dog get closer to the kitten. However don't let the dog close enough to the kitten where the kitten react to the dog. Also let the dog know that it is being aggessive to the kitten. As long as the kitten isn't trying to claw its way through your leg let the dog get as close as the kitten will allow. Make sure you reasure the kitten that no harm will come to it while it is in you lap. <br>  <br>  There is one more thing you can try and that is to keep the dog at a distance where the kitten doesn't feel irritated. Give the kitten space & time and as the dog is kept away from the kitten the kitten will go to the dog on its own. Good luck... Just give it time... P.S. Sorry for any miss spelled words as spell check isn't working...|`|73211431bfc5d82ad1b65eda95f3bf72aa	get rid of the kitten.|`|AA11162050	She is a cat.  There is nothing you can do with her.

One thing I try to do is make sure he gets tons of exercise.  I walk him for 1/2 hour in the morning, 1/2 at lunch, my boyfriend Rollerblades/takes him to the park/plays fetch after work, then we walk him for an hour at night.  I know this sounds like a lot, but it's not too bad.  Try walking him with a dog backpack on to give him a little more exercise if you're short on time.  The most important thing is to spend active time with him when you are home.|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	You are definitely crating the dog for too long a period of time.

He never chews while I'm at home and he sleeps in the bed with me... If I do leave him loose and he chews its usually because I ran out without giving him a good walk in the am.

Another thing is too make sure she has a chew toy or a couple toys to keep her entertained, non-edible, choking hazards. I began leaving her out little amounts of time at a time. Like when I went to another room, or in the office to work. I would listen to make sure she wasn't getting into any mischief and would check up on her every now and then.

Then tire his butt out with a lot of exercise before bed so he's ready to go to sleep when you are.

So I just baby gated a section of my apt off and I have her bed and toys in there and she is fine when I'm not home. He probably has a lot of energy built up from being in a crate all day so when you do let him out he goes crazy *lol*. Just try and spend more time with him outside too - let him get a good run/walk in before bedtime so he'll sleep through the night. Goodluck!

a50aee793c1a82060d304823b4c2df29aa	On bathing, it depends on wheather the guinea pigs needs it or not, if the fur is soiled or matted, then either use a sink or a small tub(some prefer using a baby tub). Use Luke warm water and make sure she/he feels secure while being bathed in very shallow water. If he doesn't feel secure, they will swirm and squeak, and try to get out. I use baby shampoo for mine or you could also use kitten shampoo. After the bath is all done, wrap him up in a towel and dry him off and some guinea pigs loves to have their fur brushed with a guinea pig pet brush. <br>  <br>  As far as nails goes. It is very important to keep the nails trimmed. If the nails are not trimmed they will grow long and start to curl and it can curl into the guinea pigs pads of their feet and cause pain or it can cause one nail to wrap around another. To trim nails if you want to do it yourself, is two have another person handy. Have the other person to hold the guinea pig and feed it a carrot to keep him distracted and trim right below the bloodline on the toenails. Make sure to have Styptic Powder powder available and ready just in case you do end up getting the bloodline and the nail starts to bleed. If that happens dab some of the styptic powder onto the toenail and the bleeding will stop right away. Also when you get a pair of toe nails trimmers. You can use either baby clippers, adult clippers or you can buy small animal clippers. Buy the kind that you will feed comfortable using. My clippers costed 12.00 for a small animal clippers and it was worth it(sometimes the generic pet trimmers are cheaper but aren't worth it) , the styptic powder costs around 7-10 dollars but will last a good length of time. It will save money in the long run to do it yourself but if your not comfortable doing it, then a vet will usually do it for 5-10 dollars depending on what vet you use.|`|45d90ae365f733cad40a933870a497e1aa	Well, if you want to bather your guinea pig, you should put it inside a small tub or bucket, and make sure that if there is a drain, it is plugged. To wash it, get a damp cloth and rub it down gently, you dont want to hurt it, and I wouldn't suggest using soap on him, maybe a bit on the rag, but make sure it is safe for hamsters. As for clipping his nails, I actually don't think it's neccesary, but I could be wrong. Hope this helps! :0)|`|1458f3b8082b68e67db80436c38bb729aa	oh yes some guinea pigs love water. my gurl doesn't though but yes i wash her once a month and its fine. guinea pigs do get dirty i evn got special shampoo at a pet store. its a really fun process! try it!! okay about clipping hold ur guinea pig and let it eat its favorite food while its eating the yummy whatever it likes it wont even notice when u clip its nails!|`|3be72541187ae6351a5a574364c888b2aa	Advice varies as to the necessity or desirability of ever washing your pet guinea pig. If you have one of the long-haired varieties then bathing will have to be a regular aspect of your pet's life, unless you keep the hair trimmed short. For short-haired varieties, an easier option would be the 'sponge bath' i.e. just wrap your guinea pig in a towel to keep him immobile and use a damp sponge without soap to wash him a small area at a time. This is also the way to wash his face, if this is ever necessary. Use a new disposable sponge for washing faces to prevent infection. You can get pet wipes from pet shops for cleaning around eyes and ears. If you are cleaning your guinea pig because he/she has any sort of discharge from mouth, nose, eyes or ears this is something you need to consult a vet about as soon as possible because it could be a sign of serious illness. Only bathe your guinea pig if  large areas of  the coat are very soiled and matted. You need to clean a soiled coat to prevent infection and irritation to the skin and you need to clean a matted coat to prevent hypothermia.|`|de76126f72a7491b33d17fba424e7d2daa	Whenever we clean our guinea pigs cage I put a little water in the bath tub just enough to cover a little of the bottom so his feet and belly touch it but than the other half of the tub is dry. This way he is cleaning his feet and belly and if he doesnt want to be in the water he can go to the other side of the tub I usually leave him in there for about an hour. It gives him time out of his cage and also cleaning him.

62900c7d1a876bd3771d58a3cf3128b8aa	No, no it is not. <br>  Here is a response to the 'best answer' on yahoo's main page asked by 'snookalicious' and best answered by SkateKad47:<br>  <br>  For one thing, animals are NOT very much like humans, and so they are not representative of how a chemical will react in a human body.<br>  <br>  For instance, Anaesthetic, when tested on cats, was thought to cause hyper activity. When tested on Rats, it had the relaxant effect it has on humans. It is very hard to predict the different responses different animals have to chemicals which are introduced to their bodies.<br>  <br>  Another example: We have discoverd something in the order of 1500 cures for cancer in rats - 17 of those affect human cancers, and not nearly so effectively as they are on rats. <br>  <br>  The truth is differences in physiology across species make it impossible to know if a drug is safe for one animal by testing it on another. Even within our own species there are drugs that men and women react differently to. Testing on animals is simply ineffective in determining how a chemical will react in a human being. In fact, because animal testing is assumed to be effective, many drugs are released that are harmful to humans after being thought to be safe from their tests in animals. I would not be surprised if this was the actual case in the mascara incident, but it is often the reason for those drug-recalls you always hear about. "But we tested it! It was safe!!" . . . ."uh huh, safe for rats, but you gave it to humans, you big smart old scientist, did you not know that humans are not rats?"<br>  <br>  Now to the rest of Skate's nonsense. Some animals are overpopulated - yeah, humans! There are 6 Biliion humans on this planet and we are the most widely spread animal on earth. The truth is animal populations regulate themselves naturally - If there are too many plant eaters, the preditors thrive. Then there are too many preditors, they eat all the prey, and die off. Then the cycle continues. We do not need to worry about this, and furthermore, we do not use wild animals in lab testing, it introduces too many uncontrollable variables into the experiement, actually, I don't even see how this comment was relevant. <br>  <br>  Finally, animals are treated well in Labs - from who's perspective? Labs generally don't have a whole lot of space. Animals aren't left free to roam, nor are they ever let outside. They have to be confined so that the researchers can controll what they are eating / what they are exposed to in case one of these factors interferes with the effectiveness of the drug being tested. On top of that - they are having drugs tested on them, which can never be fun. We often cause them to have diseases such as cancer, AIDS, or whatever we are studying so that we can then try to cure them.<br>  <br>  So Skate, if you consider being kept in a cage, never being allowed outside, infected with diseases and then subjected to harsh treatments being treated well, then we have some cause for concern.<br>  <br>  So there we have it - Animal testing IS harmful for animals (did I actually have to argue that?), it does not combat some imaginary over-population problem, and finally, it is entirely ineffective at finding cures for human diseases. Ultimately, animal testing causes far more harm than good, and is a waste of resources, the most important of which is life.|`|e49180ed7f3e7b1742ab281bbccc8d17aa	It depends on what kind of animal testing you are referring to.  There are a great many research projects that are ongoing that do not harm the animal in any way.  For example, a great many animals are used to test the differences in foods - to see if animals show an overall improved health with organically grown foods as compared to the readily available non-organically grown foods.  <br>  <br>  Dogs are frequently used in research laboratories to test the claims of dog foods - to see which actually promotes healthy teeth, shinier coat, more energy, etc.  These are not at all harmful to the animals and instead of being kept in laboratory cages, they are generally loved, cared for, groomed and taken out for walks by a whole slew of people who eagerly volunteer to interact with them.  <br>  <br>  There are a great many laboratories using rats and mice to see if there is a direct corelation between certain types of music that they are subjected to and their increased or decreased ability to concentrate as a result - such as how fast they can figure out a maze.  <br>  <br>  Don't read something into this that isn't here.  These are tests to measure how music MIGHT similarly affect people - so it is not loud or blaring 24/7.  Also, dog foods that are tested by dogs are educational for consumer reports.  Dedicated dog lovers want to know which prepared foods "test dogs" preferred with the best overall results.<br>  <br>  By the way, classical music is usually associated with  promoting the concentration ability of white rats.  Those that listen to hard rock tend to be clueless.  Later, the studies included dogs and cats and music is now generally played at animal shelters across the globe.<br>  <br>  These studies are applied to people with canned music in the workplace, in doctor's waiting rooms, in business lobbies, in malls, etc.<br>  <br>  So please be specific when you say "animal testing" as not all animal testing involves such horrid things as intentionally injuring them to see which products will heal them better or faster.|`|3Sq3JW07aa	In my opinion no. I went to a rally in Boston against animal testing years ago with my mother who I am proud to say fought for animal rights and became very ill and was told by her doctor that she needed to stop this mission. The things she saw are to me unspeakable. The rally was a rude awaking for the cruel things human beings do to see if a product is safe to use I mean horribly cruel. I dont know why our government allows things like I saw that day allowed. That was 30 years ago and it still goes on.It is something I will never forget. I beleive with all of todays technology there has to be a better way. In my opinion it takes a not so special human being earning a pay check to do the cruel things I saw being done. There is a list of companies that do animal testing for there products and to this day I wont purchase any of them. I wonder if there was a species above ours how these folks that do this testing would feel having products ingested, sprayed in their eyes, skin etc. would feel.

It's immoral and downright cruel. If humans want cures for diseases, then THEY need to be the guinea pigs (and yes, I have volunteered for medical study groups, etc. This was a personal choice and I UNDERSTOOD the consequences). Animals are not here to serve humans, or be our test subjects. Just because we are stronger, smarter, etc, does not give us the right to torture them. Many companies are actually putting an end to testing due to pressure from PETA. Although I don't completely agree with PETA's policies, at least they are forcing changes.<br>  <br>  Animals are the innocents in this corrupt world. They don't understand what's being done to them, or why. If they did, how many of them would volunteer for the job? Would you?<br>  <br>  <br>              *Edited note for posting above*<br>  ALL animal testing is cruel, regardless of whether it is painless or not. Simply put: Animals don't understand what's being done to them and are frightened. How would you like it if you were trapped in a cage, subjected to loud music, temp changes, forced to eat foods that could possibly make you ill, and poked at prodded at any given time?

I tried both my girls on a harness but they never liked them and I was afraid they would hurt themselves in trying to escape from the harness that I haven't tried training them on it again. They prefer free range, like all Guinea Pigs. <br>  You can try your Guinea Pig on a harness, for the harness is just about right for your Guinea Pig, just watch the Guinea Pig when in the harness, and if he/she looks like it could hurt him/her self from trying to escape then stop with the harness cause he/she could very easily be hurt.

It's not enough just to brush the surface of the coat since mats usually begin in the undercoat.

I have a Yorkie that had coat that always go matted I used Pet Silk Moisturizing Shampoo and conditioner on her and it helped out a lot. Some other good products are Bio Groom, Plush Puppy, CC or Cowboy Magic. Also, use a leave in conditioner as well to help prevent future tangles. Use this conditioner every time before you get ready to brush your dog. If you dog has an undercoat use a slicker brush, without an undercoat use a pin brush without the balls at the end.|`|82ef0b1bd6fb90af2b2d6d20ac39db35aa	Your best bet would be to take him/her to a professional groomer. Let him/her discuss the best options for the type of coat you are dealing with. <br>  <br>  If you have a long coated dog (like a Maltese, Yorkie, Shih Tzu or Poodle) the rake or Coat King will not do a job for you. This type of coat needs to be combed/brushed daily. When bathing a quality coat conditioner helps maintain a mat free existence. <br>  <br>  If your dog has a long coat such as a Golden Retriever, Keeshond, Pekingese (etc) a rake is a good tool. Again, a comb is still needed to finish out the job. <br>  <br>  Bottom line is that daily grooming and the proper tools are essential. A professional groomer should be willing to discuss this with you and guide you as well. You may have a coat type that would do better by being clippered into a cute (but shorter) trim.

PBBdapCWaa	Sounds like the damsel has a territory staked out.  If tis is the case I doubt the attacks will stop and the stress certainly won't be good for the puffer.  You may have to rearrange something a bit to stop the behavior or as you suggest remove the damsel for a while o confuse it concerning territories.<br>  <br>  MM|`|MlxdKrdlaa	I had a neon damsel (see link for a picture of what I mean) for 5+ years and it use to cause the same trouble.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tropicalfish.at/saltwater/damselfish/Paraglyphidodon_oxyodon.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tropicalfish.at/saltwater/dam...</a><br>  <br>  I found if I introduced striped fish it went crazy (must see them as more of a threat).<br>  <br>  I think your damsel sees the saddled puffer as a threat because it thinks it is another humbug (4-striped damsel) because they are both "black-and-white-striped".<br>  <br>  If you can catch the humbug and stick it in a box for a few days while the puffer relaxes.  Also move everything around to mix up the territories a bit and let the humbug back out, it maybe ok.  Thing is, the humbug may still see the saddled puffer as a threat and go for it, despite all the things you did.   They are monsters sometimes.<br>  <br>  Damsels are generally like that (green and blue Chromis are more peaceful).<br>  <br>  My adult neon died a few weeks back (after 5+ years!) so I am currently converting to a simple reef tank, now it has gone I can finally introduce some peaceful fish without fear of them being bitten to death.<br>  <br>  You man consider removing the humbug if you really like the puffer (I mean take it back to the shop).  Depends how attached you are to it.|`|17c190c18b508ab2670be5827be4d6f4aa	damsels are aggresive little fish they may learn to live with it and they may not.  i got rid of my damsels after the cycle because they are mean fish. there is a good chance that they will never leave it alone. if i were you i'd try and find a good home for them but thats just me, alot of people like damsels but they will harrass almost anything you put in there causing death to some fish because when first adding a fish its stressed anyway and if they pick on them to much they can kill it easily.  If you enjoy damsels i'd choose a clown fish they are in the same family and they are alot less aggressive.  you can rearrange your tank it might help but chances are they are always gonna be like that.|`|M60tlUItaa	I had a dog face puffer awhile ago and they are very docile fish much like yours. The damsel may not stop picking on the puffer because they are territorial your other fish may be aggressive enough to keep the damsel at bay. Just remember to have a net handy to chase the damsel when it comes time to feed your fish, because I will bet the damsel keeps the puffer from eating. Eventually the puffer will get bigger. Good luck|`|VHi1Sqpqaa	Man oh man this sounds wayy to familiar- I also have an over aggressive damsel fish. The truth is there is ALWAYS going to be one fish thats going to try and dominate the tank- it helps that before every time you add a fish to move around the rocks or whatever decor you have in the tank to throw the fish off a little, so it doesnt feel that a new fish is coming into its territory. the best thing to do is to get a tank separator, stress is the number one killer of fish, if the damsel continues to go after the puffer in that manor its going to eventually die. or you can simply bring the damsel back to the fish store you got him from. certain damsels are very territorial- try to stay away from em.

JIGNnm5yaa	If you want to make your dog scared of its own shadow, paranoid and devoid of personality then go ahead and use the barbaric training methods advocated by Bark Busters.  If, however, you want a happy dog that loves life and your family try other more gentle methods of training, such as clicker training.  There are lots of books available about this method, and there's probably a training group near you.<br>  We paid ￡100 to Bark Busters when we first got our dog from a rescue home.  After the first couple of sessions - throwing chains at the dog, screaming 'BAH' at the top of our voices at him, throwing water bombs at him (crazy!!!) - we had enough.  Our poor, bewildered dog almost ran under a car trying to get away from the demented Bark Busters woman.  Save your money, and go elsewhere.  You'll have a much happier dog, I promise.|`|60e41e781e4fe0684fa8ca97041a0efeaa	is so bad
20b2cb79cc0312b06b88a0ce2024af91aa	Your puppy is not a psychopath, but a perfectly normal, albeit, ill-mannered puppy. I suspect somebody plays hand wrestling games with her. Is that true? That is why she bites, she is being trained to bite by those hand wrestling games. <br>  <br>  Piloerection is the term used for hair standing up on her back. All it signifies is adrenalin, or uncertainty. It doesn't indicate attack. And it sure doesn't indicate attack in a pup only 5 1/2 months old. <br>  <br>  You need to take her to a training class ASAP! You need to socialize her and teach her how you want her to react when other dogs are around.<br>  <br>  The best way to change your dog's behavior is to train her.|`|jZp6jY9Zaa	Socialize her!  If she is really aggressive, talk to a dog trainer and start obedience school.  She sounds territorial and it may require a trainer to help you in your home to overcome this behaviour.|`|1d6bb51b16b2905fcec1dd821858f41faa	when puppies are teething it is VERY normal for them to bite and nip around. make sure you give it a lot of things to chew on. Also, it barks because its protecting his property. Never heard of them attacking when the fur goes up though. MAke sure your dog gets heaps of interaction with other dogs.|`|N1NM7JoYaa	When she acts like a mad dog just yell at her and drag her away from the other dogs.

You've let her bite for months now, better stop it soon.   <br>  <br>  Google Nothing In Life is Free and also I'd recommend the book Cesar's Way for how to become your dog's pack leader.<br>  <br>  Right now the pup does NOT respect you.    Don't hit her, train her and yourself.|`|qJiWYTVRaa	call your vet! but u should probably take it 2 obediance school!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|A844m9eraa	Still laughing at above answer (Scott's). The hairs or hackles up doesn't mean they are or aren't going to attack, just they are a little,umm curious slash unsure of the situation. She may be bored at home and biting seems to be an activity at home. In regards to the barking at the other dog at the other side of fence, many dogs do that. When the pup bites you at home, say very frmly NO!. If this doesn't get the pup's attention, then say it with NO and scruffing the back of neck. If your pup reacts very negatively to this (Yelps, barks, growls) you need to see a real trainer.When a pup gives you talk back after correction, he thinks he's the boss not you. Biting is very normal, but it needs to stop by 5.5 months. The adult teeth are usually in, so it's not acceptable anymore. It's alot of training to break the pup of this, but with constant work it can be done. Ask your vet for a trainer. Good Luck|`|AA10071046	take it to puppy daycare|`|B6Loic0raa	It's pretty normal, when she is home keep toys in your reach, when she goes to bite replace your arm (say no) then place  her toy in her mouth and say "good girl"!!!  Most likely she is trying to get dominance over you and you are also her favorite play toy!  Negative attention is better then no attention.|`|YrtxF6Graa	It sounds like your dog is not socialized. The best thing for you is to get your dog into some sort of puppy obedience (puppy kindergarten) to socialize it to other dogs. In these classes (they usually have a pre-k and a K class) they allow the dogs to sniff, jump, play, and get to know each other, interrupted by small bits of obedience. <br>  Another reason she barks like crazy is because the fence is a barrier. It is holding her back. Think of when she's on a leash, if you pull, she pulls harder. The fence is holding her back like the leash would. This makes her go into defenseive mode--she's protecting you from something she sees as a threat only because she hasn't been taught any differently. <br>  <br>  The biting really sucks, but if you don't teach her it is not ok to bite you, she will continue. Bite inhibition is a really big part of training puppies. Because she is older, she has forgotten the lessons her siblings and mother tried to teach her. Its up to you and your family to continue. If she bites or if any part of her mouth hits any part of your body, sharply yelp "ouch, that hurts" and stop play for a few minutes. When you go back to playing, don't let her forget the rules. If she bites, play stops. If she is biting to be biting (which starts getting worse around this age) invest in lots of chewable toys. Different types and textures, they even have the ones you freeze. My dog would rather have her Kongs or her cuz.|`|bdd8595ffe50725a8efaabc36c3f643aaa	dont ever bring her home|`|cgWVfxGVaa	It would help to know what kind of pupper she is... even if a mix, a mix of what?<br>  <br>  Even without that, it sounds like she is board at home, and wants you to play with her.  Puppies in a pack bite on each other to entice play.  I have 3 dogs here, and the youngest, a 6 month old English Springer Spaniel will sneak up on the other two and nip at them, then run and bark, to try and get them to play.  A kind of "Tag you're it!" game.  To us, he just "Mouths" or bites gently on our feet, clothes, hands, pants legs, shoe laces.... anything he can get to.  The more we yell and protest, the more excited he gets.  We have found a squirt bottle with water on stream mode, (not mist) works great!  It doesn't hurt him, but snaps him out of this state of mind.<br>  <br>  You should never pet or praise her while she is biting.  Wait until you can catch her being good.  When she is calm and still, gently pet, massage and kissy face her.  Speak in a low soft calm voice.  The minute she turns and mouths you, stop paying her any attention.  Other than a short, firm "no" or "Off".  Whatever you use.  I also find myself making two different noises to diswade naughtiness... one is the short "SHHH"  like you are hushing someone at a movie theater and you really mean it.  The other is "EH EH!"  Like you don't want a child to do something, or touch something.  The "Eh Eh" has great affect for my pups.<br>  <br>  OK, barking at passing dogs is her protectiveness.  She is saying, "This is MY house, and these are MY people!"  she is claiming her territory.  You can also use the spray bottle at this time.  But better yet, would be to try and distract her with something the likes.... A toy, a stick or ball... get her mind off of the people/dogs walking by and focus on something more possitive.<br>  <br>  It is true that raising hair can be before attack.  It can also be during extreme excitement.  My ESS will raise his fur while playing with my other pups, even though he is not being aggressive at all... he is just really into the tag game.  He may raise his back hair as he is running away.  Sometimes even when he is in the "Play Bow".  (Front end down on the ground, back end raised up in the air.  This is an invite to play, actually more of a request to "Pllleeeassssee play with me!")<br>  <br>  Obedience class would be a GREAT thing for both you and the pup.  They get to socialize, and so do you, with other doggy owners.  Obedience is more than just a convenience, it can save a dogs life.  (Stop them from running into traffic, getting into something toxic, prevent a fight with another more aggressive dog etc.)<br>  <br>  Lastly, have her spayed.  This helps with so many behavior issues and prevents unwanted puppies in the world, not to mention cancer.<br>  <br>  Remember, the puppy might look almost full grown, but is really just a baby.  About like a 3 year old.  CAN do a lot, but doesn't know right from wrong.
KxjUim7yaa	You should talk to the vet about this. My dog has a yeast problem between his toes. The vet has us use Malaseb pledgets which are medicated wipes. There are 60 in a jar so they go a long way. We use them every evening before he goes to bed after his potty break.

If kitty's behavior is normal and she doesn't seem to be in pain or distress, it is probably okay to keep a close watch on her. <br>  <br>  Is the cat eating and drinking normally?  If she is not eating, take her to the vet immediately.  Sometimes the major pet stores have vet clinics where you and your mom could take kitty for a relatively inexpensive check-up. If you notice any other changes or the yellowing gets worse, I would head for the vet, if it were my cat. <br>  <br>  You don't have any new furniture or bedding with yellow as a base color, do you? Cats rub their cheeks and sometimes their ears on items (and people) to "claim" them.

Add "No" if she is used to that word and understands it.  But, most of all, be consistent with the word you use when she does it and you correct her, and when she jumps on you.  If you don't want her to jump on you, you have to correct her every time and never let her get away with it.  If you let her once, then she thinks you'll let her again.  Make sure to praise her when you get her back down, and when she hasn't jumped up on you at all (and normally does).  What works for me is "Good" and the key word, like "Off", which I follow with "Good Girl".  My dog now understands when she hears "good" with the command word, she has done correctly, and when she hears "bad" with the command word - she hasn't done as I want her to.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend you look into obedience classes.  Usually, most areas have "obedience clubs" that offer these classes for around $50, and meet once a week for approx 8 weeks.  The instructors will basically teach you to train your dog to behave and follow your commands.  They will give you the tools to make your environment and your dog happy ones, without worries of control (jumping on you & your guests).  Also, if you've adopted your dog from the humane shelter or similar places, a lot of these clubs will give you the first Beginning Obedience class for free with proof of adoption.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|460370464f65248901c6b1edc0f9088baa	when she jumps kick your knee out|`|9a2be4691639e032ef671781ee443eaeaa	scold her when she does that.

Make sure you are using off and not down there is a difference. Off means just that and it works when/if she would get on the furniture, the car door, other people or whatever and down means she is supposed to lay down. If you use the word down for both things she will be confused and then you won't receive a response to either command and the problem will continue to grow and spiral out of control. Remember to be consistent and that if you have other people in the home that all of you are using the same methods and commands.

The trick is to be really consistant.  Take the dog for a walk in a neighborhood with sidewalks, where you have to cross the street every block.  When you get to a place where you have to cross the street, have the dog sit, and give him a treat when he does.  Do that every time you get to a corner, before you cross the street, and he'll start getting to the corner and sitting down for his treat before you even say anything.  After that, just be really consistant.  He needs to sit EVERY time you get to a curb, no matter what.  You don't move until he sits.  After a little bit, probably quicker than you think, he'll get it.|`|KxNdCO4Vaa	You need a leash to walk or let your dog out, and when he runs make high pitched noices, screamed or make a yip sound, high pitch sounds catch there attention better.

Don;t let questions/answers on here determine your day!|`|24CFl7sjaa	You could try asking your mum as she is so against speying, she should be extensively researching signs of pregancy in dogs as you have an unspeyed b*tch of breedable age and no idea if she has been mated.|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	in about 30 days, you will begin to see her get bigger and you can feel puppies inside by palpating her belly.

Wdlglfauaa	was there growling or hissing involved, you can usually tell the difference between a friendly romp and a death match by the sounds they make and whether or not it looks like they are seriously trying to hurt one another . Growling and hissing would mean this was not friendly . Watch the body language.|`|dc3c05e029bb4f41031c7265562f3310aa	The older cat doesn't sound like he is really injuring the new kitty, but what he IS doing is establishing dominance. He is letting kitty know he was there first and is still the leader. They Will eventually warm to each other and be glad for the companionship, but they will always have these little tussles where the older kitty asserts his dominance and when baby gets older,she may try to become dominant. The bigger kitty could give in for a while but not for ever. There is also a big element of play in this. They are playing and the bigger kitty is training the little one at the same time. My 2 have a funny ritual. The first one is 8 and the other just turned 2. One or the other will start grooming the other for several minutes and then they will switch for several minutes. At the end of the mutual grooming sessions they will fight and tumble and bite, and roll around, who ever gets tired of it first quits and walks off. They do it everyday.usually about 15 minutes before they fall asleep together. It's cute. About the ear, sometimes they lay one or both of their ears back flat. I think it is to appear more threatening to other. But don't worry they understand what they are doing.|`|JrnXCy49aa	I'd say take your time introducing cats of different ages. Easier transition into friendship that way. They may already be friends, just working out their hierarchy now. ;)|`|8vXIS9zeaa	The old cat is having problems with the new kitten moving in, that is ok. he or she will become to like the kitten, even  mother it it just takes time. Mine did the same thing, just watch them when they are to gather don't pay more attrition to one then the other.|`|AA12010555	Sounds to me just like playing mostly.  If your older cat really didn't want the kitten to play, he would let her know.  My cat is 13, and has had to deal with several kittens in her lifetime.  She HATES sharing her home.  She will growl and hiss and run from the kitten.  When they got to a point where she would allow some playing, when she was done, she made it clear with a good swat to the head and running away.  As long as fur isn't flying and there isn't screaming coming from either cat, I say you are okay, and they are "bonding" so to speak.  And yes, the kittens tend to fold their ears all the way back, because this is there play fighting; practicing for when/if they have to do it for real.  Just be careful if you stick your hand in there, cause you will just become a third cat, and while they don't mean to harm you, you don't have a nice fur coat to protect from the scratches and bites.  GOOD LUCK!|`|RMcFVXZNaa	If there was not a lot of hissing, spitting or biting and scratching they were likley just playing-my two cats do the same thing and their ears look funny and fold back but they are just playing with each other--just suppervise until you know for sure that they are okay with each other.
xHxKDQ80aa	okay so I had the same problem with my Boxer puppy. Her smell was room clearing even though we have fed her high quality, holistic foods since the day we got her. We have since cut Chicken out of her diet along with turkey and the smell is so much easier to cope with and way less frequent.<br>  <br>  Digestion starts in the mouth - with chewing - if your dog is wolfing it down without chewing, then he is sucking in air as well. Causing the first part of the burping and farting. You can slow his eating habits down by getting an eat better bowl (found in most pet food stores), or what I do is I put a larger treat(usually OMH large P-nuttier biscuit) and my pup eats around it and then takes the treat for desert (this does not work for some dogs though).<br>  <br>  Another thing is the quality of food and how much you are feeding. If the food has Corn, Beet pulp, or other fillers in it. If there is none of that in the food then look at the portions you are feeding your bulldog, maybe divide into three smaller meals a day to make digestion easier for his stomach.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi it sound like the food he is eating is making a lot of gas and indigestion.  Try Science diet food i use it for my basset hound cause he was always passing gas and when he pooped it looked like a cow pooped there.  So i bought some Science diet and it works he doesn't poop half as much as he did and he doesn't pass gas now.  A person could give him a little Pepto-Bismol as it coats the tummy and if his tummy is upset that might help.  The vet told me 1 tsp.  3-4 times a day when my dog had diarrhea so i think u would be safe giving it to him once or twice a day.  Hope this helps.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-I was going to suggest diet.  The right food will lessen the amount he expels, both in solids AND gas.  Give it a few days to really show a difference.  He is also probably very nervous.  This too will take a few days.  We have one, never give him people food at all, and never have had any gas problems with him- seriously, none!
C8obM9GEaa	Lol - I had this all the time with my Bourke Parakeets. Best thing to do is trap them in a room and wait till they settle down (ideally in a low position). Close the curtains and then turn off the lights. Parakeets have poor sight in the dark and will avoid flying. Its best to have a partner in this so you can get as close to the bird as possible before the light is turned off... you then simply pick up the bird. <br>  <br>  It may take a few attempts and a tea towel is helpful to stop the bird hurting itself, but I swear by this method. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Z9l9sHO7aa	ok first of all, tidy up the room that their mostly in.( to bore them) then when they'r both in at the same time; shut the door and trap them in.remove all food and water from the room and top up their food and water.eventualy they will get bored and go into their cage  to sleep or eat. and ev wa la:)<br>  <br>  good luck baby x <br>  ?|`|KvUJZa1Paa	take a light weight towel and walk up to them one at a time. gently toss towel over bird and then pick up towel, put bird back in cage then repeat with other one, causes less stress on birds then chasing them. i do this with my parakeets when then gt out.|`|AdmtROXUaa	Get a cloth, or towel and throw it over them.  Then pick them up gently, but be careful as they may nip, and place them back in the cage.  <br>  <br>  My love birds have done this as well.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	A Carolina wren comes in my house all the time. Each time we trap her by using a mesh trash can and a towel. The trash can acts as a cage and the towel prevents her from flying out and can be used to guide where she flies.<br>  <br>  The last time this happened I cornered her in my upstairs bathroom and just caught her by hand. It's easiest if you can corral them into a small room.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Calmly!!!  Leave the cage door open and they will probably go back in.  I am assuming they are not hand tame- right?  If you chase them, that could cause serious problems for them!  Make sure no windows or exterior doors are opened while they are out!
Ik6WOcw3aa	What kindve frogs do you have? You say net, so Im assuming you have either african dwarf or african clawed frogs.<br>  <br>  They come to the surface for air.

If you can't do this then I would suggest getting an aquarium ornament or anything else that'll provide shelter for the Pleco. As the cichlids get bigger, they'll eventually stop pecking at it but I do strongly suggest you remove it from the tank as soon as possible.
PBBdapCWaa	That really depends on which ahli you are talking about.  There are several cichlids with that species name and with some of them, such as Sciaenochromis ahli, which is probably the one you mean, there are various color varieties.  Generally speaking though, the females are less colorful than the males and look much more like a juvenile.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you search the scientific name and look for some pictures of your color morph.<br>  <br>  MM|`|Snn0k0yCaa	which one?|`|42d2e9ef43ee3d223044187bc53e4410aa	There is only one true Sciaenochromis Ahli. There are several collection points of Sciaenochromis Fryeri(COMMON name is Ahli). Petsmart sells the Fryeri most likely Maleri Island being the collection point. A "true" Ahli is a very rare Hap, thats actually a drab blue with very large eyes. A "true" Fryeri(common name Ahli) is much more colorfull blue(male). Females are silverish/gray to drab brown in both species. Go to Chichld-Forum.com . Click on "profiles" then "lake Malawi" then "Haplochromis" then scroll down. It should have pictures of both female and males of the actual AHLI, and the actual FRYERI. Good site to learn alot about African cichlids for you starters out there. Good luck finding your breeding group. And if anyone comes accross a true Sciaenochromis Ahli, snatch them up, cause they are worth good $$$.

65LQyd1gaa	It is a very good idea to start with a fresh water tank a salt water is a lot of work and if you go out and pick up a tank you will find out quick it is a very involved hobby and requires a lot of work your fish will probably die and you will have put a lot of work in to a tank with dead fish,and that sucks. i don't want to discourage you i love having my tank and i encourage people to get in to fish keeping but  you must remember that the fish you have relay on you to keep the alive so if you want a salt water tank great but be patient read as many books you can before you get any fish like i said there lives are in your hands.|`|8bc1419f3268344a5964f48cc6672e36aa	You probably dont want to hear it, but this will save you tons of money!  Start out  with a freshwater tank.  After you learn everything you can and STILL ENJOY IT...... say a year or two... then you can move up to saltwater fish.<br>  Saltwater fish are way more expensive than freshwater fish.<br>  The setup itself is more expensive.<br>  You need to learn the whole cycling process and maintenance.  Best to start with cheap fish and work your way up to the more expensive fish.|`|6Smd54ceaa	It is going to be VERY expensive.  And will continue to be expensive.  That is what stopped me!|`|e56f1c18e738b33c84695571d2ddbe1daa	It's not that bad once you get set up and you don't buy equipment you don't need.

AA11481529	Mollies and guppies, no matter what they look like, are live-bearers (meaning they giv birth to live young) which I'm sure you already knew.  An interesting thing about them, is that once they are pregnant, they are ALWAYS pregnant; the female has the ability to hold the sperm sacs produced by the male inside her forever, it seems.  Once the first batch of eggs develop and hatch, the next is automatically fertilized.  It takes 6-8 weeks for smaller live-bearers to give birth, but that can be cut down to 4-6 when the female grows larger (2 inches).  The larger the female, the less fry(baby fish) she will have, but the larger they will be, thus the more likely to survive.  Good luck!!|`|48f71c076d18631136ef272b70606bedaa	if they are similar to guppies then it's about a month or so.|`|8bc1419f3268344a5964f48cc6672e36aa	Also, since they are live bearers, you dont want to have her in with other fish that will eat the babies.  If you have other fish in the tank, you may want to put her in a seperated area.  Pet store has something, forget what its called.|`|6YHuxoZnaa	Just put her in a breeder box or breeder net and give her time. She will have them.|`|9HdexsSCaa	Gestation depends on water temp since fish are cold blooded. Usually between 3 and 4 weeks.

Mental stress on a dog can cause seizures.<br>  <br>  Take the dog to the vet, he may want to give you something in case he has another seizure.
LPEO6AsCaa	OK here goes!  /the term Golden Retrieves means that a Golden Retriever can have many variations in the term golden.  This includes from a dark golden to a very light almost white colored coat with all kind of variations in between.  Now the extremes of this are very dark almost Chestnut colored to almost white in coat color.  These extremes are looked upon as faults in coloring and not consider the breed norm.  dogs with these faults would not be considered for showing, but they make beautiful pets with all the wonderful traits of the Golden Retriever.|`|0xJZJggVaa	One. <br>  <br>  They're supposed to be the color of dead wheat.

AA11501528	They are excellent family dogs or even just a one person dog.  They are extremely loving.  If you are having a bad day, they want to know about it.  They get up in your face, if you let them, to try and hug you to let you know they care and want to make it better.  They have loads of energy and mellow with age.  They shed!!  They need every other day groomings especially in the summer, not so much in the winter.  They come in many colors and have anywhere from long to short hair.  I had 2 blonds and a red, they are wonderful.  They aren't very good for protection but they don't really like strangers.  But when push comes to shove, depending on the dog's personality, usually the stranger becomes a friend.  2 of mine didn't like strangers and the other one wasn't really sure what she thought.  They tend to think that they are lap dogs, the bigger they are the smaller they think they are.  They are super animals and would defiantly recommend getting one to anyone.|`|osrqpU2Taa	Hello....one of the best, kindest, loyalist & gentlest dogs there is, same care as any other pretty much...just have to be careful about hip displaysia...as many big dogs are so overbred it is a common, sad & expensive problem..a good breeder will the know the whole history & life of the puppies & they won't be cheap !!!

XnXbPYd5aa	It's normal.  When kittens are nursing from their mothers, they knead the teat that way to get more milk to flow.

When I come up to my cat when she's on her window shelf, she is always glad to see me, so she kneads her paws. She is declawed, though, so she doesn't rip up the shelf.

From what it sounds like, you kitty loves you and is just expressing how happy she is to be with you.<br>  <br>  Some cats have larger motions while some are just gentle pushing motions. Some cats don't do it at all.

She may do it for several minuets, (like my cat) but eventually she'll stop an lay down on your lap, its a sigh of affection. But if you do not want her to do this, when she does, gently pick her up and set her on the ground. Eventually she'll get the message and stop.|`|a5c7de2fb025a45e6200dc11c66841c6aa	it is normal for your cat to do this. when cats are kittens they knead the mom stomach in order to get the milk out, doing this makes them happy cause they are being fed. once a cat is older one way they show that they are happy is by kneading. i have a cat and whenver it lays in the bed by me in kneads the blanket|`|ovhmrQOfaa	Don't be too worried about this behavior. I had a cat named Cleo for 18 years and she would jump on my husband's lap every night after dinner. We laughed and said that she was baking us dessert, and "kneading the dough". She was purring as she "kneaded" in a very loving manner. We certainly miss Cleo's affectionate habits, since she passed away a few years ago now. Although it can be painful for you with your Siamese and her flexed claws, try placing a thick blanket on your lap to help. Enjoy your quality time together. :-)

I put my cats on it (and they eat so much better than they used to!) now their coats are glossy, they are more lively and alert too.<br>  <br>  2. Stop the fish, the meat and whiskers meat. Give her the whiskers dry and cooked chicken. This is bland and firms the poo's up. <br>  <br>  3. Take her to the vet and have a million and seven tests done at ￡38 per session, to find that her diets wrong! (happened to my friend)<br>  <br>  You were right about the spaying thing btw and well done on the injections.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  x
8vDyvxePaa	Depends on your personality.<br>  <br>  Beta fish bowls are easier to clean because they like small bowls.  They are very tolerant of poor water conditions, and they come in a rainbow of colors. They're really pretty :D and they work well with kids.  I had a beta when i was like 6 and it survived 2 years (about the average beta life expectancy) even though it went through lots of unintentional fish-torture.  My sisters (who were 2) dumped an entire container of liquid soap into his bowl, but he still lived.  His bowl tipped over once and it took us 5 minutes to find him (under a wet towel) but he still lived.  I'm not going to go into more details of the things Tacky went through, so lets just say betas are really family-friendly. They're also cheap, you can buy them at the pet store for just  a couple of bucks.  I wouldn't suggest buying them from Walmart, though.  Have you seen their fish isle?  Eeech it's so gross.<br>  <br>  But,  beta fish can't be with any other fish.  They're really feisty and will eat the other fish.  They're kind of boring; they "hang out" more than they "play." Also, after a week or so your fish's container will really start to smell and get mucky; when my sister had a beta she had to clean it every three days or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hermit Crabs are fun because you can keep them in a fun-colored shell you can buy at the pet store (it's kinda like the crab has his own outfit :D)  You can accessorize his tank and make it look really cool.  You can hold him, unlike betas :)<br>  <br>  But hemit crabs have cons, too.  They like to have hermit roomies with them so they don't get lonely. (i guess that can be a good thing for some people)  They have to have a constant humidity level of at least 70%, which is harder if you live in a dry climate (like me).  They have to have a tank temp of no less than 72 degrees.  If they're too hot they'll die slowly and painfully (and it's irreversible once they overheat).  You have to remember to only give your crab water that you would put in a tropical fish tank.  That means you have to remove harmful chemicals before giving it to the crab.  And there's more; look here for more hermit crab stuff: <a href="http://hermit-crabs.com/care.html" rel="nofollow">http://hermit-crabs.com/care.html</a><br>  <br>  Hope you get your dream pet :D|`|rMmU5klPaa	i would get a betta fish because this one time i bought a hermit crab at petsmart and as soon as i got in the car i wanted to hold it and it pinched me and would not let go it hurt so bad!!! but if you get a betta fish make sure it is separated from any other fishes, because we just bought one the other day and it kept flaring at the other fishies. hope this helps : )|`|26oL7vHoaa	get a beta.<br>  apparently hermit crabs are actually really hard to care for if done properly....or it will just die...they live like, 10 years.<br>  yeah, betas are better.

Their water should be maintained weekly by performing a partial water change. Betta's live 5-7 years.<br>  <br>  A hermit crab should have at least a 10 gallon tank and is a little more complicated.

Maltese are super cute, and anything mixed with a poodle will shed a lot less than usual.  If you get a xxx-poo (something mixed with poodle) make sure you go with a breeder that's been around a long time who has had a lot of success with getting the coats as non shedding as possible.  So if you decide to get a maltipoo, look for a breeder that mixes maltipoos with maltipoos, and has been doing that for a long time to get the best, soft, non shedding maltipoo coat possible.  And you don't have to get a maltipoo, they have yorkipoos and other thing poo's, I was just using that as an example because they're small, too.  Good luck!|`|GaL66jbQaa	Here's a link to the Yorkie club of america somewhere on their page is a link to the rescue group|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	That piddly amount of pocket change *might* get something from the pound.<br>  <br>  <br>  YT are ****NOT***** "hypo-allergenic"=no dog is!|`|PM23RDycaa	The shelter and there is no 100% guarantee the dog will not aggravate  either your asthma or your mother's allergies if not both. Not all low shed dogs work for everyone some cans till trigger reactions.|`|XagPxe7Faa	Any breed dog can trigger allergies if you are severely sensitive to them.  Please do not be mislead into thinking that a Yorkie would solve that problem.<br>  Furthermore, dogs are not cheap as breeding ethically is not cheap.  Your best bet if your funds are limited will be to check with shelters and rescue organizations.  Otherwise, you will likely have to conserve your funds and save your money just like everyone else.  Only in a perfect world would everyone be able to get the dog of their dreams for little to no money.  Unfortunately, reality is that breeders have costs they have to cover by charging for pups and like with most indulgences, you have to pay for them.
mauBLzYeaa	Ahaha! Yes, cats will hump objects, preferably soft objects like blankets, stuffed animals or other things that they are attached to. Even if they are neutered, they will still have this habit sometimes. Not all cats still do this, though. But two of my cats do. XD|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	not much difference between a human male and a cat male. neither are that fussy.<br>  <br>  he is in love, leave him be.|`|swWg9TGDaa	Males still show sexual behaviour after neutering especially if neutered late and already had puberty. Humping is normal sexual cat behaviour. |`|LRtDyVB4aa	Yes they do. I had a cat named Lucky that had a favorite stuffed monkey. Lucky would drag this monkey around all over. He would put the monkey in the food dish, and the water dish like he was trying to feed it, and yes he would hump the fur off that poor monkey all the damn time. By the time poor Lucky died, that monkey had bald spots all over it.   |`|AA11450203	How old is the cat?  If he's six months or older he should be neutered.  If not, humping inanimate objects will be the least of your worries.  As cats reach their sexual maturity they can do things such as spray urine to mark their territory.   So if your male cat is not neutered please do it as soon as possible.|`|U5NeDToBaa	They will to that . I hate to say it but its a form of masturbation , just like people they do things that make them feel good .

pyqgEbmsaa	A little slap on the butt isn't going to damage him for life.. The thing is tho when you hit them with your hands.. They start to feel like you can't be trusted. I am not saying your dog needs therapy now.. but it would have been better to grab the scruff of his neck and tell him NO.. it's like his mom would do, and it less offensive and not an attack like an actual swat.<br>  |`|zeTGmB3faa	I don't think that you damaged his psych for life but you might try this next time. Grab his collar, a stern"no" and make him sit.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	A slap on the butt is better than a dead or seriously injured cat. An occasional swat or slap when a dog is misbehaving does not do any harm. It is a natural human reflex,and you were protecting the cat and letting the dog know that he was out of bounds.You'll need to keep a close eye on the two of them.If the dog so much as looks at the cat in the wrong way,say "No!" or make a noise like "Aahh!!" to startle the dog and interrupt his thinking about getting the cat.When he walks away from the cat or ignores it,praise him.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	You weren't wrong in what you did but the best thing is to pop them on the nose.  If you don't have a rolled up paper handy then the hand will have to do.  It's not being abusive for what you did.<br>  I have a cat to GS & a beagle.  The GS are the ones who think the cat is a play toy at times and I state leave the cat alone in the firm voice or if they bark at anything (1 does a lot) all I need to do is show the rolled paper and it ends.<br>  It's all tough love but still in a gentle way.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Sounds like a natural human reflex unfortunately, but maybe next time something like that happens, you should try just saying no instead of using the violence on the animal.  Even though they live together and the dog tolerates the cat and vise verse, they are natural enemies...........|`|O4jGlC2caa	You aren't supposed to slap the dog.  What's done is done though.  No use beating yourself up over it.  Like someone else said, a firm "No" should do it.<br>  <br>  I'm worried about the dog having a possible food aggression problem brewing.  Keep an eye on the dog.|`|475d330bc2fa32468a2d4444d92ab679aa	umm its ok<br>  but hitting is really not that good...the no is good and maybe you can clap really loud to show him your serious<br>  wild dogs like wolves dont slap eachother in the wild so thats just not a good idea|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	If you slapped his tush hard enough for him to be noticeably hurt (ie: a yelp, whine, or even limping afterward), then yes. If it was a soft little swat, and the loud "no!" I'd say you did exactly right in getting your point across. The fact that he ran from you afterward though, means that you only made him afraid of you, not learn from his mistake.<br>  <br>  In my years of owning dogs, I've found that once I stand up, they automatically see that "master has the floor," and pay attention to my sharp "AACHT!." Which means they've done wrong, and they'll quit and go lie down, and not look at me, and glance at me when they think I'm not looking. I don't hit dogs, and mine are extremely well trained. Thus proving there, indeed, are better methods of discipline.<br>  <br>  If your dog doesn't respect you, though, he won't have the same approach to you just standing. Dogs that respect aim to please at all times.|`|QLopvWKDaa	In training a dog it is important to remain "a leader" and use similar though modified ways to correct behavior that the alpha dog would use.<br>  <br>  The point is- leader dogs don't "hit" other dogs to gain control or correct behavior. So hitting behavior really isn't recognized well by your dog as corrective and therefore it is pretty ineffective. A lead dog might snap loudly or ostracize the offender from the group.  <br>  <br>  I have grabbed my little dog ( he's a Yorkie) say "NO CAT" close to his face like a snarl and then placed him in the bathroom with the door closed.  When he cries and whimpers that he wants out, I repeat "NO CAT"!  and leave him in there for a while and go about my normal routine. Dogs hate to be excluded from the group!<br>  <br>  When I let him out, I repeat "No CAT"! again.  This seems to work for me, however, I still get the occasional cat sniper attack- usually brought on by jealousy.|`|VOjwq5aXaa	Its not cruel if you tap his nose but only if you catch him in the moment of snapping so that he knows what its for.<br>  <br>  Dont beat yourself up you sound like a very good firm dog owner and people like you make other dogs and children safer because you can control your dog.<br>  <br>  |`|L2rxDUbuaa	No, that's not cruel. Sometimes you have to slap them when they're really out of line. If you let him get away with it he'll be biting people next.<br>  <br>  Lauriemdc - "leader" dogs don't lock other dogs in the bathroom either...|`|oiGxMIx9aa	I always slap mine if he goes after Cats, it's not cruel, beating is cruel, slapping for aggressive behaviour, is not.|`|GMOYdjyKaa	As long as you slapped his butt and not his head it's ok. The dog has to learn not to snap at your cat.|`|rWsGq3vmaa	no that was fine as long as it wasn't your most powerful swat you could muster up.|`|e5pwuZXuaa	They say never hit your dog although I've smacked mine a few times for chasing cats.  I'd say the best thing to do is just say "no" in your firm voice.|`|zN7ELB9Maa	Yes.<br>  But then show him you love him again.<br>  Hope he relized what he did wrong.<br>  It would be cruel if he did it and 20 mins later you beat him.|`|OVoyvhX6aa	No it tough love

Tropicals need one.  <br>  <br>  You don't say how big the aquarium is, or the fish you previously kept in it, but if you were to get goldfish, you'd need a minimum of 30gal for 1-3 fish.  They grow large and require excellent filtration (probably beyond the Juwel filter's ability to cope). <br>  <br>  Danios and White Cloud Mountain Minnows can be kept in a 20gal (minimum) temperate tank, with a heater set to around 20*C.<br>  <br>  To start again, wipe down the tank with an unused cloth, refill, and carry out a fishless cycle.  This is when you use fish food or household ammonia to simulate fish waste and build up a colony of bacteria in the media.  Check the water every day for ammonia and nitrite (the API Master Liquid test kit is the best on the market).  The process takes around 3-6 weeks on average (more details in Sources).<br>  <br>  EDIT//  As Sarah said, all animals come with responsibility, and all require time, effort and care.|`|uGkLRQsxaa	the ONLY difference btw coldwater and tropical is water temp, a tropical tank and coldwater tanks are set up and maintained the same but the only difference is tropical tanks (usually) have a heater, (unless your house is really hot!) and tropical species need warmer temperatures.  Its best to read some beginner articles to get off on the right foot, its kind of a lot to type on here, I'll give you some good websites to look at to get a good basic understanding.  To start, I wouldnt recommend any tank smaller than a 20 gallon, I wont get into details why right now but if you read some articles you'll find out that they're actually harder to keep due to water chemistry.  To start from scratch you need to know what equipment you need (obviously), get a basic understanding of how the nitrogen cycle works (huge deal!), learn factors that determines species compatibility and read about some species of fish, find out what would be some good fish to start out with (like guppies of cories) and some fish you should avoid until you have some experience (like most cichlids or any saltwater), check out these sites and start reading!  <br>  fishlore.com<br>  badmanstropicalfish.com<br>  theaquariumwiki.com<br>  practiclefishkeeping.co.uk<br>  thinkfish.co.uk<br>  fishprofiles.com<br>  aquariumlife.net<br>  ask any questions you have!|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	It takes weeks for fish to starve,maybe even months!

If you went on a trip, or went to another house, or didn't see them for a couple of days and didn't feed them, then of course they died. Cold water fish require the same amount of care as Tropical fish, except for the obvious fact that cold water fish do not require a heater. For cold water fish such as Goldfish, aside from the fact that they are very messy fish, they need lots of space. Tropical fish, like Betta's, Guppies, Mollies, etc, require space too. In both cold and warm water aquariums, you need to make sure the pH balance is correct, the ammonia isn't too high, and you have to keep an eye on nitrate and nitrite. You will need a filter for both. Not one is less work - keeping fish is a LOT of work.

You'll learn all about fish biology and the ecosystem that fish live in. <br>   <br>  Tropical fish don't eat much and don't require a lot of money after you set up <br>  the aquarium and buy the fish. A small <br>  dog or cat will eat about $150 in food a year whereas fish should cost you <br>  about $25 a year to feed. <br>   <br>  Tropical fish are good pets for kids in teaching responsibility at a much <br>  reduced cost than it would be to take <br>  care of a dog or cat. <br>   <br>  Keeping tropical fish is a relaxing and enjoyable hobby. <br>   <br>  Tropical fish can provide you the satisfaction of taking care of a pet <br>  without stressing you out over con- <br>  cerns that other pets require. <br>   <br>  You can leave tropical fish alone during <br>   the day, at night, on weekends, or on short trips. <br>   <br>  Your tropical fish will (usually!) stay put inside the tank where you left them. <br>   <br>  You don't have to walk them, wash <br>  them, groom them, brush them, take <br>  them in for check-ups, clean up after <br>  them (or keep your slippers away from them). <br>      Just like keeping any pet in the house, there <br>      are things you'll need to watch when keep- <br>      ing tropical fish: <br>  Tropical fish can die very easily when something goes wrong with the tank. <br>  Often by the time you notice something <br>   is wrong with the tank or the fish, it <br>  will be too late for you to do anything <br>  for them (although you can take you lessons learned for the next aquarium <br>  you set up). <br>  Tropical fish do require more care than <br>  a plant; you must know how to change <br>  the water, clean the tank, and what to feed them. <br>  As opposed to bringing other type pets <br>  into the house, set up costs for fish keeping can be expensive. You'll need <br>  to put in an investment in terms of the <br>  tank and the accessories. Plus many <br>  fish are not cheap! <br>  Tropical fish are living creatures. <br>  Things happen to them, even when <br>  you're not paying attention. So they <br>  aren't just design features and will <br>  require your frequent attention and <br>  care. <br>  If you keep your tropical fish tank with<br>  out doing any research, things can get ugly! For example you can have algae blooms or snail infestations that are <br>  very hard to eradicate. <br>  <br>  PRO'S AND CONS OF KEEPING COLDWATER FISH<br>  <br>  Hardier and can go for a period of about a week without food although this is hardly acceptable. <br>  Do not require a heater<br>  More forgiving if you have poor water quality<br>  <br>  CON'S <br>  Do not come in such a colour variety<br>  Need at least ten gallons of water per goldfish an therefore limiting the amount of fish you can keep in an aquarium compared to the tropical fish such as tetras<br>  Needs very strong filtration and frequent water change in order to remove the huge amount of ammonia goldfish produce<br>  Comes in a limited colour range<br>  <br>  As for setting up, if you've read this far down lol, if you've still got some aquarium water from the last time you set it up you can just build from that.

And jus gonna include some basics here:<br>  Remember to leave the bag in the aquarium and don't just tip the fish in their. <br>  You'd be suprised at the amount of people who just tip the fish in.

kifwyOgKaa	Totally sounds like Beep is the alpha.|`|q9I6ElWuaa	I would have to say beep.  But why did you name her that|`|MHWT13WYaa	sounds like stevie to me. Which one eats first, which one gets jealous when you pet the others, which one runs the yard, whatch them when you are not there. dogs lick the alpha to show their respect. the littlest dog in my yard is the alpha, but just watching, you would think it would be the pit lol dogs are wierd. also the alpha is usually but not always the oldest male anyway. there is always an alpha but sometimes its just not real obvious to you. |`|ZmFa6FL2aa	The relationship between dogs is much more fluid than people think. Dogs are not 'alpha' dogs or 'dominant' dogs, each just feels more strongly about some things and may be willing to make a scene about them. Dogs are usually trying to keep things cool among themselves, not trying to be the big boss. Dogs that bully other dogs are often the ones that are not very confident so they make a big show of being tough. The whole idea that there is an alpha dog is silly. It's just not how dogs operate.|`|QLopvWKDaa	I think that it is Lilly!

Younger cats are more active than older cats. But you can still encourage your cat to play, though it might require a bit of patience and participation on your part. Cats like things that move and make noise. Get you kitty a couple of interactive toys like battery operated mice and balls. You can also get a mitten cat toy and wand. These toys do require your participation. Cats also enjoy rattles. Also, pet her a lot so she becomes accustomed to you.  Checkout the link below for more toy ideas.|`|UrToN7Ngaa	keep in mind that cats are not going to be as playful as kittens. i would suggest you initiating more playful behaviors with your cat on a regular basis. cats love those little mice (come in a pack of 8 for like $2.00) don't be afraid to get down on the floor and play with your cat. at first she may be a little frustrated, but if you don't give up and play in a fun manner with your cat, she will be more apt to give in. just have patience. good luck|`|oXCyUIVEaa	try catnip, my cat goes coocoo on the stuff lol|`|dada2423667dd6d0db5e6da96f8b3767aa	take into consideration the age of the animal and helath and fitness. also felines love to climb,doesnt matter what as long as they can jump or claw their way up, they will do it cats love strings and things with tails,yarn shoes.|`|rtyuRkKdaa	Cat toys|`|378743915b090816f6d5759f09529712aa	cat nipp<br>  <br>  :D|`|v6t4Ylddaa	take a leaf stem or a stick (has to be long) and sway it in front of her she will be more playful pet her and let her have her space to be friendly|`|U1TAHDlcaa	Get a plastic milk ring (thing you pull off on a new carton of milk) and flick it across the floor. or you could attatch it to a peice of string and tie it on a chair or a doorknob.

2z69twcpaa	i don't have leopard tortoises but the ones i do have live outside some of the time in summer but this year they have spent more time indoors than out so the temps have been poor, the best thing you can do as our summer is so bad is have a heated shed or green house with a door so they can get outside, mine don't always like the temps where i am (in the midlands)  and they are a mediterranean species, a leopard needs a higher temp than they do so if you want outside accommodation you will have to have a shed  or out house that has heat for when the weather turns, best of luck honey|`|ldvYdbEqaa	not very hot in the uk now id say keep them inside but when its sunny put them in the garden to run round   |`|94mqNB4jaa	tortoises*<br>  <br>  <br>  i have a russion tortise from a local pet shop in chesterfield called the mill i dont know where else you can get one but they  were selling lepord ones there they grow huge.

y7igESfUaa	Pretty much you just have to sit back and be patient. When cats get introduced, usually they aren't friendly at the beginning. They will hiss, spit, even swat but with time, I think they should be fine. If they don't learn to live in harmony, cats will tend to avoid each other (better than fighting, no?). So, don't expect buddies at first- it will take time. Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  Oh, and also, if your mom wants to give you her cat just because she thinks she'll be lonely, I'm sure the cat will learn to live by herself. This way, she'll be in the same surroundings and she's already used to your mom. This is just if you didn't want to take on the additional cat. Again, either way, good luck with your introductions.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	I would be surprised if there were not hissing and growling.  Cats are often very territorial, and in addition often hate change.  You have now done both.<br>  <br>  Have a separate litter box for the newcomer, and don't worry that they will hurt each other.  They know what damage their claws can do, so much of it is bluff.  Once the pecking order is established, things will be fine.  It simply takes time.<br>  <br>  In a way, with an older cat, and your two who are still very much kittens, things should go much easier.  The older cat will be laid back, and the kittens soon will expend energy on each other.<br>  <br>  Since it seems they already know each other, separation and re-introductions don't seem necessary.|`|AA11606260	it sometimes takes cats a while to get used to each other, maybe more than two weeks.  hissing is normal, they are feeling threatened and so on.  i think if you are willing to put in the time it will work out
AA12058653	Hi there! Well, lets keep in mind that different diets can require specific fruits and veggies to be fed. Can you let us know what diet you are feeding?  For example, I use a diet called BML - because of the way it's put together, I only feed corn, carrots, peas and green beans with apples or a type of melon. This is because of some technichal stuff over my head about Calcium absorption and phosphorus... blah blah blah. <br>  <br>  So anyway, gliders can be extremely picky as you can see. All you can do is keep trying something new until you find something she likes, which may change from week to week. I usually stick to watermelon, honey dew or cantelope - not only because the diet I feed requires that, but also because they have alot of water content and ensures that they stay hydrated. <br>  <br>  But when it comes down to it, as long as they are still eating the main staple food, they should be okay. Maybe only put in one pitted cherry along with one or two chunks of another type of fruit. She'll still have her favorite available, but can try something new. If she doesn't like it this week, try it again next week :)<br>  <br>  I hope some of this helps!|`|ekUwaOx2aa	I used to feed my sugar glider pureed baby-food fruit.<br>  <br>  She liked pears, apples and fruit blends.
JrnXCy49aa	For Rags - simply keep her outside for an hour after eating or drinking, and keep her away from the room the couch is in.<br>  <br>  Bubbles, according to info from Cesar Millan, needs far more walking, it's a lack of enough excersize that makes dogs escape and run.<br>  <br>  When you've fed them, give it ten minutes or so and go for a loooong walk with both.|`|qulGidPQaa	not sure about the question, but is your dog named after bubbles from trailer park boys|`|68a3ce8714283fd006a18f9cb99d497aaa	For Bubbles, I would suggest an 'invisible' fence.  This works via an electo-shock collar on the dog.  You set the wire around the yard (or bury it a few inches deep) and when the dog gets near it, they are shocked.  I'm sure you will hear people say it's cruel, but having your dog run off and get hit by a car is no fun.  The dog usually learns very quickly not to get near the invisible line, and the collar beeps before it shocks them, so they get a warning to back off.<br>  <br>  As for the peeing on the furniture,  I would need more info.  Do you have a cat, or some other animal that it smells on the couch?  Not to be rude, but does anyone in the house use it for 'intimate' moments?  The dog obviously has a reason for going on it.  Try taking some mouse traps and putting them under a layer of newspaper.  When the dog jumps up, the trap will go off.  It will scare Rags half to death, but the newspaper will keep the traps from hurting Rags.  Try cleaning the cushion (although if it were me, I would be in the market to buy a new couch!) with Nature's Miracle.  You also mentioned "if you don't take her out often enough."  I don't know how often this is, but have you thought about getting a tie-down stake and leaving her outside when you don't have time during the day to walk her?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6OdwRnxTaa	well...<br>  <br>  Try talking to your vet about Rags and the couch.<br>  <br>  Your dogs running away...how big is your backyard? Is it big enough for your dogs to run around in. Add an electric fence or something so that when they go out and try to go to far...they'll get shocked any yeah.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you dont have a good backyard or even front yard for your dogs to run around in...when you take them on walks...dont let your dog off the leash!!! as much as you want too...you are going to have to train them to not run far off. if you dont get them to come back like they are supposed to...you could have a lost pet on your hands...that wouldn't be fun at all<br>  <br>  Talk to your vet about these things. Ask if theres a way to train them to stop going on the couch and to come back when needed to when you take them on walks<br>  <br>  Or try finding a place where there is an dog trainer that trains dogs of how to do tricks and such.<br>  <br>  for Rags...get one of those potty training padds...that may help!!! just an idea!!!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA10941321	Here is a crazy idea DON'T GIVE HER THE CHANCE TO RUN AWAY also you may considered getting her micro chipped if not already done and take her out often so she doesn't go on the couch.|`|YJmGf4RLaa	any dog will take off given the opportunity.   it is up to you to not let that happen.|`|8cjFSBW9aa	OK, here's my two cents. Small dogs have bladders the size of a small walnut and have to be taken out frequently or else have a fenced in backyard and put in a doggie door. I had a Yorkie and for 4 years, it was a contest to see if I could get him--males are worse BTW---outside when I got home from work before he would just look right at me and then lift his leg on my curtains at my sliding glass doors. I think it was a game for him to watch me wig out every time he went in the apartment. I finally put down " Puppy Pads"  and he learned to go on those. These are pads that you get at the pet store that are scented to attract puppies to pee on them. They have an absorbable side that soaks up the urine and a plastic side that keeps the fluid from soaking through to the carpet. You have to train the puppies to go on the pads by making them aware of the pads---place them on them whenever you think they may be getting ready to go. They are a good idea if you work a full day and don't have anyone to take the puppy out during the day--or very small dog like my 5 pound Yorkie. But remember that the real goal is to housebreak the dog to go outside and that takes consistant work on your part too. You may want to consult a professional dog trainer. I hate to say it but I had to move to CA and couldn't take my Yorkie. Finding a home for him wasn't too hard since I gave him away and he was a very desirable dog for breeding. I just wanted to find him a good and loving home but, to be honest, he was still a brat when it came to housebreaking.<br>  As for your other dog, most cities in America have leash laws even if they are outside in Your yard but your yard doesn't have a fence. If your dog runs off and attacks another dog, you will be liable for not having her on a leash. Hopefully you have a fenced in back yard so she gets to run somewhere in a safe enclosed area. If she runs off, she probably wouldn't do well in a dog park. Also, you wouldn't want her running off and getting hit by a car either. Leash laws are for the safety of your dogs as well as other people and their dogs. To be a responsible dog owner, have a chip implanted in your dogs, have them trained so that You are running things in your house and not your dogs. Plus no one will want to visit you or have you bring your dogs over to visit if they are not well house trained and trained to obey their owners and know their limits with other people. If you don't have the area to run your dogs in a fenced in yard, with a doggie door, or cannot be available to take them out often and consistently, then you may want to look at more low maintenance pets.
0wKCaNocaa	they have something called odoban it kills 100%so the bateria which helps they smell better that febreze that is what I used at my house when I had a litter of eight pups running around they had alot of accidents|`|7G4hisdzaa	I'm sorry!

AA12001837	ok the only advice i can offer you here is that you should never clean the entire tank...especially not every 3 days.<br>  <br>  there is beneficial bacteria growing in the tank, and your fish need it to live.  <br>  <br>  do you use a pump, or do you just keep your goldfish in a bowl? (<---that's bad)<br>  <br>  put a filter and air pump in your tank.  when you clean your tank, only do a 25-30% water change every other week.  Unless they are in a bowl with no filter, do it once a week.<br>  <br>  but i repeat...NEVER clean the entire tank...and NEVER use soap or detergent.<br>  <br>  if you have gravel, use a gravel vac to clean your tank with.  it will get all of the waste on the bottom of the tank.<br>  <br>  goldfish give out a lot of waste.  in waste, there is ammonia.  test your ammonia levels.  if they are high, the fish will die.<br>  <br>  i also dont know how much you are feeding them, but at MOST you should only feed them a pinch of food twice a day.  whatever they can consume in 3-5 minutes.  that's it.  otherwise there will be a lot of unconsumed food floating around your tank that will also make it smell.  plus, fish dont have a sense of "fullness" and will eat until they die.|`|AA10665652	How long since you last cleaned the tank, did this problem start? You might want to clean it more often, especially if the fish are breeding, or if they're dying from under feeding, or over feeding. I've never owned a tank of fish, myself, but I have fed fish and cleaned the tank for friends, in the past. <br>  It might be due to breeding, but I'm thinking it might actually be due to seemign fish deaths, or even the day to day activities of the fish.|`|KGf0zXqkaa	agree totally with coltsgal!!!|`|tc3kYpTYaa	It sounds like your tank is being exposed to some sunlight.  If  this is the case the same thing will happen every fall if you do not take mesures to correct it.  If you decide to move your tank remember that in the spring the sun will be coming in from a different angle.  I would suggest covering the window that is exposing the tank to light with a heavy curtain or blanket durring this time of year.  Goldfish are very dirty fish and a little sunlight hitting the tank anytime during the day will cause this.
27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	You can give any shots at home except Rabies.  You don't need "certified" for anything.  I have a refridgerator full of all kinds of vetting supplies.  My daughter (15) has been drawing blood and doing Heartworm tests for 4 years.  Giving shots for five.  <br>  <br>  I found this (?) from your pregnant dog situation.  DO NOT GIVE HER SHOTS IF SHE IS PREGNANT!!!  The day she whelps you can give her a booster but not before!!|`|FUmjD9b3aa	You already can give vaccinations at home to your own dogs.  The only thing about giving the rabies vaccination is that it will not be recognized as current if a licensed Veterinarian hasn't given it.  That would mean your dog couldn't be quarantined at home if it bit someone but would have to go to a shelter, or Vet clinic for the observation period.<br>  <br>  I must admit to never having heard of the Nuvet program you spoke of?<br>  <br>  Edit:  I just did a search but only came up with Nu Vet Laboratories?|`|tvADhzi2aa	I have never heard of it.... but under the law of most states anyone can give injections... you just have to be a licensed vet to give rabies vaccines
1c3t8S6Kaa	Does he have popeye? Doubtful.<br>  <br>  The thing with bubbleeyes is that they were originally bred from the telescope goldfish, so some occasionally still have a little bit of the 'telescope' stalk behind their eye, making it look a little popped.  <br>  <br>  If it were another type of fish, maybe worry a little bit, but since it is a bubbleeye, I would say to just watch him for now. Add some  aquarium salt(1 tablespoon for every 5 gallons of water he is in)  if you want to do something.  Arbitrarily adding medications will do more harm then good for him.<br>  <br>  If for some reason, he does lose the eye, no it wont ever grow back.  He will, however be able to get along pretty much alright with only one eye as long as he doesn't have any bully-like tank mates.<br>  <br>  If he loses the bubble, it may grow back(assuming it doesn't get infected while the broken bubble is healing).  It wont grow back to match the other side, however, it will always be smaller or a little misshapen.|`|f0e57d91912429e23d93c39bb20af333aa	does the fish's eye have a white haze over it? medication is not effective on pop eye quite yet all you can do is a salt bath and pray.
T8thZoEbaa	Watch "Dog Whisperer" his name is Cesar Millan on tv if you can get it or google him.<br>  <br>  He's great, he gets more into the mind of the dog and also into "your mind".<br>  <br>  I taught my Lab/Border Collie immediatly to calm down (which is hard for a 6 month Border Collie) and sit by using a simple technique he used.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I tape his shows, because my dog is still a puppy and going through all of it, the chewing, jumping on people when they walk in the door, pulling on the leash.<br>  <br>  Well, all of that has pretty much stopped, but I do work with him at least 3 times a day.<br>  <br>  good luck and HAVE Fun ::)|`|d7ebd442c0485ef336df44d1c657c7b2aa	Classes are very good for socialization, and I would strongly encourage you to go.  I think the best overrall dog training/understanding dogs book is one called "Mother Knows Best," by Carol Benjamin.  Make sure no one talks you into one of these trendy, silly, treat centered training methods.  All they do is teach your dog to behave when you have food with you.  Benjamin helps you to teach your dog the way its mother would.|`|doz7RIoeaa	Any dog can be trained at home... I trained my two german shepherds by myself. they sit, stay, heel, lay down and come on command... the key is partience and consistency. choose the type of command and stick with it. Dont change the tone or pitch of your voice (or hand motion if you want that) when giving the same command. And never in an angry voice (unless you want the dog to stop doing a specific thing). Always use it's name when praising, never when scolding so it will associate it's name with something positive. So when you call it, it will come bcause hearing it's name always means something good. Individual dogs have individual characters. Again, just be patient. and do the training outdoors with lots of positie reinforcments. dont spend too much time on one session as the dog might get bored.|`|AQIF3qIbaa	the training classes are really to train the people more than train the dog.  You don't need to go to the classes if you know what positive reinforcements to use, none of my dogs have ever gone to the formal doggy kindergarten classes, and are very well behaved.  <br>  <br>  Just use lots of verbal praise and occasional treats when the dog does what you ask it to.  Don't reprimand him when you are trying to teach him, unless it is a neutral "nope, try again" sort of redirection.  Be patient and persistent.
2pZiWeTaaa	I have two oscars, and with them i have a green severum, pictus catfish, columbian shark(catfish), a channel catfish, bluegill.  All those fish i know for a fact are good with oscars.  below are a few more that I've heard that are good with oscars and there potential sizes.  I also have african cichlids and i don't recomend haveing them together, they both need different ph and hardness needs.   For oscars it's recommended that they have at least 55 gallons, but i suggest 75 for a single oscar just to give it more room and to make it easier to keep up on the tank maintenance.  So if you plan on getting it friends be sure to have a 90 gallon + in mind.   I know it looks bare now, but wait till it gets 12+ inches and it will be a different story.<br>  <br>  Synodontis Catfish - 7"<br>  Black Lancer Catfish - 8"<br>  Clown Loach - 12" <br>  Tinfoil Barb - 12" <br>  Silver Dollars - 6"<br>  Jade Eyed Cichlid - 6"<br>  Chocolate Cichlid - 12"<br>  Pumpkinseed - 5 to 7"  <br>  Banded Leporinus - 8"|`|MKxHscklaa	other ocrers if there is enough room or african cichlids (seen at petco) make sure there is like 60 gal though|`|3de2d793e4ecf25407f3ba7e029d7783aa	i have a cat fish (synodontis) in my tank with my oscar, aslong as you have hiding places it will be fine, and its bigger enough not to fit in an oscars mouth.|`|d84b03804cab833afdfbb991099703b0aa	you can get another oscar but you must have a tank that is at least 55 or more gallons( even for just the one you have).
wl3WTsh7aa	If you have a short hair dog, try Aveeno baby shampoo.  I have been using for years on my Toy Fox Terrier and the oatmeal formula works great.  Johnson and Johnson works better for long hair dogs like Yorkies and Shi-tzus.  I would try something like that before I got too panicky over parasites.|`|3ANWwYTaaa	Go to a pets supplies store. They have Puppy, oatmeal, and medicated shampoos. When you go to the vet with your puppy you need to ask for proper guidance on the puppy's flaking problem. We are not vets out here, the wrong answer could harm you pet.|`|j5RR0iFVaa	The best shampoo to use is tearless puppy shampoo or an oatmeal rinse.  It is not a good idea to use people shampoo cause the ph is too high and that will make matters worse.  Also make sure he has enough omega 3&6 and fatty acids in his diet cause that will cause dry skin as well.
499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Gestation is usually around 4 weeks. Usually the fish will get very large looking and will have a dark spot near the anal fin. It is hard to spot on black mollies.<br>  <br>  If you know she is pregnant and want to isolate her, do so now. You don't want to wait until she is close to delivery because the stress may cause her to abort. Personally, I suggest that you leave her where she is and provide some plants for hiding places. Java ferns are good for the fry to hide in. I usually put all my plants close together in a corner of my tank away from the filter intake. Some will not survive, but she will have 30+ fry (or more if this is not her first time). My guess is that your tank is not large enough to support all of those anyway-<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|tXQzLapYaa	she will ask you to put the bacon on.ha ha|`|8McCqHHbaa	the first response is correct, but another way to tell is she will become almost squarish looking instead of round.  Enjoy your new batch :)|`|K85W2ra5aa	There is no spacific way to answer that question. mollies take around 30 days to give birth after getting pregnant. as you probably allready know, the fish starts to get bigger, but fish don't allways double their wieght when ready to give birth. younger mollies usually don't give birth to as many fry as bigger full grown fish do. you may not even know if she is pregnant untill you see babies in the tank. if you suspect a molly is ready to give birth in the next few days, put the fish in a seperate tank filled with plants for the babies to hide in (with heater) or in breeder net with pertective panel for babies to fall down that has to small an opening for mother to fallow. there is no perfect way to keep all babies safe from being eaten but byputing them in a breeder net and giving them places to hide is a good way... making sure you remove the mther after done giving birth. Good Luck withthe new arival!!

The office may be closed, but there should be a recording giving the number to their answering service.  Call them and explain the situation, they will relay the message to the vet on call and he will return your call and can advise you as to whether you should meet him at the office, the puppy can wait til morning, the puppy is fine or where to take the puppy for a fully staffed emergency clinic.  If you think that the situation is too dire to spend all that time on the phone, then you shouldn't be on the computer, you should be on your way to the nearest emergency vet clinic/hospital.  Good luck!|`|6zPKNQy9aa	I'm assuming that you mean your dog is having puppies and one of the pups is having trouble breathing?<br>  make sure the air way is clear look in the mouth just be gentle, tip the puppy upside down so he is facing the ground and gently but quicky rub him from back to front, try to get him to cry which will also help to clear his lungs of any fluids!|`|p8r0PCMwaa	what do u mean by "color" -  do u mean "collar"?<br>  Well i guessed right it might be becoz it's too tight or something.

AA10221896	This is the same answer I posted on your first version of the question. I haven't been on Answers in a few years, and was intrigued that someone contacted me. I understood why when I saw your questions. I have a bunch of birds -- lovebirds, parrotlets, cockatiels and, yes, parakeets.<br>  <br>  To find out whether your parakeet indeed has a broken wing, you could take him -- very carefully -- to a pet store, or a bird or wildlife rehabber. A broken wing tends to droop and hang, depending on where the break is. You can generally trace the main bones of the wing and find a place where it wiggles and is not able to be controlled by the bird.<br>  <br>  Avian vets are hugely expensive. One of their techs might tell you off duty, free, whether the wing is broken. If you have a wildlife rehabber in your area, they might be able to recommend their vet, and that vet may allow you to make payment arrangements.<br>  <br>  Finding a local rehabber is as easy as calling your local animal control, or humane society. Ask them if there are any local wildlife shelters or bird rescuers in your area.<br>  <br>  Until you know for sure, a few suggestions to make your friend more comfortable are to keep his perches low, make sure to keep him in a quiet, draft-free, warm location, and give him a more nutritious diet than seeds-only. My birds like scrambled eggs or chopped hard boiled ones, finely grated carrot, thawed frozen corn, canned pumpkin, and bits of bell pepper. Cuttlebone is essential, and will help him heal.<br>  <br>  If/when you transport him, carry him carefully in a well-padded carrier or secure, ventilated box. If you can, open the box in dim lighting so he doesn't start and try to fly into the light.|`|FGn8okQQaa	Why can you not take it to the vet?  If the bird's wing is broken, then it needs an avian vet just like if your arm was broken, you'd need to go to the hospital.  It's cruel to just let the bird suffer just because of whatever reason you're not getting it the medical care it needs.  Get a ride with someone you know, borrow money, see if you can do a payment plan, whatever, if you care about your bird, you will get it to the vet somehow!<br>  <br>  And don't try to fix it yourself like someone said; you don't know how to do it and you'd likely hurt the bird even worse.  D:|`|fJaZbXTkaa	he's (or she's?) probably fine, as long as it doesn't affect your bird's feeding, flying, or perching habits, then it might go away. was it like this when you got your bird? if you are really concerned, you can call a vet, they can answer a lot of questions. i called when i was freaked out when my parakeet popped a bloodfeather crashing into a wall, but she's totally fine now. if it's nothing serious then he should heal, parakeets are pretty tough little birds!|`|4XN052WMaa	im not sure if im right.......but if i am your bird might have a broken wing somehow.....did the bird get hurt in anyway? or did u ever forcefully held it?(sometimes u do that and u cripple the wing....it happened once when i was really small i didnt noe better...:( ) well i had one of my pets getting a broken leg once and i fixed it my self.....so first of all, check if she/he has a fracture by feeling its crooked wing. if u feel that some part of the bone is diffrent than the other wing(like seperated) than it broke its wing. i have to tell u that bandaging a bird is way more complicated especially on the wing cuz they need it to fly. the bandage often falls off, gets bitten off etc.... but try your best. you may need two people to help you one is to hold the bird and another to fix the wing. just bandage it snugly and try to make the bone pieces fit together  so it would look like the oter wing.<br>  <br>  theres alot of reasons why your bird is doing that and im no expert so mayb find something on the internet. but the best thing to do is to take it to the vet. feel its crooked wing for any abnormal growths as well ok? sorry im not much help.|`|AA10339742	Get the little guy to a Vet At Once!!

This behaviour should go away on its own after a while, but it may take a long time and she may never get any better.  It is always better to choose a rat from a breeder that is very tame and friendly to begin with.  I would suggest you keep doing what you are doing, taking her out and playing with her, offering her treats and petting her gently.  Make sure your hands are washed before handling her, as fingers smelling of food can cause her to nip.  You can also try carrying her around in the front pocket of a hoodie, this will make her feel safe so she will likely sit still and you may be able to pet her this way.  Just keep at it and eventually she should calm down.  Good luck!|`|QOat0VXwaa	just give her time<br>  I used to keep rats and for me some of the females just needed more time to adjust
nRR734G7aa	So does mine sometimes.  I don't think there's a way of stopping them from snoring, perhaps you could gently move your cat into a different sleeping position to open his airway up a bit.  They tend to snore when they're in a deep sleep so you probably won't wake him if you're careful.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't normally snore, he might have a little infection like a cold, blocking his nose up.|`|Ix7krzhdaa	Cat snoring could be as simple as being in a deep sleep, or it could be a sign of problems.  Listen carefully next time she snores, and listen for fluid sounds or blocking sounds (you'll hear a slight gurgle or a sound as if the air is stopped and forcibly started) If you hear either of the sounds, make a vet appointment!  Cats can suffer from allergies, even to them selves, and also get sinus infections and even apnea.  There are many concerns if it has been a sudden onset snoring, but it is spring, so it could be allergies.  I'd just see her vet, or even just call her vet for advice, many will give advice free of charge.|`|PeQ40WcWaa	You can't, I'm afraid!|`|e6V3vgVxaa	dont let him sleep|`|Aurhesleaa	When my cat snores I make him a bed of old clothes in a laundry basket, stick him in it, then shove him outside my room and into the hallway. :(|`|AgYnmUmxaa	Tiny breathe-right strips. Or lock him in the living room.|`|X4hz3a9haa	some cats snore when they sleep--only because they are comfortable and relax completely. they do not snore loudly, so the sound cannot annoy you unless you are not fond of kitty.<br>  if you do not like kitty, please find kitty a new home. if yo really do like yor kitty, please be kind to kitty. snoring kitty is not a bad thing.<br>  <br>  have fun with kitty.|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Don't get him drunk before beddybyes?
ckiRlCkLaa	Depending on how old the kittens are you can start to offer them hard food and fresh water.  I know you don't want to hear this but honestly the only way to prevent anymore kittens is to have the cat spayed or keep the cat indoors at all times.   Best of luck|`|0880ac45fbb6456e1e6cd4a33571a64faa	Do the responsible thing and get the cat fixed.|`|nYt9Dw9uaa	The only way to ease it I know of is having her spayed. <br>  <br>  The momma cat should finish weaning the kittens herself, just be sure you keep out water and wet kitten food so she can teach them to eat it. She will start denying the kittens access to her to wean them when she is confident they are ready and there is plenty for them to eat.|`|ezswj3uZaa	ahhh..okay.  let the momma wein her kitten naturally..once you notice that they are eating food and drinking water..take your cat to the vet and get her fixed..<br>  if shes just comming into heat and starting her wining and rubbing of things..KEEP HER INDOORS AT ALL TIMES..SHE will calm down in about 3 weeks, maybe sooner..at that time take her to the vet to get fixed!!!!! its cheaper if shes out of her heat cycle..so keep a close eye..|`|AA11476807	Wean the kittens, (kittens four-five weeks old can be weaned)find them good homes if you are not keeping them and get the momma fixed as soon as possible.|`|JX6EIKoGaa	Leave them alone but put food out anyway. Take them to the vet and get them fixed or neutered.
dLHquAsqaa	Firstly, congratulations on your new bundle of fun!<br>  In answer to your question...there are a few options you have...<br>  1. buy a scratch post. every time your kitty scratches you or any of the furniture, pick  it up and carry it to the scratch post. Gently stratch the post and it should copy you (wel, mine did anyway). I found it helps to have two scratch posts, one in the living room and one where kitty sleeps and eats. You can buy scratch posts from all pet shops and they range from about 5 pounds to 30. (the more expensive ones have different layers and toys attached-some even have bads or hammocks!)<br>  2. de-claw kitty. take your kitten to the vet and have its claws removed. this process is very cruel and hurts the cat, plus they cannot defend themselves if they get into a fight. i strongly do not reccomend this.<br>  3. clip kittys nails. you should do this every 5 or 6 weeks and there are 2 ways to do it...<br>  -take kitty to the vet and they will clip them for you. this only takes a few minutes and ensures that the nails are clipped correctly. the downside of this is its difficult to get kitty to and from the vets, most cats don't like cars and you have to wait at the vets ... the whole process can be a little bit stressful for both you and kitty. also, it cost me 8 pounds to get my cats nails clipped, which is very expensive for a two minute job.<br>  -clip kittys nails yourself. you can either buy nail clippers for about 10 pounds from any pet shop (i recommend the 'guillitine' ones) and they are quite good, or you could simply use 'jumbo' nail clippers (i mean like normal ones...for humans lol) which also work just as well but have a downside: it is easy to clip the skin or fur of kitty at the same time. with the pet shop ones they are closed and can only cut the nail. when you do it yourself, hold kitty firmly, so it can't struggle or pull away, and take one of its paws in your hand. press on one of the pink 'pads' on its paw and the nail should go forward. clip the tip of the claw sideways on, but only on the clear part. DO NOT clip the pink bit inside the claw, this will hurt kitty and probably make it bleed. keep feeding kitty treats in between paws so it feels safe and happy. the back paws dont need clipping as often as the front ones.<br>  <br>  I personally recommend doing what I did with my kitten. I took my kitty to the vet and got his nails clipped by them once so I knew exactly how to do it. then i bought some clippers from the pet shop and have done it by myself ever since. also, I got a scratch post anyway.<br>  <br>  You put in your question:<br>  'Often times it claws when it "massages" with its paws.'<br>  and you might find it interesting to know that the kittens "massage" their mothers like this to stimulate their mothers milk glands. the kittens who do this were weaned from their mothers quite early in life and they therefore long to have their mother's milk. when they massage you like this they love you and trust you like their mother and so they therefore paw you like this to try and stimulate their mothers milk glands.<br>  <br>  good luck with the scratching!<br>  x|`|VRJCtQlAaa	Despite the fact that many will say not to declaw a cat, have her declawed....she will be given anesthesia and pain meds after for pain management...I've seen too many pets "homeless" for scratching the furniture....|`|nyQMDwWYaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It's a kitten! She plays! All kittens do this, they are just babies and want to play so they pretend they are hunting and then accidently claws you. When your cat  gets more mature she will stop.<br>  <br>  love,<br>  animal helper|`|nYt9Dw9uaa	She's young and may not know how to quite control it yet. The kneading, yeah, that can be painful. You can yelp a little in pain and put her down when she does it. If she's clawing people jumping around, she is still working on getting her balance and is a little clumsy. Just be sure you do not wrestle with her with hands. That will encourage it more.<br>  And yes, you can trim her claws, very carefully. That will make it a little less prickly.|`|AA11920624	kfrost  is absolutely right -clipping your kitties nails starting now, you will be able to clip nails anytime necessary....it doesn't hurt them or you, but starting as a kitten they won't be so against it as they get older. Talk to the baby while you're clipping and keep her/him calm. As an adult cat she'll/he'll be just as calm. Good luck.|`|AA11476807	They now have plastic covers you can put over kitties claws.  You can find them in pet stores and sometimes in stores such as Wal Mart, etc. or go to<br>   <a href="http://softpaws.com" rel="nofollow">http://softpaws.com</a>|`|Hhx2h7Xmaa	OK, this is short but- tap it's paw gently whenever it's claws come out if it's not sharpening them on a scratching post or something. Even if it's not scratching you. Never declaw a cat! It's just to cruel.|`|ezswj3uZaa	an easy fix..get nail clippers and clip her nails.  the nails should be clear, just cut the tips off..dont cut where you see pink or you'll make her bleed.

Had a gorgeous nature and very playful.<br>  These dogs are quite often born in kennels and are not only far less expensive but more importantly, desperate for someone to love them.  I love a good "mutt".  My last dog was a labrador/collie cross, a very affectionate dog, highly playful though perhaps a little bigger than you're looking for.<br>  Gun dogs are a good pic, as it is their instinctive behaviours that make them more willing to fetch, or do agility tasks and enjoy it so these are:<br>  Labradors<br>  Spaniels<br>  Weinmeranas (not right spelling I think)<br>  Retrievers<br>  <br>  Quite commonly, a lot of these breeds are the very type that end up having "cross" puppies, the mother is often put into kennels as the owners don't want the pups, and you could have a lovely dog, perfectly healthy and happy saved from a life behind bars.<br>  Your local RSPCA or Pet Sanctuary or even private kennels (some house rescue dogs along side boarding animals) may be housing the very critter for you as we speak.<br>  Enjoy your search.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	Some of the top ten most playful breeds:<br>  <br>  Small breeds:<br>  <br>  Brittany Spaniels<br>  English Springer Spaniels<br>  Cavalier King Spaniels<br>  Papillons<br>  Bichon Frises<br>  <br>  Large breeds:<br>  <br>  Labrador Retrievers<br>  Irish Setters<br>  Golden Retrievers|`|ZYouNFQbaa	we have 2 staffs, they are 6 and 7 and they are very playful still!!!!<br>  we also have 2 boys aged 6 and 8 and they are a right handful all together.<br>  Remember that as puppies they need toilet training, they also need regular check ups and boosters so that can cost money.<br>  They don't stay puppies long. <br>  They snore really loudly when they sleep, <br>  they shed a lot of hair so you will constantly be sweeping or hoovering and that is all dogs not just staffs.<br>  think carefully before taking a dog on.<br>  Oh yes and my biggest thing about dogs is that if you go out for the day or want to go away for the weekend or something you always need to consider who will look after the dog.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Pretty much all puppies are playful, unless they have been abused.<br>  <br>  The problem is, is that they don't stay puppies for long.<br>  <br>  You would do far better to decide on a type of dog that would suit you, then have fun for the few weeks when it is a puppy.|`|uec7RIhbaa	two of my friends have lab puppies - playful they are but they are also destructive and exhausting!!!!  |`|rQFNivhNaa	I've got beardies and they are wonderfully playful, and cute looking too|`|AA12186734	Can`t go wrong for play full when it comes to a cocker spaniel,Play full as puppies,play full even up to the day they die.Faithful,Property protective,great with kids and can`t get enough of you,medium size so you don`t have to carry them like you would a smaller dog if you go for a beach walk and a lot easier on the furniture and wallet when it comes to a puppy that doesn`t chew furniture and eat like a horse if you got a bigger one.As for faithful,They are number one on the list next to labradors. |`|fad6c79100222b0b4ae048c370866c9aaa	Most puppy's are playful, haven't ever seen a puppy that doesn't come in cute!  As much as that is a nice attitude for a puppy to have you may be better of looking at general temperament of the breed/s as well as taking into consideration size, your and their activity level as well as how much time and money you have to spend in relation to their upkeep (grooming, feed, etc). <br>  <br>  Cavalier-smaller type dog, generally very friendly, longish coat will need regular grooming, adorable.<br>  <br>  Poodle-I probably wouldn't go miniature or standard(large), very intelligent, quite active, needs clipping or scissoring every 6 to 8 weeks, make wonderful pets if treated like one of the family but not being able to get away with nuisance behavior.<br>  <br>  Springer Spaniels- Love them myself but have met very few that have been taught grooming procedures from very young and aren't a bit bitey when they are being groomed out, they are active, in most cases friendly, you will need to give them more exercise than the two above and a normal size backyard would be fine.<br>  <br>  Fox terrier- have great little personalities, short hair for easy care, they are active(may be to active, they will become destructive if not properly mentally stimulated). They are great little do-ers.<br>  <br>  Larger dogs being a Labrador or Golden Retriever are usually great with people, good with other dogs and most definitely playful as puppies. Both need quite a bit of exercise but do slow down as they get older. Lab's have a short thick coat while G. Ret. longer coat meaning more grooming necessary. Both if bathed regularly tend to quite like the experience(love water).<br>  <br>  Truth is for every dog there is pro's and con's.  Mongrel's(mixture of different breeds) often have less breed associated medical problems(eg German Shepard -hip displacia. Rotty's-bone cancer in the legs).  There are sites that you can google that will help you decide which dog will best fit into your life situation.  All dog's given enough love, attention and training can be the ultimate friend and family member.<br>  <br>  I hope you find the puppy that best suits you!!  Truth is even if you end up with a puppy that isn't quite what you were hoping for chances are it will find it's way into your heart anyway, they all have a nack for that(some of my dogs worst habits are the things I now miss the most since they have passed away).<br>  <br>  Enjoy ur new found friend.....when you get it of course.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|hktbfRPWaa	Most puppies are playful.

rMzEt909aa	No apple cider vinegar is not good for skin conditions.  <br>  Since Poms have such a thick undercoat, are you sure you're getting all the soap out when you bathe her?  <br>  If you just bathe her in a tub of standing water, and then rinsing her in another tub of clear water, then I would say that could be part of your problem.  You are not getting all the soap out of her heavy coat.  I prefer to bathe my dog using a hand held shower to be sure I'm getting all the shampoo out.  <br>  Also, it might do her good to use a no tear baby shampoo on her, as it's much more gentle.  That's what I use on my fur baby.  <br>  Another thing that might be cause for concern is the fact that your Pom likes to jump in the pool.  The chorine is not good for animal skin, and just like with humans, should be washed off after being in the water.  <br>  You say your Pom is on flea meds.  If it's just some powder, then that also could be part of your problem.  Most vets reccomend  Frontline or something of that sort, because you simply part the hair between the shoulder blades, put the oily medicine on the skin, and don't bathe for at least 3 days.  You must wait a few days after applying any flea meds, or else you will just wash it right off.  And, you don't want to be constantly putting different flea meds on your dog, because that could be too much going into it's bood stream at a time, and could make your dog sick.  <br>  Has your dog been exposed to other dogs recently, and one of them might have mange?  That is contagious and can lead to some very serious issues.<br>  Good luck, I hope something in here has helped in some small way.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	The chlorine in the pool might be making his skin dry. Cut out the swim time and see if he improves.|`|dvS6F9ZSaa	The chlorine has a tendency to dry out the skin.  After swimming, wash him down with regular water.  Moisturizing shampoo will also help.  Check his skin in the area he scratches the most and look for anything out of the ordinary.  Consult a vet if it persists.  The vet may give you an anti-microbial for his skin.  That will ease the itching too.|`|s76aC4G8aa	the chlorine could be very drying to his skin and that might be the issue.

AA12083992	You need to take the dog to a vet to get a flea remedy that works. OTC stuff does not work (as you found out) and most can harm your pet. Not only do you have to treat the pet but you will have to treat anywhere the pet goes, rugs, furniture , beds, etc.  Every where the dog goes he is dropping fleas and flea eggs that will hatch. Have the vet recommend what to use on your furniture and stuff. Good luck.|`|p7swtBYzaa	ONLY thing that absolutely works is a good name brand topical liquid on the back of his neck every single month - Frontline or Advantage.<br>  <br>  Forget the dips, flea shampoo, flea collars, powders, etc. - they only get rid of a few adult fleas, eggs and larvae hatch, fleas are right back.<br>  <br>  Put your dog on Frontline or Advantage every month - prevention is the key.<br>  <br>  If he has so many, you need to take him to the vet and get a pill, Capstar, that gets rid of all fleas within the hour.   Then wash bedding, vacuum rugs and sofas and throw out the bag,  bomb your house if it is infested.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prevention - this is not the place to try to save money with less than name brand topical monthly liquids.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|QRTqfiXGaa	Honestly flea collars don't really work, because the fleas just move to other parts of the body.<br>  <br>  I would get a flea "dip".

I found this to be very successful!<br>  <br>  How to Use Borax to Kill Fleas<br>  <br>  <br>  Fleas can quickly become a problem for not just your pet but your entire household. A flea infestation usually requires treating large areas of your house with special purpose chemicals, many of which are expensive and inconvenient. In this how to you will learn how to use borax, which is both cheap and easy to use, to treat your home for fleas.<br>  <br>  InstructionsDifficulty: Moderately Easy <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  Borax, broom, vacuum <br>  <br>  Step1-Locate areas where fleas are most likely to nest, these are locations you will want to target with borax. Carpets, rugs, behind and underneath furniture, these are all potential flea nesting areas and locations to treat with borax. <br>  <br>  Step 2-Carry out a spot test on your carpet. Sprinkle a small amount of Borax on a small section of carpet and allow it to sit for a short period of time. Check the carpet for a change of color or any other damage that the borax might do to your carpet. If the borax appears to alter your carpet in any way do not use it. <br>  <br>  Step 3-Lightly shake borax over the area you would like to treat. Do not use an excessive amount. A light dusting, enough to work into the material is more than enough. <br>  <br>  Step 4-Work the borax into the material with a broom making sure all of it works down in between the fibers where fleas and their eggs are. <br>  Step 5-Allow the borax to sit forat least 6 hours. During this time keep any children or pets you have away from the borax as it is toxic to them. Also avoid exposing the borax to any moisture. If the area you live in has high humidity do not allow the borax to sit for as long, as it will absorb moisture and make cleanup more difficult. <br>  <br>  Step 6-Vacuum up the borax and dispose of it. Vacuum the area where you used the borax several time to make sure you have removed all of it. If your vacuum cleaner has a removable bag change the bag once you have finished picking up all of the remaining borax. <br>  <br>  This WORKS and your carpet will look brighter and smell cleaner!  Good Luck!|`|re2ZtPV3aa	!!! Only about 10% of the flea population (mainly the adults) are on your pet !!! - Read the source provided<br>  <br>  A mistake seen all too often is the "more is better" approach that some people take when using flea products. More is NOT better when it comes to chemicals or medications! Following package directions is essential when using over the counter products and medications. Only buy products that are labeled for use on the species you will be using them on (dog, cat, etc.). Cats in particular are very sensitive to drugs and chemicals - be sure to read all labels carefully.<br>  <br>  Even when labels are read and instructions are followed, adverse reactions to flea product can happen. Call your vet immediately. Other resources are Animal Poison Control Center and Adverse Drug Reporting hotlines.<br>  <br>  * Shampoos and dips - A shampoo, or "flea bath" is a good first attack on fleas for the pet that has large numbers of fleas visible on its body. Cats can be difficult to bathe. It is important to realize that a flea shampoo is not intended for lasting control. Many people are surprised when they see fleas and it was "only a week ago" that the pet had a flea bath. Shampoos are only effective for a day or less. They leave little residual chemical on the animal when properly used.<br>  <br>  Flea dips are strong chemical rinses to rid animals not only of fleas, but mites and ticks as well. I do not recommend dips unless absolutely necessary, as in the case of a mite infestation. Dips last approximately 1-2 weeks. That is a lot of chemical residue to leave on an animal! Flea shampoos and dips are effective for adult fleas.<br>  * Flea collars - Flea collars work one of two ways - by emitting a toxic (to fleas, anyway) gas, and by being absorbed into the animal's subcutaneous fat layer. The toxic gas is usually only effective in the immediate area of the head and neck. This type of collar is best used in the vacuum cleaner bags to kill any fleas vacuumed up. The collars that absorb into the subcutaneous fat are much more effective. Flea collars are effective for adult fleas.<br>  * Flea powders and sprays Flea powders and sprays offer short term (2-3 day) protection from fleas, and with some products, ticks and mites too. Powders and sprays have fallen out of favor recently with the newer spot-on treatments that are available. Most flea powders and sprays are only effective for adult fleas, some offer additional flea protection by inhibiting flea egg and larval development.<br>  * Spot-on treatments - Common brand names include: Advantagetm, Frontline?, and Bio-Spot? just to name a few. These products are applied between the shoulder blades of the pet, and typically last about one month. Spot-on treatments are effective for adult fleas. Some include ingredients to inhibit the larva from emerging from the flea egg and some are active against larval development as well.<br>  * Oral medications - Flea "pills", such as Program? and Sentinel? work by stopping the larva from emerging from the flea egg. Program? is also available as an injectable medication for cats. Fleas ingest the blood of animals on these medications, and the female fleas then lay eggs that are unable to hatch. They do NOT kill adult fleas. These medications are essential to break the flea life cycle and stop the flea problem when used in conjunction with flea adulticide treatments.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  READ: Do not use Hartz brand flea products.

yOz6GY44aa	I don't know about beagles in apartments. I've owned many beagles over the years, and one thing they all had in common--they loved being outdoors on the trail. Whenever we let them in as a "treat", they would be okay for about 5 minutes and then beg to be let out. They just didn't like being cooped up in a house. And it's not like it was a small house. It was an old fashioned ranch-style farm house. You could get by with them as long as you take them to a dog park every day and really let them get their energy out. They would likely behave in the house as long as they were well exercised. They really don't bark as much as people think. They will bark when they are on a trail, but they hardly ever bark otherwise. Their instinct is to alert the rest of the 'pack' to the hunt, not to alert for intruders. Our labs always went nuts when company came, but the beagles just sat back and watched. Every dog is different, though.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend pugs, boston terriers, cocker spaniels, bulldogs, dachshunds, or basset hounds. I realize that bassets have the same instinct to hunt and follow trails, but they are more of the long-haul trail dog. They are meant for following 'cold' trails, so they don't need as much exercise and tend to be less energetic than beagles.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	What about a puggle - pug/ beagle mix...good looking dogs that will not be too bad for an apt?  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pugglesville.com/puggles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pugglesville.com/puggles.html</a>|`|jmz0VTR7aa	It depends on the the individual dog, of course, but I have had great success with my Miniature Australian Shepherd in an apartment. I would normally never do any size of a herding breed in an apartment, they just need too much exercise as they were bred to run all day, but since my guy is a mini he is a little easier to wear down. He does need two short walks or one really looong walk a day to be good, but he fits in with my lifestyle great. The other good thing about Aussies is they are not prone to barking.

They are great "watch dogs", very loyal,protective,scrappy, tenacious and smart as a whip! A bonus, is that they can be litter box or poo pad trained- if you are on a multi story with out easy yard access.<br>  <br>  As far as being frou frou- they were actually bred to be "ratters", used in mills and farms in England- and often accompanied there masters to the pub for a pint!<br>  <br>  The down side, is that they are true companion dogs, so being alone for more than 8-10 hours a day can make them lonely- a cure for this, is to consider getting two!|`|8FBbcnKGaa	Pugs are great small dogs with a rather calm demeanor.

AUD1wZ5Kaa	You do sound really good with animals. But, anyhow, I suggest you give it some space. Don't try to pick it up much. But, you can try to stroke him and pick him up later on when he gets familiar with you and less frightened. You could get more familiar with him by spending time with him, don't ask me how. Maybe you could sit in the same room as him, and read a book. And if he squawks, just look over and maybe get up and walk over to him to see if he's okay. To kind of show him that you're watching him all the time. Give him what he needs, like that thing birds use to keep their beak in good shape, a feeding bowl, water bowl, basic things, to show you can take care of him.|`|MR4LFMY0aa	let him get justed to his suroundings, play music for him and talk to him but give him space and let him get used to your voice|`|9NrjExV9aa	DO NOT try to stroke him, or take him away form his cage. If he's a single bird, don't worry. With time, he will think of you as his flock mate, where as if you try to grab him he will think of you as a frightening creature. He seems to be coming along fine if he's already singing. For now just keep the radio or tv on while your away. While you're in the house try to be in his sight as much as possible, and maybe just sit in front of his cage and talk or sing to him. Let him come to you. You can start to feed him millet as a treat to help him know you're not a scary thing. Don't get him another bird because he seems lonely... unless you're fine with him losing all interest in you. Good luck with your new friend!

6xf1GfbUaa	That's actually pretty normal at first. Cats are VERY territorial and he sees her as an intruder. It's best if you either keep them apart until he gets used to her "smell", or carefully supervise them when they're close. Since today is the very first time they met, it's normal to get these kinds of reactions. That will happen any time you bring a new animal to your home. Actually, to "HIS" home LOL.. that's how he sees it.<br>  Don't worry too much for now ~ that will definitely pass, and in a few days they'll be buddies. Trust me, that exact same scenario happened to me when I brought my new kitten home and I already had another cat and a dog.

LazxXqXjaa	Spaying/neutering helps to control pet overpopulation by preventing accidental pregnancies.  Even if you're a responsible owner, it doesn't mean everyone else is - and a male dog can smell a female in heat from 2 miles away.<br>  <br>  The procedures also carry medical benefits - in females, it prevents pyometra (a very dangerous uterine infection), eliminates ovarian/uterine cancer, and greatly reduces mammary cancer.  In males, neutering helps to prevent dominance-related behavior issues and eliminates the risk of testicular cancer.  In both males and females, there is some debate over the possible increase in certain cancer rates in spayed/neutered pets, and increases in joint/bone problems...but these findings are controversial and the veterinary community still advocates that the benefits of spaying/neutering greatly outweigh the risks.<br>  <br>  The procedure itself involves removing the reproductive organs - it is a much simpler surgery in males than females.  Females require a more intensive and costly abdominal surgery to remove the ovaries and uterus, while in males the testicles are removed - the abdominal cavity is not opened.  The greatest risk of the surgery is the anesthesia, so pre-surgical bloodwork is recommended to make sure the liver/kidneys can handle the anesthesia, and there are sufficient platelets/red blood cells/white blood cells, etc.  An IV catheter is also recommended to maintain stable blood pressure and to provide access for IV emergency drugs if needed.  Pain meds are adminstered after the procedure for a weeks or so - dogs are very good at concealing pain so it's not reliable to expect them to show signs of pain, even after major surgery.<br>  <br>  If done correctly, the risk of the surgery is very low.  Talk to your vet about their surgery protocols and make sure you feel comfortable and ask lots of questions about how your pet will be monitored during anesthesia, pain management, recovery, etc.|`|h9t1UTm4aa	I'm going to be blunt. Both are surgical procedures that are carried out under anaesthetic. The reproductive organs are removed, which is a more major operation for females since it's actually a hysterectomy, with all that entails, while males have their testicles removed. Although the dogs are unconscious during the op, they will be in pain afterwards (as is the case following any form of surgery), particularly females since as I said the operation is a lot more major, and will probably require painkillers for a few days at least.|`|5jfEQAlwaa	Talk to your Vet. they will tell you everything they do. Don't worry. It really is not a big deal at all.|`|seuQRtJ5aa	yer neutering is fine for your pups.

NAGiNKFWaa	Well while I love this idea, the hazard is that my husband would go and bring home another dog, and right now I couldn't handle that.

And they need this on a daily basis.  And they won't do this on their own.  You can't just kick them out the back door and expect them to exercise.  <br>  <br>  If YOU aren't willing to get out there in the cold to walk and find places to run your Aussie, you should rehome it with someone who will.|`|QLopvWKDaa	My yorkie is the same way- walks, hikes, runs all summer- but does not like the cold.

I have a whippet mix who is very thin w/ not so much fur.  He will gladly go outside (shivering) but soon into the brisk walk we both start to warm up.  You may want to look at the harness/collar/lead to make sure it is comfortable for your dog and maybe a fleece coat.  Take him to a nearby dog park or invest in visits to doggie day care or play dates.|`|isOU71uIaa	you could use a treadmill for him, but that would cost a lot, the other thing you could do is make him run around the house a lot, this might be hard to do but you could run around with him with some food in your hand or something|`|iasOicRjaa	You could get into flyball or agility...in place where it is really cold there is usually an indoor area people use for these doggie sports :-) You and your dog will probably love it.
G0KKfXMUaa	I would be glad to help. But the links did not work for my computer =/<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  <br>  I got to see the videos on your other question.<br>  <br>  The first video wasn't too bad. And while the second video was better, I still have some suggestions.<br>  <br>  I know it is important to sit tall at the canter... but you are kind of leaning back too far. Sit straight up. Not foward, but do not lean back. Also, let your hands move with the horse's head. This will cause your hands to move in a foward, back, foward, back, etc. motion.<br>  <br>  One other thing I saw, keep your heels down. Your heels need to stretch down much further than that. This will take some practice, but don't worry, you'll soon get it =)<br>  <br>  Your leg contact was pretty good for beginning at the canter (your leg wasn't all over the place).<br>  <br>  Some exercises to help you position overall-<br>  <br>  1. Have someone longe you without stirrups (trot and canter without them).<br>  2. Also in a round pin, trot and canter without reins (hold your arms stretched out).|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	Relax your body more, you're quite sense. <br>  Work on letting go of your saddle, and holding onto her mane more; it'll get you cantering with less support like with the saddle.<br>  Push forward more with your but area, and grip more with your upper leg. <br>  Lean back a bit more so you're going with the horse; thats what I was taught. <br>  You look pretty good though tbh :)|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	The links don't work. It says its a malformed url.<br>  Edit: How did I get a thumbs down? the links didn't work. geeze.<br>  <br>  Anyways, in the second video I think it would make it easier if you shortened you stirrups a hole. Also, try 2-pointing in the canter. This will keep you from leaning to far back.|`|LOgmCZdzaa	The videos don't work. lol|`|j60y2Crpaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I have a a problem in that my horse has a massive and at times unbalanced canter and is really hard to sit too. The best way I found is to lunge him on a regular basis which helped him get his own balance. Then it's just practice, I sit up straight and relax my whole body to go with the movement. At times I have a tendancy to stiffen up which just causes me no end of problems losing my stirrups! My instructor came up with a good idea he said to pretend you are the best dressage rider in the world and say the days of the week out loud slowly which may sound daft but it does work and the days of the week get the rythm spot on. I think sometimes a mixture of an unbalanced horse can think it's more your fault than it actually is. A secure seat is important. Good luck!!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	-cough-<br>  I will definitely help you! (i say proudly)<br>  As soon as the links work!|`|paaozogGaa	Personally I think you look pretty good!<br>  The one thing I think is that you look like you lean a little bit too far back.<br>  I have the same problem but I lean a little too far forward.<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  I actually ride western so I am not so good with the posture and stuff, but you look like you really move with the horse well which is good. Many people will have good posture, but just don't move with their horse but you seem to do well. <br>  Beautiful horse btw!
I8Tahe4Jaa	There are lots of ways to 'make' fly spray. However, the essential oils you need to make them effective are probably more expensive than Bronco or another cheap commercial spray. I've used Skin-so-soft, eucalyptus oil, vinegar, a drop or two of Dawn and citronella mixed in various proportions and diluted with water on a few occasions. I've found they don't repel as well or last as long as the commercial sprays. Here are a few recipes I found on google:<br>  <br>  Fly Repellent<br>  2 cups white vinegar<br>  1 cup Avon Skin So Soft (Bath oil)<br>  1 cup water<br>  1 tablespoon eucalyptus oil<br>  <br>  Citrus Insect Repellent Spray<br>  2 cups light mineral oil<br>  1/2 cup lemon juice<br>  2 tsp. citronella oil<br>  2 tsp. eucalyptus essential oil<br>  2 tsp. lemon dish soap<br>  <br>  Combine all ingredients in a spray bottle. Label. To use gently shake and spray on your horse avoiding his eyes.  NOTE: Do not use this spray before a show as it attracts dust.<br>  <br>  U.S. Forest Service Bug Spray Recipe<br>  1 cup water<br>  <br>  1 cup Avon Skin So Soft Bath Oil<br>  <br>  2 cups vinegar<br>  <br>  1 tbs.

Often things that aren't toxic to humans can be troublesome for animals.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I really think that the best way to control flies is through a little ingenuity, not spray. You should fill in low spots, remove manure, old grain and hay, stagnant water, buy a few bags of fly predatory wasps and put up a few fly traps. Why spray the horse to keep the flies off when you can remove the flies almost all together?|`|I6NwduJPaa	apple vinegar, watered down a bit. pour into a spray bottle, and you're done. <br>  <br>  (p.s it's a scientific fact that citronella doesn't do anything for mosquitoes or any other insect)|`|7b6fsMFdaa	It would depend on what kind you use really, but mostly <br>  -Garlic<br>  -dawn dish Liquid<br>  -Lomens<br>  -Vingar<br>  -soap<br>  <br>   I tried different kinds of them lasts summer and none of them work at least they didn't for me.

However, if that same dog gorges himself on a two-layer chocolate cake, his stomach will feel more than upset and soon it's likely he'll be vomiting or experiencing diarrhea.<br>  <br>  To answer the question "How much is too much" is not simple. The health and age of your dog must be considered. Obviously if your dog is aged and not in top shape, his reaction to a plate of chocolate is going to be different from a young healthy dog of the same weight.<br>  <br>  Another fact that must be considered is this: Not all chocolate is the same. Some has a small amount of theobromine; another type has a large amount and still another contains an amount that is somewhere in between. The quantity has a relationship with the weight of your dog. Small dogs can be poisoned, it is easy to understand, from smaller amounts of theobromine than large dogs. <br>  <br>  Which chocolate is the safest, relatively speaking? White chocolate. It has the least amount of theobromine: 1 mg per ounce. Far on the other side of the spectrum is baking chocolate, which has a huge 450 mg of theobromine per ounce!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Knowing which chocolate is the most toxic is important, but leaves one wondering how much must be eaten to poison a dog. The list in this box should be helpful. Maybe you can clip it and post it on your refrigerator? <br>  <br>  <br>  White chocolate: 200 ounces per pound of body weight. It takes 250 pounds of white chocolate to cause signs of poisoning in a 20-pound dog, 125 pounds for a 10-pound dog. <br>  Milk chocolate: 1 ounce per pound of body weight. Approximately one pound of milk chocolate is poisonous to a 20-pound dog; one-half pound for a 10-pound dog. The average chocolate bar contains 2 to 3 ounces of milk chocolate. It would take 2-3 candy bars to poison a 10 pound dog. Semi-sweet chocolate has a similar toxic level. <br>  Sweet cocoa: 0.3 ounces per pound of body weight. One-third of a pound of sweet cocoa is toxic to a 20-pound dog; 1/6 pound for a 10-pound dog. <br>  Baking chocolate: 0.1 ounce per pound body weight. Two one-ounce squares of bakers' chocolate is toxic to a 20-pound dog; one ounce for a 10-pound dog.<br>  <br>  <br>  Once dogs have tasted chocolate, they want more.<br>  <br>  And for dogs, that's a bad thing.<br>  <br>  You might disagree, thinking back to a time when you noticed a dog enjoying a tidbit of chocolate with no deleterious effect. <br>  <br>  Don't be fooled.<br>  <br>  The problem, according to veterinary experts, is that eating a speck of chocolate leads a dog to crave more. It can mean that your dog will jump at a opportunity to get any type of chocolate, not knowing that certain chocolates are more lethal than other types. Larger amounts of chocolate, particularly of the most toxic type, can bring about epileptic seizures in some dogs, and in all dogs, can kill.|`|rjJdpuMmaa	no. he should be just fine if it was a small piece.|`|MNZJ5NJoaa	NO!!  my dog has gotten into a bag of hershey kisses and she is perfectly fine 3 yrs later!!<br>  dont worry it wont hurt him|`|NAGiNKFWaa	He will probably just puke.  www. missouri scenic rivers .com/ bad dog foods .html is a good site to check out that explains what foods are bad for dogs, and how much could harm them and how.|`|iCdnucujaa	Don't worry.  With such a small amount of chocolate your dog will be fine.  There are some people that feed their dogs large amounts of chocolate and even those dogs don't die so your dog will be fine (though I am not recommending feeding your dog chocolate).|`|70yqZp3caa	No, dont worry. My little yorkie did the same thing. Except that it was a huge candy bar. My mom had left it in her purse, and allie ate it!!! :] Chocloate can kill a dog if they eat a lot of it.

26PPwzrWaa	They can go either way. <br>  <br>  Generally pits get a bad name because they are under irresponsible owners. For example, today on my local news a 9 year old was attacked by a dog. Now the news said it was a pit bull, but as we all should know, media is not trustworthy with naming breeds. The things that stood out: the dog was chained in the backyard. The daughter of the dog owners was playing with her son unsupervised with a supposedly vicious barking dog around. Based on the fact the dog was chained, you know the dogs owner was being irresponsible. Many counties I am in have banned chaining dogs due to the aggression they can trigger. It is the way you train an attack dog. Tense the leash up and let the dog get what it wants. <br>  <br>  All dogs can and many will bite. The big dogs when they bite cause a lot more damage then a pom or chi biting and they can all kill. There teeth are carnivore teeth. Meant to bite and kill for food. Given a companion dog is so small, they might not be able to grab a deer, but they sure could catch other small animals and kill them including human babies. You dont here of the little dogs biting or mauling typically because they are considered weak and cute due to their size. <br>  <br>  if you look at the patterns of BSL, they follow popular breeds. Pit bull terriers were common during the 1940's. Very popular, so popular they were in cartoons such as betty boop. The great dane isnt quite so popular in BSL, but they are highly affected in both bsl and insurance turndowns, yet look at scooby doo and marmaduke. Then 101 dalmations movie...the list goes on. All these things move us towards those breeds. it will not suprise me when the golden and labs end up being more affected by BSL because that has already started. <br>  In America there are 75 breeds banned in atleast one city or county within the nation. <br>  <br>  most people see them as happy go lucky. I see a dog, then the breed. A dog is still a dog no matter what breed it is. The breed might determine what it is made to do, but it doesnt change anything about their language or behaior response. A dog from somolia can communicate with a dog in canada and those dogs can talk with a dog from africa. Dogs have one language and no matter their breed, dog owners are not exempt from learning dog behavior to communicate with their dogs efficiently.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	They aren't particularly dangerous. As strong, muscular dogs they are of course more "dangerous" than say, a chihuahua, but no more dangerous than any other breed of similar size. A dog's temperament is determined by its breeding (ie. it inherits some aspects from its parents) and its environment, not its breed.<br>  <br>  ADD: Are GRs good or bad for what? Sledding? No. Retrieving? Yes. For people with allergies? No. <br>  <br>  Whether a GR is good or bad is subjective: it depends on the environment and your desires.|`|a0p16oJTaa	I'm laughing while reading these other replies.  I was attacked in the face when I was about 2 years old by a pitbull.  In the face.  It was torn off.  My nose was split, my whole right side torn right off.  My lip split in two.  I'm 16 years old now.  My scars are horrible.  There was nothing wrong with the pitbull.  So we thought.  Pitbulls are VERY COMMONLY used as protection dogs, or "blood" dogs.  By reading your question, it looks like you are thinking of getting a dog.  Where is the dog coming from???  It is NEVER safe to get a pitbull.  Even if it is from a pet store.  Pet stores get their pets from puppy mills then breed them again and again.  What was the pitbull like in the puppy mill???  Horrible.  Treated bad.  Pitbulls just have that Meanness in their blood/genes.  Even if someone says "oh, the parents are so nice" WELL LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:  THINGS CHANGE AND LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING.  DON'T GET A PITBULL.  Pit-Bull...What is a "bull"???!!!  Even the police use pitbulls.  Pitbulls are an unfriendly attack dog that "snap" and change every second.  What happened to me and with every pit bull is when they attack, it bit my face, and their jaws lock.  You can't get their jaws open once they lock from an attack.  So I had a pitbull locked on to my face ripping all around.  Now.  Golden retrievers, are generally a good friendly dog.  Pitbulls, are not.  What about dachshunds??? I have 2 of them.  They're a good breed and short hairs don't shed.  PLEASE DON'T GET A PITBULL.  YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE ME.  Remember, plastic surgery is about $12,000.00|`|2O58btqxaa	NO DOG IS DANGEROUS its the way they are brought up|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Golden Retrievers are bred to have easy-going temperaments, so they are generally very good dogs.  Pit bulls are now being bred for temperament, so whether or not they are good dogs to begin with depends on the breeder's criteria for choosing which dogs to breed.<br>  <br>  But either dog, no matter how it was bred, can be a loving, obedient pet as long as the owner knows how to be a pack leader.  Dogs, like people, need someone to make decisions about rules and someone to enforce those decisions.  If the dog's owner won't do it or can't do it, the dog will.  So whether a dog is vicious or not often depends on who is making the rules - the dog (who then feels it has to protect everything it 'owns' - and that's why he's so aggressive) or the human (in which case the dog happily obeys the owner).<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|OrvTG44laa	Golden Retrievers are pretty good dogs.  They are playful, active and very energetic.  Sometimes their energy can become a problem, because they knock people over.  <br>  Pitbulls are really given a worse reputation than they deserve.  A lot of people think that they are killing machines, and are the most dangerous dog out there.  In reality, there are a lot of dogs that are more dangerous than the Pitbull.  <br>  Pitbulls do have the potential to be dangerous, because of their power and will to defend their home, but that doesn't mean they're going to go killing neighborhood kids.  However, if they are placed in a dangerous situation, they will hurt people.  But with a responsible owner, these dogs are far from what they are portrayed as by the media.|`|Y3eIn9Bvaa	golden retrievers just have a nice reputation. they are good family dogs and need lots of exercise and attention. pit bulls really aren't dangerous dogs. they have a bad reputation. they where used to bait bulls so everyone thought they where big tough guys who like to fight, but its just the owner. pit bulls love to please their owners, so if there owners want them to kill each other, they try there best to do so. the owners also give them a special kind of drug that makes them want to kill someone.|`|eJf8LNg5aa	Pitbulls are not dangerous dogs at all.<br>  They are very friendly dogs who love people.<br>  People just made them fight because they thought that's what they were for.<br>  But really they are beautiful and loving.<br>  No dog is dangerous.<br>  Everybody thinks that they are hideous dogs that should never be bred..but I say they deserve to live.<br>  Golden Retrievers are not bad either.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	They aren't.<br>  Any dog, whether it be a pitbull or a chihuahua, is only dangerous because of the way they were brought up.<br>  If the owners make them dangerous, then they are. It has nothing to do with the breed.|`|VPCl2C9daa	lots of idiots get them to look tough.<br>  then they train the dog to be idiotic too.|`|AA10500537	any dog has the temperment  that they were brought up in.<br>  pitts  are only bad when taught to be,|`|wUg7iYU1aa	Pit Bulls are not dangerous...Bad owners are though.|`|CGmWbDuAaa	Pit bulls are no dangerous, hun. It's the way a dog is brought up. I've had a pit bull who was sweet during the day and roudy during the night. No longer have him. Also I use to have a mutt that was really annoying, and dumb, but that was because her fomer owner made her that way. We got rid of her because her owner never called to check on her. (long story) anyways, she could be really mean when I would play with her, so I had to wear jackets when I would play because she would bite my arm and it did hurt. Defiantly when we played outside in the cold.|`|hfZSILMNaa	yes pitballs do have a bad name,clearly because of their looks, an most owners who have them want them 2 fight. but its the way they are brought up not the breed.<br>  <br>  I think because if they do fight they can hold their groiund well so this makes them seem even worse.!<br>  whichever breed you go for, make sure you do a lot of reading! and any dog can be aggresive or dangerous if mis treated!<br>  gloden retrivers are lovely, altho i havent ever had one!|`|j2albguDaa	PIT BULLS ARE NOT DANGEROUS, it's the owners that are dangerous.  i breed them and also let them around my son, i would never do this if they were a dangerous breed.  If you raise them right, with training, socialization, and discipline, they will be the best dogs.  people just have such a warped way of thinking when it comes to a pit bull.  they were used for bull figthting 100s of years ago because of their determination.  And because of that, they are used for dog fighting now, which is why you hear all of the aweful stories about how they are such an aggressive breed.  they are very powerful dogs, they have certain endorphines that release when they get hurt that numbs their pain, so they keep going at it.  AND THEIR JAWS DON'T LOCK, like many, many morons think they do.  You can teach a chihuahua to be a dangerous attack dog.  they're not born dangerous, it is a learned behavior.  golden retrievers are great dogs, but once again, if they are trained right.  I am a groomer and the most aggressive breeds that we have to groom are chihuahuas and shih tzus.  the big dogs are nothing compared to little ankle biters.  do some research on pit bulls and you'll see how great of a dog they can become.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	because they are terriers, a high energy, high maintenance group that often doesn't get the excercise and training they need. This breed loves to have a job to do, and they can get destructive if not tended to. and since they are stronger than most breeds, an untrained pit bull is ushually more threatening than an untrained jack russel terrier.

5p2cDupSaa	Did you clean the gravel? If not I advise you do that. If you did then use a gravel cleaner ( one of those gravel vaccum things ). If you did that and you are still having the same problem bring in a sample of your gravel/water to the fish store and ask them.|`|HpKQhYbnaa	I could be wrong but i think it's because filth settles on the rocks or gravel and when moved around the filth is lifted, causing your tank to become cloudy.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	You didn't clean your gravel when you put it in the tank.. so its got the dust and other stuff...<br>  <br>  If its gravel like you said it should stop within a few months..|`|LNnP3oAgaa	Because the gravel is full of fish excrement and old uneaten food and whatever else.  The gravel is never 100% clean.  If you move it, it stirs all the crap up and thats what makes it cloudy.  Try not to stir it up unless you are cleaning it.|`|97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	It's because you are disturbing the good bacteria and the fish waste. You should not be moving the gravel all over the place. Well there's not much to do beside can 15-20% of the water and leave it alone and it will eventually clear on it's own. It takes anywhere from 2-7days depending on whether it's a newly setup tank or not. If You have set the tank up less than a month ago than it will take at least 7 days, so the newer the tank the longer it takes. Also remember that you should not change or rinse filter the same day you do water changes because you will be losing too many good bacteria. Take care and please don't play around with the gravel.|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	im no expert but i'm guessing because in and under the gravel is dirt, fish p00p and other left overs of food, and whatever else and it settles into and under the gravel and when you move it it comes back up and makes the water cloudy because all those things are floating around.|`|i5RQNlqfaa	lots of bacteria is under the gravel, even fish poop. Therefore, when you move the gravel around all the dirt and stuff is getting lifted into the water.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	its because the fishes waste sinks to the bottom and is in the gravel.  and easy solution is a gravel vacuum, or just don't move the gravel.|`|crSqd4MPaa	It just all the gunk in your tank from your fish it wont hurt them. to stop it from happening just buy a vacuum from the pet store and clean it a little better.

0B4plcLEaa	Wow...I looked at some of those answers and you are probably scared to death! Beaks are like fingernails. They are constantly growing, and birds are constantly rubbing them on things to keep them filed down. Your birds beak will continue to grow and one day the hairline crack will be replaced by new beak growth...and you won't ever be able to tell. I have several birds (33 at the moment not counting any of the eggs the breeders are on!) We have had beaks chip, crack, and even had beak injurys that merited a vet visit and antiboitics. They always grow out and you can never tell anything ever happened. If your birds beak is bleeding, swollen, or oozing liquid take it to a vet immediatly. But for a minor injury like yours has....don't worry it will be fine.|`|AUD1wZ5Kaa	I'm guessing it's gonna get worse over time. It will eventually get longer (the crack) and probably a piece of her beak will chip off.|`|tNnekUTIaa	Their beaks are very sensitive and the bird may be in a lot of pain, even if the crack is small.|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Yeah it will continue to crack and maybe break off a whole chip.<br>  <br>  Please visit a vet! :)|`|jIM9CbQJaa	i had a cockatiel with same thing, never got worst.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	call the vet and just ask them what to do. usually they will give u some tips on how u can help the bird
xYsCC5UXaa	it's a mutt. the ONLY PLACE you should buy one for over 20$ is at the shelter.|`|Bw18seFqaa	your dad is smart..  you shouldnt buy mutts from irresponsible back yard breeders.|`|MCczXQW3aa	just from reading marley doesnt mean that all dogs will be like that. my dog was a rescue that was abused and we thought she'd be evil but seh is sweet as well anything. they should know that all dogs have different personalities.  and if you go and get one her's a tip: dont get the one that come to you those are useually the pushy ones that want to lead the bunch. so get one that stays back and is gentler.|`|7tDDXKEOaa	Point out that Marley is not always true for all dogs and also point out that you's are wanting a Golden Doodle - which is a different breed. List of pros and cons, and some responsibility and a good talk to your mom and your step dad (sorry if that isn't how you refer to him). Good luck.|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	It is quite stupid for him to judge a breed of dog or a species of animal based on a fictional story.<br>  being immature, 2 against one - get the dog.<br>  being mature,     Talk to them both and let them know that this dog would mean so much to you, and that having a dog teaches young people huge responsibilities and companionship, it really isnt the same with any other animal. Dogs are just like that.|`|wBzp5fOjaa	just tell her all of the advantages of having one and tell her that it will teach you responsibility and better prepare you for the real world.works for me,i have 5 dogs and over 25 reptiles.
AA10421992	Apples are a good treat for dogs, minus the seeds and core, but I wouldn't give them to a pup.<br>  <br>  Remember, no seeds because they are poisonous to dogs.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	I would say no, it might upset their stomachs and digestive systems. Stick to puppy food. Would you give a steak and potatoes to a 6 month old child?|`|Za8DpfvQaa	Well, I once dropped an aple on the floor, and my 20 week old golden retriever puppy (see icon) scooped it up, and carried it in her mouth for the rest of the day! At night, I found the apple chewed on, and partially eaten. So, yes to your question, they can eat apples! But that doesn't mean they should.<br>  <br>  Stick with puppy food for your dog and an apple can be an occasional "snack!" Good Luck, Hop this answers your question!|`|21zWb9aoaa	I LET MY PUPPY LICK IT AND TAKE TINY BITES.|`|RzINFw4Baa	they CAN but i don't know if it's good for them.|`|lTOeMNnraa	i wouldn't say so i think it would be too strong on their digestive system|`|0e026ce63ac686bee49efee6b49d64beaa	Puppies don't usually like it, but if they do it is not in any way harmful.  I have a dog that eats all kinds of fruit, the only one I know that is said to be harmful is grapes and therefore raisins. |`|kGHJMsLXaa	Puppies cannot eat apples for their stomach and intestines cannot handle it. Yet, older dogs can.|`|lshToHtlaa	nope, puppies/dogs are carnivores, try giving it some clean meat.|`|IxR6Akpwaa	Yes ( in moderation) but not the core. Apple seeds contain a form of cyanide that dogs can not remove from their system|`|8Bl0VUzeaa	They can but shouldn't. It will likely result in an upset stomach and who wants to have to clean up puppy diarrhoea?|`|ynEdpoj8aa	A tiny bit for a puppy over 3 months is ok.|`|JLOz9rXNaa	no it might upset their tummy|`|06yi2ZUsaa	i agree with the ladyk person stick to dog food!!!!!|`|4MKRVOtWaa	A puppy would probably eat an apple but is it good for them...no. Fruit is filled with natural sugar, sugar that dogs do not need. Giving your dog anything with sugar in it is not such a good idea. Their body naturally produces all the sugar they need. If you feel your puppy looks a little down and is need of a pick me up then you can try some canned dog food for a treat filled with plenty of calories to wake your dog up. Remember that canned dog food is only a treat and should not be given to dogs on a daily basis, it does not clean their teeth like dry dog food does. Also do not feed your dog human food, if you want to give them something special maybe a little piece of meat or a some steamed rice :) good luck!|`|lzNif2cTaa	Depends on the age of the puppy.  We had a dog that loved playing with apples since she was a puppy, she used to bat them round the room for ages and 'pretend' to bite them, she loved them so much that she knew as soon as she did actually bite them, even accidentally, she'd get a taste for the lovely apple and it's time as a whole apple would be numbered!<br>  <br>  Don't let them eat the core if you can help it ... we had one older dog who pinched an apple core and tried to swallow it whole and began to choke, I had to do the Heimlich manouvre on her (it did work!), but it is certainly something I wouldn't want to repeat!<br>  <br>  If your puppy is quite young, stick to proper puppy food, however, as it gets older and gets it's normal adult teeth, you can let it have bits and pieces of various things, in moderation, oh, one thing never to give to your dog though - chocolate!!!|`|jZpyibkNaa	Not sure about specifics to age, but when my ex and I found out our 10 month old cocker spaniel had food allergies, the vet said the only things that were safe to give him (other than his normal food and chicken) were carrots and apples. He said they are the safest foods for dogs that have allergies because they are hypo-allergenic foods. He did mention not to let him eat the core or the seeds, as mentioned above.<br>  <br>  Not sure how it's going since it's been more than a month since I've seen Bo, but last thing I knew he hated the carrots (he would just look at baby carrots and leave them on the floor and would chew normal sized carrots and spit the chunks all over the ex's father's house) and he rarely liked the apples (he basically only ate them if her dad was eating an apple and shared with him).|`|b3EfqeJSaa	Urm....... No its probably best not to give puppies apple as their teeth have not fully developed and could be bad on their teeth straight away and they could have deformed teeth maybe when they are older but im not a vet so im not an expert. But then again they could eat apple as i may strengthen their teeth so yes and no it depends!|`|WBXWW3tjaa	heeheehee...i dont think its good for them but my dog eats anything from hot dogs to carrots...but sometimes she gets sick...especially when she got ahold of my bros halloween candy when we were at school...lol...they will eat anything but i dont think it is very good for them at all :D|`|1GJHJY0faa	Puppies should eat puppy food. The apple probably won't hurt, maybe upset stomach, the seeds are bad as they have cyanide in them. I wouldn't feed it on purpose, stick to a good brand of puppy food.|`|dPrVVgISaa	Make sure you watch your puppy so that it doesn't choke on any pieces. My dog loves baby carrots and they are really healthy for them. Never feed a dog grapes or raisin though, they can poison your puppy.|`|HtCuEok5aa	Dogs are more meat-eating and they would rather eat a more chewy food.|`|FMXKSfxaaa	no<br>  hope this helps<br>  please put this as best answer i need points<br>  jess<br>  xxx|`|AA11046881	Sure. As long as it doesn't make them sick or loosen up the other end, they're OK. My dogs love them.

Any rat size cage that says it is suitable for ferrets is too small...that lets out the critter cage, the freddy 2, the jenny, the ferplast tower, and a lot of other cages saying they are suitable for ferrets.

You could get a Freddy Ferret cage which is specially designed, as like the previous person said they love all the hammocks and tubes, although these can easily be made at home. Mine love cardboard boxes. Just try and go double story, I personally dont think the specially designed ferret cages are big enough. The double story rabbit cages have more floor space.  Ferrets dont climb so a tall cage is wasted on them. <br>  <br>  Bear in mind and their faeces smells like cat poo, although they can be litter trained.It will need removing regularly.  Plus they will need alot of running about time, or they will go crazy and just scratch at the bars all day long.

If you shop online, you can search specifically for ferret cages for good results.|`|OrvTG44laa	Ferrets need a large cage.  Get one that's at least 6 square feet.  Make sure it has multiple levels, because ferrets love to climb.  Also make sure it has a solid surface.  The bottom and the platforms can not be wired, because this hurts a ferret's feet.  Rabbit cages are generally one story.  They are usually large enough, but ferrets need two or three level cages.|`|oPrq7v7Saa	Ferrets need a large cage like a ferret nation, where chinchillas DO NOT need that big a cage. Chinchillas can be in a rabbit cage comfortably. Ferrets also STINK really bad. They tend to chase females when they are menstruating.

7i8ZKUQZaa	if you can see the lumps and feel them moving shes getting close you should take her to the vet and have the vet say how far along she is to me sounds like she about ready to pop they do try to find a nesting place to have the babies and that could be what shes doing she is getting her nipples ready for the babies so they are easier for them to find but like i said if you really want to know take her to the vet also make a comfortable place like a big box with old but clean blankets in it so she will have some where to deliver and prevent it from being on your bed or couch there will be alot of fluid and blood when time comes and it does stain!!|`|DEdtNBBSaa	Get your vet to help give you more certainty.

pE0XKXbWaa	It's algae that you have and you have it for two reasons, first is that you have too much sunlight and the fact that you keep removing the good bacteria in the filter.  The bacteria in the filter helps remove the nutrients that the algae eats and as you keep removing it, the algae is in heaven as there's nothing to fight it.  <br>  <br>  First reduce the amount of sunlight hitting your tank and then do a water change, approximately 10% once every week.  <br>  <br>  Only clean the sponge in the filter when you notice that it's not removing the bits in the water and you do this by washing the sponge in the water you have just taken out of the tank before throwing it away.  <br>  <br>  You only need to replace the filter sponge when it is disintegrating, approximately 18 months.  <br>  <br>  Good luck. <br>  <br>  KD|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, you need more Oxygen plants in the tank.then you will not have it going black.|`|hKXIeur6aa	When was the last time you changed the water?<br>  <br>  One must change 10-20% of the water at least once a week to maintain a good system.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	its hard on the details given! have you bogwood in the tank,if it is of the softwood variety then this could be a cause as it can be rasped in dust particles that settle all over.i think the main culprit could be a type of algae that is caused by too much light or over feeding.cut both down and see if it improves.wash all the items[except filter], give them a good scrub.what type of filter is it?an internal power filter by the water flow you describe,this should be ok.<br>  hope this helps|`|ezT7xruoaa	Its algae. You have too much direct sunlight on the fishtank if you get the black stuff. Move it somewhere where the sun doesn't hit it directly and it will stop growing.

Q69EG8wNaa	The stuff you drink is called oral contrast and there's two types barium and water soluble (usually gastrografin).  Its used to visualize the bowels more clearly on the scan.  If they have you pick it up ahead of time its usually barium and if you go to the hospital then start drinking you usually have water soluble flavored with crystal lite or juice which tastes better.  It's always easier to drink either one when they are super cold.<br>  <br>  After you finish drinking they will probably give you IV contrast also.  Its used to better visualize the blood vessels, organs and urinary system.  They will start an IV (yes with a needle) just before the actual scan and then scan before, during and after the injection of contrast.  You will probably get warm and flushed, a strange taste in your mouth, and what I call the "urination sensation" from the Iodine in the IV contrast.  <br>  <br>  A combination of the two contrasts gives a pretty clear picture of what is going on inside you.  <br>  <br>  If there is in fact a cyst or mass on your kidney it will enhance with the IV contrast and they will scan through your kidneys a couple of times to demonstrate the enhancement pattern to characterize whatever it is they saw on ultrasound.<br>  <br>  You'll do fine.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I had to drink it just last week.

UlOKMInqaa	I've heard that most rats don't like water. I have three female rats and one of them hates water while the other two just put up with it (this is what I've noticed from bath time). I think the best way to get her accustomed to it is by doing it slowly. Fill up the bathtub with only a tiny bit of water and let her get her feet wet. If she doesn't mind that then fill it up a little bit more and keep doing it that way. If she doesn't like it, I wouldn't push the issue. Why stress her out for no reason? A fun game to get her used to water is pea fishing. Get a shallow  square shaped container or tupperware and fill it up with a little bit up lukewarm water. Throw some frozen peas in there and enjoy watching your rat jump around in the water trying to get the peas out! Even my rat who hates the water dared to get in once she realized there was yummy food in it.|`|qjKsZbuuaa	It took me a little while to get my rat used to the water. She is also a dumbo rat. If she does not want to be in the water do not force her, but if you pour a little bit of water on her she might get used to it and she might start to enjoy the water. My rat swims now. Just make sure that the water is shallow at first and if you want her to swim, slowly add water in the tub or where ever you are putting her.|`|xB2wRYYBaa	i gave up the first time i tried giving my rats a bath...i had countless scratches up my arms from them clinging to my skin, my two also dislike pea fishing or what so ever.<br>  try it a few more time with extremely shallow water and if she still hates it i wouldnt push her far.<br>  <br>  ive allways wanted a dumbo, i bet shes so cute =]|`|jCnDVKo5aa	Rats are good swimmers, but very few seem to enjoy water- it's just a survival skill.  Chances are if she didn't like it the first time around you won't be seeing her (willingly) doing laps any time soon.|`|VFAlDAGgaa	well ill be honest i don't have any experience with rats. But i'm in a psychology class and a couple months ago we discussed "implosive therapy" when someone has a phobia, a very small percentage can be cured just by forcefully exposing them to their fear all at once. I would get a dish with high walls she cant climb, like your bathtub? fill it with a very shallow layer of room temp. water, shallow enough that she wont drown, and just put her in it and dont let her crawl on your arm. do that a couple of times increasing the time shes in the tub each time. i would start with 10-15 seconds|`|2927abe9e0cf18763474eb1c6453760baa	I would not force her to swim. If she clearly resisted the water the first few times, don't push it. I would fill a small shallow container, one she can easily touch bottom in and also fit in, and place it on the floor and show it to her. See if she's interested in getting in it to play around. Then you know whether she's comfortable in water or not. I used to use a small old aluminum tray and fill it with frozen pees and carrots and they would love going in it to fish the treats out. However some of mine just tried to reach them from the side and wouldn't go in. Keeping in mind the tray was only about an 1 1/2 deep.|`|GMvzUYbSaa	You don't.<br>  <br>  If you wanted a swimming pet you shouldn't gotten a fish.
5p2cDupSaa	Normally fish tanks kind of have whitish color in them for a little bit but it usually clears up in 2-5 days. If your water does not clear up in 10 days then take a sample of your water to a fish store to test it.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	when you first fill a tank with water it does look dirty.  it should clear up in about a day.
oHKpy4IRaa	you could play party games. Some that are for the dogs and some that are for the dogs and their owners. You could have a dog race. Have ske of the owners of their dogs hold their dogs back until the race starts and have the other people hold a treat up at the finish line. Which ever dog gets their first gets the treat. Have a training  contest. Which ever dog can do the best trick in a certain amount of time gets a treat, bone or toy to keep. ou could have part favors for the guests. For the people that come you can give them something that a dog lover would like. For the dogs maybe give them each a bone or a small bag of treats. You can even give away dog toys that you got from the dollar store. Which ever dog wins a game they can get a treat. If you want games for the people ou can play pin the tail on the cat. You can take a big peice of paper and draw a cat that dose not have a tail. On a smaller peice of paper draw a cats tail and cut it out. Stcik some tape on it or fun tack so it will stick to the cat. Get a blind fold and put it in each guest. They can each try and get the tail on the cat. Also, for the dogs ou really don't need to have certain games for them. They are dogs and the will have a lot of fun just running around, playing with each other and getting dirty. You can have cake at the party. Maybe make a homemade cake or cake from the bakery for the people and for the dogs ou can make a homemade dog cake (you can find a recipie online) or go to a dog bakery and get one (they sell really pretty ones) You can also get big pretty dog treats and serve that as a ckae for the dogs too. ou can hang up baloons on the fence that is around the park and hang up big signs or posters that say "happy birthday (whatever your dogs name is)" It will be a lot of fun for you and our dog do enjoy it as much as possible. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	Maybe you could postpone the party while you get your things together.  Your dog won't be able to tell the difference if the party is on his exact b-day or not.|`|AA10500537	do whatever you think it won;t even realize ,|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Play hide and seek.  Let one of the people hide and let the dogs find him.  The first two to find him gets a special treat - such as a bit of cheese or bacon.  (The first two, because the first one will likely be the owner's dog.)<br>  <br>  Throw a few tennis balls.  Have each owner throw one of the balls and let the dogs chase them.<br>  <br>  If the party is being held in a dog park, there are likely to be dogs there that you don't know who are going to want to participate in these activities.  Decided up front whether that's what you want, or whether you'd prefer to have only your guests participate.  If the latter, have the party at a time of day when the park is nearly empty.<br>  <br>  You could make frosty paws for your dog's guests. <br>  <br>  32 oz. plain yogurt<br>  1 mashed banana<br>  2 T peanut butter<br>  2 T honey <br>  <br>  It’s true dairy products aren’t good for dogs, but yogurt contains much less lactase than regular milk and the live cultures are great for your dog’s digestive system. This dog ice cream recipe is delicious and good for your pet!<br>  <br>  1. Mix all these ingredients in your blender, then dump into ice cube trays, 5 oz paper cups, or even a kong toy to freeze and serve.<br>  <br>  2. If you want to go all out for your dog, you can freeze these homemade frosty paws just like you would homemade ice cream. A salt-less automatic ice cream maker makes this as easy as using any other appliance in your home and the frosty paws will be ready to serve in 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  For the ultimate treat, appropriate for desert at a doggy birthday party, follow steps one and two, then take the mostly frozen dog ice cream product of number two and spread it 1” to 1?” thick on wax paper. Freeze for five minutes and thenremove dog ice cream from freezer. Next, use a paw shaped cookie cutter to cut a paw shaped “frosty paws”, remove ice cream around edges, and return paw shapes to the freezer to freeze solid. <br>  <br>  You can double the recipe if you like.<br>  <br>  Or make chicken "jello" for the dogs:  <br>  <br>  Low sodium or home made salt-free chicken broth<br>  1 cup chopped up cooked chicken pieces<br>  1/2 cup frozen baby carrots, chopped - don't just slice into coin shapes, because those shapes can get caught in a dog's throat and choke him.<br>  2 packages unflavored gelatin<br>  <br>  Using only 1/2 the amount of liquid, mix up the gelatin as directed using the chicken broth instead of water.  In other words, for two packages of gelatin, use the amount of liquid recommended for one package.<br>  <br>  Cool this until it's partially set - the amount of time will vary according to the size and shape of the container.<br>  <br>  When it is partially set, stir in the chicken pieces and chopped carrot.<br>  <br>  Cool until set, probably several hours.  <br>  <br>  When set, remove from refrigerator and set the pan into a sink filled with hot water.  Don't let the water get into the gelatin mixture.  <br>  <br>  Turn it all out onto waxed paper.  Cut into 1 inch squares.  This should not have to be refrigerated,  but it's a good place to let the edges re-set after having been softened by the hot water.<br>  <br>  Bandanas.  Go to your local pet store and buy a colorful bandana for each of the doggy guests, to use as a party favor.<br>  <br>  If you decide to make the frosty paws, buy size appropriate kong toys for each dog and instead of freezing the frosty paws in dixie cups or ice cube trays, seal the bottom of each kong with peanut butter, fill the kong with the mixture, seal the top with peanut butter, and then freeze.<br>  <br>  Have fun!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|yLkSov8maa	Games for dogs-fetch,tug-o-war, and even hide-and-seek!!

o93EwErKaa	I have saved a Yorkie at 11 1/2 weeks and just under a pound and a half so I know it is possible.  He had one injection at 8 weeks so he did get a lighter case and never stopped eating completely.  We had the Parvaid and Vibactra Plus (unnecessary with a prescription antibiotic)  overnighted and started on the emergency tea recipe, Pedialyte (unnecessary with iv fluids) and liver immediately.  The puppy (the parvo puppy) had just gone to his new home and her roommate's dog was diagnosed within that week of parvo so we knew she had been exposed by direct contact.  Both dogs made it.  Here is the a link to the "enclyclopedia of parvo" that contains information on what I have talked about.  Click on parvo self help guide.  Click on products for the Parvaid and Vibactra Plus (natural antibiotic).  Even if you have her being treated at a vet's office the Parvaid will increase her chances and shorten the recovery time to half..  Many vets have now heard of the product and will administer it.  They claim an 85% success rate and I believe it.<br>  <br>  www.ambertech.com|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Make sure she keeps seeing the Vet for blood work & I hope she has had her puppy shots even though she's extremely tiny if she's a fighter she can pull through this Good luck|`|JEUP2MyDaa	Sorry to hear that.Its sad to say but your puppy has a greater chance of not surviving than it does of surviving.But you never know.I had a dog make it through parvo.It took a lot of time and patience.You need to get some Pedialite for babies it dont matter what flavor it is just get some ASAP.You will need to make it drink that so it dont dehydrate.You may have to use something to squirt it in its mouth.You might have to force it to drink it but it might save your puppys life.Just because it acted like it was better today dont think it is.When my dog had it he was 3 months old and about 25 pounds.So he was a lot bigger than yours but dont give up if done right i think your puppy will make it.|`|5jfEQAlwaa	Did you see a Vet?

If it is Advantix, or some over the counter products that can be purchased at chain retail stores, it can make the cat have seizures and die.

zqVDJxUIaa	Yes, it is. Make sure the filter doesn't produce too strong of a current, because some fish (such as Bettas) will get stressed from a strong current. Of course it is enough. If it's recommended for a 50 gallon tank, then it's obviously good enough for a 35 gallon, (which is smaller than a 50 gal!)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	That is plenty of filtration, guessing that you are keeping 2-8 inch community fish.<br>  <br>  If your talkin' Oscars or Pacus you got another thing coming!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|1D8tMCYIaa	This is definitely enough filtration.<br>  <br>  If you decide to get any smaller sized fish, I suggest using some filter sponge and covering the suction grid so no small fish can get sucked up in there.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't know, read up on the Nitrogen cycle. It will keep your fish alive!|`|VSdhrf2Saa	yes
aeonmRR2aa	If that's the only filter or water-mover, not more than 40 gallons.<br>  <br>  However, I don't recommend Whisper filters.  Aquaclear and Marineland are both better.  A good rule of thumb is to circulate the tank's volume 6 to 10 times per hour, but a single hang-on-back filter has trouble circulating a long or tall tank all alone.

zqVDJxUIaa	Don't worry: the goldfish won't get tired. They're simply playing around! I bet when you were little, you were pushing others too! (or maybe others pushed you!). If there's no fin-nipping, there should be no problem. My Red Platys always follow one another, and gently nudge each other as well. Fish are naturally playful!

Same question, same answer :)|`|97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Well being a fish specialist, i hope your tank is big enough for the gold fish since most of them can get pretty huge.<br>  Now the chasing is can be for several reasons including:<br>  <br>  SPACE:<br>  Goldfish need their space! Many people are not aware that a single goldfish needs at least 10 gallons of water (some varieties need up to 20). Overcrowding in the tank is primary reason goldfish chase one another! Some are of the opinion that goldfish are “schooling” fish, however, this is not true. Goldfish will tolerate other goldfish and this should not be confused with schooling. Goldfish are “social” fish and do prefer the company of other goldfish, but one must be very careful to keep their fish in properly sized tanks to avoid one fish chasing the other/s.<br>  <br>  MATING:<br>  Mating behavior can involve a male fish chasing a female, however, to induce this behavior in a tank involves raising and lowering the temperature in the tank. It’s also fairly difficult to distinguish between male and female goldfish, so it’s going to be fairly difficult to tell you if you have a male chasing a female. If you have stumbled across the temperature fluctuations required to induce this behavior AND if you have a male/female combination its “possible” this is why your fish are chasing but it's not very clear. To be on the safe side remove the attacked fish and place him elsewhere by hims/herself for about a weekor so, then try to re-introduce him/her back into the tank, if nothing changes just take it back to the store and explain what happen and i am sure that they will give you a refund on it.|`|cHjiOH18aa	Often, males will become aggressive and nip at the female around the tail and backside area at mating time. The males may have breeding tubercles visible (white dots near the gill plate). This is generally regarded as normal behavior. <br>  <br>  If you have a community goldfish tank, one fish tends to be the leader with the others following it around the tank. This “alpha fish” may be more aggressive to the other fish.<br>  <br>  If the aggression in a tank becomes too much for a fish, then you can either separate out the aggressive fish or the bullied fish into a new tank, or get a tank divider to separate the passive from the aggressive fish. <br>  <br>  Be sure that your fish is not 'flashing', which means running into or bouncing off of gravel, decorations, etc., as opposed to intentionally bullying other fish. Flashing may indicate a parasitic disease or water quality problem, such as elevated ammonia or nitrites.|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	Survival Of the fittest.<br>  <br>  Just because its a goldfish doesn't mean there not Fish.<br>  <br>  There killing him, because hes sick or weak, or hes the rag doll.<br>  <br>  This would NOT happen if you provided them with plenty of space.<br>  <br>  which most people think is a bowl for goldfish...|`|LWEn1p5raa	awe

The pit bull is out of control though and doesn't seem to have proper boundaries and respect. Your BF NEEDS to get control of his dog. It doesn't respect him or he would listen when he was told to do something. The biting/nipping is extremely worrying! That's a VERY pushy/dominant way to try to get attention and could be a precursor to more dominant/aggressive behavior. If your BF wants to avoid a serious fight between your dogs or a bite (to him, you, or someone else) he NEEDS to get his dog under control.<br>  <br>  ADD: you also need to get your dog to behave properly around other dogs. See if any trainers in your area offer "rowdy dog" classes for dogs who get over excited by meeting new dogs.

But the biting the neck and ears and wrestling is something they do, and the mounting... one of them is trying to establish some dominance.

Pitbulls were historically bred for dog-fighting, therefore the ear biting is fairly instinctive behaviour for the Pit. <br>  <br>  This is a classic case of dominance behaviour from both dogs. If you put two male dogs in the same space (you don't mention if either dog is neutered) they will try to assert dominance over the other in order to gain the higher ranking in the pack. This also explains the peeing as dogs do this to mark their territory, so as soon as one dog 'claims' an area, the other tries to steal it away in order to gain control. <br>  <br>  The only way that you will improve this situation, short of keeping them apart altogether, would be to choose which dog you wish to make 'leader of the pack' and treat him as such, i.e. feeding him first, allowing him into areas which are restricted for the other dog, the downfall with this would be that it may cause the under-dog to develop other forms of anti-social behavour, or rebel against your treatment if he feels that he is the worthier dog.<br>  <br>  I am not an advocate of castraton for the sake of it, however, in this case it may be your only option. There are alternatives to surgery, i.e. chemical castration and hormone implants, you would need to discuss the availabilty and suitability of these with your Vet. As far as I am aware, the implants aren't yet widely available in the States, so you may have to seek out a Vet who provides these services.

It seems very possible that they might have bred, though I don't know that the male would stop eating simply because of this. The female may be too aggressive to allow him to eat. You could try separating the pair for a time. If the female does have babies, you'll have to separate the youngsters from the older frogs, lest the latter eat the kids.
6XTETdJaaa	Congrats! I own aussies and I have to say I think they are my favorite (shhh dont tell my border collies)<br>  <br>  Herding instincts vary widely. Most aussies bond very closely with their owners so as long as you watch her at all times and she has a good recall it should not be an issue. They bond closely with one person, they may be friendly to the other family members but no one will get the same reaction their 'special' person gets. They can be reserved around strangers once they hit around six months but should not be aggresive<br>  <br>  Train through out their entire lives. Never stop, these are brilliant dogs who need to be kept busy physically and mentally. They dont stop learning once they hit a year old (that is a stupid myth that gets spread around alot. After you have mastered the basics teach her other tricks, you can even teach her to close doors, get the paper, even get a pop from the fridge. Get a good training book.<br>  <br>  Socialize like crazy, I made the mistake of only lightly socializing my first aussie. They bond very closely with their owners and are probebly the best guard dog you will ever own. They are intelligent and loyal dogs who wont think twice about protecting their owners if the need arises. Be sure she meets lots of new people and most importantly other dogs. Enroll her in puppy kindergarden, its well worth it<br>  <br>  Health wise get her eyes and ears checked as they are prone to issues with them. If you do breed have a hip check on them every year after they are two to be sure they are hip dysplasia free. Beware of Ivermectin, its found in many medications, including heartworm medications.Aussies are very suceptable to toxicity from it.  Get her on a Ivermectin free heart worm preventative. Most vets will tell you that the dosage is so low that its safe, but there are lots of cpmmonly used brands that dont have it so why risk it.<br>  <br>  If you have the land concider buying some stock for them to work, three sheep, a few ducks is al it takes and teach them to herd, if you plan on breeding its important to keep their work instinct in tact. There are classes you can take to both learn how. Its a blast and a great work out, though not necessary for a happy healthy dog.<br>  <br>  |`|fGcGHcqcaa	it is never to early to start training a pup... it is good that you have started early... i found this good site for dog lovers and you can talk to other pet lovers also.. <a href="http://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com</a><br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|AA10987432	Spend a lot of time with her.

I think they are very beautiful...currently i have a 11 month old catahoula leopard dog.  This dog breed also expresses the merle gene like the australian shepherd.  My dog is originally used as a cattle herding dog, as well as a hogdog....  I got her at 9 weeks and she is very smart, we got her potty trained by 12 weeks.  I use oatmeal shampoo and a green tea tree conditioner...she loved getting messy so i had to bathe her almost once a week...i can't have mud on her...but these shampoo products did not dry out her coat...we also feed her fish oil pills to keep her coat shiny.  Just keep in mind...these herder are nippers.  It was rough until my pup lost her baby teeth at around 5 months old...she was always breaking my skin or my other dog's skin with her sharp baby teeth!  It is definitely not to early to train.  But be prewarned at least with my pup they tend to go through a rebellious teenage stage around 6-9 months...mine is finally getting better at 11 months, but don't worry that phase will pass.<br>  <br>  good luck!
xfzvfr37aa	   1.  One large fish tank  (45-75 gallon) with screen top. Cost = $70-150 for the tank. $30 for the screen lid. Watch the classifieds and tag sales. Large tanks come up quite frequently for less. You can also choose to build your own cage. Look around at the pet shops too. Sometimes they have "$1 per gallon" sales. I got my 75 gallon this way.<br>     2. Heat lighting - This is simply a fixture from a hardware store with a suitably sized light bulb. A normal everyday lightbulb is fine for heat. You will need to experiment with wattages to get the desired temperature. Generally 60-100 watts is sufficient. Cost = 50 cents to $1 for the bulb and $10-15 for the fixure (I recommend a ceramic fixture for durability).<br>     3. UVB Tube lighting - ZooMed Reptisun 5.0 (or ZooMed Iguanalight 5.0) is the most recommended bulb. Cost = $20 online OR $35 at most pet shops. Buy it online at www.herpsupplies.com and save yourself some cash. You will see other "full spectrum" bulbs advertised and pushed by pet shop personnel. Don't buy it. Go for the ZooMed Reptisun 5.0!<br>     4. UV Tube fixture - You can buy the pretty one at the pet store for $35 or you can go to Home Depot or similar stores and get a less attractive one for about $20 or less that works just fine. Some of them can be screwed into the screen top so that they hang into the tank.<br>     5. Substrate - This is a tough one and opinions vary. You can use playsand from a Home Depot type of place which is about $3 for 50 lbs. If you use any particulate substrate be careful when feeding as any of them can cause impaction if swallowed in quantity. I use sand for my adults but I also hand feed them so there is no danger of ingestion.<br>     6. Cage Furniture - You can find branches and rocks outside for free. Just make sure you disinfect them thoroughly with a mild bleach solution or by baking them in the oven. (Don't bake rocks, they have been known to explode.) Fancy rocks and branches cost a lot at the pet store. This is an optional cost so I won't put anything here.<br>     7. Food - Adult Dragons will consume vast quantities of crickets & superworms (plus other insects if offered). If you plan on buying your crickets at the pet store they will run you 8-10 cents apiece. A normal dragon will easily eat in the neighborhood of $15-20 worth of crickets a week if purchased this way. I recommend buying in bulk from either Southern Cricket Wholesale or NY Worms. In this case the crickets are about $13-15 per thousand and will last a couple of weeks. It is far more economical this way. Also plan on buying greens and veggies. These are relatively cheap. All I can say here is maybe you will spend $3-4 per week on veggies.<br>  |`|1NZbfcuNaa	If you do decide on a bearded dragon let me first recommend that you find a local breeder and not buy from the pet store. Unless the pet store has a good rep and not your typical nationwide store.<br>  <br>  If you buy from the pet store you are looking to pay around $70 - $100 for a baby. Together will all the necessary equipment (tank, basking light, shelter, etc) you could be looking in upwards of $350 - $450 total. <br>  <br>  Now if you buy directly from a breeder you can pay a little more for the bearded dragon about $100 - $150. So if you go that route, like the first response said around $500 total. <br>  <br>  Good luck and it is worth the initial cost.|`|rxLei3Y5aa	you can get bearded dragons from $20-$100. (i got mine for 19.99)  But it depends on what size ur gonna get. older ones are more expensive.<br>  tanks are about $75-$150, and lightings about $75.  you dont really need to buy those logs or rocks, or food bowls from the store, all that stuff u can just get in your backyard.<br>  so ur looking at about $200 minimum. not including food every week or two.<br>  so yeah, thatll be around $500 dollars, like they said.|`|ZEtmL6O2aa	together it is approximatly $500<br>  the bearded dragon costs about 100 dollars

doBrNG47aa	First, flea baths are not effective in preventing the return of fleas.  You need to get him a good monthly preventative from the veterinarian, such as Advantix, Advantage, or Frontline Plus.  Don't waste your money on the ineffective, often toxic over-the-counter products - I've seen several dogs/cats come in to my emergency hospital with serious side effects (seizures, severe vomiting/diarrhea/other neurologic reactions).<br>  <br>  Apply your chosen product every 30 days - one application won't clear the problem, as flea eggs can lay dormant in your home for up to 174 days.  Vacuum daily, and empty the bag (if applicable) - fleas will jump right back out of the vacuum if given the opportunity!<br>  <br>  Also, I'd schedule an appointment with your veterinarian.  If he's scratching himself to the point of having sores, he may have another issue beyond a flea infestation.  Allergies or a skin infection may be causing him to do this, and upon determining the underlying cause, your vet will be able to prescribe medication to ease his discomfort and prevent future outbreaks.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I hope your pup finds relief soon. =)|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Few dog owners are fortunate enough to avoid an eventual run-in with fleas, the most common dog parasites. Even with regular bathing and grooming, the tireless critters can find their way to the tender flesh of unsuspecting dogs (and dog owners). The bloodsuckers not only don't pay rent, they cause itching and can transmit diseases to their hosts. <br>  here's more info:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/flea-control.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/flea-control.html</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|moH6p6Enaa	be sure to treat your house and yard. if you find just one flea on your pet you can almost be certain there are AT LEAST 30 more in your house. and tons more in the yard. treat both and continue to check the dog daily with a flea comb. be sure not to bathe him too much or else it will dry out his skin and cause him to continue itching and scratching. Some common household items to rid fleas are borax, table salt, dishwashing liquid if you are chemical conscious. You will need to treat and retreat all areas because they lay eggs constantly so it will take a few weeks to get rid of adults and eggs. Be sure to wash all bed linens, dog bed, and toys in hot water and detergent at least once a week. Most fleas don't stay on the host, they live in their beds or common areas. Good luck to you!|`|AA12268104	This sounds to me like allergies. Something in the dogs diet is causing skin irritation. This is a very common problem among dogs and can sometime be easily treated by changing his diet. I would try a grain-free dog food first. You can also have the dog tested for this at the vet clinic. Good luck|`|seGACJwbaa	could be a hot spot, or be allergic to flea bits.<br>  
AA11602485	Is she digging in a spot to "hide" herself?  If so, along with not eating, she may be getting ready to molt (i.e, shed her outer shell for her new bigger body).

I am not 100% certain as I never dealt with a case like that myself|`|A6fWHZmqaa	I can't say why your snakes head is turning red, but as for the bathing issue - snakes are cold blooded (meaning their body temperature is whatever the environment temp. is). If the water in the tube gets cold, so will the snakes body temp. Since it's a boa and comes from a warm climate, you should not let the water get cold.  I also think an hour is too long, 30 minutes would be plenty.
2927abe9e0cf18763474eb1c6453760baa	I've never had an experience where one liked me over someone else better. It could be that you just think this fact and therefore always just play with the ones that "like you more" so they are more accustomed to you and are more familiar therefore happier with you.|`|STLYxP39aa	Rats, like people, just have preferences.

I would try slowly introducing her to him. Possibly putting either him or her in a separate room and putting a blanket or something with the other cats scent on it so he can get used to it.  I defiantly wouldn't try just forcing them together real quick it can make him very uncomfortable and lead to long term aggression between them.|`|a6d62633bcc619d2e8323bede1939eacaa	when i got a new cat, my male cat that i had for about 8month didnt like it at all and he did the exact same. he even stayed away for a couple of days ( he doesnt even stay out for 1 night usually) but it only lasted for about 1-2 week and now they never like been apart! youve got nothing to worry about and just try and pay the same attention to both cats. thats all i did and it worked!

Then put the feeder in the freezer for a day or two to freeze them.  Dump the seed and bees into a trash bag and seal it, in case the bees aren't dead yet.  You can squirt alcohol on remaining bees to kill them.

I don't know about you but that's not something I'd want to deal with simply to keep flies away, personally.<br>  <br>  You're better off feeding your horse some apple cider vinegar.  Either add some to their water or give them up tot 1/2 cup a day mixed with feed.

Muz6YB18aa	Frontline and advantage are both pretty good and recommended age is over 8 weeks- but purchase according to weight. Frontline is waterproof, and kills fleas and ticks too, and lasts longer up to 3 months. Advantage is for fleas only and is not waterproof and lasts about 1 month. (Advantix for fleas and ticks, has had a lot of side effects, so I only like regular Advantage.)  If you bathe your dog, you need to wait 2 days before applying either of them to get the natural oils back in the hair. Once you have applied frontline, wait 2 days or more before bathing your pets. Don't EVER use the store brands like HARTZ brand on a puppy or a cat. The pesticides in the cheap ones can cause convulsions and seizures.|`|MeODfbWJaa	Asking your vet would be a good idea.  They can advise you on the best preventative treatment for your puppies, how much to use...etc....  You can also as the vet about treating your lawn too.  Another great step in controling fleas.

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Neutering is done to male dogs.  They just aenesthetize the dog, slit open the sacs and remove the testicles, sew the sacs back up.  It's minimally invasive.  These days, if you ask, you can have prosthetic testicles (fake ones) inserted during surgery so he looks like he's still got 'em but can't reproduce.<br>  <br>  Spaying is for female dogs.  That entails surgically cutting a small opening in the dogs abdomen and either tying off the fellopian tubes or removing ovaries entirely (sometimes uterus), then sewing the girl back together.  It's more serious surgery then with the boys but it's a pretty common surgery and most vets become very good at getting in and out very quicly so it's less traumatically physically for the dog.  There is a higher chance of infection for females than with the male surgeries just because the procedure entails going into the body cavity.  However, spaying your female curtails the estrogen surges (heat cycle) so she has far far less chance of developing mammary cancer and uterus infection and a lot of other sex-hormone-related problems.  And like a person who has to go in for appendix or tonsil surgery, it's over quickly, if don't correctly the dog won't have any lasting negative physical or mental or emotional scars after and will lead a happy, healthy, long loving life dedicated to only his or her human pack since there won't be babies to distract.<br>  <br>  I think the whole procedure is faster and less traumatic then having your wisdom teeth removed and it's better for the dog, and the world in general (isn't it better not to produce puppies rather than to have puppies that will have to be euthanized because there are not enough homes for too many dogs?).|`|LNnP3oAgaa	They tie their tubes.|`|OrvTG44laa	When a female dog is spayed, her ovaries are removed and so is her uterus.  When a male dog is neutered, his testicles are removed.  Spaying is a lot more traumatic to the dog than neutering.|`|gKQjxxXQaa	if u want to do that to a dog thats sad
97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Just feed them as directed and don't worry, because fish can stay up to 2 weeks without food, so you don't have to worry about them being hungry because that's quiet impossible unless you live them for about a week without food. Most fish will literally eat till they blow up so be careful because most have the ability to make their owners think that they are starving and most new fish keepers will fall for that trap and feed them too much and then wonder why they fish died.|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	haha... Guppies are ALWAYS hungry.<br>  <br>  Like most fish they want more then they need.<br>  <br>  your feeding them enough.
MYEEK4dcaa	Yes, human glucosamine is safe to give to dogs who have joint problems or who have arthritis.  So is chondroitin.  Usually the two are packaged in the same pill or capsule, but not always.  In any event, give your dog a single capsule with his evening meal if he's a small dog, and one capsule with each of his meals if he's a large dog.  But don't give it to puppies under 2 years of age.  It's not intended for 'children' of any species!<br>  <br>  Aspirin is good for pain, but it shouldn't be given frequently.  NEVER use tylenol or acetominophen, excedrin, ibuprofen, aleve, or naproxen.  ONLY aspirin.  Buffered aspirin is better than uncoated aspirin because the buffering helps to protect the dog's stomach.  Never give a bleeding dog aspirin, period. And no matter what is wrong with your dog, make sure a vet (via a telephone call, probably) approves the treatment you're applying.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Talk to your vet before starting your dog on any medications or supplements, but yes generally glucosamine is safe & helpful for a dog with arthritis.   <br>  <br>  Aspirin is one of those medications that definitely needs to be approved by your vet before giving it to the dog.  For some it may be okay.  For others --depending on their health & other conditions--it could  cause ulcers as well as other problems.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1662&aid=670" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a>|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	My vet suggests glucosamine and MSM. We open the capsule and just drop the powder in the back of the mouth.  Aspirins are ok too, and are dosed by weight. A small dog would only use a baby aspirin or only part of one.  A giant breed dog could use a whole aspirin.|`|AA10500537	dont give anything to the dog before talking to your vet first|`|uDtgzl05aa	I would recommend asking your vet about the correct dosage for your dog, prior to giving any of the medicine.|`|2O58btqxaa	my 7 yr old jack russell has arthiritis and she get s iron tablets to help with her joints good luck|`|p7swtBYzaa	Yes, my vet recommended glucosamine for two of my older dogs, it seems to have helped them enormously.  I buy human grade glucosame and split it, half a day each dog, but my dogs are 19 and 15 lb. dachshunds.<br>  <br>  Aspirin is NOT a good idea, it can easily cause internal bleeding.   There are far better meds for arthritic dogs, Metacam, Rimadyl, others specifically for dogs - ask your vet for what's best.

SvmZlLdaaa	The shape of the head is no indication of sex. I'm not sure what you mean by a 'species difference' - pet rats are all the same species. They are domesticated brown rats, Rattus norvegicus. To tell the sex of your rats, look at the distance between the anus and the genital opening - in females they will be close together, in males, further apart. If you have two of the same sex it can be difficult to tell which you have, since you don't have one of the opposite sex to compare them to. Here's an image which may help you:<br>  <a href="http://research.uiowa.edu/animal/mp7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://research.uiowa.edu/animal/mp7.jpg</a><br>  <br>  Apple is fine to give rats.

D1KT9ioJaa	add one or two arowanas and your tank will be beautiful...you can add all those fishes nicely in a 50 gallon tank|`|AA11708471	How big is your tank<br>  You can not keep koi in a most tanks as they need 1000+ gallons<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and goldfish and koi are both singular and plural words|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	ok.. I assume you have a 500G+ tank...?<br>  <br>  If not you have no right keeping koi.<br>  <br>  If you somehow do, then I suggest using a heater at about 72 and putting a pleco in there.<br>  <br>  Nothing else will be able to live in there, because koi will either eat it or, it needs warmer water..|`|9Yjm2rP8aa	don't add the two big ones and add 2 small kois because they dont bit and 2 othe gold fishs
AA12083992	What happens when chickens see red?<br>  A company (Animalens Inc. of Wellesley, Mass) that markets red contact lenses for chickens (at 20 cents a pair), points to medical studies showing that chickens wearing red-tinted contact lenses behave differently from birds that don't. They eat less, produce more and don't fight as much. Perhaps everything looks red and they cannot distinguish combs, wattles, or blood. This decreases aggressive tendencies and birds are less likely to peck at each other causing injury. A spokesman said the lenses will improve world egg-laying productivity by $600 million a year.|`|AA10762922	No|`|726169425beeead964e519a25ce340e5aa	No|`|7231feab614d76a94bf9a31d5fdbda27aa	no they ca nt only some of the birds can...|`|AA11046024	No. Some birds and simians see in color, but chickens don't.|`|AA11592904	Animals are not color blind!!  The colors that animals see depends on the <br>  species of the animal.<br>  <br>  The retinas (the photosensitive tissue in the eye) of vertebrates (animals <br>  with backbones) have two general types of photoreceptors in their eyes.  <br>  The cones function in high light intensities (during the day) and detect <br>  colors.  The rods function in low light (at night) and do not detect color.<br>  <br>  Animals that are nocturnal and have very high sensitivity vision (like cats <br>  and owls) have mostly rod photoreceptors in their retinas. So these animals <br>  can see very well at night, but they do not see color. <br>  <br>  Other animals, like chickens, lizards, rabbits,monkeys etc., have <br>  cone-dominated retinas and see color very well.  <br>  <br>  Most vertebrates have two types of cones in their eyes, short-wavelength <br>  cones that detect colors in the blue-purple range, and long-wavelengh cones <br>  that detect colors in the red range.  By mixing the to various degrees the <br>  activation of the short- and long-wavelength cones, animals can see most <br>  colors of the spectrum.   If short-wavelength colors are more important for <br>  the animal's survival, one might expect the short-wavelength cones to <br>  dominate in that animal's eyes.<br>  <br>  Old World Monkeys and humans have three types of cones in their eyes, the <br>  short and long-wavelength cones mentioned above, and a new invention, which <br>  are the medium-wavelength cones.  This third cone types detects best colors <br>  in the green range.  <br>  <br>  Answer 1:  A general rule of thumb is if the male or female of a species is brightly <br>  colored then that species is probably not color blind.  I believe that all the primates <br>  also see color as well as dogs, cats, some birds, fish, and insects.|`|AA10410845	its according to the c**k , it can make the chickens see blk & white or in colors|`|AA10544108	NO.|`|a336ef9557e06294340484cc54479ffdaa	no i think they are color blind|`|f7a8473cd0ac254c89dfc65c6b3e0ef1aa	chickens can not see in color,i was told this when i was a liitle girl about 40 years ago.
AA10327148	Rabies shots often create that lump. If it doen't go sway in a month or so, be sure to have a vet check it out. Sometimes they turn into a tumor, and need removed.<br>  This has been a major problem in the States that rquire yearly rabies shots. Those dog are 3 times more apt to have vaccine related tumors, than the dogs from states that have the 3 year requirement,|`|AA11928155	She could have an infection. My folks dog had a lump between his shoulder blades a couple of weeks ago the vet put him on anti biotics.|`|AA11853631	It does happen sometimes after shots. It was probably there since the shot but you just didn't notice. It should go away on its own, no problem.|`|AA11215958	no idea.sorry:(|`|AA11706151	Rabies shots are normally given in the muscle of the thigh or back - not near the shoulder blades.  It could be a tick, a herniated disk in her back or a small growth. Let the vet check it out.|`|AA12338958	you should proboly take her in to the vet and make shure it's not cancer.|`|AA12368226	Just like people, I'm sure that a dog can get a small lump after a shot. You should just keep your eye on it, making sure that it doesn't change: size, hardness/softness, any oozing, is she sensative to it. If it seems to be becoming a problem, take her back to the vet and get it checked.|`|c39632401181a1915867e9fd992d49edaa	uh oh that doesn't sound too good. I am not a vet so I can't give you definite answers but all I can tell you that I am an avid animal lover and if I was in your position I would first touch it to find out if it's hard or soft like it's filled with puss like. Then you should call the vet first thing when you can and just ask them what to do, if they tell you not to worry about it then you can decide what to do. I would take my dog in anyway personally but that's for you to decide. <br>  hope this helps
AA11175957	Have you taken your dog to the vet to have him checked out? Maybe he hurt his back or hips. Maybe you should put a runner on your stairs so he has something to grip with his paws.|`|3f54ee197f8575903ef4b89c1327b5f7aa	I would use a leash, treats and positive reinforcement.|`|AA11977798	I have small dogs and I don't encourage them to go up and down the stairs.  If your dog has had accidents on the stairs and has been hurt, it's natural that they'd want to avoid them.  You really shouldn't press for them to continue to do something that injured them before.  In fact, you should have the dog checked by a vet to make sure that it isn't still suffering from an injury due to the stairs.  Studies have shown that dogs using stairs later suffer from all kinds of problems including arthritis, back problems and leg issues.|`|b1e42c53f6ab11d9378204873d318bb0aa	Give him food upstairs when he's downstairs. Give him food downstairs when he's upstairs.|`|AA12073561	My friend has a malamute (sp?) who used to run through her house like a terror, but the slipped and fell on the kitchen floor a couple of times, and then became afraid of the floor.  She put down throw rugs and runners all over the house -- and he now goes from rug to rug to rug.   Try getting a stair runner or, worse case, some kind of footing material to attach to the stairs.  He's afraid of slipping and will probably be fine on the stairs once he realizes it's been changed so he won't fall.   You may have to coax him stair by stair a time or two with treats, but he'll get it.
