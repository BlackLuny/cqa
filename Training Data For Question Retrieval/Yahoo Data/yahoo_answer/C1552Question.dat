When the guy in front must've read my expression said "Hey man, what's up", then starting talking about how good the club was. After a couple of seconds, after I had relaxed (a little), he went on to give me some history of the original Skinhead movement. He also says he HATES Neo-Nazi skinheads & the reputation they have gave their movement. I don't know if he "really" hates Neo-Nazis, who would still be his "brothers" in the movement, but he did school me on something I didn't know about.

20081019101432AAn1RKn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why is it that Hispanics (particularly Mexicans) seem to think this?	So why is it that Hispanic seem to think that long hair is a sign of beauty for a girl? Like when my mom was a young girl and a teen she  had her hair almost to her waist, and my aunt did too.  Although when she was a teen she cut it but she still kept it long.  And then when my twin sister and I were little girls, we likewise had our hair to our waist.  Eventually I finally cut it to my shoulders, which upset my mom very much.  Now I like it long and I am keeping it long (although not ridiculously long, just almost to the middle of my back) and my mom is very happy about this.  And then I am friends with this one girl who is Argentinian and her hair is super long too, and when I asked her why she didn't cut it if she wanted to, she replied by saying that her dad says that he wants his daughters to have beautiful long hair. So why do hispanics consider this to be like a sign of beauty for their daughters? And in addition, I have found for this to particularly be true for girls who don't have really curly hair. Why is this?

20080302110150AARbHc0	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	Pourquoi ne cultivons-nous pas davantage le savoir et l'expérience des personnes agées ?	Dans de nombreux pays, comme dans la culture touarègue, les personnes agées sont particulièrement bien respectées. Elles sont accompagnées, en fin de vie, par des enfants qui ne demandent qu'une chose : apprendre, entendre les récits de ce qu'ils n'ont pas encore vécu et cultiver leur soif de vivre.      En France, comme dans de nombreux pays occidentaux, on entasse les personnes agées dans des maisons de retraite. C'est comme si on perdait de la valeur avec l'age : les jeunes sont source d'espoir et les vieux sont parfois traités comme des fardeaux.      Ma question est : pourquoi un tel paradoxe ?

20080825214155AAgOXDz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?Quiseras que me dieras tu opinion acerca de una respuesta que me dio una persona no creyente?	Esto es lo que escribio:      Las únicas gran incógnitas en las cuales la religión aún se refugia son: Qué había antes del Big-Bang y qué lo provocó. Qué hay fuera de nuestro universo. En ambos casos, la respuesta religiosa es, obviamente, Dios.      Así pues, vemos que efectivamente la Ciencia por fin, después de tantos milenios de existencia humana, ha anulado completamente a la Religión. Las personas que creen aún en Dios son aquellas que necesitan la seguridad moral que un ser superior proporciona, o aquellas que no poseen los suficientes conocimientos científicos (que no por ello dejan de ser básicos y al alcance de todos).      TE PIDO QUE LEAS ESTO, PORQUE ESTO ES LO QUE QUIERO QUE OPINES:      Tambien escribio esto:      Además, la ciencia no nos deja ni siquiera un ápice de incertidumbre en el que refugiarnos. Todo se puede reducir a leyes matemáticas, todo se puede controlar. No hay nada extra?o. Incluso detrás de fenómenos aparentemente caóticos se esconde siempre el orden. Sabemos que el Universo es finito en espacio y en tiempo. Conocemos todos los misterios de la vida, y no encontramos nada "raro" en nuestro interior... todo es química: el amor, los sentimientos, la razón, el movimiento, los pensamientos... todo se puede reducir a combinaciones y reacciones entre átomos. ?Dónde está lo extra?o? Sabemos de dónde venimos, y a dónde vamos. Conocemos la historia natural de nuestro planeta, y de sus especies (incluida la nuestra). Cada vez nos adentramos más en la física de lo muy peque?o (física cuántica) y seguimos sin encontrar nada que la ciencia no pueda analizar. ?Dónde se encuentra, pues, nuestro Dios? Ha muerto bajo el pu?al de la Ciencia

Two LDS missionaries walked up to me trying to give me a Book of Mormon, I told them that I only read the Holy Bible King James Version, they then said: "The Bible has too many errors and contradictions. God has restored truth through a living Prophet. Can you guess who his name is?" I replied: "Joseph Smith." The missionaries responded: "Yes, and today we have a living Prophet named Thomas S. Monson. Have you ever read the Book of Mormon before and prayed about it?" I said: "Yes, I have and found that it contradicts the Bible too many times". The missionaries said: "Where?" so I showed them where, but they disagreed and later added: "Did you know that the Bible has too many contradictions?" I said: "Where? I see no contradictions. Show me at least 3 contradictions and I will believe you." Unfortunetately these professers and teachers of the law called Mormons couldn't show me more than 2 contradictions in the Bible they said so they went their way without handing me a Book of Mormon, but I already showed them 10 contradictions in the Book of Mormon before they left. What do you make of that?

20090128211346AAGA56S	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does this disprove the existence of an afterlife?	Ketamine has been used 100's of times by scientists to simulate near-death experiences.  Ketamine can produce all the features of the near-death experience, including travel through a dark tunnel into light, the conviction that one is dead, telepathic communion with God, visions, out-of-body experiences and mystical states.  If near-death-experiences can be reproduced by a drug, thereby giving a false glimpse into the afterlife for some, then aren't real near-death experiences the same?  Thus, isn't the whole idea of an afterlife produced by a drug that signals the brain to cause hallucinations and visions that are taken out of the person's nonconscious mind (which can include the deeply-ingrained relgions views of each particular person)?        If you like, you can read the whole article followed by the following link:  http://www.near-death.com/experiences/pa...

20090128155212AAdo0gi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why wouldn't God use evolution?	Evolution states that species transform over time to adapt to their environment where those that are more suited survive while those that are not are forced to extinction. This ensures the survival of life through various environmental changes and extremities without any interference.   Now comparing that scenario to the God of the Bible who creates man, infuses him with curiosity yet expects him not to eat from the tree, allowing mankind to grow then realizing his something was not right and sending out a worldwide flood to erase the mistake and saving all the animals by getting them ion one boat rather than recreating them, etc.   The God of the Bible makes countless mistakes and must correct them, whereas looking at evolution all errors are eventually resolved by themselves through the process in place. If God was directly involved wouldn't it be more intelligent to use evolution as a way to ensure life's survival rather than having to come in and fix all the mistakes that are mentioned.      PS: Saying the Bible says so, so it's true is not good enough. There are countless holy books all with their own creation myths, all with the same amount of evidence.

I actaully havnt been on here that much lately,but I see the R&S section is still the same;only thing changed is the people.      The:      Arguing and debating      The frequent comparisons of Atheism against Christianity and Christianity against Atheism and other faiths.      The super serious attitudes people get in this section      The flawed arguments against God      The debate about God VS Science      The Frequent ignorant people      And the very occasional person honestly seeking answers and some spirtual direction         Did I miss anything?

Is it wrong if I ask him or will he take offense? I don't want to damage our relationship because I don't care one way or the other. He still my homebody regardless in my eyes.

20090225154914AAtO3QP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Mormonism and God Further Reexamined?	.   Ever had the possible inspiration that God kind of really likes the situation arising from LDS atheist(s) who might also might like to perhaps try and pretend that they are living a nearly perfectly unexamined life as The Latter Day Saints, also more popularly know as Mormons?  With the many numerous hugely serious and rapidly accumulating problems concerning truthfulness inside of The Church Of Jesus Christ OLDS that immediately seems to require relentless mental gymnastics appearing most Olympic in nature rather than merely for the amateurish.      Why wouldn't it be completely reasonable to perhaps reconsider the real possibility of how much dialogue is then created when maybe discussions are open and thoroughly exhaustive about those same incongruities.  Rather than strictly disallowing a more complete conversation and study of the issues never encouraged inside of the LDS Church or even on the supposedly "open avenues" of LDS sanctioned books and websites.        Maybe Mormons aren't lovin it because it truly affects their false sense of security built around all of the increasingly exposed lies.  But some much higher powers at work might not seem to mind at all.         Knowing that the most fundamental benchmark example of definitions describing occult behavior is first and foremost the attempted quenching of investigative inquiries into maybe the harder, maybe more diffiCULT (pun intended) examinations.

But many  doctors, nurses and security guards who work the night shift in the hospital where I work say they have seen ghosts walking around on a certain floor, rockers start rocking with no one in them, and people have been seen in locked rooms with windows.  Then security (who are the only ones with the keys to these rooms) unlocks them and checks them out and no one is there.            These are reputable people and they swear they are real and that they have seen them with their own eyes.  My brethren, what do you think of this?  I'm confused.  I think maybe they might be real after all and that they might be unsaved souls wandering in outer darkness, souls who did not go to Jesus.  What do you think???????  Thanks.

Certes, les non fumeurs que vous derangez peuvent se pousser... mais ne pouvez vous pas sortir prendre l'air quelques minutes lorsque vous êtes au restaurant en zone non fumeur plutot que de demander un cendrier au patron et de deranger tout le monde?        et autre question: respecterez vous l'interdiction de fumer qui aura lieu le 1er fevrier?      je ne parle bien evidement pas des fumeurs qui s'abstiennent d'eux même de fumer dans ces lieux publics ou qui se limitent aux zones fumeurs... pour eux, cette interdiction ne changera evidement pas grand chose voire rien!      merci!

I'm back here posting on yahoo answers again.      In late March I turn 28 years old. I graduated college with a BA in Radio/TV/Film in June 2004.      Recently I called this temp agency that I registered with 5 years ago asking for work. They lied and told me that they don't have any work assignments. Other poeple who were walking outside the door just got placed in jobs.      Every month or so the temp agancy calls with with jobs that are 70 miles each way that they can't fill.      Just because I have a small learning disability and mild CP doesn't give them the right to descriminate against me like that.      Because of what happened to me at the big department store last year I'm frusterated with looking for a job. The department store I worked at starts with the letter M. I can't mention their name becasue I'm suing them.       The lawsuit is taking longer than I thought. The department stores has good lawyers who take the side of the lying managers. My lawyer told me he won't give up. My lawyer tells me he is used to these things.      I would like to apply for SSI becasue I need money and can't find a job.      Employers don't want to give me a chance. I could get SSI for a few years and then hope to either start my own bussiness or get a job after the economy rebounds.       The department of Rehab feels that they are unable to help me.

He has no job, he dropped out of college, he has blue balls, he lives in his parent's garage, and he got a woman who is not his longtime fiancée (10years) pregnant. The woman just turned 18 and plans on keeping the baby even though she didn't finish high school and her parents kicked her out. She is now sleeping on our front lawn because she got in a fight with my son and he won't let her back in to the garage. What should we do? Should we raise the kid as our own and get a restraining order against our son? Should we get third jobs so that we can support our son, the girl he got pregnant, and the new baby? Or should we move away?

20090225155443AAAO2kR	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Anyone ever heard of this murderer?	some guy called Pocumpsy (spelling probably isnt right) I heard about him from a friend at school and apparently he would wear a mask on his face and a mask on his head. Then he would put his victim in a room (I'm assuming tied up or something) and crawl into the room on his hands and knees facing the ground (showing the mask on the top of his head) and in his hands he would have knives and eventually kill his victim with them.       My friend mentioned he had seen something on youtube over the summer about it and how someone got movie rights to make a film about it.      Just wondering if anyone else had heard of this ( I wanna see the video, if one exists) or if it was just some story my friend had made up.          Please respond,      Dan

20090225155034AAmj7dH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Just heard some sad news about my first house...?	Me and my fiance are in the process of buying our first house together and we're due to get the keys in 2 weeks. We've just heard this morning that someone committed suicide in the house 3-4 years ago, and today while introducing ourselves to our new neighbours, they confirmed this was true.       It was a married man, who's wife left him and took the kids. He slipped into a sad world of drug abuse and he eventually took his own life through depression. I feel so upset this has happened in my new (and first) home and I'm not sure what to make of it. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I found out.      I don't know the details of how he took his life and what room it happened in and I don't want to know either. I'm moving into such a beautiful home, in a beautiful and quiet street. This news would of came as a massive shock to all the other residents.       There's nothing I can do about it obviously, but just wondering what everyone's thoughts are. I feel this has just cast a huge black shadow over what should be an exciting time for us. Am I over reacting? How would you feel if this was you? I'm trying hard to forget about it, but I can't.      Thanks for your time.      Suzanne x

20090225155231AAPO6Op	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Gay student opening up to a gay teacher?	Alright, so I had this teacher a while back and we got along quite well, telling jokes and what not, I always made her laugh quite easily. Anyways, Shes a lesbian as am I, and this one time while I was still in her class I had a bit of a panic attack just before the bell, and rushed to the bathroom. I was there for a while and when I came back obviously everyone had left, but I needed my bags, she made me sit down and calm down before I left because she knew I was driving home. she tried to ask why I was so upset, but I didn't really explain and she didn't push it. (I ended up half answering the question because it was based on the fact that I came out to my parents and all did not go well. I was basically forced into it because of family troubles. which was not good because it messed up the outcome) anyway I'm not in her class anymore but I had to go talk to her about exams and the conversation took turns every once in a while where she asked questions that hinted about how I was and caused me to hesitate when answering because I wasn't sure how much I wanted to give away about my family life now. but I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to talk to her about the whole situation. It has started to get rough again as communication between my parents and I is at an all time low. The thing is I can't explain it without telling her I'm gay, And I'm a little scared to do that.. I guess because I really look up to her .. I dunno... I just want to know what you think and if it would be a good idea to talk to her about it all....

20090225155602AAwBz0f	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are "Bible Beating Christians giving God a bad rep?	First, I am a Christian and I am fed up with hypocrites spreading these uneducated, mis-informed statements about God. They would have the world believe that God is a tyrant and only interested in destroying his own creations. They pick out versus like, if a man should work on the Sabbath day then he should be put to death, saying that God commanded entire kingdoms wiped out because they refused to worship him, or that Jesus came to rid this world of all sinners! THESE ARE ALL TWISTED HALF-TRUTHS! If these so called Christians took the time to actually study and research the Bible in all of its original translations they would see the truth. God is not going to kill anyone for working on the Sabbath. He commanded that we should take a day of rest. This can be any day of the week and I usually take mine on Friday. If people worked every day, forty to sixty hours a week for a year how healthy do you think those people will be? People would, will, and do work themselves to death trying to build empires and obtain a comfortable lifestyle. God said to rest one day out of seven for our own benefit. A lot of people would kill themselves if they didn't take time off. In the book of Samuel we are told about King Saul and how God told him to wipe out the Agagites because of how evil they were. God told him not to leave one thing alive! Now if anyone doubts this battle took place you can look it up. Its historically documented and not just in the Bible. Now some might say why would a loving God tell Saul to kill all those people including the children and animals? Saul killed them all except for the king of the Agagites, his queen, and their son. The prophet Samuel found out and killed the king but the wife and son got away. Now you may say to yourself good for that woman and her son; but what you probably don't realize is that Adolf Hitler is a direct descendant of that young boy. And we all know what a bloody mark he left on the 20th century. The Agagites weren't just some innocent tribe of people who God picked on because he was bored. The Holocaust and World War II could have been prevented; Saul's choice to disobey God effected people who came thousands of years after him. Jesus said him self that he did not come to condemn the world but to save it. Again if you doubt the fact that he ever existed, it is recorded in secular record too. If Jesus did not come to condemn but to save then no man on this earth; Christian or not has the right to tell anyone that they are going to hell. Our jobs as Christians is to show God's love to everyone, even our enemies. Jesus said to love those who persecute you, pray for those who spitefully use and mistreat you. As far as homosexuality being wrong, yes it is wrong but am I going to curse the ground they walk on, tell them that they're evil, no I most certainly will not. God loves them too, he loves everyone even when they don't love or live for him. He even loves those who don't believe he exists! So to all those out there who have been shunned and treated badly by so called 'Christians', I am sorry for their actions. 'Judge not, lest ye be judged' is what God commanded of his followers. Feel free to respond to what I have written. God Bless!

20090225155906AAZzsNk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do you believe in what you believe in?	Ok, first off, I really don't want to offend anyone or their beliefs by asking this/these question(s).  I'm just voicing a few of my opinions and questions and getting people's input on them.     You can pretty much say that I'm agnostic.  Don't get confused with athiest, or something else.  It's just a name for a person that doesn't necessarily know what to believe in when it comes to religion.  And that makes me wonder why there are other people out there that are so involved and believe in a god or a higher power.  To me, it makes no sense.  I know that the basic idea of a religion is to give us a meaning of why we are here, or why we are alive on this world.  But really, as far as I know from common sense, not one religion has been proven true. (Correct me if I'm wrong.)   Another thing is that if you think about it, your religion is based off of your family and/or heritage.  So in reality, you may or may not be choosing what your religion is.  If you are raised a certain way in a certain environment, you are more likely to follow that path rather than another path obviously.  And religion causes so many problems.  There are wars over religion and stupid jokes or comments that are out of context about certain religions.  I won't include any specific religions.   I, as a child, was tried to become part of a religion.  The only reason that I ever become committed in any way was because of fear.  Religion SHOULD NEVER strike fear in a person from my point of view.  The reason I was scared was because of "sins" or other things that would supposedly go against a religion.  And you can be forgiven etc., but the point is to never sin in the first place or try not to.  The stories that I have been handed before have been completely unreal to me.  I have tried reading a few different bibles before and have not understood how any of these "Gods" could have done anything or brought us here, created us, whatever religion it might be that you're talking about.   Now, I'm not saying I'm a sciency person because I'm definitely not.  But evolution is far more believable than a higher power.  And I don't exactly believe in evolution either.  Even aliens from other planets are more believable to me.  But it's not that I believe in aliens either.  To get to the point, I'm just saying that I really don't understand why people believe in such imaginary things.  The imagination is a great thing, yes.  And if you want to believe in something, nobody can stop you.  But you also have to respect what other people believe in, and I do.  I'm not insulting any religion or person.  I'm just asking a simple question.       So why do YOU believe in a religion?  And does anyone else(whether you believe in a religion or not) agree with any of my opinions/views?

20070621011553AAfip6s	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do Christians go against their Bible by having so many denominations?	"I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought." 1 Corinthians 1:10      "May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus"  Romans 15:5      I'm just curious.Why, if the Bible is truth and the truth must be followed, would there be so many different views on and about how to practice and follow a belief that clearly says that everyone must be united in that belief.

20070708222706AA7FUzr	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Does this prove I'm good at hiding my emotions?	There was a guy who was known to harass people because he thought it was funny and I was one of his targets. He would call my name loudly as I walked past, say mean things to me and snicker, sometimes attempt to isolate me, etc etc. I would simply ignore and talk to my friends or have fun.       One day in front of his friends he made a face at me anticipating suprise n anger me, but I simply smiled. He quickly attempted to say "Hello," but I averted my eyes quickly so he only got half of the word out. I had never seen anyone look so embarassed in my life. All I did was simply ignore him while he had attempted to harass me for so long.    The fact that he was so quick to jump from trying to harass me (negative attention) to greeting me (positive attention) and getting REALLY super flustered when I cut him off (no attention and mind you this was all in public)...does that show I am good at hiding my emotions since he thought I would acknowledge him after he had treated me poorly?

20070916011425AAWdKWn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So, what do Christians believe?	I'd like to know what you guys believe or even if you know what you believe.      MAT 1:16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.      LUK 3:23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli.      So, was he Heli's son or Jacobs son? You cant have two biological fathers, can you?      1st Kings 4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.      2nd Chronicles 9:25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.      So, how many stalls and horsemen really?            Day 1: Sky, Earth, light   Day 2: Water, both in ocean basins and above the sky(!)   Day 3: Plants   Day 4: Sun, Moon, stars (as calendrical and navigational aids)   Day 5: Sea monsters (whales), fish, birds, land animals, creepy-crawlies (reptiles, insects, etc.)   Day 6: Humans (apparently both sexes at the same time)   Day 7: Nothing (the Gods took the first day off anyone ever did)      Plans before the sun? Wow, I wonder where they got their sunlight to live.      Has anybody ever seen God?      "For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." (Gen. 32:30)      Genesis says so      "No man hath seen God at any time." (John 1:18)      But John disagrees, LOL.      This is only a few out of many..

Sous l'empire romain, la crucifixion, le combat de gladiator ou encore des hommes dévorés par des lions étaient des divertissements. Longtemps d'ailleurs, les éxécutions se sont fait publiquement. Aujourd'hui encore, dans certains états américains, les éxecutions de prisonniers peuvent se dérouler devant un public. Il y aussi de nombreuses personnes qui, sur internet, regardent des vidéos de gens qui se font tabasser, tuer ou violer.    Le fait de faire du malheur, de la souffrance ou de la mort d'un autre homme, un divertissement ou un spectacle n'est donc pas nouveau.      Comment est-ce possible d'avoir un coeur mauvais à ce point ? Quel plaisir peut on trouver à regarder un homme se faire torturer, tuer ou à voir une femme se faire violer ?!   Et même sans aller jusqu'à ces extrêmes, comment peut on rire et se moquer du malheur d'un autre. Qui y a t-il de divertissant dans tout ?a ?!!

20070801001800AAoKqWH	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Men have needs, but so do women, so why allow him strip clubs and not yourself?	I've often heard many women say that the reason they let their guys go to stripclubs, and often they will go with them, is that "men have needs". That's fine, but I also have needs. I don't want to know that I will be staring at the same pen!s for the next 40 years, so sometimes a lapdance from a nice Italian with my girlfriends is a nice release.      But why are so many women out there willing to let their men do these things, but as soon as you ask them if they ever go to male stripclubs, they tell you that they think it'd be disrespectful to their husbands? I mean, just how gullible and desperate to please are women nowadays? I love men. I love seeing beautiful, naked men. And lord forbid I have a little change here and there -- LIKE my boyfriend! So why is it generally seen as some sort of natural urge for men, yet for women it's "bad"? If you were my boyfriend, would you be okay with some other guy rubbing his junk across my chest?

Why is it that when Satan, (Lucifer, the devil, or demons). is confronted by Jesus Christ,  he always recognizes Jesus and identifies him as LORD?     If Satan himself recognizes this, why doesn't all mankind also recognize this and admit Jesus is Lord?

Mateo 28:11-15 contiene un registro de una conspiración entre los Judíos y los soldados Romanos para propagar la historia de que fueron los discípulos quienes robaron el cuerpo de Cristo.      ?Cómo pudo enterarse Leví de este asunto, ya que ningún judío o romano lo habría admitido?
