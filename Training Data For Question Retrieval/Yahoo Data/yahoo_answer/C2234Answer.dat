I'm not sure, I haven't played it in a few years.<br>  <br>  If you two can set up a LAN connection then you can deffinately play.

(Default)<br>  <br>  I've played a LOT of H3, the oddball IS a 1-hit kill, this may change in MLG because those gameplay rules are set by MLG and not bungie.|`|2mU1bbAZaa	i have yet to come across any.|`|DJ4y1QkCaa	No there are not. and i've sometimes had 1 hit kills with the oddball but mostly not. if it's team slayer it's hit and miss but in mlg it is a 1 hit kill...

QSwUhuk9aa	To be honest with you, since they released the Burning Crusade levelling has become somewhat easier to do.<br>  <br>  You haven't said what class you are so it makes it difficult to give specific advice so here goes:<br>  <br>  1) If you have a rested bar, you gain 200% experience from monsters. So if you have been playing on the character a while chances are you won't have a rested bar. Just make sure that before you log off, you get the character to an Inn so he can acquire a bit of rest.<br>  <br>  2) Get as many quests as you can, and do them all before handing them in. Sometimes you get many quests that are close together and it means you waste less time travelling to and from quest givers.<br>  <a href="http://www.usfine.com/World-of-Warcraft-USA-c-51.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usfine.com/World-of-Warcraft-...</a><br>  3) Instance runs and Quests for Instances are paramount. You get much more experience, better armour and you will also have the quest to hand in afterwards.<br>  <br>  4) I got from level 70-80 in a matter of three weeks; but I spent a lot of time doing it. If you have a lot of free time then 20-55 is achievable in two weeks, but it would mean spending hours on the game - there are no shortcuts on WoW.<br>  <br>  I know you asked for a really quick method to getting to level 55 but there just isn't one. The above are just tips that I found useful in levelling up my characters.|`|ak0T96CQaa	Spec Fury and get two 1hs

I5tFjvm4aa	The monster hunter series is AWESOME! The second one in my opinion is better because it has all the same stuff as the first plus more like more weapons armour items monsters levels etc and it also has better graphics. By the way I don't think it has online play (it might I can't remember) also a good online game would be socom navy seals (I think that's what it is called) that has good online play. Hope this helps :)
M79W3Ct9aa	Questions 2-6:  You need a certain amount of wins for that class of vehicle before they call you.  I don't know the number, but i'm told its A LOT.  Let's say, for example, you need 90 wins before the champs call.  You need 90 wins in a tuner before he calls you, 90 wins in a muscle before he calls you, 90 wins in a luxury, etc. etc.  This would make sense since you gotta do a lot of races to get that 1 million bucks for the garage buy-in.<br> <br> Question 1:  Booke is the city champ.  I think you just need a certain amount of wins before he calls.  This was the first champ I encountered in the game along with the bike champ (I use a bike for most of my races, a lot easier) so just keep playing the game and he will call eventually.  <br> <br> Question 7:  Again, I use a motorcycle for the majority of my races (especially the DUB tourneys and pinkslip races) and only resort to cars when its specifically required.  A souped up bike in this game usually smokes most of the competition.  Invest in one whenever you can becauce they are very useful for the more difficult races and are pretty cheap compared to the cars.  In terms of speed, the best Muscle is the Z06.  Best exotic is probably the Saleen S7 (I don't own this car, but the stats bar suggests it is).  Only exotic I have is the Lambo I won in the DUB tourney.  For Tuners, I'd have to say either the Evo or the Skyline.  Possibly the RS4 too (don't own it yet).  I lost my Skyline in a pinkslip race so I didn't get a lot of time with it, but i've had my Evo for a while and it looks to have the best speed stats over the others.  For Luxury, the SL65 convertible.  I have the DUB Benz, though, and its not too far off from the SL65 so that will probably work for most races.      <br> <br> I don't like drifting in this game so I'm afraid I can't help you there.  Sorry.<br> <br> Question 8: Karol will call you about the abilities pretty early in the game.  You can choose which you wanna use for each vehicle whenenver you go to the garage.  You have to drive clean, regardless whichever one, to build it up.  You only get a max of one at first and as you keep using it you rank up to the next level where you then can get two max and stops at level three.  I think the best for most cases is the EMP since it slows your opponent down a little bit.  If my opponents are on bikes then definitely ROAR since it knocks them off their bike, lol.<br> <br> EDIT:  I just got my 100th win in a tuner and sure enough the champ called me up.  So, you need 100 wins for each vehicle type like I stated above before they challenge you.
8M5Srqh1aa	yes|`|Mb31azhQaa	its fun...and if 1mil people have downloaded and played, i think its virus free maybe
x7iYis9Saa	Hmm sounds like a problem to me|`|jyVqvRxHaa	it just looks like that on ur screen?? thats wat i always thought
z2LGqY0Gaa	Yes I agree, it does suck that you only get one game system, but be thankful that you got a good one.  Your dad probably thinks it's a waste of money because in a few years the ds that he paid 130 for is going to be worth 50 bucks.  But that is what happens to almost everything, cars, tvs, computers and when you go to re-sell games their value gets flushed down the toilet from what you paid for them.  I know how you feel, I had a ps2 and that was it for the longest time.  I bet you could convince him to get you an older console.  I don't know if it's you personally that only has one tv or if it's the whole family, but if it's the whole family you should be happy you have a handheld.  You aren't getting yelled at to get off the tv so your parents can watch the news.  He also probably doesn't think that video games have any recreational value which can be a huge thing when you are young.  Just remember that when you live out on your own you will get to do whatever you want.  I have all the game systems and 2 tvs and I love it, but my mom never would have let me when I was underage.  If you think you are bored with the ds you should look up what else you can do with it online.|`|7S2mPt3maa	i had nothing until i got a ps3 <br>  i just paid for it with my own money<br>  good luck

j6MvCr6Naa	Bioshock:<br>  <br>  Bioshock is my favourite game of all time and definitely the best game ever made in my opinion. The graphics are absolutely fantastic, very detailed and the different effects like blood are very realistic and well done. The design is astonishing, the world of Rapture is the most unbelievable game world ever created, every level is has it's own new visual style, colours, design and atmosphere. The sound is also amazing, the game is constantly playing with your senses by putting in scary noises in the right places in time with what's happening on screen with creates an amazing atmosphere and immerses you in the game. The story is just as good, it's very complex in places but easy to follow, it has a very rich backstory and all the characters are well developed with amazing voice actors behind them. Be ready for some spectacular plot twists. The gameplay is also a great deal of fun and pretty much limitless because of the amount of different powers you can combine, this also let's you play in a very tactical and smart game if you want. You can't go wrong buying this game and you won't regret it.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for Bioshock:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform..." rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 96% meaning this is one of the best games ever made and in my opinion it is.|`|JepeaPHsaa	I could recommend a few: Halo 3, Halo Wars, Street Fighter IV, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Fable 2, Call of Duty 4 or Call of Duty World at War.|`|xl1a4u3aaa	either call of duty 5 or Basketball 09 or maybe a racing dam or  grand theft auto lost and damned or grand theft auto 4|`|dDa2BPaOaa	halo 3 and play live that the only thing people play these days

nsVig475aa	You use the disc from the game that was released most recently, regardless of the order of installation. So you would use the disc for Apartment Life. If you install a newer Expansion Pack than Apartment Life (should one ever be released), you would use the newer one. <br>  <br>  If you try to use an older disc, the game will reject it and tell you to insert the proper disc.<br>  <br>  But simply put, just use the disc from Apartment Life.<br>  <br>  If by "add-ons" you mean Stuff Packs, you still need to use the disc from the most recent Expansion Pack you own. If I'm mistaken about what you wean by "add-ons", please clarify.|`|EnEI9BG7aa	you know you need the original sims 2 also?but you use the disk for whatever one your using
5eUoENzuaa	Downloading games and such online is a rather risky thing to do, because of legal reasons and the fact that you don't know what is really in the files that you are exposing your computer to.<br>  <br>  With The Sims 2 and it's Expansions, you need to type in the code which came with the game case to activate it anyway, and it's not possible to continue with the install without the code.<br>  <br>  If you want to get the game without paying for it, then borrowing it from a friend would be the best option. :)|`|x5R1zUtraa	That for one is illegal, and you can't download it without paying.

xlCx3zsjaa	This answer really does depend on your opinions. If you liked GBA games or not. Seeing as you didn't like GBA games it only makes sense that you don't care about it. Others enjoy(ed) GBA games however. Nintendo was probably trying to capture the highest percentage of opinions on this issue from the gaming community. If they were to make the DSi capable with GBA games then they would half to make it thicker, which would not only make the DSi cost more but also have more people frowning upon this decision. If you do like GBA games then you would probably just stick with the normal DS or the DS lite. This does dock into profits but still. I believe that Nintendo made the right decision......I will miss Golden Sun though.|`|lQZa74mIaa	They had to remove it to fit the memory card slot in.|`|vNJpT6EKaa	i agree too<br>  go get a GBA or something|`|2KnEHMj3aa	Yea with the modchip you could download gba games anyways and DS, and retro games. But 1 problem...<br>  I dont think the modchip will work with the DSI.<br>  Some of them only work on DS Lites as it is.<br>  And Some may require the GBA slot.<br>  BTW:<br>  Some other good GBA games are wario ware, Yoshi island, mario kart, Sonic, and Others.<br>  And peoples friends may not own a Nintendo DS<br>  and those people wouldnt be able to play gba games and gutair hero will be missing out on alout of fun.|`|H2FXgTIraa	That wasn't so much a question as it was a rant, but yeah, if people are so annoyed by it they can't just not get the DSi.  So long as they still have their old DS they can still do it, or just use their GBA.|`|dhXCEumpaa	They probably had to remove it. The DS is now too thin to have the extra slot so they removed it.<br>  <br>  Comment 3/9/09- If the DSi DID havea GBA slot and an SD slot then it would be good for ROMs of gba games unreleased in America. BRING MOTHER 3 TO THE STATES!!!|`|N2rntAqvaa	I totally agree with you.  <br>  <br>  The GBA has never fascinated me that much.<br>  It doesn't have a touch screen like the DS.  Doesn't have the two screens that make the games look pretty cool like on the DS. <br>  <br>  And besides, when buying a DSi, there are so many good games out there exclusively for the DS, that it just makes you not want to play the GBA games.<br>  <br>  I mean, when you play a game you really love, would you suddenly go back to some old GBA game?  <br>  <br>  When you have the opportunity to buy other great DS games, would you suddenly go and buy a used GBA game?  <br>  <br>  And come on, there are only two Guitar Hero games for the DS, and they aren't that great like they are on the home consoles.  People ALWAYS complained about how the buttons are too small and incomfortable, and how it gives them cramps, and how the songs are not that good. <br>  <br>  Why are they suddenly trying to find a reason to not buy a DSi? <br>  <br>  I can't really "prove you wrong" because I don't think you are wrong.  I think you are right.  <br>  <br>  I am not saying it doesn't matter to me at all, because having the opportunity to play some GBA games is pretty cool.  But I am glad they got rid of it.  Why?  Because if they wouldn't have, they wouldn't have been able to add all those great things to the DSi.<br>  <br>  What I think is also pretty bad (a great disadvantage for me) that they made the DSi region locked.  Although, the older DS games are region free, so that doesn't worry me too much.  <br>  <br>  I think it is pretty stupid to make a hand-held/portable console region locked, since it's portable.  People buy it so that they can play when they wait somewhere, when they are not at home and they are bored, and also to take it with them to other countries.<br>  <br>  I am gonna be moving to a different country soon (not in North America) and I would have to start buying exclusive DSi games on eBay instead of a normal local store, since I will buy my DSi in the U.S., and not there.<br>  <br>  People just have to understand that in order to get something better (like cameras, DS shop, recorder, bigger screens, etc.) you have to give up something else (GBA slot).

AA11850311	for xbox, Sims focuses more on Free Play, while Bustin' Out focuses more on the Story Mode, plus Bustin' Out has more furniture and buy mode options.  The controls for Sims & Bustin' Out on xbox are exactly the same. <br>  In Sims2 for PC, to get pregnant, your friend must "try for baby" not woohoo.  It's the same animation, but woohoo does not result in a pregnancy.<br>  In Bustin' Out, if you have the heart bed or heart hot tub, you can have 2 sims play together in them.  Very similar to the woohoo animation in Sims2 for PC.  In Bustin' Out, if you are in Free Play, you can only have 4 sims in the house at the same time.  If you already have 4, you will not be able to have a baby.  If you are in Story Mode, or in Free Play with 3 or fewer sims in the house, just keep hugging and kissing.  Eventually you will get a message pop up that asks "should we have a baby"  select yes, and a baby in a cradle will immediately appear.|`|viAoOSXXaa	Nope, they're different.<br>  Depending on what game system you have, you could just look up Sims Bustin Out to see it. I have it for game cube, it's just a different version of Sims. It's actually fun, if you like the regular Sims version you'd like Bustin Out too.|`|gV3IvTIpaa	The Sims bustin 'out is a PS2 game which almost changes everything relative to controls, means i pick The Sims But The Sims Busting out has some good feautures<br>  But The Sims 3 is the best!...

Another good, strong pokemon is Dragonite.  Find a dratini asap and lvl it.  You will need a fire type for the elite 4, Ponyta are easy to find..Also one of the first you'll encounter is Shinx, an electric type..<br>  <br>  THat should be Grass, water, fire, and electric to start, the other two could be your choice.  BUt you might conisder a ghost or dark type and bug type.

dNrDhzkHaa	There not exactly major characters in the Nintendo series.  All the characters in Brawl were at least kinda popular at one time or another, while the mages and ninja are only in this 1 game as far as I know, and they aren't very popular.  The other characters have all starred in at least 1 game as a hero or villain, these guys have never starred in one game.|`|0muvYszmaa	well brawl has enough but Fly Guy should be on there but by put do you mean use cause I'm pretty sure Fly Guy would be in the background of yoshi's island stage.|`|BlDt6CjMaa	They aren't in Brawl because they are characters owned by SquareEnix, not Nintendo.

If you click on each move you can tell what kind of move it is by looking at the symbol next to it.<br>  <br>  Physical moves will have an orange box wih a star in it, and use the Attack and Defence stats. (E.g. Mega Punch, Bite)<br>  <br>  Special moves will have a grey-blue box with a circle in it, and use the Special Attack and Special Defense stats. (E.g. Flamethrower, Energy Ball)<br>  <br>  Status moves will have a light grey box with a Yin Yang symbol in it, and are not affected by any stats and usually cause status problems, or they can raise or lower stats. (E.g. Growl, Recover)|`|BlDt6CjMaa	When your looking at it there should be a little symbol somewhere near it that is either a red rectangle with a faded star, circles inside of each other(like a drop of water) or the ying yang thing.

AA10040586	This code was only given out to people who attended the midnight launch of this game at either GameStop or EBGames, so it is a unique code like microsoft points are all different codes.
lsJYCsKVaa	Are you talking about while you are playing a house in the backround the neighbors look a bit blurrier? If so...it is supposed to be like that. And the reason why the video probably looks good is because they used a video editing software. If you graphics don't look good...perhaps you need to upgrade your card?
zCIIHr3saa	Are you using Steam? Do you mean the game is running faster than it should? I mean at more that 100%? Because if you managed to get a game working fast, than you should not have a problem.

This should help you cut back a little, but really it's all up to you to cut back, just like any addiction.

After you get out you sould see a tower. Climb the tower and there is your rayquaza. It should be lvl 70 so be prepared. All thoughs rumors about needing a master ball not true. Get his hp low then throw ultra balls. Remember he has rest but its only 10 pp. <br>  <br>  Try a lvl 60-65 Glaceon, anybody who has icebeam or blizzard will work actually. :D<br>  <br>  More importantly, use a Pokemon that has an affinity of ice.

xkRoWidsaa	It is true. Private servers are basically a privately owned version of another game. They are often filled with a lot of cheats that normally wouldn't be allowed in the regular version of the game ex) In WoW ps, you can get to level 80 in a couple minutes.<br>  <br>  If you want to play on a private server, go onto google and type in 'World of Warcraft private server' and you should find a webstie that lists a lot of different private servers to choose from. Once you've decided which one you want to play on, make an account on their website and follow the instructions that they put on their website on how to set up the private server.<br>  <br>  EDIT: In response to alexencandar's post, private servers are VERY easy to find. Also, it is not necessarily illegal as long as they are not making a profit (or so I've heard). What also proves this logic is that Blizzard would have already have all these private servers shut down by now, wouldn't they?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Hvd82Owiaa	In response to Sdrawkcab's answer:<br>  <br>  WoW private servers are ALL illegal, whether they make a profit or not. In order to create one you violate the DMCA and use copyrighted material.<br>  <br>  Having said that, private servers are dangerous in other ways as well. They can lead to loss of personal information which could affect bank accounts and other important things.<br>  <br>  The $15 month is basically what you would pay to go to one evening movie and have popcorn and a soda. Thats 2 hours of entertainment versus as much entertainment as you want from WoW.
Wh0dSjsmaa	looks like a possibility <br>  <br>  NoE: How do you see the future of the interactive mystery novel as a genre of video games, and do you already have ideas for a follow-up title?

Before you go and buy anything, make sure any other devices hooked up to the internet are turned off and check your internet settings on the ps3 to get a signal strength. If it's low, i'd recommend getting a ethernet cable. I have one and downloads are always quick, compared to my friend who also has a wireless connection. Online play is also more enjoyable with less connection interruptions.|`|egCrER9haa	Do you have Media Servers on? That often messes around with Game Updates. Chances are your internet is fine.

For example, my Touch Screen is on its way out, I can get a replacement touch screen for less than ￡5. I have watched instruction videos on YouTube that show me how to replace my touch screen.<br>  If you don't want to repair it yourself or you can't, then go to your local games shop, one of them will be able to help you.

KFDzhDowaa	What system are you running it on? Ps3, Xbox360, PS2, wii, or PC? <br>  <br>  The only thing I can think of if you are using a console is that you just need to return it and get a new one. <br>  <br>  For the PC, it's possible that the data got corrupted somehow. Their are a few ways that it could have gotten corrupted, but no matter what it's best to just uninstall it, then reinstall.

You need to add a decimal value to the end of the number to "squeeze" the item into a spot.<br>  Example: Item 1 is 103<br>  Item 2 is 104<br>  You want to move Item 3 in between them. So you number it 103.1.

xcyrLDnHaa	After crossing the bike path ( To the south of Eterna City) and going through the gate, turn left and cut the trees. Keep going ahead, cross the bridge, and try being somewhere in between. in case a pillar blocks your way, just change your path a bit. Once you get towards the end of the grassy patch, go directly under the bike path. Here, you have to do some TRIAL AND ERROR work. Start from the left- most side of the path. Take one step right and try going ahead. Keep doing this and you will eventually find an entrance to the cave. Just a HINT: Your key is to find a long path under the bike path. It is not too long, but you can make out when the screen moves itself. After g<br>  oing in, Use STRENGTH to move the boulders. Then, take the left side and get into the cave.

It's impossible to see, because the path is blocking your view, but you'll know when you've found it when your walking against an outer-cave wall and you're able to keep walking forward, as if walking on the rock wall.|`|k8h2kAd1aa	it is hard to find, but you have to go to the wayward cave. outside the wayward cave is a bike track, go under the bike track then go up and find a secert entrences, you may need strength for this, also you can get the tm earthquake after beating the 6th gym here.|`|nQMMKua0aa	u need to get surf and waterfall before u can get there... u gotta go back after u almost beat the game...|`|NBS9csBOaa	Go under Cycling road and once you get to the end go along the wall to the Left, there should be a secret cave there, I also think the rate of finding a Gible is 20%.<br>  <br>      Good Luck! :D|`|EUaIGX0Gaa	It is hard to find, but you have to go to the wayward cave. outside the wayward cave is a bike track, go under the bike track then go up and find a secert entrences, you may need strength for this, also you can get the tm earthquake here.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped<br>  Mip

QWHpXlNCaa	Maddie,<br>       I would want to work the games because that is what I do for a living. I am a carnie though. We get a percentage. The ride job won't teach you as much for your future as the games can. If you try to get people for more money you will learn sales techniques that apply everywhere. Many sales ideas come from us carnies. Like when you go to mc donalds and see that Big Macs are 99cents. Then the next two or three signs bring up the Big Mac value meal. If you get the value Big Mac meal it will cost you more than getting all the items seperately because of the 99cent sale. We do that as carnies all day long.

Profiles - Jimmy, i don't know what its called, and paste it somewhere you can find it later, then re-install it, get to that area in the program files, delete the folder/file that the game created as default on installation (the one that you copied earlier, unless there is nothing there now) then paste in the copy you made earlier in its place.

6d2078fa8217615a83c0ed01345fc5bdaa	These two strategies are the two I generally use.<br>  <br>  1.  If there seem to be a lot of one number, say, 9, try to fill in every 9.  Remember, there needs to be one and only one in every row, column and box.  If you are working with a pencil, put a line through every row and column and scribble (lightly) in each box.  This will leave a few spaces free of your marks.  These are possible locations of the 9.  If there is only one square left in an unclaimed area, that would be where the 9 goes.  This new information can help eliminate other squares.<br>  <br>  2.  Fill in an entire row, column or box if four or less squares are empty.  Try using shared numbers to get to this.  Example:  A row is missing 2, 5 and 8.  Two spaces are missing in a box that needs a 2, 3 and 5.  That means the 8 would go in the other "non-common box" square in the row and the 3 in the remaining box square.<br>  <br>  It is best to work with a combination of these two techniques, so don't only rely on one.  Using two at the same time can be effective.  Also, if you're working on one on the computer, try copying it down with a pencil.<br>  <br>  Hope you find these helpful! <br>  -Blacksheepmatt|`|260b20f5a7609d46c5df45794b79882faa	Yes.  First, each row, column, and box (each square of a tic-tac-toe grid) must have the numbers 1-9 in it.  So I start with "1" going through and putting in all the number "1's" where I know they go.  (ie.  there is a 1 in this row, and that row, and this column, and that column, so the only spot left is this one.).  Then do 2, 3, 4,...  After you are done, start at one again.  When you filled in all the ones you know, then start putting tiny numbers in the corners for all the maybes.. (Maybe a 4, or 7 go here).  And eventually it will all fit together.  It is all logically figured out--if there is something here, then there can't be another one.|`|AA11312571	To find the lone number.

AND YOU CAN BE A BLACK GUY.<br>  <br>  'Nuff Said.|`|ZRS6V6Rcaa	dude come on, whats wrong with the cod5 gore? that makes it even more awesome... <br>  <br>  CALL OF DUTY WORLD AT WAR!!!!!!|`|CaDrjGoVaa	rock band = my favoritest game ever!|`|X8nw0UQEaa	Gears of War 2.|`|3oN9nkFqaa	Maybe Banjo Kazooie N&B.|`|IUxM3brbaa	Most of the popular shooters are at least a little gory. I'm guessing you want something that you can spend a lot of time online with and not get bored...I'm the same way.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I highly suggest "Left 4 Dead" because it is so much fun online. It is a little gory but not too bad.<br>  <br>  A good racing multiplayer game is "GRID" and a good new RTS multiplayer is "Halo Wars" that just came out.

You have great cards but you gotta chose. i would  keep thunder king and create a gadget oppression deck. Obviously it is an antimeta deck and is not only fun but a very solid deck.

LnYr2dLfaa	There is no games just for the DS Lite. All DS games work in both the DS and DS Lite.<br>  <br>  All official GBA games work in both DSs (fake games may not work). No GB or GBC games will work in either DS.|`|kO1ykFo3aa	yeah u can play regular games on DS light in a regular DS and  GBA or previous games can be played on DS as well.<br>  <br>  downloaded games on DS lite cannot be played on DS because the chip (bottom on) is too small for the DS.|`|wck4MHREaa	Let me set you straight.<br>  <br>  The DS lite is only an upgraded version of the DS; it can play all of the games that a DS can, including Game Boy Advance games. Some Game Boy Advance games, such as "eReader" cannot work with the DS because of how the Game Boy Advance slot is placed in the DS (or DS lite).<br>  <br>  The Game Boy Advance comes in three sorts; the GBA (no backlight, but can play Game Boy and Game Boy Color games- also is retangular in shape), the GBA SP (which shuts closed, like a clam; also has a backlight, a rechargeable battery, and also plays GB/GBC games) and the GBA Micro (A smaller version of the GBA that does not flip closed, has a rechargeable battery/backlight, but does not play GB/GBC games).<br>  <br>  So for review, DS Lite can play anything a regular DS can. A regular DS can play DS games and Game Boy Advance games. Only two types of Game Boy Advance models can play old Game Boy/Game Boy Color games.<br>  <br>  <br>  It'll get more confusing when the DSi comes out in the states; that system can't play Game Boy Advance games at all, nor can it play games like Guitar Hero that use the GBA slot. Plus it has it's own set of game that only work on the DSi.|`|KMn7XZGYaa	The Nintendo DS will play all "Nintendo DS Lite" games. They are they exact same thing apart from upgraded brightness, weight and appearance.<br>  All Game Boy Advance games will play in the Nintendo DS and the "Nintendo DS Lite".<br>  The seconds cartridge will allow you to slot them in.<br>  In regards to any good GBA games. I would recommend Breath Of Fire III,<br>  It's a good Final Fantasy 4 style game with alot more detailed people. Made 11 years ago. WOW<br>  still very good graphics for that old game. It has an amazing story line. very long gameplay.<br>  Tactical game - Final Fantasy Tactics of course lol.|`|d1ZWtAFWaa	I am almost 1,000,000% certain that Nintendo DS games will work on either system.

They give u $25 real money just for trying out their casino or u can play fake money. why play fake money if they are giving u the $25 free anyway. The problem is that u cant cash out the $25 unless u had gambled over $700. This means for example u gamble $25 and win = $50 u had gambled $25. YOu gamble $25 again and lost and your back down to $25. this is when u had gambled $50. you do this win and lose many times until u circulated $700+ then u can cash out. Why do they give u free money? By the time u reach the requirements to cash out your already hooked.

In both games you build a house and run your families lifes.  SIMS2 is a more recent release with higher quality graphics.<br>  <br>  The "Deluxe edition" is a combination of all the expansions (add-ons) created for SIMS.  Both games originally sold for $50 and had numerous expansions sold for $20.  The expansions add additional options/items/furniture that can be used while playing SIMS.<br>  <br>  SIMS2 is newer...SIMS deluxe will give you more options for your dollar.  Other then that they are "basically" the same game.

Mit seinen neuen Schulfreunden Crille (Arnel Taci) und Matze (Kai Müller) bricht er in einer Zehlendorfer Villa ein, seinem früheren Zuhause, um mit dem Geld die Gang bezahlen zu k?nnen. Erol, dem Anführer der Gang, ist das nicht genug. Polischka wehrt sich. Der Drogenh?ndler Hamal rettet Polischka. Da ihn Hamal vertrauenswürdig findet, bietet er Polischka einen Job als Drogenkurier an.<br>  <br>  Erst geht es nur um kleinere Mengen, doch dann bekommt er einen gr??eren Auftrag. Bei dieser Drogenlieferung wird Polischka auf dem Rückweg von Erols Gang überrascht, sein Rucksack mitsamt dem Drogengeld (80.000 Euro) landet nach einer Auseinandersetzung auf einer gerade abfahrenden S-Bahn. Damit wird Polischka zum Problem, denn die im Rucksack befindliche Geldb?rse in Verbindung mit dem Geld k?nnte die Polizei auf den Plan rufen.<br>  <br>  Alles, was er zur L?sung des Problems zu tun habe, meint sein Auftraggeber, sei eine ?Geste“: Umringt von seinen reichen ?Vertragspartnern“ bekommt er nachts unter einer Autobahn einen Revolver in einer Tüte überreicht, um Erol, der gefesselt am Boden liegt, oder alternativ sich selber, zu erschie?en.

92a5d180da3a67afa485c8c161fbd739aa	Anyone who is saying that you play it too much is wrong. I would play mine up to 17 hours straight and fall asleep after my halo fests on xbox live and leave it on with my headset attached and everything so it really shouldn'[t be overheating.<br>  <br>  It can however overheat if it's not properly ventilated, don't keep it in a confined area in an entertainment center they get hot inside them and just keep blowing hot air all around. I would always leave mine on the floor away from everything. You're also not suppost to have it near anything eletrical since it gives off heat, so keep it a good distance from anything like tv's, etc. Always plug your xbox into the wall and not a surge protector.<br>  <br>  Can't really think of other things, but do NOT blow a damn fan into your xbox. You'll be blowing dust and particles everywhere inside your xbox and it can cause problems and damage things if your not careful. <br>  <br>  Also are you sure it's overheating or it's just really hot? When my 360(i'm saying that because my xbox never overheated) would overheat it would start to freeze and glitch games(only my screen) and I would have to turn it off for an hour. Does yours do that, or are you only saying it's overheating because it's extremely hot?<br>  <br>  P.S. If you think the dust is a problem, just take a towel and wipe it across the air vents to pick up the dust. I would do that occasionaly but more so because it disgusted me :)|`|78d89fe48b1c53537da667c386e5f7e5aa	well this is obvious move it.

xWA6wuKFaa	A gameshark is a code program that you can use to modify the game in almost anyway you want- gameshark provides codes to do different things, for example "Unlimited Ammo", or "Infinite Health". They also have fun codes, that make your character able to walk through walls, etc. You have to buy the disc, and it usually comes with a memory card to store your codes. You start your system with using the gameshark disc, it loads the codes, and then you load the game. You can get it at almost any video game store or ebay, it runs about $40.

ut2JaiPWaa	Something happened to your sims current positioning on the sims. It may have been moved, deleted, or replaced. This usually happens when you use in game cheats (move_objects on, boolprop testingcheatsenabled true, motherlode) and not when downloading content.  If you did not use an ingame cheat, then this seems to happen very rarely in some sim games and should not happen again for a long time to you. If this happens all the time to you and you have tried leaving the game and entering it again, you must have some sort of modded material. Make sure you have NO mods and this problem won't occur again. <br>  <br>  The quick fix I would suggest for your problem if you have more than one controlable sim living at the lot is by promting the cheat box by hitting control shift and c and typing in move_objects on. Next delete your "malfuntioning" sim. Use your other sim to leave the lot just by going to the park of somthing of the like. Return and your deleted sim should be back to  normal.<br>  <br>  If this sim is your only sim, try promting the cheat box again by hitting shift control and c and type in boolprop testingcheatsenabled true. Shift-click ( this is done by holding down shift and left clicking) on your sims. Find the FORCE ERROR option and click it. A small blue window will pop up in the middle of your screen and press the RESET button. Your sim should be back to normal. <br>  <br>  If your sim is still not working, try exiting the lot without saving or move in another sim to do the first way to solve your problem.|`|N9LQG5u3aa	well well welly well well hmm trygoing to <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamefaqs.com</a> and if u cant find faqs there then if u have disk uninstall and install again if download do the same|`|gVJcmrNcaa	actually something may have blocked the way of the sim.It happened to me its just nothin,and it wasnt the stuff,maybe theres sometimes theres noting actions available....if some sim is about to leave then your about to greet him,it may do it like your sim do.

mOTCr8Pxaa	Fail<br>  <br>  It would seem that you never trained a teram and are relying on a legendary and poorly trained starter to get you through them. I get disgusted by people that only train the starter, poorly I might add, just at the level of the elite 4 get a bunch of low level pokemon and wonder it that's good enough. But you have a legendary. Doesn't matter. You didn't train like you were supposeed to and you will fail.|`|ASL5nrSBaa	its never going to beat the elite four unless  u have alot of revives and alot of luck if u train mighteyena to around lvl 50 then it would be better, some other pokemon u should add to your team are ludicolo, gorbyss, absol|`|wAiVxAKNaa	Your Pokemon are a little low level, but you should be okay. The level 59 Blaziken is higher than any Pokemon in the Elite Four (including the Champion), as well as Rayquaza. It can be done with just two Pokemon. Don't take that for granted though. I'll run you through a few problems you may face.<br>  <br>  - Blaziken will be effective against Sydney's Dark types. However, its fighting moves will have no effect on Phoebe's Ghosts. Rayquaza should be able to take them out, but putting all your reliance on one Pokemon can be a stretch, especially since it could be taking 5 on 1.<br>  <br>  - Blaziken will be useful on Glacia's Ice types, but remember that she also has water types. Two Surf attacks from Walrein could take Blaziken out. Rayquaza is also extremely weak to Ice attacks because it is both Dragon and Flying. It will receive 4x damage from ice!<br>  <br>  - Dragon moves are good against dragon types. Remember that this could hurt you as well with Rayquaza as it is a Dragon type and therefore weak to Dragon attacks. Blaziken will not be useful either as Fire does not do well on Dragons. The fighting aspect of Blaziken won't help either as most of Drake's team have duo Flying natures. <br>  <br>  -  For the Champion, Steel types are weak against fire and fighting but strong against Dragon attacks. If your Rayquaza does not have moves powerful against Steel and Rock, you may be in trouble and could be forced to put all your reliance on Blaziken. This may not be good if you run out of PP or potions.<br>  <br>  Make your Rayquaza as well rounded as possible move-wise and feed it stat boosting vitamins, as well as your Blaziken and you should make it through okay. Bring a lot of revive, full heal, hyper potions, full restore and Elixers to bring back your Power Points (PP).|`|K3ldDxmxaa	add a gardevior and teach it thunder to kill the ice lady. if you get a wynaut or wobbuffet destiny bond is a killer move.a flygon wouldnt hurt either.just dont use rayquaza for ice even if it is level 70.and you should level up your pokemon a bit.please please pick me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fr180hSmaa	Um no. I do not want to be mean but you should at least train all of them to 60 if you want to win. Do not forget the champion is water so you Bazeking will take heavy damage. You will go far with Rayquazza but the ice lady will kill you. Please train at minimum you Blazking and Rayquazza.|`|IPMItFlMaa	good for the two high level but the others well can be a bit hard because the elite for has level 45 and higher. good luck|`|fGaa8yc9aa	You will win if your rayquaza knows outrage and thunder. Get Maril a little stonger along with Mightyena, Castform, and Kecleon and you'll do just fine. Hope that answered your question.

XX0ac9iRaa	I found it very fun and charming, with a great sense of humour. There isn't too much replay value (the expansion pack is not really worth it) but the game is long enough and good enough on its own to make up for that.<br>  <br>  Most people would describe Fable II as an RPG, but an action RPG would be more accurate. I think it is an RPG for people who have never played one before- it's very easy to get into and understand. The property and family aspects of the game are fun additions too (you can buy houses and get married with children in the game), and the storyline is pretty deep for such a simple game. Also there's a cute dog involved. What else could you want?|`|wAiVxAKNaa	It would take me ages to tell you how much I love Fable 2. :) Bascially it's an RPG game set in medieval times and you go around trying to defeat a man named Lucien who is planning on world domination... He also killed your sister. The only disappointing aspects are the lack of customization of characters and the short length of the storyline, which I completed in less than a day.<br>  <br>  Other than that it is a great game and if you don't rush through it you'll love it.|`|fCiqZsE0aa	ITS AWESOME!<br>  But its very short (the mainstory)<br>  Its mixes everytipes of games.<br>  You can decide to be good or bad, be dedicated to your family or to your job and adventure.<br>  Its all based in the decisions you make.<br>  Its totally worth the money!<br>  Basically in fable 2 you create your own world and make your own game|`|Dey3kiYcaa	Its the best game ive ever played! Your given so much choice in how to play the char like whether to be good or evil and your char changes accordingly and its a mixture of good old fashion killing with good story line, graphics and adventure!<br>  <br>  I truly recomend it!|`|Pg0af8mcaa	Fable 2 is a very good game. have you ever played games like final fantasy where you walk around and go into stores its like real life you guide him through life its actually very fun all though it do not sound great it is good game!|`|AFObCLvZaa	Its good, but its not as good as the Original the combat is quite easy but some of it is just confusing, but over all good game.|`|ViwewkTiaa	Yes, but it gets quite boring once you have completed it. There is an expansion pack however.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Fable 2 is an RPG game. It allows you to customize your hero in a number of ways and you go about your business doing quests etc.<br>  <br>  In my opinion Fable 2 was a big disappointment compared to Fable 1. The spell system is horrible, your hero looks ugly, and combat isn't all that nice.|`|gCtJkjpFaa	I own a copy of Fable 2 and I can DEFINETLY guarantee it. It's basically a Single Player RPG filled with very interesting quests and minigames.<br>  <br>  I have been playing the main storyline for a while, but have now stopped to enjoy the rest of the game. Most of the mini-games should be classed as their own games, because they are pretty awesome. :)<br>  <br>  You wont find this game too easy nor hard. The interface is fairly easy to use and the sountrack is absolutely beautiful...one of the best RPG's out there for the 360.|`|d5840173c2f9293f7f5fa3f72aa85d41aa	I loved it, you have an option to make your character good or evil.  Mine was evil she even had horns.  The missions are fun to figure out.  The towns are fun.  Great game.  Never played online though.|`|a5gAwH4Laa	ive only played the 1st one on the original xbox and really liked it,wont be playing the second one though because im a mighty ps3 owner now, poop poop|`|FbcJq0ioaa	I own this game and it's the best game I've ever played in my entire life. It's an Role-Playing game or like some people call it RPG.

d9b44e285aebf827112c3e65f6c24b7aaa	There is no need to take the game out of the console.|`|cpyUSp2Uaa	Does it matter?|`|1467a1b2fe1b917813ec656f859fdabbaa	ummm no....what you do is quit the game, which will take you to the dashboard, and THEN eject the game and turn off your Xbox.|`|9YnHV3h1aa	You can't take out a disk without turning on the xbox, so you have to do it before you turn it off. But if what you mean is do you have to go to the xbox dashboard before you take out the disk the answer is that it doesn't matter when you take out the disk as long as you don't do it when the game says "Don't eject disk or power off" like when it's saving or something like that.|`|m3TNrVVVaa	Turning off the console before removing the disk helps prevent damages that could occur to the disk. Since the system is still reading the disk, it could damage the disk or the lens if you remove it while on.<br>  <br>  Turning off is the best bet to be safe. =)
48c21cf4024a52e6bcf2e57ad70d6574aa	Are you supposed to go somewhere once you get all the passports, if so do that. Usually if you go to that place, the game should continue.
kMymyn03aa	You should check the URL on the game that you want if it is on a different website. Copy and paste it into an area of your website.
mog61Nzeaa	this applies for maple global.<br>  try downloading the manual patch from the official website and patching it using that.<br>  if that doesnt work try downloading the new version of the game which is around 600+mb.<br>  still not working? then i suggest uninstalling EVERYTHING from your computer then installing then new version of the game|`|N9LQG5u3aa	I had the same problem! reinstall maplestory (its OK the computer Will keep your file safe) then see if it works if it doesn't reinstall again|`|H0mkEn1Xaa	You can either download the patch on the website or re-install MapleStory.
9YnHV3h1aa	Your gamertag is your gamer profile on your 360. To join Xbox Live, you have to go to the xbox live tab (in the xbox dashboard) and there should be an option there to "Join Xbox Live" Just click on that and the rest is self-explanatory.|`|BlKekFNkaa	It's much easier doing it threw the dashboard on the Xbox 360.

He feels so guilty of her death that he pretty much puts it on himself to watch out for the females in the party. <br>   i guess for comparisions it's gotta be cloud.

If not, you could whip stitch sew-in Velcro to cover the spot.<br>  <br>  Use sew-in Velcro, but instead of sewing, use Fabri-Tac fabric glue.  Let it thoroughly dry before closing and opening the Velcro.<br>  <br>  You could open a seam in the lining and use a small magnetic snap.  The area for the snap needs to be reinforced with a small piece of stabilizer.<br>  <br>  There are also large sew-snaps, but you may have the same problem as with sew-in Velcro.<br>  <br>  Last resort - take it apart and put in a new lining.|`|EgAO49w9aa	put bag in freezer for ten mins before you put velcro on

dQBAqXCPaa	First I'm going to tell you about the browser based MMORPGs, then I'll mention somewhere you can see the downloadable.<br>  To play games in flash, there are Dragon Fable and Adventure Quest (In both you have to pay to have full access to the game, and notice that Dragon Fable is still under construction and that it's hard for non-members to login into AQ). There are also those community based flash games (that some people consider to be MMORPGs) that are becoming really popular: Gaia Online (that I already played and that is really cool), ClubPenguin, PuzzlePirates, and i think that Habbo goes the same way; in all of this games you create an avatar and play games like fishing to get money and personalize those avatars.<br>  There’s also the pure browser based ones: Tibia is a fairly popular game, BiteFight and Knightfight are OK. Travian is a strategy MMOG, also pretty good. There’s also pokemon crater (but it has a lots of publicity) and, my personal favorite, FallenSword (it's interface is much like pokemoncrater, but it's a dungeon crawler. It also doesn’t have lots of publicity like pokemon crater, and has a guild system that stimulate interaction and stamina restrictions that allow players that don't have much time to remain competitive, not to mention the lottery and the auction system).<br>  The downloadable... well, i think it's harder to speak about them. I'll also give you a link for the "List of free MMORPGs" on wikipedia, where you can see the downloadable games out there (in this list you can read about other browser based MMORPGs as well). Take a look at the websites and check the screenshots, maybe you'll find some that interest you. My favorites are MapleStory, Anarchy Online, Monsters and Me, Trickster Online (really good, you should consider this), Flyff and Silk Road. Seems like Rappelz is also pretty good.<br>  There are also some really good free downloadable MMORPGs coming out: Sword of the new world (a.k.a. Granado Espada, where you can control up to three characters at once - but you'll have to pay so that you can get over a certain level) and the global version of Lunia (it's still on closed beta, but will soon come out - keep an eye on it).<br>  See you.|`|OJVIfRXcaa	www.runescape.com|`|9sozGxC5aa	visit www.igg.com|`|N9LQG5u3aa	1.maplestory 2.Flyff 3.(blank) 4 (STILL BLANK)|`|ZP15S5s9aa	Check and see if Guild Wars still free..

However, it's boring, like RuneScape a little, except the only thing you can do is fight, and fight, and...fight.  However, RuneScape, with worse graphics, has a variety of skills to train, and pretty nice quests.  Flyff has quests too, but they are to collect Monster Drops, or to kill monsters...fight.  <br>  <br>  I personally suggest RuneScape, because it does not require download, and is less boring.  However, there are many players that scam/cheat their way through the game, and they are the only people that ruin it.|`|khWUQnEdaa	GRAAL ONLINE.|`|FyWvDqYraa	niether|`|AA10691287	that depends. runescape can b mage ranger n warrior at the same time. flyff only focus on 1 of them plus an xtra assist. for me i would prefer flyff cause the graphic really matters alot.
AA11746952	yup.<br>  at least in flyff, there are less bullies and the quests are easier.<br>  runescape is a gme that makes it hard for players to wor together.<br>  flyff is more concentrated on being friends with players, but you can go solo if you want.|`|w7Ad3Sdzaa	wuts the website for flyff? oh nvm i got itbut idk it all in japanese or somethin..|`|AA10691287	runescape lets u to become a mix of melee, range n mage. flyff specifies on 1.<br>  flyff would still b better cause of graphics, system like cannot att any monster other player att unless in a party. also the assist play an important part in flyff, so generally flyff is better

However I suggest that you don't use rare candies. You may level up quickly however there is a downside. Your pokemon will be weaker than other pokemon of the same level. For example, a level 100 rare candied mewtwo can be easily defeated by a level 70 hand raised charizard. I have tried leveling up using rare candies and all the pokemon I have leveled up using this process ended up in disaster.|`|1e4ee71285ba38755d22bd5b9881768faa	try action replay , it is much more dependable|`|613d6383b04638a7d7c50ef35b159643aa	Certain pokemon (I think drifbloom or something like that) have abilities that allow them to pick up items.

AA10039821	i also love bowling. i bowl on a league and on my high school team. but you have it all wrong. strikes are great, but spares matter so much more. you have to learn how make them because you get more oppertunities to pick up spares then yu do to get strikes... i bet you didn't get that 300 game either. my high game is 217, but i am always trying to improve. oh and 2 games aren't so bad to bowl... try 6 in a competition setting, stressful, hard and long will sum that up|`|2b8d6ee0d6f1a82879f4c267cf84e4e3aa	Thats Cool.My high game is a 204.I've been bowling for 9 years I'm 12 now.When I go bowling in a league we bowl 3 games so the highest series you can bowl is a 900.Yes 12 strike sin a row is a 300 game which my cousin bowls a lot.How long have you been bowling if you can get a 300 I'll give you a star...:-)|`|AA10274024	Bowling is a lot of fun, that's for sure.

You will not get anything but a newbie pack for signing up through that link (which is the same as what you would get using any link, even simply going to the Neopets homepage and just creating an account yourself!). You will most assuredly NOT get 100,000np for signing up with the link posted above. <br>  <br>  Wow, Jerry, (Neopets username: green4mike), I would expect much more for a 6 year old account. I would expect someone who would respect Neo and it's players enough not to try to pull off some idiotic lie like this one. <br>  <br>  Of course, I'd expect a 6 year account to show a darn sight more than what your's shows, but anyway...<br>  <br>  If anyone out there wants to sign up for Neopets, just go to the Neopets homepage and create an account. There's no reason to give a person who is going to try to attempt to use lies in order to enrich themselves any satisfaction. <br>  <br>  (Also notice that I'm not giving out a referral link using my account?

dQBAqXCPaa	There are a few browser based online MMORPGs.<br>  First, the flash based ones: they’re Adventure Quest (but you have to pay to have full access to the game) and Dragon Fable (the game is under construction, but is fairly entertaining).<br>  There’s also the pure browser based ones: Tibia is a fairly popular game, BiteFight and Knightfight are ok. Travian is a strategy MMOG, also pretty good. There’s also pokemon crater (but it has a lots of publicity) and, my personal favorite, FallenSword (it’s much like pokemoncrater, only that it doesn’t have lots of publicity, and has a guild system that stimulate interaction, not to mention the lottery and the auction system).<br>  See you.|`|4242ab4786b562aa86658f4bb7e2b79baa	yeah here are a coule i play: <br>  mythwar (www.mythwaronline.com)<br>  silkroad (www.silkroadonline.net)<br>  hero (www.heroonline.com)<br>  <br>  the only problem is with the hero     , b/c ive tried creating a profile, and each time i try, it keeps saying permission denied. dont know why, it just does. if you figure a way to get in let me know.|`|AA11280056	Runescape?

See the link below, it's FallenSword.

kxvMw1r5aa	Technically the hook & ladder isn't an official play but i think its an Ace formation that allows the proper set up to run it.  But make sure you put a new hot route on the right tight end otherwise he will draw any safetys that might have otherwise been fooled into the action not allowing your wr the space he need to go the distance.

My modem receives the connection (cable modem), which transfers it to my router, which then divides it among my computer and my xbox.

K7HqBGcyaa	Lock On Rockets:<br>  To lock on with rockets, target a person, vehicle, etc., then hold R until it says that it is locked. The red reticle will follow the item. Release R to fire. Additionally, while using a rocket launcher, you can lock-on to the following items: turrets, vehicles, and the Phantom's plasma cannons (Covenant Dropship's turrets). To lock-on to those objects, aim your cross-hairs at the object. By doing this, your rocket launcher's cross-hairs should have four red squares on the corners. Then, hold Fire so that the rocket launcher will fully lock-on to the object. While this happens, the lock-on system of the rocket launcher should make a few repetitive beeping sounds. After the beeping sounds have ended, the cross-hairs should be completely red and ready to fire. Release Fire and your spiraling heat-seeking rocket launcher missile will go to the target.<br>  <br>  Crouch jump<br>  1st you crouch then at the right moment of the crouch you jump(this may be done at the same time jump and crouch) you may not see much of a diffence to the the normal jump but you jump a bit higher.<br>  <br>  hoped that helped|`|ENflX5Qdaa	It's really easy you just zoom in hold down the right trigger until it is look  like its locked on.( you can tell because it will stop change and just spin around ) Then you let go but when you lock in make sure the aimer appears red so you know it will lock if its not your to far away .<br>  <br>  P.S.

But the best way to make money off it, would be to package every bit of games and accessories that you have along with the Gamecube--it will make people think they are getting a better deal. Rule of thumb, Start with $25 for the system and add $3-$5 per game or accessory depending on how much you have to add on.

9YnHV3h1aa	I used this when I still had a member's account:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/fast_free_laws.html" rel="nofollow">http://runescape.salmoneus.net/fast_free...</a><br>  <br>  It takes a little patience but it works great and you can earn a lot of money through this.|`|R032KA2paa	Free items:<br>  -----------<br>  When you do the tutorial at the beginning, keep talking to the people that give you things. <br>  For example, with the baker that gives you water and flour, bake the bread then talk to him <br>  again. He should give you more supplies.<br>  <br>  Best Rune weapon:<br>  -----------------<br>  If you just get to level 40 Attack and are looking for a Rune weapon, the Rune Scimitar is <br>  recommended over the R2H. The scimitar attacks faster, therefore dealing more damage and <br>  killing opponents faster.<br>  <br>  Easy money:<br>  -----------<br>  If you are a member, get to 5 Herblore. Create as many Antipoison potions as possible. Then, <br>  sell them to the general store. You will get 114 gp for each potion.<br>  Do the quest that allows you to mine Essences. Mine as many as desired and sell them for 45 gp <br>  each.<br>  Get your Fishing up to 40 then fish Lobsters. Get high combat (over level 50 recommended) and <br>  good armor (Adamite+ recommended), then go in the volcano on Karamja Island and kill Lessers. <br>  They drop lots of money, and sometimes Rune Med Helement. Sell the Rune Meds for 10,000 gp each. <br>  Get to Combat level over 50, Magic 55, then get 60 gp, food (swordfish or lobsters), good armor <br>  and weapon (Adamite or Rune - recommended). Go to Karajama's Lesser Demons Pits and kill them <br>  until you get a few Rune Mediums if possible. Then, get five Fire Runes and one Nature Rune for <br>  every Rune Medium you get. Use High Alchemy on them. You will get 11,000 gp for every one you <br>  use it on. Alternately, you can get 55 Magic and 10,000 and buy one Rune Medium. Use High Alchemy <br>  on it and get 11,000 and buy another until you run out of Runes to make a 1,000 gp profit for each <br>  one. If you are a member, go to the Gnome stronghold and pick Flax. Make them into bowstring, <br>  then sell them for 100 gp each. <br>  Note: This trick is only for members. Get your Woodcutting level to at least 45 (level 50 is <br>  recommended). Go to Seers Village (on the other side of Ice Mountain/Member's Land) and chop <br>  down maple trees. These trees are difficult to chop down, but if you get over 500 maple logs, <br>  they will sell for a total of 55,000 gp (100 gp to 150 gp each). Once you are at level 60 <br>  Woodcutting, you can chop down Yews, which sell up to 300 gp each. Then, at level 75 Woodcutting, <br>  you can chop down Magic Trees and sell their logs for anywhere from 500 gp to 1500 gp. A high <br>  Woodcutting level is very important to earn money when you are a member. <br>  <br>  To get money, fight Moss Giants. They drop objects such as Black Squares, Magic Staffs, Runes, <br>  Uncut Gems, and 3 to 300 GP. They drop Big Bones, which can be used for Prayer. Moss Giants in <br>  free play mode can be found on Crandor Island and Varrok Sewers.<br>  Get your Mining level up to 40. Go to the mine near Rimmington. Mine Gold Ore until your pack <br>  gets full. Then, go to the general store in Rimmington. Sell the Gold Ores there. 7 Gold Ores are <br>  worth more than 300 gp. Note: Watch out of the Rock Golem; it appears sometimes when you are mining.<br>  <br>  Mine lots of ore until you are at level 15 Mining. Then, use the furnace until you are at level 34. <br>  Next, mine Iron and bank them until you have 1000 Ores, then sell all of them to the armor seller <br>  in Varrock for about 250 gp each. You should have about 130,000 coins, because iron only works <br>  when making bars 50% of the time. <br>  <br>  Get to level 60 Wood Cutting and sell Yews for no lower than 260 GP.<br>  Get to over level 60 in mining. Go in the mining guild, then mine Coal and Mithril ores. Sell <br>  Coal for 150 gp each and the Mithril ores for 500 gp each. Alternately, if you have over level 50 <br>  smithing, make them into Mithril Bars, and sell them for 1,000 gp each. <br>  Get a brass key and go to Barbarian Village. Go east from there, and when you reach the bridge <br>  turn left. You will see a shack. Use your brass key on the door and climb down the ladder. Kill <br>  the giants there, collect the items that they drop, (3 to 300 gp, Big Bones, Iron Full Helm, <br>  Iron Kite, etc.), and keep fighting until you run out of space. Then, sell the Big Bones for <br>  200 gp each and sell the iron items at the shop.<br>  First, mine and smelt iron until you have sixteen bars. Then, go to Varrock and smith them <br>  into three iron plate bodies and one iron longsword. Sell the iron plate bodies to Horvic in <br>  Varrock and the iron longsword to the shopkeepers at the sword shop (which is also in Varrock). <br>  You should now have 1002 gold.<br>  Battle Lesser Demons in Karamaja. The recommended food is tuna, but salmon works. You should <br>  be at least level 48. Another easy way to make money is to make your inventory able to hold 20 <br>  bananas. Talk to the person inside the hut and ask for a job. If you face the hut's door, the <br>  crate should be on the left side. You only need to put ten in at one time. You can make 30 gp <br>  every time you fill the crate and talk to the plantation manager. After you talk, wait for a few <br>  seconds. He will ask you to fill the crate again. <br>  Mine Ess after completing the Rune Mystery quest. <br>  Then, make runes. Sell them at a magic shop. Repeat this process as desired.|`|YBH4Or4zaa	There are no cheats for runescape, you have to do it all yourself, sorry. Personally, I like mining as the best way to make money, especially if you improve your smithing level at the same time. Make a few loads of ores from somewhere close to a bank, smelt them somewhere close to a bank, smith them somewhere close to a bank. <br>  Once again, this is personal, I mine coal in the mining guild, and before i was in that, the dwarven mines, take it to falador to dump in the bank. But its often busy there, if worst comes to worst, there are some mines in wildy that might be better. Then, in fally I smelt the bars, and I often smith them there, if you've done dorics anvil quest, otherwise in varroc theres an anvil just outside a bank :)<br>  all you have to do to make money from all this is either sell the armour you make, to people or the general store, and teh more you do it, the better you get, the better your items, the more money you make :P personally, I now have several million gp, along with full rune (g) plate, but to get that much has taken a while. If you need any more advice, visit the website i'll source, it has everything you need, you just have to know what to look for :)<br>  The site doesn't just have mining tips, but everything, btw.|`|hx6Gfv6Faa	Kill cows, get around 500-1,000 (1k) Cow Hides, take them into World 1 or 3, sell them at the highest price you can. Buy more at the lowest price you can instead of killing. Then, sell at the highest price you can, repeat as many times as necessary.
cSwXkdcvaa	The memory card only comes if u buy it in a bundle but not with just the core system. As for the best games, for me atleast (it depends mostly on what u like), are (in no particular order):<br>  Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops<br>  GTA: liberty city stories<br>  Daxter<br>  Burnout Legends<br>  Final Fantasy tactics: The war of Lions (The one coming out in october)<br>  ETC.<br>  You can check this link out for the best rated games for the PSP: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/games.html?type=top_rated&platform=1024&mode=all&sort=score&dlx_type=all&date_filter=all&sortdir=asc" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/games.html?type=...</a><br>  <br>  As for best movies it depends on what u like but I havent bought many movies for my PSP.|`|xeQVYE2faa	yes psp comes with a memory card and I recomend the game inccoent life and movies get boring on psp so don't recomend any.|`|fKAaGiXUaa	PSP huh? SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... You should buy Final Fantasy VII Advent Children only if you like Final Fantasy the CGI is great|`|jH7xm2peaa	.It depends on what kind of games you are into. Marvel Ultimate Alliance is good to start with. There are now games for all genres. Some PSP systems come with a memory stick if you buy a value pack or a bundle pack. There is a core unit that is sold without the memory stick. It is a "Pro duo" memory stick(very small) don't lose it in the packing. You won't be able to do much with out it. They are sold separately.|`|m9JJJQ7Yaa	If you got the psp in a bundle pack, it probally came with a 32mb memory card which kinda sucks but is good if your using it solely for games.  I have a 2gb memory card and it was like 20 buck on ebay and i have movies and tons of songs on it.  instead of buying the umd movies for the psp which are limited in movies, i use a dvd to psp program that alows me to put my dvd's on my psps but that is only useful if you have atleast a 1gb mem card.  I suggest 2gb or 4gb on ebay.  Im a Tony Hawk Pro Skater Freak So i got thp8 but theres pleanty of games for every catagory such as stratagy, rpg etc<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pqdvd.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pqdvd.com/</a> is for the dvd program, buying just the umd videos is a waste of money lolz <br>  <br>  Good luck, any questions just holler

9YnHV3h1aa	It is because you got him from a trade and with the other pokemon that do obey you, You've probably just gotten lucky. sooner or later (unless you get the next badge), they will disobey you. So to answer your question, there's nothing wrong with Turtwig. Just don't use him unless you have to and get the next badge then he should start listening.|`|3Yi4NSPLaa	on another pokemon game if you dont have enough badges they dont respect you so they wont listen to you might be the same on that one|`|AA11991193	You need badges to make pokemon obey you. Sooner or later, those pokemon will start disobeying you. I think if you get the 3rd or 4th badge, pokemon above 30 will obey you.|`|U0YtAfK6aa	maybe it's because of that, there's a slight chance of obeying, but somethimes, if it's the pokemon you use the most then it might become obnoxious, also it might be due to it's nature, hope this helps

3SQ5RNIPaa	guarda k costa tra i 30 e i 40 euro..ma ti consiglio di scaricarlo da emule...e x giocare a questa espansione devi avere installato the sims 2 normale|`|r8Ec3yyjaa	Prima di tutto devi avere il gioco base The sims 2 poi puoi mettere le espansioni che vuoi tipo Pets. Se vuoi il gioco originale (meglio) ci sono due strada cioè ho acquisti in negozio (i costi dei giochi vanno dai 35 ai 40 €) oppure acquisti su Ebay le versioni originali e lì dipende l'offerta che trovi in media si va dai 18 ai 24 €. Se vuoi il gioco tarocco vai su emule oppure altro programma peer to peer e scarichi ma non sempre funzionano.|`|g9DYh9wHaa	allora se lo vuoi gratis lo scarichi da emule... se lo vuoi originale tu vai con 100 euro e vai sul sicuro.<br>  io l'ho scaricato perchè tanto nn ci gioco quasi mai e spendere tanti soldi nn mi va<br>  comunque per giocarci devi avere the sims 2<br>  tizzy io quando devo comprare qualcosa che nn so quanto costa mi porto dietro sempre qualche soldo in più per sicurezza|`|lPyg79zFaa	bobobobobobegegegegegegegegegebooooooooo...|`|tep1Pkd2aa	Beh, io ero indecisa tra pets e season e alla fine il mese scorso ho comprato pets...cmq non dar retta agli altri...il gioco lo ho comprato in un game shop e l'ho pagato 29,90€...poi ho visto anche nei centri commerciali e costava sempre lo stesso...però il gioco ( è un' espansione ) richiede che sia installata la base...quella io l'ho comprata 2 anni fa e costava 59,90€...però adesso credo che possa costare anche 40-50€....Se proprio non hai soldi da buttare scaricati tutto da emule....è difficile trovare i file giusti senza virus o altro però ti assicuro che è un gioco davvero bello e tutti i soldi spesi sono spesi bene!!!<br>  Ciao e buon divertimento!!!|`|yBoHKCe0aa	100 euro|`|lZd9zhwqaa	dovresti prima comprare the sims 2 ke costa circa 50 euro xkè the sims pets è un' espansione e dovrebbe costare 15-20 euro. io ce l' ho x il nintendo ds e te lo consiglio!!|`|yD9jKjmfaa	cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee??<br>  100 euro?????????<br>  ma no,di meno..<br>  ora, dato che è uscito da 1 po di tempo lo trovi anche a 40 €..<br>  se non hai the sims 2 devi comprare  anche quello..<br>  ti verrebbero tt e 2 un settantina di euro!!<br>  ciao!!sxo daverti aiutato!!

N9LQG5u3aa	Runescape Pking<br>  <br>  To start off, you may be wondering - what is Runescape Pking? Simple. PKing stands for Player Killing. This means that you go out into the wilderness, and fight with another player of Runescape. A lot of Runescape PKers focus on one or two stats so that they remain a fairly low level player but pack a punch that is much larger than the average player their level. But be warned, other Runescape players are more of a challenge than a mindless monster. An actual player can heal themselves with food, or prayer to defend themselves, and can fight back with their own cunning strategies. The best area for PKing is North of Varrock, preferably North of the dungeon area.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.runescape-money.eu" rel="nofollow">http://www.runescape-money.eu</a><br>  <a href="http://www.runescape-money.eu/gold-items..." rel="nofollow">http://www.runescape-money.eu/gold-items...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.runescape-money.eu/gold-items..." rel="nofollow">http://www.runescape-money.eu/gold-items...</a>
