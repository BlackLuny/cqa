20090220220205AAbYHkR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	At what age would you let your daughter date (more details if you want to read)?	I have a 13 yr old (fourteen in about a month), this boy (13, 14 in a few weeks) asked her to be his girlfriend and she said yes (she has liked this guy since the 6th grade).  My thing is I told her that she couldn't date until 16, however she has broken the rule before (in elementary school... which was pretty much "will you go out with me" .."ok"... and they both forgot about it in a few days.      this one... she's on cloud nine... and I hate to say it but I think he's a neat kid... kinda geeky and nice      should I enforce the 16 years rule or let her "date" him?  He would only see her at school and adult supervised "dates" and rarely would these "dates" not be without mutual friend(s).      am i being soft to lean towards her dating so early?   should I hold my ground?
20090220220329AAYlQa0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Anybody else adore their baby so much that they don't want ?	anyone else but yourself or your spouse to take care of them, and you want to hold them or hug them all the time? i think i am just severly attached to my 18 month old baby girl. i am a stay at home mommy and a first time mommy. i don't like to have anyone babysit for me and my mother in law can't stand it because she says that she don't get to spend enough time with her. but, whenever i do take her over there to her house, she tries to give my baby soda and junk food all the time and it really makes me angry. when i say something to her about it she just says that it won't hurt it and get over it. then, if i am not around she gives her the junk food or sodas. i told her i don't want my baby girl to have that crap this young plus, i don't feel like my daughter is safe anywhere without me, and if i am away from her for more than a few minutes, i start worrying about how she's doing without me. am i nuts or normal? i know what my baby girl wants when she wants it but nobody else does not even her daddy, cause i am around her more than anybody else. is it wrong? should i let her go to church and be in daycare with my sister in law or go to playgroups or not? mom in law wants to take her to church and put her in the daycare/playroom there, but i don't know what the purpose would be at her age cause she won't know what's going on yet. what do you think?

20090220220858AA1wM3x	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What cycle day are you on today?	Hey ladies, just wondering what CD you guys are on. I'm on CD 11 and just finished Clomid 150 mg.  I normally have a 31 day period with Clomid and ovulate on CD 17-18. What about you guys?
20090220220831AAvPZkN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Does this sound like a food allergy in a toddler?	My 18 month old has been going through a rough patch with some stomach issues.  She has constipation on and off for a few months.  Just lately it has been getting worse.  My older child suffered from severe constipation and was given a Rx for Peg 3350 which does wonders for that.  I brought up the constipation with our Dr and she said to give the Rx to the younger one in very small amounts to help.        Now we have had a run of constipation and then explosive diarrhoea, for a couple of days, both of which have a very foul smell.  Then today after everything seemed to settle down she seemed fine, a little cranky, but she didn't nap well.  She was fine through dinner and we even went to my aunts after, she was doing fine and then she suddenly started to vomit.  I'm hoping this is just the flu, but with the constipation mixed in I'm wondering if it could be a food allergy or something else?  Does anyone have any ideas?

20090220221002AAnDsKE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby constipation- tmi warning?	Is it all right for my baby's stool to be solid turds?  He is almost 5 months old.      For a month now, he has started having less frequent poops.  He used to have them every other day, and they were soft and mushy.  Lately, they have come generally every 3-4 days.  He works for a day or two on them, turning red, but not producing a poop.  Then finally, he will produce a turd...a REALLY HARD TURD.  It varies in size but usually is fairly large, about the size of his old slops.  Today, he produced two large turds, but it was the fourth day after his last poop!      At his four month checkup, the doc said not to worry unless he was screaming in pain or he stopped eating.  Once or twice I have felt an inkling that he was so uncomfortable his eating slowed, but it didn't stop.      He's been on the same formula he's been on since his second week of life.  He doesn't take any solid food.  He used to get a little breastmilk, but my very meager supply has all but dried up.      Is this normal, and any ideas for how to approach it?  I am not going to start him on solid food yet.

I have noticed lately that I think I pay more attention to him then the others. There ages are 12,9, and 2.5.

I do love ALL my children - so please no harsh comments. I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same way.
20090220221136AASOlGx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant CM question TMI inside?	What is your cm supposed to be like when you are pregnant?   Is it like before your period?   What does the cervix feel like when pregnant?      I am 12 days past ovulation with my period due around the 26th Feb and I just felt my cervix for the first time, it was soft and felt kinda close to the opening (not too close lol) I had some mucus that was like thick white almost sticky lumps and I wasn't sure if it was normal just before your period.    I also have been having a few symptoms, not looking into it too much but hopeful :o) My breasts today have felt like someone beat me with a bat, mostly around the breasts and underarms, also when I push lightly on them they hurt....they do usually hurt before my period but it's usually just when I push on them and they start to hurt right after ovulation until I get my period. This month they only just started hurting yesterday and are very bad today.   I also have been getting waves of nausea and metallic taste in my mouth for the past few days...anyone shed some light?

20090220180751AAFEuAr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does it make me a bad mom if...?	For example:  I called the DR's office this morning to make a last minute appt before the weekend- I was concerned my son had an ear infection and I figured better to just get it checked out rather than wait.  He's almost 11 months old.      I took the only time they had available - 10:15am.  My son had not had cereal yet this morning.  This meant that if everything went smooth and I moved fast, he'd have time for cereal before we left- BUT, if he was upset/cranky/we ran into a bump, he would NOT have time for cereal before we left.        Our family is temporarily staying at my mom's house until we figure out our next moving adventure.  Naturally, my mom thinks she ALSO my son's mother- which I knew couldn't be avoided when we found out we would be staying here for awhile.  I told her I was taking him in to get checked out- and her main concern was that he get cereal.  Normally, she's happily pitch in and feed him cereal while I got dressed.  (I don't EXPECT it from her- she likes doing it).  This morning she was also on a crunched schedule.  My #1 priority was getting out the door to the DR's so not to miss the appointment.  She made it sound like I was an evil, terrible mother if my son didn't get cereal before we went- like I was depriving him.  Keep in mind here- he got a bottle and was NOT starving by any means.  He probably would have cared less about the cereal.     Normally, he gets cereal each morning.  I did not think it was the end of the world if he didn't get cereal this morning due to the circumstances- he's not 1 yet and gets his scheduled bottles!!      All said and done, things went smoothly and he got his cereal BEFORE we left, without the help of grandma.      However, if he had NOT gotten his cereal this morning for said reasoning, would that make me an irresponsible mom like MY mom is making me feel like??

Okay, so, today at lunch, I was sitting at the table in front of my guy-friend, and my boyfriend just came out of nowhere with his other friend and started talking to my guy-friend. And my boyfriend didn't even say hi to me, and how can he possibly not see me, I was sitting right in front of the guy he was talking to.      I'll probably text him later on tonight, should I bring it up in the conversation or just let it go?      And do you have any ideas on why he wouldn't wanna say hi to me? Or do you think he really didn't see me?      And BTW, he's been walking past me a lot during school and not saying hi or even waving, but after school, he wants to get all cuddly with me and all, and hold hands.       Thanks for answering!

20090220175906AA0T56k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Would you rather sleep in your car or in a windowless guest house without a bathroom?	Lets say that your parents tell you if you come home late even on weekends you must sleep in your car. They will allow you to put a cott in a windowless guest house that has no restroom inside the guest house.       The oneroom guest house would be heated and would keep out wind and rain.      What would you choose?      Lets say you couldn't afford a hotel?         Your car has a back seat that is very comfortable.      The oneroom guest house has a solid door with a lock.         The cott in the guest house would actually be a single mattress.      Since you would use the guest house your mother would allow you to decorate and paint the inside of the guest house.      For example your mom would allow you to paint the inside of the door and the walls.       Unfortunatley you wouldn't be able to put windows inside.         Would you be afraid to close the door while you would be inside the one room windowless guest house?
20090220175130AATPLnE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My Birth Videos and Upcoming siblings birth?	I am a 15 year old male and i found my birth video the other day. I have watched birth on youtube before and i find it very interesting and i want to be a delivery room nurse so i can witness this miracle and help women out. Do you think that i should just watch this video or should i ask because i dont want it to do aquard for my mom. Plus i want to watch it before my mom has her child that she is pregnant with now and she has asked me if i wanted to witness the birth. i said yea and wanted to know if i should watch this to know what to expect with this birth? Also i wanted to know what i should be able to watch during the birth if you think that my mom would mind if i saw that baby actually being born? I also wanted to know if it would be possible to hold her leg when she pushed to help her out? This is not fake for you that said that it was last time no rude responces.      Correction: i just saw my younger brother video with y mom today because i found that too and she said that it was ok but for some reason she wanted to show me that one first. That was her 5th child about 3 years ago. She said that mine was a little different because it was her first and it was the longest and most painful. The video was mostly a camera on a tri-pod showing the action and it was like 2 hours of pushing i found it very interesting
20090220174410AANbXCc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do i have the right to be upsed with my boyfriend? 34 weeks pregnant..?	he lost his job 3 weeks ago and has only applied for 1 job so far. i don't even really believe that he has applied for this job. he applied for unemployment i know that for sure but he didn't do it till after 2 weeks of being job less.      i am 34 weeks pregnant and really stressed out because all he wants to do is go to his friends house and stay the night there, or stay there till 11pm and then come home   we live with my parents because of the job situation, and because were a pretty young couple to begin with.      idk i just get really upset when he wants to hang out with his friends all day and i am at work from 8am to 6 pm!   all they do is smoke pot and play video games. i told him that he cant hang out with them after the baby comes and he said okay      his excuse is that he is hanging out as much as he can before the baby comes because he cant after.. what can i say to him to make him understand he needs to be home?
20090220174734AAcEf7L	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Is Daja-Belle a silly name for a baby girl?	I love the way it sounds but i think she might be teased for how unusual it is.....      it means 'already beautiful' and i think it makes sense because its important for a girl to know she's already beautiful without all the cosmetics and without the fashionable clothes, and she doesnt need people telling her she's beautiful.      what do u think of the name?      BTW it can also be the variant: Deja-Belle.. if you prefer?
20090220175456AAO8Gi9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why the heck would she do this?	My good friend, is great. She's funny, nice, and honest.   Anyway, well, she has one problem.   Jealousy issues.      She had a boyfriend for a long time, and it lasted so long and they were obsessed with each other. Then she broke up with him STUPIDLY because she wanted to stir things up. Then he got mad, said he didn't like her anymore. She wouldn't let him talk to other girls while they were going out either. Her ex-boyfriend was my friend too, btw.   Anyway, then she was like I want him back!   Then she got him back.   Then they broke up. and he went out with another girl...and kissed her. She got sooo mad. thenn he broke up with the other girl for my friend.   Then together.   Then broke up because my friend went out with another guy because he asked her out. Then they broke up within 3 DAYS.   Then together.   then officially broken up for as of right now.   IT IS RIDICULOUS!!!   Then one of my best guy friends likes her, and she's good friends with him. But she likes to make him jealous, but then when he started liking me, she got soo jealous that she MADE him like her and make him feel bad AND almost kiss him.      What do i tell her? I need to confront her about her jealousy issues.   What do I do?
20090220180926AAWV5Iz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Long story!! But, I really need serious answers.Please don't read unless you are giving good advice & opinions?	Well, me and a friend were friends for about 2 yrs. We were like family. We did everything together for awhile. Her son and my daughter were the same age and they did a lot together too. Her husband was friends with my husband. So we did this about 2 yrs. Then she got pregnant, and she changed. She told me I was getting on her nerves. She never told me why but, I figured it was because her husband and I had a good relationship too (like I said, I considered them family) and he came over on several occasions to work on different things around our house. My husband is not an "outside" person. He doesn't know how to do much house repairs so since he did, I asked him to do a lot of things. I don't know if she thought something was going on but, it wasn't. Anyway, she had her child in May, I've only seen her a couple of times since then. I, since then, had a baby. She never called or emailed me to ask how I was doing nor did she get me anything when I was pregnant or when my baby was born. (She didn't invite me to her baby shower but I gave her a gift for her baby) All of a sudden, yesterday, I started my new job at a daycare and she puts her son there and her son and my other daughter are in the same class. Well, she saw my daughter and found out I was working there and she came all the way across the building looking for me. Then she talked to me for awhile, asked me to do lunch with her sometime & then said she had a gift for my baby and just hadn't got it to her. SO, then she left and when she came back yesterday afternoon to pick up her son. I was working in her son's room and she said, wow seeing you twice in one day and then she gave me a gift for my baby. I was in shock, I guess she went home, got the gift and brought it back to me. But, I'm so flabbergasted. I don't know what to feel. I mean, it's been almost a year without any conversations with her. And this is another weird thing, I've been doing my devotionals and yesterday it was talking about renewing relationships and then this happened. So I know it's God but, a part of me wants to rekindle the friendship, but a part of me is very leery. What do you think?

20090220181223AA8mnTb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why cant I recognize faces....?	I can only recognize faces that are of my immediate family or those who have an interesting face.       On movies, I am not able to identify the main character and frequently confuse him with someone else.      When someone says "hi" to me, it takes me a long time before I figure out who they are (if I ever do), even if I've known them for a long time.       I'm very embarrassed by this. I do not have many close relationships and I have no friends.      How do I remember faces...? This is effecting me significantly. It is already bad that I cannot understand social ques. I will never have any friends. I am bad at everything. I do not fit into society.

I am NOT STRESSED so that isn't the reason why I haven't gotten my period. My partner and I have had unprotected sex a few times and then we had protected sex. I know there is a possibility that I am pregnant, but nothing is showing up on the tests. I've had two urine tests and one blood test. All came back with negative results!!!   I know blood tests are the more accurate of tests, but maybe I got pregnant late and it is just not showing up yet.. I asked a doctor about it and why I am not starting my period yet and she had mentioned that her results never showed up positive until she was six weeks. Which if is my case would be next week on Wednesday. Do you think that is what is going on with me? I haven't had many symptoms, I did have slight nausea, lower back pain, headaches and my nipples are sore and feel funny. I have to go back to the doctors next week again for a urine and blood test... Am I pregnant or there is something wrong with me???

20090220181602AAoohAc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Sorry...yet ANOTHER "Am I pregnant?" question on here...but I'm married,25, and really needing opinions!?	I'm 25 years old with a 9-week old baby boy. At my 6-week appointment, my OB-GYN gave me a prescription for the mini-pill, which I took for 3 weeks (finished the pack). The pill was giving some unwanted side-effects so I asked the nurse to call in a different kind. She said to give myself a week in between the mini-pill and the next kind so I could have a period.    Well, I haven't had a pill in 7 days and still no period..    I only had some very light brown spotting for ONE day (which I've heard is something called "implantation bleeding"(?).. or, the beginnings of pregnancy).   A pregnancy test said I'm not pregnant,but I don't want to start the new pills just in case I am.    Why no period? :(

The place was hot and there were lots of people only on one section of the restaurant. I felt. It felt kinda tight in there.My friend got me some water and it lasted maybe 10 minutes. I am here at home, and i dont know if it is just in my head or not but I feel like it wants to come back...Ill get this tiny anxious feeling, but it goes away. Is that normal?  I am pregnant now, with my first baby and it scares me, does the baby feel it? What vitamin or tea can I drink that can help me during my pregnancy? Its a really scary feeling...the last time I got one was 2 yrs ago. What can cause this? Do your eating habits have anything to do with it? I started breaking my good eating habits about 3 weeks ago. Please let me know...i am really scared. THANKS

Do you find that your baby actually likes wearing those sleepers with the feet?  And why are those pretty much the only kind of sleepers available?

20090220191939AAt5X0g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	If bumpers are now considered unsafe, how do I fill in the gap between the mattress and the crib spindles?	Thanks in advance for reading my question.      I just read a government advisory warning parents not to use crib bumpers because new research shows that it can raise the chances of a SIDS incident.  Here is the advisory...       http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/legislati...       Now, I am finding this confusing because there is a gap between my crib mattress and the sides of the crib, and those gaps are also dangerous for SIDS.  I was planning on shoving the crib bumpers in between the mattress and the crib spindles so that the baby would not fall in between.        What do other parents do about this problem?  Crib mattresses only come in one standard size, right?  Or has anyone seen bigger mattresses to avoid those gaps?      Thanks.

I know this sounds silly, but I'm scared that I'm going to be a horrible mom.  My hubby to be and I are going to start trying for a baby next month.  I couldn't be more happier :) We both absolutely love children, we really do.  I know he's going to be the best daddy, but I'm worried that I'm not going to be a good mom.      I think its just the rude comments I get, when I tell my family that we're going to start trying for a baby.  They say how we're not fit to be parents.  I ask why and they just say that we're too busy partying and doing drugs, that if we did have a child it would just come out messed up like us and we're way too young to be starting a family.  Good parents don't have tattoos and piercings.      Before you read too much into that, Ima explain some things.  Yes we both do drink alcohol.  But I would never ever, drink while pregnant, I've seen first hand the effects of FAS and its horrible.  I would never put my child through that.  We don't drink often.  We do on holidays and maybe every other weekend.  A couple beers during Hockey Night [saturday].  As for the drugs, I do smoke weed once in a blue moon and my fiance has only done it a couple times.  We're not addicted.  We both know what its like to grow up with alcoholic parents and we will only drink on certain occassions and never to the point where its hurting anyone else.      Wow I'm really sorry this is coming off as a bit of a rant.  But have any of you ever felt that you would never be good enough to be a mom?      just wondering thats all, hopefully im not the only person whose felt like this      ella

I went for my second trimester ultrasound   it's a boy :]!      anywho, there was some sort of lesion on his lung... They are now ordering monthly ultrasounds and monitoring this. They said if it gets bigger/stays the same and becomes harmful he'll need to have surgery when he's born :[      Yet.. they told me not to loose any sleep over it and that it may just go away by the next time they look. has anyone else had this and had it go away, or does anyone know more about it? is it something i caused?

20090220183518AADDfIz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Reconnnecting with my dad, brother and sister after 13 years...?	I know this isn't the right section but when I asked it in the correct one, I only got one response. I appreciate the users in here giving fast responses and value all of your opinions! Anyway.....      I first met my dad, brother and sister when I was 11. I am now 25 and have been communicating with my sister by email and through facebook. I talked to my brother once but he was the one that wanted to contact me from the beginning (they are 19 and 21). My dad, through my sister, has said he is interested in meeting up with me also so we are setting up a date next week. My dad just kind of fell off the face of the earth after about a year of visiting so I am a little wary of how things will go with him but am really excited about seeing my siblings. Question is, what should we do? Where should we meet? Should we go out to eat or what? I'm so nervous and excited too. Thanks in advance!
20090220185443AAbojcI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would you do in a situation like this?	My neighbor downstairs is younger than I am by about 7 years. She has 3 kids and has just split up with her abusive boyfriend (i'm talking about today she did this).    She seems like she is kinda lost and needs some help in several different areas. I've got a big heart and I'm a sucker for these kinds of things. I want to be able to help her out and show her by example that things can be okay on your own, even if you do have 3 kids.    Thing is she has been in a bit of trouble, she has been arrested and put into jail for stealing..I don't know the full story so i'm not going to get into it. I will say that I don't fully trust her, but I have trust issues with most people I don't know that well to begin with...   I can see that she needs help and she wants it as well.. what are some suggestions on how you would handle a situation like this? I don't want her to become reliant on me...but I do want to show her what it's like to be independent and have self worth.

20090220182743AAAVC5Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you let your 14 year old be in the room when you give birth?	My husband and I are trying to decide some ways my 14 year old daughter can be included in her little sister's birth. She has 3 younger siblings, and I think she doesn't really feel included anymore. My sister suggested letting her be in there when the baby is born...but i don't know. What do you think? Do you think it would be a little too graphic? I do know that it would be a very good "don't have kids!" message to her! She told me she didn't want any kids the other day, lol. I guess that can be a good thing to think at that age, but it mainly sounded bitter coming out of her mouth. So i wonder if this may help her soften up a bit, give her something to be included in?       What do you think?    Thank you!

20090220184358AAn4GQB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why are people like this? Not all of us are incompetent, I have a very valid point.?	On more than one occasion I have come across someone in their answers who basically thinks all younger people are idiots and that they must all be watched because they are still young and naive.       Now, I agree about this to a point but these people took it to a point where its like they have no faith in younger people at all.    Like we don't think or aren't capable of making wise choices. Like the only thing in our heads is an ocelot that's juggling skittles and singing Barbara Streisand.       My first example is I posted a question about sitting online all night. People took it as I was my mom and one person answer that I am a young lady and could get into trouble chatting on the internet and that my mom should talk with me.    I am 19 and I come fully equipped with a brain and common sense.   But I am a young person, OH SHYT there goes a skittle out my ear!!      The other example is this 13 year old boy was asking a question about if it was appropriate for him and his (female) friend to be alone in a room.    Most the answers said it was inappropriate and that their parents were stupid and were going be grandparents and were completely ignoring the boy when he said that they were trust worthy.    These people acted like since the boy was 13 that he couldn't be in control of himself and neither should she and that they shouldn't for their own good, like they were individual's with their own brains who could think maturely for themselves. This boy was very smart as well.          I don't get adults treat teenagers like they are incompetent. They treat them like they can't have a complete thought and are total I don't know what's.       If adults want teens to act mature and make good choices why do they treat them like complete idiots who can't?    I think if adults treated teens more like people and less like ding dongs I think teens would get better.          What do you think?   If you are a teen are you tired of being treated like an idiot?   If you are an adult do you treat all teens like idiots or do you give them a chance first?   Don't you think I am write that just because we are young doesn't make us total morons?

It does not convey nor intends to convey support or advocacy for corporal punishment, or  the incarceration of children in adult prisons      Merely it is if as a parent or guardian of such a child you were faced with this choice what would you do and why?
20090220194428AAK1iBn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Annoying questions about pregnancy/parenting?	I've gotten so annoyed with silly questions with my 2 previous pregnancies that I feel the need to hide this pregnancy from my family. They always ask me "is this the last one", "what if your husband deploys again", "can you afford another baby", and lots of other questions. Do they not think we take this into consideration before conception? Anyways, share some annoying questions that you've been asked.

20090220184509AANMIiN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can I correct a flow preference my baby has developed (breastfeeding question)?	I was told by a pediatrician and a lac consultant to finish off each breastfeeding session with expressed breast milk in a bottle so that my baby can reach her birth weight. I have been doing this for a few days now and now she does not want to drink at all at the breast -- she has developed a flow preference for the bottle! Now my milk supply is already going down. I definitely cannot pump as much as  I used to. I am so upset about this and just want to abandon the bottle and just keep doing what I've been doing but now I have a really low milk supply.    What can I do now? Is it too late to go back to breastfeeding exclusively without any further supplementing? I don't have a SNS or syringe so what the heck can I do?
20090220191602AAkeZJF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Having severe anxiety and stress due to work...help!?	I work in a salon. I am also the last person to get hired so I tend to get all the dirty work since I'm the "low man on the pole". I get stuck having to clean the bathrooms, sweep, mop, take care of all the garbage, do all the laundry, do inventory, put all shipments away (most of the boxes weight 30+ lbs), clean up after the other employees who are too lazy to clean up after themselves, and take care of my clients on top of it.       I'm 10 weeks pregnant and had told my boss about my pregnancy a few weeks ago in hopes that I would get a little help since it was getting very stressful having to take care of my clients and everyone else's needs and cleaning everything on my own.       Unfortunately things have gotten much worse and no one has offered to help me at all. I'm also still being told to scrub the floor on my hands and knees with clorox which I told them I really shouldn't be doing as my doctor told me to avoid directly inhaling these types of chemicals. Now, today I was pulled into my boss' office and told that I'm not doing my job and the work I am doing in unsatisfactory. He gave me several examples of me "not doing my job" and yet I had taken care of each thing he'd listed. I tried to explain that it's hard for me to take care of all of that on my own and it'd be better if I had some help. He told me that I need to ask my coworkers (who are my superiors) to help me. I expressed my discomfort in doing so and he told me that wasn't his problem. I told him I felt as if I'm cleaning staff and not a salon/spa employee. He told me that was my job. I also brought up that I would be returning to school for nursing and he told me that I need to decided if this is a place where I wish to further my career or not and let him know so he can hire someone else.      By the end of the conversation I was almost hyperventilating and hysterical because I was being told over and over that any problems I have are my own problems not his even though it's his staff. I've had other anxiety problems in this job even before I was pregnant and was on medication for it. Now, I'm worried that things are going to get worse for me because I think they want me gone but don't want to fire me or let me go. I think they're going to make my life h*ll until I quit.       I'm worried that all the stress is going to hurt my baby and myself. I've been losing alot of weight because of how  sick I start to feel when I get to work from being stressed. I've lost over 15lbs so far and it's always on my mind. Should I talk to my doctor about this? I'm so lost as of what to do...
20090220194516AA8Iz0R	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What should I do? Working conditions & 10 weeks pregnant?	I posted a question just a little bit ago about how my boss and coworkers (superiors) are being exceptionally rough on me lately.      My job has always been really stressful and I;ve spent many, many hours at work locked in the bathroom in tears. I've evne had panic attacks while I'm getting ready for work in the morning because I dread it so much!      Anyways, I'm wondering if anyone can give me advice. I've worked there since March of 2008 and all the physical labor and unreal expectations of me are getting out of control! Our busiest days are Saturdays and when I scheduled time in on Satirday so I could take a lunch, I was "spoken to" and it was taken out of my appointment book, I don't get breaks and if I do finish one client early, I spend the few minutes I have to spend the few mintues cleaning up after my coworkers (part of my job). The thing is, I work full time and isn't that pretty messed up that I'm pregnant and working a full day and don't even get a 15 minute break? I get nothing!      What do I do? I was literally in hysterics today to my husband because it just keeps getting worse. I think they are trying to get me to quit....            Oh and here's my previous question that goes into more detail:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

20090220182051AA4jTuY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Baby shower for the second baby?	I still have everything from my first baby (she's 17 months) and the few things I do need for this one are very specific.      A boppy pillow   Maya or Mobi wrap   and a Graco SnugRide or SafeSeat are the main things. It has to be that car seat because that is the only thing that fits my stroller.      If it is a boy I will need boy clothes too.      So basically my husband keeps saying he's going to throw me a baby shower but I'm not sure its appropriate. I don't want people going out and spending money on nice gifts which I won't even need! And the few things I do need are a little more pricey and I don't want to ask people for it, I want to buy it myself. And while I have a baby registry I don't really feel comfortable sending the link to people because it seems like I'm demanding they buy gifts.      He still wants to have a party, which is fine, but how do I tell people not to buy me the blankies and pacifiers and other stuff I don't need that I know they will buy? Did you have a baby shower for #2?

Here are my symptoms I have been having.      I had unprotected sex with my fiance on the 31 while I was ovulating      -I have been very tired during the day but am having a harder time sleeping at night      -My breast hurt SOOOO BAD. I can see every vein up through my chest and in my boobs. It looks like my skin is translusent. My nipple was also itchy and they hurt very bad.      -about a week or so ago I had a bad pain on where I would think my right ovary is it felt like a really bad cramp something i've never felt before      -I had a headache all day nothing would ease it and I rarely get headaches      -I broke out more than usual      I mean I know some of these could go either way but my breast normally don't hurt this much.

Hi, I'm Kataya, I'm 13 and I have always been an only child but now my parents are having another baby, my mum is pregnant with a little girl called Tamara Felicity Leigh and I can't wait to be a big sister!   Anyway, as I have no experience with young children, (I have never been around them or babysitted for anyone) I have no idea what to expect.   I am really close to both my mum and my dad and I don't want that to change.   Are they going to be with the new baby 24/7 and always talking about Tamara?    Will the baby be screaming throughout the night (I need a lot of sleep, otherwise I get very cranky lol)   And what are some fun things I can do with my new baby sister to bond with her, and what sorts of things could I do to help my parents with her?   I'm really excited! I have helped plan the bedroom, she has a white crib, light pink walls and butterfly wallpaper on her signature wall and adorable laura ashley furniture..I even bought some toys for her myself and lots of little gifts..I can't wait!      So any advice as to how to be a great big sister, and what things will be like at first will really be great! Thanks!      Kataya,,x

20090220185425AAAnYBx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is naturally tan skin considered unattractive?	Yeah, I was kind of wondering...       I guess you could say I'm "white". My father is from Spain, my mother is part Spanish and part Black. So, I'm sort of a mixed guy. My father is white in color, but my mom's a caramel. I guess you could say tanned skin is naturally in my genes.      My eyes are a dark blue. My hair is black and somewhat wavy. but I'm naturally tan. In the winter I get somewhat white, but in the summer I'm probably a caramel color. I don't go to tanning booths or stay out in the sun too long.          I was sort of self conscious to this... So is it considered unattractive?

20090220194007AAR7Y4u	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My Fiancée is scared to be a Mum. Any advice?	I've been with my fiancée Laura for 3 years now. Ever since we started going out we've been talking about having children one day. Imagine our delight when we discovered she was pregnant! Laura was very excited and started buying things for the baby and choosing names.       Noticed I said 'was'. Laura is now 7 months pregnant. For the past 5 weeks or so Laura has been fretting about having a baby. She's convinced she's going to be a bad Mum. (Laura has a hostile relationship with her mother after a rocky childhood.) She cries saying how she doesn't deserve this baby and has talked about getting him/her adopted. I don't understand she wanted this baby so much. She gets in a right state saying we'll get the child taken from us because she's gunna be such a bad Mum and she's worried the baby won't like her.      She works as a nursery nurse and is great with children and neither myself or anyone else would have any concerns about her being a mother. She isn’t a bad person and she hasn’t a bad bone in her body. I think her worries may be linked to her past experiences with her own mother. I want to get her help before our child is born but I’m scared that the authorities will take the baby off of us because of Laura’s mental state.      I am at a total loss at what to do. I want this baby very much and so did Laura before this hysteria started. Please any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

I have been having a horrible time with my Daughter's "attitude" lately.      She throws food at me.  Slaps, screams, hits other kids and laughs at the word no.  Even when I yell it.      She is a really sweet child ( HA HA..I know some of you are laughing )  ( =   BUT when she has her moments she REALLY has them.   Do you think a 1 minute timeout in her playpen would work or even clue her in eventually that she will be punished when acting out or would it just fly over her head at this age?      She is very very bright and sometimes I almost think she "plays" me sometimes....like she knows what pushes my buttons and gets a rise out of it.....'sighhhhh'

20090220205748AAT26Xy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it ever to early to do tummy time?	My daughter still has her Umbilical Chord but LOVES being on her tummy already. I don't let her sleep on it but, we do tummy time already and she's only 9 days old. I've been doing it since she came home. Is it too early? Could this hurt her chord at all?         Sorry I'm asking a lot of questions tonight, just a few things that I've been thinking about!
20090220201047AAnFiOZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Part 2: 14 year olds sex life?	In addition to my last post I'de like to say;      She IS getting her life around.   She is no longer sleeping with her friends/boyfriends.   She is in a stable relationship with a guy whom she adores   and he loves her aswell.   They have permission from his and her parents to be going out and having sex (He's 17, she's 14)   She is not a ****. She does look older than me though (And I'm 16)      Her boyfriend was a virgin before they started going out so he is not a PERV. I love her boyfriend he's really nice & sweet..      Why shouldn't they have sex everyday/every other day?   As gross as it is, my boyfriends parents have sex everyday!   My boyfriend and I used to have sex everyday before we got pregnant the first time (using a condom)       Actually, I know ALOT of people who had sex for the first time when they were 13/14 .. I was 13 when I lost my virginity. Even my non-parenting friends were about 14.      She doesn't "need help" she got help for other reasons and she even said it doesn't help any, all people do is judge you no matter what you say. Atleast thats not a lie ;)      So question time:   Why do you think it's so wrong for her to be sexually active if they're in love, have permission & are using protection? (Birth control pill and condom if they have one)      Like I said, if her boyfriend hadn't of come along she would still be the same girl she used to be.. He helped her more than any professional..

20090203100549AA4gMqU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents: Kids and Dogs question?	I'm just worried about whats going to happen when we have our kid      Do you think my dog would be a good match for a kid?      Just curious.      She is a small mix breed around 24 pounds. And she is just over 1 years old.      She is a real couch potato and loves television but outside she loves run and play and she loves to play fetch.      She is pretty even tempered (especially since I'm constantly grabbing for her and hugging on her and kissing her....some dogs wouldn't tolerate that)      She is a little nervous but for the most part she is pretty calm and go with the flow.      The youngest children she has ever spent time with were 8 and 9 years old and she did great with them and played with them.      But she has never been around younger kids (she seems to get a little nervous when she sees one so we just have never let her get close)      Do you think she would do okay with kids around....should we try to expose her more to kids?      Just curious.      This is her (I took her for a walk in the snow)       http://www.i-love-dogs.com/forums/member...             ______________________________________...   We know with our other dog we have to be more careful. he is a minature poodle and he has already had a lot of health problems and when he doesn't feel good he gets tempermental and he wasn't comfortable even with the 9 year old.....he didn't like being handled by her. But he is also so small I worry about him. ( His healthy weight is around 12 pounds but when he gets ill his weight drops down to about 7 or 8 pounds)      He is a year and a half old         Do you think if we teach our kid (when we have one) the right way to handle a dog we wouldn't have any big problems?
20090203095753AAVEraG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When did you finally believe you were pregnant?	I have seen my baby twice both times with a nice strong heartbeat, last time was Friday 162 BPM. I have another ultrasound tomorrow and I will be 8 weeks 1 day.  I know that I am pregnant but it still has not sunk in.  Not even seeing the baby.  I mean I think Im just so worried about a miscarriage and I just keep waiting for it to happen.  I have lots of pregnancy symptoms including being very sick since 6 weeks and now less nausea but actual vomiting and dry heaves.  So its not like I physically don't feel pregnant.  When did it finally sink in that you were pregnant?  I am still waiting to tell my family because I don't believe that I am actually going to "have" a baby.  I guess since my last two miscarriages I got use to the idea that pregnant women don't actually end up with babies...as has been the case with my last two.  I should probably mention that my last two pregnancies never progressed passed 5 weeks.  I miscarried at 9.5 with my first however the baby never developed.  This is the first pregnancy where I have had a heartbeat.  My Dr told me my miscarriage rate is under 5% and that once I hit 12 weeks it will be down to 1%.  Do you think it will all sink in after 12 weeks?
20090203104407AAHkQ6Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it wrong for me to feel a little upset that my little sis is pregnant?	ok so i'm 21, and i will be graduated from college next semester (taking online classes) and i'm 36 weeks pregnant, and everything is going great and my hubby does a great job and owns his own business so we are great and ready for a baby. My sister who is 25 is also pregnant, she is also very well off and is engaged and ready for a baby, she is 30 weeks pregnant and lives far away. and now i just found out that my little sister, 17, who is in a off and on relationship and she is very rude to me and the whole family (very selfish and rude and self centered and spoiled) is pregnant (6 weeks) and i'm a little upset. i feel guilty, like i should be proud for her, but i'm upset. i kept telling her she needs to take her birthcontrol and she ignored me cuz she was using condoms and her boyfriend would pull out. i told her that wasn't enough. and i will support her no matter what, but i can't help but feel a little mad at her for not thinking. she's really not ready. my family is well off (my parents are dentists) so no matter what the baby will be well taken care of. but still...i dont know. am i being stupid for being so upset with her?

20090221002111AAESMlG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 4 year old daughter REFUSES to use toilet- messes herself all the time- SOOOO done! What do I do? Please!?	My 4 year old daughter REFUSES to use the toilet at all. She will pee/ poop in her diaper if she has one on, she will pee/poop in her pullups if they are on and she does the same even if she has panties on. I'm at my whits end- she just sits there with pee and poop on herself until we see it, and then she acts like it's ok for her to be doing those things.      My husband and I have no idea where to go from here- we've been trying to potty train for over a year now, and trust me when I say we HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING! She has a sister just a year older than her, and her older sister is fully potty trained!      Our pediatrician has referred us to a specialist- a urologist, but we can't get in to see her any sooner than a month away. I just want to cry- she starts kindergarten in 6 months! PLEASE! Does anyone have any suggestions that we could try to implement between now and when we see the specialist??      Also, thought I would add that she is currently 4 years 5 months old.      no crazy changes in the house or her environment that would warrant this behavior. I'm a stay at home mother.

If he reaches out to get something and I take it away (i.e the remote, my cell phone, the laptop) He starts crying and will throw himself back and kick out his legs.      He will start crying if i put him in his swing or jumper and he wants me to hold him.      Earlier I put him in his swing and he was crying and he kicked out his legs and threw himself out of the swing!       He always hits his head or legs on the side of the changing table when he throws his fits and i am afraid he is going to hurt himself!      His Nana watches him while i am at work, i usually only work 4/5 hours a day.    rarely i will work 8 hours a day.       I think she carries him a lot when i am not there because he always wants to be held.         I dont know what to do =( Isn't he to young to have temper tantrums?      Help please =/

20090220223918AApK1uQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Six year old having sex.... what to tell mom.?	I've been watching my best friends daughter for the past week while she is away on a business trip. I have no contact with the childs mother until she arrives at the airport in three days and i need help as to how to explain something to her.      the story goes that i let "lilly"(not her real name) go over to a trusted neighbors house, she went all the time while she was with her mother. i went to go pick her up from their house because it was getting dark and when i walked into the house lilly and the little boy were up in their room, so the mother of the boy and i walked up to the room and opened the door and found them engaging in intercourse. I freaked out, grabbed lilly and took her straight home. i called the other parent to talk about some things and kinda yell at her for letting the instance happen. but when i sat down with lilly to ask if she knew what she was doing she said that a boy at school who is nine told them about it. she thought it was "normal" for a child to do it  and didnt understand what she had done is wrong. i found out she has done it more than a few times. we talked about it for quite some time while i explained many things to her, but now in three days I have to tell her mother what do i do?       and why on earth are young kids teaching younger kids that its ok to have sex, and how do 9 yr olds know what sex is? i was clueless at that age.

As soon as I turned to walk out of his room, my stomach heaved and I almost didn't make it to the bathroom before I blew my breakfast. I have not been sick at ALL this pregnancy, and typically the end of trimester 1 is when the sickness should be going away. Why am I just feeling it now? Has this happened to you? What did you do, and how long did it last? P.S. With my son's pregnancy, I was sick everyday for the first 3 months and when I hit 12 weeks, the sickness was GONE and I never threw up again.

20090219105837AAs2Gs5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Interesting....is there a "rule of thumb" for preemie's weight gain in the first year or 2 years?	so I'm seeing triple their birth weight by 1 year old.  Now, is there something about preemie's as well?  our son was 2 months early and weighed just under 4 lbs.  The day before he was due we got him weighed (just for the heck of it) and he was almost 8.5 lbs.  He's almost 8 months old now and is a little over 16 lbs, so he has quadrupled his birth weight in just under 8 months, and almost double his "term" weight at almost 6 months corrected age...      Anyway, what I'm getting at (he's perfectly healthy, no issues as far as our pediatrician and we can tell), is there some way of telling what a preemie should be at 1 year compared to birth?  And just as my last question, this is just for comparison...basically like the %'s thing in the doctor's office on weight, length, and head circumference...

(i had a doctor say i needed to lose 50 pounds before getting pregnant and if i didn't they would have to deal with it..needless to say i've changed groups)  and that i'm just going to have to watch how much i gain that much more. but when i tell friends and family that they say yes but that's hard or good luck with that. i feel like i'm failing before i try when i hear that. i did gain a lot after getting married so i guess they know how easy it is for me to gain but i did lose most of that already and it's not just about me anymore i need to make sure the baby is safe. thanks for any advice.
20090219113735AAlGweX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone have this before?	Can these pains be pregnancy pains.?   What is this pain? Could I be pregnant?   Okay , let me start off by saying I was on depo ( 3 shots) stopped in Nov. Got my period in Nov, got it late in december (19th instead of 16th) and then again Jan 1st last for 3 days. Haven't got my period since. Have had sex. I got a pregnancy test at PPH (urine) 13 days ago, came back negative. Two mornings ago, I woke up, went pee, went d/s to iron clothes and had the most ripping awful pain in my pelvic area, couple inches below my bellybutton to top of hairline. I thought it was maybe a cyst rupture because i have had them before. However, after laying down with my knees up for about 10-15 mins the pain went away and I was pretty much good for the rest of the day. I just assumed it was nothing. The next morning, the exact same thing, rolled off the couch, got up and started doing the usually, straightening and ironing cloths. It was for 15 mins again, same spot, I also had a little bit of pain yesterday night. Then again at 3:30am this morning I woke up half asleep turned over and was in pain again for what seemed like forever, although it was prob only 20 mins or so. now I kinda feel a little crampy or like a dull pain in my pelvic area, but nothing I can't handle.      Anyone have any idea what this could be? I read maybe if I am pregnant it could be round ligament pain, but this early? I suppose there is a chance I could be pregnant if I got tested 2 weeks ago, it may not have been strong enough to show up. Right? Help         I don't have any other problems... no fever, (dull headache last night),not nauseous or vomiting, just a crampy feeling.

I found out about Strep B as another lady on Yahoo answers had to deliver her baby stillborn because it died of Strep B after her waters broke.  I'm 35 weeks and 4 days today and got a negative Strep B result, I only posted my swabs Monday at 35 weeks and 1 day and recieved the news by text this morning.  Please look in to Strep B further as your midwife will not mention it to you and get tested, ￡32 is all it costs and it could save your babies life. I was tested using the Enriched Culture Method (ECM) test. Please read the info below:      Reliable testing for GBS carriage is not available on the NHS - the standard test which is sometimes offered on the NHS (often called an HVS) is not very reliable since up to 50% of women who are carrying GBS when the swabs are taken will falsely be given a negative result. However, a positive result from a HVS test is highly reliable.      The Enriched Culture Method (ECM) test, recognised as optimal for detecting GBS carriage by both the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists and by the Health Protection Agency, it is not available routinely or on the NHS. However, it is available privately, and costs ￡32.00 (although some health professionals may also charge you for specimen collection). This test is much more sensitive and has been specifically designed for the isolation of GBS.       The ECM test should be performed at 35-37 weeks' gestation to best predict colonisation with GBS at delivery since GBS carriage can be intermittent. Research shows that, if the ECM test is performed within 5 weeks of delivery, a negative result is 96% predictive of not carrying GBS at delivery (so 4% of women acquired carriage between the test and giving birth) and a positive result is 87% predictive of carrying GBS at delivery (so 13% of women lost carriage between performing the test and giving birth).      Any test result positive for GBS during pregnancy means that the pregnant woman should be offered intravenous antibiotics from the onset of labour or waters breaking and then 4-hourly until delivery.      A negative ECM test result means that the pregnant woman does not need to be offered intravenous antibiotics from the onset of labour or waters breaking against GBS infection in her baby.      Where no ECM test result is available OR the less reliable NHS test has come back negative, then the pregnant woman should be offered intravenous antibiotics during labour against GBS infection in her baby if one or more risk factors is present.      However, in rare cases GBS can cause serious illness and even death in newborn babies.  GBS is the most common cause of severe infection in newborns, particularly in the first week after birth (known as an early onset infection) .
20090219142135AAVhsX0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am i pregnant? i've been crampy for weeks and my "period" ended two weeks ago?	November and December, I had very normal periods, I wasn't on BC or anything. In the begininng of January, I had my period, then they day after it stopped, I started the birth control patch. I had very bad side effects and took it off the second day I had it on the second week. two days later, I had my period again for about 5 days. I went to the DR and she said it was because of the BC. I got prescribed the Yaz pill and started taking it the next day like she told me to but had unprotected sex the first day and every day afterwords.d I've never been on the pill before, and I didn't even think to read the packet...I don't really know what to do about these things, I was raised by my dad only...   I missed two pills the first week but took them the next morning when I realized I forgot, then took my regular days pill that night when I was supposed to. I finished the rest of the pack without missing one more. I took the white pill at night and then I started spotting the next day, I spotted for six days and I usually bleed heavily for 8-9 days. My breasts were sore and are still sore with twinges of pain. I drank a little bit of alcohol a few weeks ago and got really drunk off of a little bit and it takes a lot usually, and threw up the next morning and I usually never throw up in the morning after drinking and I only had a little bit. That was before I thought I could be pregnant. But I was also thinking that it was my body adjusting to the new bc. I just don't know!!   I've also had hot flashes. I have been waking up in the middle of the night this past half of a week sweating. I'm usually really cold, just a cold person and I had to throw off the blankets. I'm walking around in a tank top and boxers and I usually wear sweats and a sweatshirt cuz i'm always cold.      Also I'm getting these, like, shooting pains in my breasts...like from the middle to the nipple. And the first day I spotted I cramped. I usually cramp heavily for my whole period. I started cramping the day after I was done spotting and havent stopped cramping since then. But the cramps are different...like more pressure. They would ease in for about a minute and really hurt then go away. that would happen mostly in the morning but sometimes in the day and night. and now, it's just twinges of pain in my abdomin and weird feelings down there   I am getting nausea before I eat, and sometimes I can't eat at all because I think that I will throw up if I do. this morning i wanted to eat breakfast and I havent been eating breakfast for about 3 years...when i was in the middle of my bagel, i got really nauseas   I have been moody and I have wanted to cry over the stupidest things and have cried over stupid things

20090219111309AAnSR7n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it ok my best friend has never  bought my baby anything?	So me and my boyfriend where talking the other night and he said something that really got me thinking about my best friend. We have a 10 month old daughter together and he was saying how some of my other friends so dont have so much money have bought things for our daughter, and my co workers have gotten me tons of things for my baby shower and he is supposed to be someone very important in her life her "Uncle Pauly" and he has never even done anything for her. not even so much as a card or letter or something for her to look back on that we could show her and say "your uncle gave this to you when you where a baby". Now im not the type to ask people for things or expect them but i do think he has a good point. The reason why the conversation came up is because my best friend went on a date with someone he barely even knows and bought this person a $60 gift. Now if he can buy someone he barely even knows a $60 gift how come he hasnt dont anything for someone he claimes is so special to him. what is your opinion on this situation? I find myself looking at him like he is sort of selfish.

20090219112820AAJXzvg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I had unprotected sex and I take birth control pills, how likely am I to get pregnant?	We had unprotected sex and my boyfriend didn't ejaculate in me, but there may have been precum. When he ejaculated, he pulled out on my stomach and the side of my thigh. He immediately wiped off the extra resido. I take birth control pills but I've been missing some pills. I have polycystic ovary syndrome also and a low chance of getting pregnant even when i want to have a baby. But we usually always use a condom and it was the heat of the moment. I'm scared, please answer this question.

20090219130420AAXRs5l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant again! Feeling hopeless...?	Alright guys, here's the deal.  I have a 4 month old daughter.  We recently found out we're pregnant again. 8 weeks to be exact. I was on the nuva ring, and apparently it didn't help much. We went to the dr to confirm and saw the new little heartbeat. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful for the new life I have inside of me, but on the other hand I'm totally freaked out. My children will only be 11 months apart.  DH is really not saying negative things. Well, not as often as I am.  Every since I found out, I haven't been able to get out of bed except to take care of my daughter and I have this overwhelming feeling of hopelessness, fear, and anxiety. I've talked to the dr about it and he said at that after my 1st trimester he'll give me something to cope, but I can't spend another 4 weeks in bed.  I just want to hear from someone that has a similar experience, how'd you cope, and what was it like when the new baby came?

20090219141340AA3z9YU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you find that husbands are seriously not understanding about pregnancy?	I could cheerfully beat my husband.  I am 18 weeks pregnant.  He has been acting like this pregnancy is a huge imposition on him because I get angry quicker, am more picky about foods, want sex only once a week, and get a lot tireder.  I get all excited now when I feel the baby move and it's like he could care less.  He gives me a look like, "Why are you telling me this?"  I asked him why he doesn't get into it and he said he knows he wouldn't be able to feel the baby this early on from the outside.  He used to kiss my belly all the time, but hasn't done it as much anymore.  He insists on coming to every single appointment, but is only interested in the health of the baby and not so much on how I am feeling.  After hearing the heartbeat, he basically goes to sleep in the chair.  I know he's excited in some abstract way, but I feel like he completely doesn't get it.  Anybody else feel this way?

20090219142804AAVl87o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	34 weeks pregnant, lots of questions!?	I am currently 34 weeks pregnant with my first baby and throughout my whole pregnancy I have had no problems, not even morning sickness. Well for about two weeks now I feel like I have been bombarded with troubles. At 32 weeks I went into the hospital b/c I had a lot of liquid come out of me and it wasn't urine, but they checked me out and said my water didnt break and everything was fine. But then I started having contractions and they then gave me a shot to make them stop. Well since then I have been having multiple things and just wanted to know if these things were normal:   1. I get a strange pain in my throat where it feels like cold air is being rushed in it and it hurts. (Could be sinus drainage?)   2. Throughout the day I was have really bad pressure in my chest. It basically feels like a 20lb brick is on my chest and I can't breathe properly.   3. Whenever he moves now, its painful. Before it was just an awkward sort of feeling but now it actually hurts.      Obviously I am a first time mom so i feel soo lost about if everything I'm feeling is normal or not. I am only 4'11 and I was about 100lbs pre-pregnancy if that matters at all. I truly feel like he is overtaking my body and I have NO idea how I can handle it for 6 more weeks!
