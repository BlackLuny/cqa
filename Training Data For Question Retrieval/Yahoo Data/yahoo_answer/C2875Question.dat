Its my dad's birthday and I want to find a nice restaurant to take them too.  We usually go to something tourist-y in North Beach, so I want something different.  Something more for locals perhaps?        I'm kind of a picky eater, so it should be a nice, classy place, but not snobbish or pretentious.  I want some place cool.        I'm not thinking any particular cuisine, just give me your best suggestions.  I hope you can help.
