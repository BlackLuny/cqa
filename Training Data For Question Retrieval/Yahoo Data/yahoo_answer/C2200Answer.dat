Xm5ab6F6aa	Erno Rubik, a Hungarian scientist obsessed with 3D geometry, first envisioned the Rubik's Cube in 1974. It took him several years, however, to work out the complex interaction of the toy's elements. And even after creating a working model, Rubik found it difficult to market his new toy due to the political and economic atmosphere -- Hungary was deeply communist at the time. Finally, in 1979, Rubik the break he was looking for when the Rubik's Cube was featured at the Nuremberg Toy Show. It captured the imagination of toy enthusiasts everywhere, and by 1982, over 100 million cubes had been sold.    http://www.usefultrivia.com|`|Q2S4w8xZaa	Rubik's Cube!|`|ecf0624e408f6094b653674cb69909c5aa	Rubik's cube

Hope I helped in someway!     Message me if you don't know how to set up a wireless connection on the PSP. As for the account I never had to make one. But then agan ive never played that game online, or tried to for that matter.

Mirror force isn't need because torrential is just as good and a really cheap sub.    anyways take out thunder king rai-oh better to run him in threes and better off in little city and gadget/oppression.Really try to get dandylion, switch out for marshmallon.     -1 my body as a shield  -2 sak.  +2 phoenix wing wind blast  -2 magic drain  +3 dark bribe  +1 threatening roar  -1 bottomless trap hole    Only changes until you get solemns and dandylion.      Edit - Ok, instead of dark bribes, use three magic drains or three spell shield type - 8.
JCdBSULraa	3 possibilities:    1) You've forgotten your username and password (3.0.8 was released several weeks ago after all)    2) Your account has been hacked and your password was changed.     3) Somehow your account got flagged to require the secure ID (a physical token which produces a number required to log in).    No matter what the case though, your only option is to contact Blizzard to verify your identify and have your password reset.    I can verify that this has nothing to do with Burning Crusade, since I have an account which can log in without WoTLK.

PXWVGQyAaa	I have been answering questions for over a year and had one violation yesterday. In all honesty I can't be bothered with appealing anymore .<br>  Just keep answering to the best of your ability. In the scheme of things, it isn't worth getting stressed about it. This answer will probably be removed as yahoo frowns on chatting.|`|LcURWscBaa	This question seems to appear almost daily.  People don't delete questions (except for their own), only Yahoo can delete them, and it happens across the board in all sections.  Why do you whiners always blame "trolls?"  There are many questions (as well as answers) which violate the guidelines, from underage children, to chat from bored people just looking to start a conversation, to rants, attacks and insults, sexual content, and illegal activity.  Even if someone reports a question and it isn't a violation, then it doesn't get deleted.  So quit blaming your issues on "trolls" and read the guidelines.|`|lOuz0nU2aa	Some people just ask a question, get an answer and delete their question right away. They probably don't want too many questions asked in their history.<br>  <br>  Depending on what your question was if someone reports it, it will probably get deleted if there's any small reason it should be.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	no, some of the reasons questions are deleted is because the question is breaking the rules.
hXOqWnkJaa	5000 Microsoft points or Street Fighter 4?<br>  Dunno.. What are you gonna get with 5000 microsoft points? Old xbox classic games? If so that's not worth it. Get Street Fighter 4 or a different game.|`|4oEuCkjPaa	You're really gonna get 5000 MS Points? wow, well Street Fighter 4 is a very good fighting game, if you like fighting games get it.|`|ItRr3x51aa	Well, it depends how many MS points, but I would recommend Street Fighter 4 for sure if it iis a game you really want to buy.<br>  <br>  Street Fighter is a better choice because you're gonna have fun with that for quite a while, and its a good game. It's a pretty new game, so its better cuz that also. You'll use it more than most MS points stuff.<br>  <br>  Microsoft points can get you themes and arcade games and originals, but not a full game with achievements and all. Movies are cool, but if it is a game, get it. Themes are cool too, but they get old after a whuile and you want the most of your money, so<br>  <br>  Get Street Fighter IV!|`|tpXUKjm4aa	Street Fighter 4 if you like fighting games ive been a fan of it for a while and couldnt wait for it on 360 its a lot of fun and microsoft points are Pointless i only get them if its for a game i play alot

dDrTVXTFaa	great deck 9/10, the oly thing i could recommend is probably replacing manju with a witch of the black forest or sangan so you have a choice instead of just having to get a ritual card, i would also say you should add another paladin and a few more traps, other than that, very good deck, draining shield is a very good trap which id defo put in, dont listen to the other idiots who will tell you youi need 3 solemn judgments in, there are better/cheaper alternatives e.g magic jammer/seven tools of the bandit and divine wrath for the monsters, hope this helps improve your deck, otherwise dont change it much because its a good deck|`|mHWsuqjZaa	It is alot better than last time. solemn... you still need it. it is the one of the best trap cards. idk what that girl above me is talking about.

bWLdtkhlaa	Well, if your a strength pure, it depends. You won't really be a strength pure anymore if you do train your mage level. What I advise is train your attack or strength to complement your high strength level. Mage is a great skill to have, but if you don't have enough health or defense to back it up, you will be very vulnerable. I advise you get your defense up before you raise your mage level. Remember, while training mage your going to need lots of money to buy all of the necessary items you need to train your level. All in all, it's your decision, and this is just my opinion. Whatever you want works for you.|`|URxNcgAaaa	Deffinetly get your attk up. Don't do mage yet with a str pure. Get your attack, def,str and hp really high then start mage. If you wanna do mage you need a high defence and good attack if you run out of runes or in a battle that doesn't allow mage. But yeah like he said mage is a great skill to have but i spent 2mil getting 78 mage. Hope this helps.|`|K81H2emuaa	go for strength is just better

RSkQ1zl6aa	Hi,<br>   Yes, I would say 2 weeks for 2 minutes is a decent time. There is no time that I would say is 'good'. As long as it feels like an achievement and that the solver is proud to achieve such a time and feel the rush to try and get faster, then that is already very good. I had started getting 2 minutes in 2 days, but I do not practice often. I practiced only about 30 minutes per day. I would say I'm an extremely fast learner when it comes to things I'm interested in, but not as much for things I don't like. It's been about a year since I learned cubing now, and I'm a 3 state champion and average 9-11 seconds per cube. I would have a bigger title, but I do not participate in many competitions.<br>  <br>   I hope this helped, and good luck!|`|FQbHZnaMaa	Well it depends. 2 minutes after 2 weeks is average. But it all depends on how long you've been cubing. I've cubed for 3.5 months and I average 35 seconds with a 22 seconds best.|`|8ey4ArjXaa	sitting in the car during a long journey or with your friends,that can be fun!|`|lOuz0nU2aa	Yeah, under a minute would make you really good.<br>  If your friend can do it in 2 minutes that's pretty good.

ATvI1WmKaa	The 360 controller is crappy for fighting games.  If you must get it for 360, I'd recommend you get an arcade stick eventually to play it with.<br>  <br>  I say the 360's gamepad is crappy (personally I like it overall) because it uses an analog stick as the primary directional input.  In a fighting game, this is not good, as its much less precise.  The D-pad on the ps3, while not holding a candle to an analog stick in most other genres, is far superior because it uses buttons, which are much, much more precise than a thumbstick.  Its difficult to explain, you just have to try them both for yourself, analog sticks just suck for fighting games.  Of course, an arcade stick trumps them both since it provides a much more comfortable layout.<br>  <br>  The game itself is good, from what I've heard, but if you're planning to win most of your online battles, you will need an arcade stick, because anyone vs. you thats using a stick while you're using a gamepad is probably going to beat you very easily if they have any amount of skill.<br>  <br>  A cheaper alternative is a custom gamepad that Madcatz (i think they're the ones making it) is making for both Ps3 and 360 that lacks triggers but has more buttons on its face (mimicking an arcade stick, but still not as good), and uses a D-pad instead of an analog stick.<br>  <br>  Also, note that, like any hardcore fighting game, SF4 will require you invest a lot of time to master any new refinements present, as well as the combos and such to gain a notable amount of skill.  Unless you're a returning veteran, I guess.|`|oczuC12caa	I can't really answer that, i've played games which i've enjoyed that reviewers would rate less than 5/10, It all depends on what you like, if you enjoyed the previous street fighter games then i say go for it.|`|qai8pcnaaa	Yes.  The game is off the hook!<br>  <br>  In addition, the Xbox 360 controller does have a d-pad in addition to the analog stick.|`|psUL6906aa	I hear its the best fighting game of the past while... i say go for it if you're a fighting fan

MDf0BoiNaa	i think after that challenge, there's one last one at the training facility. check your challenge map, it should be there
ATvI1WmKaa	Starters are fine, but a good rule of thumb is to NOT depend on legendaries, if you can help it.  They're naturally more powerful (their base stats are simply higher), and are either discouraged or banned in some competitive arenas (cant use em in the battle tower, I think).  Collect em, but don't rely on them for combat.<br>  <br>  Whether you want to keep your starter is entirely up to you, but it can be a good idea to consider completely restructuring your team as you draw closer to the Elite 4.  For many people, the pokemon they raised since the beginning of the game, they only did so because of the limited options they had.  Now you have many more lands to explore, as well as TMs to customize your pokemon with, so you can make a team that you really like.  I'd recommend heading over to bulbapedia to study up on pokemon and types you might want to consider adding to your main party.<br>  <br>  Things to keep in mind when finalizing your party:<br>  -Make sure they cover as many types as possible.  Not just having a wide variety of pokemon types, but move types as well.<br>  -Pay attention to the ups and downs of your pokemon's stats.  Pokemon lacking in sp attack aren't going to make good use of projectile moves like surf, psychic, or lightning, so give them physical moves instead.<br>  -Take caution when considering pokemon with low speed ratings.  On some of the tougher battles, it becomes an important strategy to be able to strike first, quickly and decisively.<br>  -Take caution when considering moves that have a very low amount of PP, such as close combat, fire blast, and hydro pump.  These moves, while extremely powerful, cannot be relied on since they not only can be used very little, but commonly have relatively low accuracy ratings.<br>  -Study pokemon weaknesses and strengths.  Against some of the tougher foes, relying on attacks that do only normal damage will lead to a long, hard battle, using unnecessary amounts of PP.  Switch your pokemon when necessary, and strike your foes' weak points for decisive victories.<br>  -Vary your movesets.  To truly buff your pokemon, you WILL need to give them TMs to make them learn moves they wouldn't otherwise learn.  Just as its important to have moves matching the user's type, its just as, if not even more important, that each move in each pokemon's arsenal has a clear and important role.  Here's what I generally keep in mind when considering pokemon movesets:<br>  slot 1: same type move that preferably does relatively decent to high damage (60-100)<br>  slot 2: simple, high PP move that does decent damage and is of a common type, such as normal or water. (I consider it important to have a move like this for when you just need to fight head on)<br>  slot 3: move of another type, perhaps one that's super effective against an opposing type (like giving a dragon pokemon a fire-type move to combat ice types)<br>  slot 4: wildcard.  I usually either do #3 again or use a status inflicting/support move, like hypnosis or bulk up.<br>  -Make effective and creative use of hold items.  Hold items add a whole new layer of strategy to the game, and there's a lot of them to consider.  You could play it safe and just buff an attack type with a corresponding item (like giving a fire type a charcoal or flame plate), or you could get creative and give things like various berries, or ones that buff specific stats.<br>  -Be on the lookout for PP ups, they are incredibly useful, though quite scarce.<br>  -DO NOT USE Rare Candies for most of the game.  Rare Candies bypass the whole stat system working behind the scenes that governs how your pokemon's stats rise.  Your pokemon won't grow to their full potential if you stuff them with Rare Candy's.  Technically its fine to use them, once pokemon use up their EV points, but im not entirely sure how the system works, so its tough to give a verdict.  I considered my pokemon ready for Rare Candies once they had reached their late 60s, but they had Pokerus and thus used up their EVs much more quickly.<br>  <br>  those are all I can think of off the top of my head.  Note that I didn't have official tournaments or hardcore online battles in mind when I thought this up.  Those guys probably use radically different strategies, so it may be good to take some advice from them as well.  I say, ultimately just make sure the team is uniquely "you."  I tried to balance my team while including some of my favorite pokemon and moves at the same time, and its worked out well so far, though it took a lot of planning.|`|4WIEtJCqaa	Make sure your pokemon has good combination attack to take down your opponent and attacks that fight against your weakness too(if you can). when you are set start raising your pokemon to high levels.<br>  Choose your favorite pokemon which it really will turn out good.|`|8SPKsHozaa	catch em all ...become a pokemon master|`|v7fsd02Naa	wow, i didnt think anyone played that gay game anymore(not insulting you, just my opinion on the games)|`|nOjlfGajaa	Pokemon is awesome.

uctxzjIIaa	Deathknight is its own class with its own abilities. You don't convert a character into a Deathknight, you simply make one. Blizzard just decided that they wanted to let people who had already leveled several characters skip most of the leveling process and made DKs start at level 55. But as a result, they added in an artificial restriction of the account needing a level 55+ character on it already.<br>  <br>  Aside from Northrend and DKs, the only major new addition is the Inscription profession. Each character now (on a new tab in the skillbook window) has a page for equipping 3 Major Glyphs and 3 Minor Glyphs (which all gradually unlock as the character levels). Characters with the Inscription profession scan use its sub-profession Milling to combine certain herbs with special vials to create Inks, then combine those inks with special Parchments to make a Glyph. They can then give/sell these glyphs to whoever wants them, and they can then head to an item stationed in the Inscription Trainer shops to apply the Glyph to themselves. You cannot rally remove a Glyph, though; you can only overwrite it with another Glyph. Minor Glyphs typically have no combat implications and are a matter of convenience or cosmetics (like changing the animal Polymorph does, or removing the need to have a feather in your inventory for the Slow Fall spell). Major Glyphs are the ones that have large impacts on your combat abilities (like making Water Elemental last much longer, or increasing the mana regen while casting that the Mage Armor spell gives).<br>  <br>  The Talent Trees have all been reworked and now have Talents that require 50 previous points in that tree to get, in response to the 10 additional Talent Points avaialbe due to the higher level cap.<br>  <br>  The +SpellDamage and +Healing bonuses on equipment have now been combined into +SpellPower.<br>  <br>  Mages got a new FrostFire Bolt spell, which is basically the casting speed of Fireball, the damage of Frostbolt, and all the added effects of both spells. This combined with some of the Talent changes makes a Frost and Fire spec viable now, even though it is still pretty much only good for PvE Raiding.<br>  <br>  Arcane is much better than it used to be. It is the best PvE Raid spec once you have very good gear, but is too mana-hungry before that. It's also a good PvP spec when paired with a little Fire. Not as good as Frost with a little Arcane when played well, but Arcane with Fire is far easier to play.<br>  <br>  As for spec: What you've got there is pretty much the spec for doing both solo PvE and at least not particularly organized PvP. With this sort of spec, you want Arcane specifically for Clearcasting and Improved Counterspell, and work your way down into Frost for Fingers of Frost and Deep Freeze.<br>  <br>  Just like when BC came out and there was no point in leveling from 58-60 outside Outland, the same is true for 68-70 with WotLK.|`|Hvd82Owiaa	At level 68, you could go straight to Northrend and begin questing there.<br>  <br>  Here is all the information on Wrath of the Lich King:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/</a>|`|kBKLtW9qaa	I dont understand why people ask stupid questions like this?

or9ajX7Maa	Because you prefer to sit on your ***. It's too difficult for you to move.|`|lOuz0nU2aa	I thought it looked okay until I saw the games.<br>  It's good for 10 year olds to play.<br>  Pretty hardcore.. All that jumping around, running, and interaction.<br>  <br>  I have the 360 and Ps3, but NO WII. <br>  ( and I will never buy the Wii. )|`|yRh6JoC4aa	well i got my wii before my 360 and my wii sits there collecting dust because its hard to set up online and no good shooter/ fighter games really so all i got for it is LoZ: TP but when i got my 360 xbox live is easy to work and i got tons of games to love such as call of duty, halo 3, fallout 3, fable II, the list goes on and on and also the arcade games that come with it for free are great i thought the wii was a cool idea and i got it thinking it would be fun for shooters and sports games and because it was cheaper then the rest but it ended up "kiddying" up all the games so ya it ruined itself for me|`|ugaIZSjuaa	yea the wii is like if you cant afford a ps3 or 360 but yea the wii has some good games like brawl so you just have to look for the good wii games if you dont have enough for a ps3 or 360|`|iQ2hMr09aa	i like it, but i definitely prefer the 360 (fable 2) and ps3 (heavenly sword) :]
MDf0BoiNaa	any time ive ever been hung up on an update like that, when i reset the system, it usually works the second time. otherwise, just sign out of the PSN, and since you wont be online, the game wont know that you need an update, or that there even is one, and therefore wont ask you for one. usually the updates arent 100% necessary anyway, so it should work out fine
gfGsXVc3aa	One of my favorite places to eat is called Rancho del Zocalo they have mexican food and they are really inexpensive, especially because they portions are so big I always share, they don't take reservations because you find your own table so it cuts down on costs, it is right next to big thunder Mountain and has great indoor and outdoor seating. Another one of my favorites is Cafe Orleans they have great gumbo and a really great Monte Cristo there prices are fairly inexpensive and although I love sharing they do charge a $4.00 split plate but it is almost always worth splitting as well and you will save money depending on your appetite. PCH Grill is in the Paradise Pier hotel and is open for a character breakfast and Dinner which does not have any characters but is really worth eating there there portions are huge and they have GREAT prices. I always get Golden State Fish & Chips and get a salad instead of cali slaw it is allot of food and worth sharing plus if you are daring you can get the The Whole PCH Grill & Kitchen Sink it is insane they do take reservations and are about a 5-10 minute walk from Disneyland. Here is a website I always use it has all the Restaurants from Disneyland, California Adventure, Disneyland Resort Hotels and Downtown Disney, this way you can look at the prices and see what fits you. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://allears.net/dlr/din/menu/menus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://allears.net/dlr/din/menu/menus.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Also try the Blue Bayou it has great food and you can split the plate which still gives you allot of food and then it wont cost as much this is a must make reservations for restaurant, if you do make reservations for Blue Bayou when you get there ask for a seat by the water and that way you will enjoy it all.<br>   <br>  Hope this helps you and enjoy!  *Jena|`|43zXRpLYaa	The only places that takes reservations at Disneyland is the Blue Bayou and lunch/dinner is around $30 per person. All the other places you do not need reservations. Food ranges from $8 per person to $30 per person depending on where you eat.<br>  <br>  If you want to eat at the Blue Bayou, call and make reservations 30 days beforehand.|`|2P9SXEzGaa	Downtown|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	avoid the cues .... stuff yourself full before you leave the carpark<br>  <br>  Just kidding ... have fun there|`|rSwce38saa	Mickey mouse, so I can get a BIG HUUUUGEEE HUGGGGGGGGGG

98ZLBUSBaa	Call of Duty: World at War.<br>  One of the top 10 BEST xbox 360 games ever.<br>  Very fun whether your playing Campaign or xbox LIVE.|`|ZJjdur9Waa	For Single Player Fallout 3. Fallout 3 is AMAZING its really open ended with what you can do but they still keep an awsome story line. If you have 3 friends and 2 copies of the game (or a friend who has it) and another 360 get Left 4 Dead. Because seriously zombie survival situations with friends is AWSOME!! Another really fun game is  Devil May Cry 4 because Stomping demons is always fun.|`|HApdbf6Faa	I've played a ton of 360 games and definitely the best ones are (in no order) Gears of War, Gears of War 2, Fallout 3, and Halo 3.

4He3bNO7aa	Got to say that Sam gave an excellent reply and mirrors many of my own niggles with SL right now.<br>  <br>  SL is only difficult in that there is no set 'game plan'. You have to decide what you want to do. Being a newbie in SL can be very tough going, especially if you are on your own, so my first bit of advice is to make a few friends when you arrive at Orientation Island or Help Island. This way, you will have a friend who is as new as you are. Why is this important? Well, the learning curve in SL is very steep and when you are new to things there it's also very confusing. It's very common for newbies to think they are dumb or stupid and it's not helped by the fact that some veteran SL residents quickly forget that they were newbies too once and treat new residents with utter contempt. Being on your own and not knowing what's going on can be very demoralising. What a fellow newbie friend does is makes you realise that neither of you know what is going on. When neither of you know how to open a box, you realise you're not dumb, you just don't know how to do that yet. Because you cannot go back to Orientation Island or Help Island after you leave there, it's important to make that friend early on and share those first days and weeks together.<br>  <br>  One of the big mistakes new players make is thinking they have to have an SL job. Forget that for now, because you don't have the skills or experience to do an SL job. Just explore and get freebies. Go to dancing venues or interesting regions and ask questions of the people you meet. Don't be affraid to ask simple things like, 'How do I dance?', 'How do I get hair like yours?', 'How do I get to walk like you do?' and ... 'How the hell do I open this bloody box???'. To start with, don't have any set plan, because where you eventually find yourself in SL will just come to you in time.<br>  <br>  OK, so we have to discuss money. You should always start SL with the totally free account. Don't add your credit card details - just ignore the options about premium membership, card details or PayPal. Grab all the Freebies you can (search for a place called The Block and at the edge of the area you will find a building fulll of cool freebies) and look at stores for the things you would like to buy if you had some money. Create landmarks for these places so you can go back again later.<br>  <br>  If and when you decide that SL is for you, go to the Second Life website and login to your account. Then go to the update payment method and enter your credit card details (or set up a PayPal account). Do not opt for Premium Membership as this is only really useful if you have a successful business and need to purchase what is called Linden Land. Once you are back in SL you can now click on the 'L$' icon at the top of the screen and buy SL money. If this sounds like you are very quickly going to be broke in real life, then you should know that L$1000 costs around USD $4.80 and for a while you will be limited to buying just L$1000 a day. If you have been keeping a note of what you want to buy for your avatar, you will have a good idea of how much you plan to spend.<br>  <br>  You may be tempted to take up an activity called 'camping' to earn money in SL. A lot of people do this, but to be honest, it's a false economy. While you are camping you have to stay on the camping item. Some pay as little as L$1 for every 15 minutes you sit there and some have a 90 minute limit. Even if you find one that pays L$3 every 15 minutes, you are going to be sitting there for a long, long time to earn L$1000. When you consider the power to run your computer and the fact that you can't do anything else, it's a very expensive and boring way to make money. Worse, if you crash, or the region crashes or restarts while you are away making coffee, you lose all the money you earned so far since you started sitting there. In my opinion, it's more economical to just buy money. I have been buying money for 27 months this way and I've never had a problem. The only thing you have to take into account is if you are outside the USA, you need to check the exchange rate, but there are lots of websites with currency conversion devices.<br>  <br>  As for making your own things - well you say you've seen You Tubes. I suggest you check out the You Tubes by Torley Linden, or in SL, search for - and go to - a place called UCI Plaza. Not only does this place have some weird and wonderful freebies, but they also have free clases on every aspect of building, texturing and scripting in SL. When you decide to start building for yourself, get the free tools, textures, scripts, sounds and gestures at UCI Plaza and Yadni's Junkyard.<br>  <br>  Most of all, just have fun in SL and don't rush things. Go with the flow and opportunities will present themselves to you.|`|23LFplkjaa	Its fun and for basic membership its free.  They have their own currency called Linden.  You have to spend money if you want to look better.  Although there are lots of places around that you can get free stuff.  Including skins and shapes for your avatar.  Theres really no objective in terms of win/lose.  Its a nice way to meet people from around the world and be social.  They even have job fairs on there sometimes.  Theres a learning curve, might take a few days, but people are helpful and they have an island for noobies.  Give it a try.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	You can make real money, meet real people, find real love, and much more good.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, its loaded with players, hateful people, business owners with poor business practices, the grid is very unstable a lot of the time, they have a lot of downtime, the people that own it can depreciate in value any virtual land you pay real money for at the blink of the eye, they have poor customer service, and they have in their terms of use that they can shut down at any time without notice.<br>  <br>  Overall it is a fairly good place though. Its just like the real world. It has good and bad. I say try it for a week logging in a couple hours a day and then see if you like it.
e0c51b39028498ec82e61c51a9b0b0e5aa	According to a set of rules I found for this situation a ruling would be required, but Player A would have been bound by his call, even if it were out of turn.  From "Robert's Rules Of Poker" which is authored by Robert Ciaffone, better known in the poker world as Bob Ciaffone, a leading authority on cardroom rules: <br>  <br>  10. Deliberately acting out of turn is not tolerated. A player who checks out of turn may not bet or raise on the next turn to act. An action or verbal declaration out of turn may be ruled binding if there is no bet, call, or raise by an intervening player acting after the infraction has been committed. <br>  <br>  Now the question is whether or not the "deliberate" part of the rule comes into play, hence requiring a ruling.  But Player A was willing to call until he saw B's cards.  Since player C did not alter the action in any way then A's verbal declaration would be considered binding.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Home game, so home rules... but anywhere that I've played, player A made the call.<br>  <br>  The only problem I'd have is if player C saw the cards first, but he didn't, so he folded.  Player A is in.|`|YqJGwV4taa	Actually in a tournament setting the binding of player A isn't at issue. Player B's hand is immediately dead for showing his cards while there is still action behind him.
QkXI6WPBaa	The Powered Infantry Armor is the peak of armored infantry technology, initially developed in the West Tek Research Facility laboratories. Now, only the most technologically advanced factions with ties to pre-War military or government, such as the Brotherhood of Steel or the Enclave, have access to those, and only the latter possesses the technology required to manufacture new Power Armor models, such as the Advanced Power Armor and Advanced Power Armor Mk II.<br>  In Fallout 3, you must receive training at the Citadel from Paladin Gunny or complete the Operation Anchorage DLC mission before you can equip power armor. <br>  A number of companions, as well as NPCs who may follow the Vault Dweller can equip Power Armor without receiving training. <br>  It has been observed that Raiders can equip Power Armor that they might find. <br>  Enclave Power Armor can be obtained from defeated Enclave soldiers.|`|jxpV13rTaa	yeah its just power armor..you need to be trained in order to wear it..it is one of the bests, but tesla armor is not the best. the BEST armor can be found  at Fort Constantine (if i remember correctly) while doing a quest for mr crowley (ghoul). collect all the keys for him, but keep them for yourself to unlock the armor|`|s09BnJuXaa	That is called Power Armour and it is pretty good. It is worn by Brother Hood of Steel members, BOS outcasts, and Enclave soldiers.  There are many types of Power armour.  The best is Tesla armour.  Only worn by Enclave soldiers.|`|nsUeaPCLaa	the armor on the front is called the brotherhood armor. you must be far enough into the game to meet the brotherhood to get it. you can either kill one of them to get it, or on the last mission they will give it to you. But when they give it to you, you shouldn't say you are ready to go. You don't want to finish the quest because, well let's just say you won't have it afterwords. i don't want to ruin it for you. It's not worth it to bust your hump over. as long as you don't go along with the enclave, they will come down from helicopters randomly and attack you, and there is about a 40% chance that one will be wearing tesla armor. It looks almost exactly like the brotherhood armor, but cooler, and it has better benefits.

If you do it yourself you can get a good machine that can play all the current games. Probably not on the highest settings without a little bit of lag, but my total price came to around 700 US dollars, accounting for shipping of parts I would have to order. It's all about knowing what is more important and where you want to get spendy. I think the most expensive part I had on the list was the Graphics card.<br>  <br>  area 51 is overpriced, but Alienware is the best option for people who are unwilling or unable to build their own mid to high end gaming machines.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	I don't think that's the problem because most games don't require an extreme high end PC.  If you have a mid level PC, you can play most games.<br>  <br>  I think the biggest problem facing PC gamers is piracy.  Think how easy it is to download a game from the internet.  The Pirate Bay is getting sued for piracy, but the most serious charge against it was dropped, so most likely, The Pirate Bay will continue to contribute to piracy.  <br>  <br>  Why do you think EA put Securom on all their games?  If the PC industry can find a way to curb piracy, more games will be sold, which means developers will make more games for PC.

IxNQwrKYaa	The Ouija board is not a game, even if Parker Brothers markets it as such. It is a device whereby human beings can communicate with spirits. I have only used such a device once, and then I only asked the spirits one question: "Where do you get your power of divination?" The answer I received was enough for me to swear off of Ouija boards and similar devices forever. I'll tell you why later.<br>  <br>  There is a popular belief that an Ouija board has some inherent power, or that spirits live inside the board or planchette. This is not correct. The Ouija board is simply a board with letters, numbers, a few words, and copyright and/or patent information, and the planchette is a small inert device that has been designed to move easily across the board. There is nothing magic or mysterious about the board or planchette themselves, and the mere presence of such devices will not cause paranormal events to occur.<br>  <br>  The board's power comes from the calling forth of spirits. The participant(s) get(s) the attention of these spirits and ask(s) them questions, whereupon the spirits respond by moving the planchette around on the board. Many people believe a person can call forth the spirit of someone who has passed on, or some other specific entity, but this has never been proven, to my knowledge. The spirit(s) who are summoned will often not have any singular identity at all.<br>  <br>  Those spirits who do have identities will usually be vague, evasive or misleading about their names. This is because knowing their names can give the experienced summoner power over the spirits themselves, and the spirits can then be forced to do things they don't want to do. This is very undesirable to the spirits, of course, who want to keep their liberty and freedom intact.<br>  <br>  The spirits who are summoned in this way are never good ones. Good spirits will not respond to this type of summoning. Sometimes the spirits who are summoned are neutral or mischievous, and will often simply give random answers to participants' questions.<br>  <br>  Other spirits may be more powerful than these, and may actually have limited knowledge they may impart. However, these spirits are nearly always malevolent, and when summoned they may decide to take residence in the room or household where they are summoned. Sometimes they will even take residence in the participants themselves! Once they have taken residence, they can manifest themselves in our world of reality in real and very frightening, and in some cases very destructive, ways.<br>  <br>  Depending on the power of these malevolent beings, one may be able to drive them out in a variety of ways. These spirits are very legalistic, however, and some of them may have the power to take up permanent residence in the room, household or person they have elected to haunt.<br>  <br>  These spirits can only be gotten rid of by identifying the source of their right to be wherever they are, renouncing this right, and flooding the host with good spirits. They can then be forced to flee. Very powerful evil spirits may be difficult to exorcise even in this manner, but it is the only manner that has been proven to be successful.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this is the way you get rid of the malevolent spirits once you have them. You cannot prevent their permanent residence by any means, whether by religious icons, garlic, holy water, or whatever, because the actual calling forth of spirits is what gives them the right to stay. The calling of the spirits will override any preventive measures you could use to prevent their permanent residence.<br>  <br>  If you do call forth spirits to manipulate objects in the real world and divulge information, you are asking for trouble. My advice is, DON'T! No information received in this way is worth the potential risk of possession by evil spirits. Many lives have been completely destroyed in this way. Please, don't let this happen to you. If you are tempted to use divination devices to call forth spirits, get rid of them. Your life will be much better for it. - LJS|`|0H8AEvJkaa	Its a simple board to provide entertainment for fantasy play among a group of friends.|`|eKuvx6f8aa	Don't mess w/it.|`|iMULlxdgaa	big waste of paper/carboard...I recycled all mine with a bunch of old newspapers and boxes.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	the older ones are better, its a wood board and a metal oujia...the newer ones are a cardbord board and a plastic ouija........it is soooooooooo hard to get spirits that way

d60972a141a0ece3ed840882b5123229aa	you can go a many rides however be aware of things that happen in the background that could affect YOUR child that maybe would not affect another persons child. several of the rides have loud noises (for small children ears.) or could have thunder storm noises that if you have a child that is scared of thunder, could scare them. carousels, small world, dumbo are all good options. pirates have cannon fire during a short time as well as a quick drop. i mentions this because that ride does not have any type of safety belts. you know his tolerance more than we do. you can check www.allearsnet.com for more details on the rides.|`|pnZKH9LXaa	yes...<br>  <br>  <br>  but hes hardly two and you're gonna put him on rides? wait a year i say|`|9NpXU7D2aa	magic kingdom is a great choice for your son. <br>  <br>  yes he can go on dumbo and nearly every other ride as well. <br>  -carousel of progress<br>  -monsters inc laughing floor<br>  -its a small world<br>  -winnie the pooh<br>  -peter pan's flight<br>  -haunted mansion<br>  -pirates of the caribbean<br>  -jungle cruise<br>  -snow white<br>  -mickey's philharmagic<br>  -enchanted tiki room<br>  -flying carpets of aladdin<br>  -tomorrowland transit authority<br>  -tea cups<br>  -walk through mickey's house, and minnie's house<br>  -meet and greet with characters<br>  -parades<br>  -fireworks<br>  <br>  i haven't actually taken a 20 month old there but my parents took me as a baby and before me they took my 2 other sisters as babies. and obviously if my parents thought it didn't work well they wouldn't have continued to take us.<br>  <br>  my whole family is going next february (including my niece who at the time of the trip will be 22 months old)|`|93RWdcMDaa	Whats the point of taking a 1 or 2 year old to Disney World.

qpjorXRnaa	I would choose both parks in two days, because of experience..i live not far away from LA and the excitement is way too big for a single day!|`|i6RHI18Paa	If he is a local then he probably knows.<br>  <br>  I live in Florida, we have a "rat land" in Orlando. I know this: NO ONE can do a Disney park in one day. NO ONE! Not even Disney could do a Disney park in one day. The 2 day specials here are split so you are in one park one day, and the other park the other day. (Here it's a wrist band now and you go on any ride you want all day in that park.)|`|cCAGstnpaa	I say you should go to California Adventures because it is more fun. It has way more rides. And it has an upside dow roller coaster called California Screaming.|`|DDTiZRvzaa	both parks in two days, you will have more time and more fun!|`|mtqaIT3aaa	California Adventures. You see more celebs there. Plus, it's very similar to Disneyland. If you like thrill rides, definitely go to California Adventures! Enjoy :)|`|2P9SXEzGaa	I choose Downtown because it is free and they sell a lot of food there.|`|CjsFtjuhaa	For me, I would choose "Both parks in two days".  It would be hard to fit both Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure all in one day (if you want to cover all of the rides).  Two days would give you enough time to do one park at a time.<br>  <br>  Disneyland Park is the original (and my favorite).  It has more settle rides for the family and little kids, but it can be enjoyed by all ages.<br>  <br>  Disney's California Adventure is more thrill rides.  Currently, the Burger Invasion restaurant and the Sun Wheel are closed for refurbishment.  I would recommend this park for people who enjoy roller coasters.<br>  <br>  Here is the Disneyland Link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/home/home?name=HomePage" rel="nofollow">http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyla...</a><br>  <br>  Here is the Disneyland Calendar: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/calendar/daily/daily?name=CalendarDailyPage" rel="nofollow">http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyla...</a>|`|eKDYbe9Laa	better go 2 days.and seee.<br>  don't look on website. its not to be good

caL7yk7baa	hell yea|`|1pZLQSz0aa	probably not.... just order em from the internet|`|FYhGTJ29aa	I don't think so.

Mainly you have a pretty decent team all my pokemons at lv 100.|`|MFAVIW1waa	Cranidos. How come you haven't evolved it yet?<br>  -Zen Headbutt, Stone edge/Rock slide (don't have head smash), Earthquake, Assurance/Swords Dance/Rock Polish<br>  Luxray: Thunder fang, Ice fang, Crunch, Howl/Swagger<br>  Floatzel: Waterfall/Aqua Jet, Ice Punch/Ice Fang, Brick Break, Dig/Rain Dance<br>  Staraptor: Brave Bird/Aerial Ace, Close Combat, Double Edge/Return, U-Turn/Roost<br>  Heracross: Megahorn, Close Combat, Swords Dance, Night Slash/Stone Sdge<br>  Infernape: It's got a timid nature (+spd -atk) so i'll give it a special sweeper set. Flamethrower, Focus Blast (if it can learn it) or Close Combat, Grass Knot, Nasty Plot/Calm Mind<br>  <br>  Those are just suggestions for the final moveset they should have. You don't have to make them have it now. And as mentioned before Heracross isn't really needed coz you've got infernape as a fighting type so i suggest switching it with something like a blissey: Softboiled, Seismic toss, Thunder wave, Aromatherapy/Stealth Rock/Shadow ball|`|xorPm2gOaa	I would get rid of heracross. You already have infernape for fighting moves, and atraptor for flying moves. Plus, bug type pokemon won't do you any good to the elite 4.<br>  <br>  For infernape, I would let it learn dig because just in case he is your last pokemon and you are battling against a rock type, then you can go underground and kill the enemy then.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't want to have my luxray to learn swagger because if you use it, to an enemy, it makes their attack moves very much higher, and if it attacks, it can kill you. <br>  <br>  and for infernape, again, I would just let it exchange grass knot for a hyperbeam or something stronger than a grass knot.

88L1UHVZaa	After you complete the story in Fallout your character is done. Telling you why will spoil it so I won't tell you. Enjoy the game and quests before you finish the story because you'll have to do a new character after the story ends so.... Don't finish the story until you're done with the game!<br>  It sucks, I know, but take your time.|`|JEUshzOVaa	no u cant as ur character dies =( sucks i know!!|`|KU5SB6Tlaa	Sadly...and stupidly on Bethesda's part, the game ends.  This means any exploration, questing, or fun whatsoever must be had BEFORE the final quest in the main quest line.  This makes us all sad, and I think that this is the one thing that Oblivion did better (as far as game design goes)  So yes, your character is done.  Best to do what you want before you beat the game!|`|CQmITRetaa	Well...the game ends. Best is to do all the side quests then move to the main quests.<br>  <br>  I am doing the same right now.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Have Fun...|`|rBWm8pPuaa	it ends|`|joyRBLK9aa	i wont spoil the story but yes you cant do anything when u do the last mish so enjoy it now
mlyftc6baa	As far as PC games go, you really cant go wrong with any games made by "Valve", The Orange box, (including Half Life 2, Half Life 2 Episode 1, Half Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, and Team Fortress 2) is a good one. Counter-Strike Source is also good. Blizzard is also legendary on the PC gaming market, obviously you're acquainted with World of Warcraft, but  Warcraft III (with the Frozen Throne expansion) , Starcraft (with the Brood War expansion), or Diablo II are all well-received. RPGs like Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, or Fallout 3 have also received good ratings. Spore, a God-game is one of my current favorites. IF you're looking for other MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, then Id recommend Star Wars Galaxies, or Warhammer online. None of these I have mentioned should be overly-expensive, the most expensive probably being Fallout 3<br>  <br>  Edit: Almost forgot here are some more RTSs to chew on: <br>  Medieval: Total War, Rome: Total War, Empire: Total War, Civilzation IV, Age of Empires 3, <br>  <br>  and some more FPSs:<br>  Halo: Combat Evolved (with the custom edition download), Halo 2, or 3, Call of duty (all of them are pretty good),<br>  <br>  and another Valve game:<br>  Left4dead|`|iu0vQxR9aa	You could play:<br>  <br>  Runescape (MMORPG)<br>  <br>  Eudemons (MMORPG)<br>  <br>  Final fantasy 7 or 8<br>  <br>  SNES. Playstation, or N64 games with an emulator<br>  <br>  Diablo<br>  <br>  Unreal Tournament<br>  <br>  Counterstrike<br>  <br>  WarRock<br>  <br>  Left 4 Dead<br>  <br>  And I cant think of any others at the moment but thats a start.|`|5AwxqfLDaa	Halo PC. After that download Halo Custom edition for free.<br>  <br>  Star Wars jedi knight jedi academy. After that download movie battles 2 for free.<br>  <br>  Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.

Comes with new maps and map maker. only for windows vista.<br>  <br>  WOW wrath of the litch king. I suggest only if your level 40+<br>  <br>  Age of Empires 3. After that get Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties Expansions.<br>  <br>  Call of duty 4 or World at War. If you dont have it on any other systems.<br>  <br>  Thats about it.<br>  EDIT: Forget this answer. I suggest you read Gruzzy's. His has like every good PC game. (Exept a couple that he forgot that are on my list)|`|4gliQ2H9aa	Either of the COD's<br>  <br>  Some older games that are ballin are: CS:Source, Battlefield 2, Battlefield 2142, Medal of Honor Spearhead. Most of those you'll need a decent video card though.|`|FYhGTJ29aa	I would suggest trying Civ 4-the online play is especially fun. Spore, Sims 2 (Sims 3 is coming out on June 2nd if you're willing to wait), and most other EA games are also favorites of mine.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	Perfect World International. Its an online role-playing game that gives you as much character creation options as the sims(except for clothes, you upgrade your clothes as you play). The theme is fantasy, and you do quests to build your character, or eventually you can even better your skills by making stuff such as armor, weapons, or even magic.

oOly8Wj2aa	If you haven't done so already, the first thing you should do is to download the official Zoo Tycoon 2 patch, which will update the game to the latest version. You can download it from the link, below. When you click the "Download English" link on that page, click "Save" to save the patch to your computer. Then find where you saved the patch (your Desktop or wherever - it's called "Setup"), double-click on it, and let it install.<br>  <br>  After you've done this, downloading extra content to Zoo Tycoon 2 is easy - just click the Downloads option from the Main Menu once you've opened the game, then look through the download options available to you. Finally, click the Download button next to whichever add-on you'd like (e.g. the Spring Beautification Pack) to download and install it.<br>  <br>  The new content will appear in your game immediately and be ready to add to your Zoo.

GKJV2EBSaa	The reason why you can't wear legwarmers and bangs is because there both accessories and you can't wear more than one accessory at a time.I'v tried it before and it just doesn't work.Hopefully someone will find a glitch or something that let's your avatar wear more than one accessory.
k8fWo4Saaa	It depends how much space you have, if you want a small scale railway choose N, if you want a larger scale choose HO (also the most popular, by far) and if you have alot of room choose G (garden).|`|UtBb83Aeaa	So, you're looking to build a model train set? But you want pre-made scenery, too? Well, that kind of narrows things down a little bit. There is not much available in the larger scales with pre-made scenery. N scale is popular for people who are looking for plug-and-play train sets because you can buy pre-finished scenery.<br>  <br>  Noch is a German manufacturer that makes a number of pre-made scenery units. Here is an example:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eurorailhobbies.com/ERH/eurorailhobbieslist.asp?pageid=&MN=15&SC=N&offset=325" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurorailhobbies.com/ERH/euror...</a><br>  <br>  You would still need to buy the track separately, and then buy the trains to run on the track. Very few manufacturers offer everything all together, and those that do charge a lot of money for it.<br>  <br>  But if you're considering model railroading as a hobby... then you might think about challenging your self to learn about making your own scenery, building your own structures, etc. To learn more about the hobby, visit these sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.greatesthobby.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatesthobby.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nmra.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmra.org/</a>|`|XOPvmV5Iaa	It depends on what you're interested in. If you like a lot of detail and don't mind short trains, go with one of the bigger scales like O. If you're looking for an outdoor train, you'll probably want to to with G. <br>  <br>  If you like to run long modern trains N gauge is probably best for you. HO is a pretty good all around gauge with the most available accessories and ready-to-run stuff.|`|4jYg8k0Qaa	Space is a big factor (no pun intended).  HO is the most common because it's a decent size and still easy to handle.  I prefer O Gauge but as someone already pointed out, I'm limited to shorter trains given my space (and I have a layout of around 100 sq. ft.).<br>  <br>  O Gauge also brings the electrical simplicity of "3-Rail."  The 3-rail operation of O-Gauge makes it much easier to wire loops and connect tracks without having to worry about polarity.  I wasn't smart enough to handle 2-rail.|`|qgenlaEkaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  While not necessarily the cheapest in price, S Scale is the best in terms of size and detail vs. quality and performance. In model trains you get what you pay for. A cheap priced set will not run well and will annoy you.<br>  <br>  Go here <a href="http://www.showcaseline.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.showcaseline.com/index.html</a> and get a starter set. They have a lifetime warranty and excellent quality.<br>  <br>  Go to my website and look at other S Scale models.<br>  <a href="http://www.lanestrains.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lanestrains.com</a> Email me if you have any questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Bill|`|5hNAgTpaaa	---- I am always, very interested on building a full model of a train set, including its site and surrounding. I for sure can make all the train model site features, the mountains, the backgrounds, and even the right buildings. These days I'm thinking of starting building a model train set. My initial idea is to build something like not less than 6’X6’ size bass model.<br>  NOW; Please I want to know;<br>  1- From where to buy the best train model sets? Do I have to use the online shopping?<br>  2- Can I find the best train model scenery pieced in the same scale?<br>  SO, I will go and ask the same question, as the one hear. -----
wuS2zr2uaa	saints row 3 will come out but not now it will come out next year
qUuafpuwaa	Even though they suck in CC, the IG are it.<br>  In apocalypse you can ally them with your chaos army as heretics so that'll boost your army. So a 2,500 point chaos army and a 2,500 point Guard army=5,000 point apocalypse army.<br>  But as Games Workshop has said, this year is going to be big for the IG. <br>  New Leman Russ squadrons, Sentinels with plasma cannons and better armor, Ogryns have higher toughness, a Heavy 20(yes 20) ap6 tank. AND Valkyries!! Deathstrike missile( 1 shot per game S10 AP1 D3 +3 blast, ignores rule about half strength on vehicles if scatters off and a 960 in range!)<br>  For the amount of blast weapons you can have, you can't go wrong with IG.<br>  Although I would wait till may to get the new IG codex, but they look promising. New catachan models are cool looking and new ratling models are amazing.<br>  I play them myself and the ability to blow away half an orc mob with 1 shot from a basilisk is amazing (15 orcs if you;re lucky). Rough Riders are good at close combat and have fleet of hoof and spears that give a 1 shot ap2 attack in close combat(take that you darn termies).<br>  <br>  The ability to swarm fire warriors and broadsides with infantry to allow your tanks to take out other targets is also a good advantage.<br>  <br>  Necrons were nerfed in 5th edition so a new codex is coming out sometime in the future year, probably replacing the "We'll be back rule" with Feel No Pain. Necrons today have a rule that if 75% of your troop choices are knocked out, you "phase out"(a.k.a lose).C'Tan are going to leave in the new codex and be apocalypse only units.<br>  Tyranids are numerous, but have low armor and can suffer after a "synapse" beast is taken out in the game. Cool looking models though.<br>  Eldar are difficult to maneuver as all their choices are specialties except for guardians which suck. If you can't control their strengths and weaknesses, you will always lose.<br>  Dark Eldar are impossible to find, but most DE players kick total a$$.<br>  Chaos Demons are decent, but rely on invulnerable saves that can be canceled by immolaters.But can be numerous like IG.<br>  Space Marines...pretty much a chaos army without the chaos.<br>  Daemonhunters are pretty good, but have low numbers like SM.<br>  Orks have numbers, but suffer from  mostly 6+ armor saves and BS2. A full mob can get up to 90 attacks if all of them get into combat, but chances of that are slim.|`|befb9ffd5e4a504aaca7a2d679c187a0aa	Necrons. they have pretty much the same ranged abilities. And besides initiative are the same in close combat as a space marine. On top of that you have destroyers and imortals who out gun most units, and you have wraths and porias who beet most units in hand to hand combat. If you dont mind the the lack of veriety you can olmost always win. Plus necrons have war scieths (wich ignore all saves), we'll be back ability, and the monolith wich is the most terrifying non-super heavy in the game.|`|1WJO1y6faa	Well, Tau are fairly good in that regards as they have Kroot to back them up if things get hairy. Otherwise, Eldar are awesome fun. The Dire Avengers have an 18" range now as opposed to 12" for guardians, Dark Reapers can pump out heavy fire, same with War Walkers, Wraithlords etc (Star Cannons are fun). The other Aspect Warriors are awesome at what they do. Thing with Eldar is everything is fairly specialised (so Close combat things are good at that and nothing else) so it take a bit to get the balance right.

It'll work well for your gyarados and blastoise too because of all the fire pokemon there.|`|xorPm2gOaa	you can use the vs. seeker to battle lots of trainers. If you remember a specific trainer that's weak against charizard, then you can battle them again and again. You can train at the victory road, but you can't battle them again.<br>  <br>  All of them are good except for Muk. I would change it to a Mr. Mime. You can get it at the place near the first gym. You can get cut, or go to the city where the third gym is, and go inside the diglet cave and get to the other side. In one of the houses, there is a kid or guy who wants an abra, and he will trade you with a Mr. Mime. I like Mr. Mimie when I had him. <br>  <br>  I would change blastoise too. I have him right now, but he sucks. I would go for a lapras.

N334BErCaa	www.direct2drive.com<br>  They have pretty good sales from time to time and a pretty good selection.<br>  I would buy the discs though because you can resell them on eBay or something when you beat or get bored of the game .|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	From the developer's store itself.<br>  <br>  For EA games:<br>  www.ea.com<br>  <br>  steam is another good one.|`|iu0vQxR9aa	I would recommend getting a torrent application, such as utorrent, and going to torrentz.com where you can download all the free pc games you want!
uctxzjIIaa	The items contained in chest in FF12 have a lot of random chance built into them. Each chest has a set percentage chance of dropping gold. If it doesn't drop gold, it has a different percentage chance of dropping either of two rare items (which one depending on if your party leader has a Diamond Armlet equipped). If it is not gold or the rare item, it is then one of two normal items (again, determined by whether the party leader has a Diamond Armlet on). Also, some chests have a less than 100% chance of spawning each time you get within 3 zones of it, and some chests will continue to respawn after they've been opened before.<br>  <br>  That particular chast has a chance (I think it's 40%) of dropping a sword called Demonsbane. It's a significant step up from any other weapon that is available to you at that point in the game (except for a pair of rare weapons off of monsters that are rather hard to kill that early in the game). However, you can buy Demonsbanes in bulk just a few hours farther into the game, so it's not a huge deal.

I6vEYYLFaa	None of the Xbox 360 games have 1080p or will have it on the near future (or may never get it).<br>  <br>  The elite gives you the chance that if they do a software upgrade they may be able to create games that output at 1080p, you will not be able 2 do this without the HDMI and that why you should get the elite instead of the pro.<br>  <br>  You should also consider that MSFT already says it will not do this software upgrade to display 1080p because they don't want to fragment their customers in 1080p capable and not 1080p capable.<br>  <br>  At the end if it makes business sense for them they may change their minds.<br>  <br>  In the time been i have the best of both worlds i have the X360 pro (at least until the elite comes out) and i have the PS3 that is the only game machine with 1080p output for games (limited titles but they have some), and movies (all available blueray).<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.<br>  And make sure you get the elite (or the ps3)

The peak of each respective consoles' abilities.|`|KvvWfPu3aa	God of War. It is so freakingcool. you have puzzles, sex, violence and a crazy story line to go along w/ crazy bosses. get it then get #2.|`|l6e4rDG0aa	God Of War cuz its freakin awesome and you get to do crazy moves. also if ur into greek mythology and crap like that...GET IT! then if u beat God of War, get God of War 2.<br>  This one is bloody and is bit revealing for a few bosses and characters.Other then that its an awesome game.
AA10829097	9yj2-8xxw-lsjf-ee77-gzpb    thats it but its the complete collection but it should work because the complete means it has evything like unleased,vacation,superstar etc.
ybQaMekMaa	alright, lets see how good you are tonight..
a4LGeeI9aa	It's a stupid game. Rent only. I returned it after two days. Highly unpolished. It attempts to play an  MMO style with a single player.<br>   <br>  The game would probably be tons better when played CoOp online. <br>  But I personally am primarily a PC gamer, so I don't have PS3 friends to play with.<br>  <br>  Being a assassin is almost impossible because of wonky camera controls. Healing as a mage is pretty confusing, game doesn't exactly have life bars for your allies. Annoying voice work.

2edd6cc76a3c0595af2050bba55c3515aa	yes i have heard about it and there will be a goldrush
gfGsXVc3aa	First let me tell you that since you have reservations, to get there before you reservation time and ask for a seat by the water you may wait a little more then your scheduled time but it is very romantic and special. Also I was just there a week ago for my Birthday and as long as you wear your birthday button they will give you a free desert which for me was Chocolate moose with a raspberry drizzle on top. <br>  <br>  About the food yes it is expensive but you can make it less expensive, we always go there and always get a split plate it is a $5.00 charge to get a split plate but you get allot of food and your own Cajun-inspired wedge salad or a cup of our signature New Orleans gumbo. Which since you are a vegetarian then it would be the salad just make sure you let then know you are vegetarian they some times add a dry meat pieces on the side of the salad. They have a great Portobello Mushroom and Couscous Maque Choux which is so so good. You could also just go for Desserts mind you that they don't serve alcohol so if you go there for drinks it would be Soda, juice or Coffee. Also here is a website with the Disney Resorts menu and you can look at Blue Bayou and see there menu and prices and see what suites you. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://allears.net/dlr/din/menu/menus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://allears.net/dlr/din/menu/menus.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps and enjoy your trip and Happy early B-day. *Jena|`|AA11795652	The atmosphere is fun.  My husband and I went there for dinner and were disappointed with the food for the price.  If we ever go back again, I would only get dessert.  I didn't feel the food was tasty enough for the price.  I liked the salad but I got fish and the fish wasn't too great.  I know you're a vegetarian but I've heard others say that the meals aren't all that.  And, I asked the server if it's okay to just come in for dessert, and she said, "Of course!"  Have fun!|`|p5tZ8PIxaa	I went to the Blue Bayou and it was delicious. They are pretty pricy, but it is a really romantic and interesting setting! I didn't order desert there, but I am sure they have some! Drinks, definitely.
PuxYfJR9aa	If it's that big of an offset in timing it's not an issue with the pad or the TV. Go into options and look at the "sync", it should be at 100% (or +0 depending on which version it is).

AA11107069	I think it's an awesome trailer. i dont know abt the game though...  im sure the multiplayer aspect of it will be top-notch, there's no questioning that.  But the story is getting to be overblown, even for HALO.  i thought the single-player campaign was a liitle "meh", nothing special.  I hope Bungie doesnt get too carried away with the story or it will end up being the video game equivalent of "the Matrix" trilogy.|`|ab20c892a252ad8b981652e225e2a754aa	The trailor is pretty awesome and really cool. Halo 3 is going to be the final game in the Halo series.( Said on halo 3 behind the scenes trailor on Xbox.com) So bungie is probably going to do all they can on the game and try their hardest on the gameplay,graphics, and storyline.|`|AA12158508	The trailor was nothing more than that, a trailor. It won't be used in the game and it honestly didn't reveal anything new. Halo 3 will be pretty sweet though.

If so, the maker is Natsume. The first version was available for Super Nintendo; there have also been versions for the Game Boy and at least one each for the Game Cube and the PSX. (The PSX version was a port from the Super Nintendo, I believe.)<br>  <br>  ..If it turns out NOT to have been Harvest Moon, you now have a lot of useless information, but at least it might be a game you'd be interested in.|`|e8e4d0ca8993e7951427415ab948de69aa	On the computer I was thinking of SIM FARM or something like that.  I ran across two board games recently about farming- one is LIFE ON THE FARM and the other one is called THE FARMING GAME.  Life....was purchased at a local TSC and Farming...was purchased at the mall.  As a previous poster said, if this isn't it- you have more useless info!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

It sounds fun but its a very bad investment if you dont have the latest system.

AA11357293	You can probably fit 3 or 4 movies on a 2 GB memory stick.  Try videora, they have a psp compression program that words well and is free.  Make sure you set the settings to 29 fps, otherwise the audio won't match the video at the end.  I have the ipod program, but I'm assuming it is the same thing for the psp.

The direction you draw the lines (with your mouse) will determine whether the line is a "ground" piece or a "ceiling" piece. Example, when creating the beginning of the track you will need to use ground pieces, but if making a loop, you will need ground and ceiling pieces. Once you think you have the track all set, there should be a play button. When pressed, the rider will fall to your track and begin his ride. If the track is not drawn properly the rider will crash and you will have to fix it. I have made a few tracks, but nothing special. I have seem some very impressive tracks which lead me to believe that there is a track editor floating around the web, because the original version does not have an option to delete portions of the track. The game was created by some one at deviantart, try googling linerider and deviantart in the same search, should yield results including the original game. Hope this helped.

I had the same problem.  If you registered you XBOX when you bought it then they will be able to know if it was under warranty.  You have a one year warranty when you buy it.  Xbox will try to work you through the problem but it is messed up.  If it is under warranty they will send you a box threw UPS and then you will mail it back.  The whole process is under 2 weeks.  They sent me a different XBOX but I think now they will send yours back to you.  If it was bought less than a year ago you have no problem.  If it was over a year ago buy a new one.  Also if you have a hard drive it is not messed up so you could buy the cheaper version and keep your hard drive.|`|b5db7217ed1e213aa12f6d3bead08875aa	this isn't an answer to this questions.

Bcz19hS6aa	If you are deciding on buying a ps3 or a mac you need to consider the pros and cons of both<br>  mac: -has many iproducts such as itunes iphoto and many other useful tools<br>  - The gaming communaty is ever present in the computer world. Although you may be left behind in the pc gaming race becuase of vista and the games for windows brand ever present in the electronics isle.<br>  -Even though the ps3 has a internet multilpayer function (i think) The mac allows you to surf the great wide internet space allowing you to download lots of addicting games en masse. the 360 has realized this and made the marketplace a area to buy these things.<br>  -To put it shortly the mac is a computer and computers have power. they can do a wide variety of things that are far and wide and will give you a much better start (or end) in life.<br>   <br>  ps3<br>  - the six axis. unlike the easy fumbled mouse this graceful controller allows a wide variety of entertaining actions in-game AND out. trust me though you may need some practice cuz the oceon motion can just as easily become a raging bash'n thrash'n.<br>  - ps3 exlcusive games, although these games are increasingly letting over to the pulling hand of the 360 and wii<br>  there are still some incredibly fun games that are ps3 exclusive. Mainly becuase the ps3 can put out better than others. to name my favorite lair,resistance:fall of man. <br>  -The system is a gaming console and it excels at what it does pushing buttons and making wave after wave of zombies while waving my controller and in turn my gladiotors sword in the air, seems so much more appealing then making ninja movies alone with your mac|`|ec2ummRBaa	i say a mac.
h9VbB8MAaa	becuz of how they were used wen they were made.they were also first made of marble,and used them to play the game,marbles,which was originally played with rocks.Why they called the game of marbles,marbles,is becuz of the fact that  they were the size of a forged marble stone.<br>  I hope this answers your question!|`|0fa6e7a976f33ebe667eda272fe99929aa	Marbles were made from clay, or marble, hence their name.<br>  <br>  Marbles are often mentioned in Roman literature, and there are many examples of marbles from ancient Egypt. They were commonly made of stone, metal, or glass until the 18th century, when ceramic marbles become more common.<br>  <br>  Ceramic marbles entered inexpensive mass production in the 1870s.<br>  <br>  Glass marbles entered mass production in the early 20th century, when World War I cut off their importation from Europe, causing American innovation to be applied to the task, producing a mechanized method of glass marble production which became the most common system in the world. Glass marbles, too, became the most popular variety, and have remained so to this day.<br>  <br>  In some developing countries children use steel minerals or large rocks as a less pricey marble substitute|`|f76af9289f94e7e6e6eb1398d8e7ca71aa	cause they look like it.|`|mAS8Y2uEaa	I think because there Shiny and have designs and its a game

zgUClKZ0aa	Have you checked out Creative Memories' Storybooks?  It is a free download and has many themes from which to choose.  You can even mix and match.  Another plus is that you don't have to be on-line to work on your book.  You only have to be on line when you're ready to upload your book to be printed.  <br>  <br>  I have not personally made one of these books yet but I know several people who have and they are really neat.  They are higher quality - thicker pages and stitched binding - than some of the others that are available.  (I worked in a library for 11 years and the type of binding a book has makes a big difference in the wear and tear of the book!)  I have been very impressed by the books I've seen and can't wait to do one myself.

Top Line Creations offers DVD's, CD's, and photobooks made from your creations.  You can also burn your own CD of the album at home, or you can upload your pages to a printing service of your choice, even Costco!<br>  <br>  I love this option because it does not require me to be connected to the Internet.  The program includes SEVERAL themes already, and you can download more from the TLC website, or any other website you choose.  I have bought additional themes for as low a 99 cents.

Your brother has the 360, so get a PS3.|`|rhlLt1yfaa	i would say both of the consoles  are both pretty good but i would have to say the Xbox 360. because its one of the most user friendly consoles. for example. when you create a gamer profile you can customize ALOT. your name of corse, theme, or "background as they call it", and alot of your other changable features come along with xbox live. i know it may sound like a struggle to get xbox live but when you get it its worth it. even if you dont get live the system is plenty changeable. literally you can get skins for the outside of your xbox and different plates for the front so you could totaly customize you xbox. i dont see the ps3 doing that but hey if you want a big chunky pice of garbage then the ps3 is for you. so if you have nay other questions BEFORE you buy it than hit me back ps. i do think there going to come out with a new xobx but not for like 3-5 years i think.|`|q0kdv8N5aa	It depends on if you play online much.<br>       -Xbox is cheaper than a PS3, but with the Xbox you have to pay to play online. <br>       -With the Xbox you have better servers with online play.<br>       -There are some PS 3 and Xbox exclusive games, so if you like one very much, you should buy that console.<br>  <br>  I don't know when/if there is coming a new version for both.|`|X95I8ZfXaa	If i was you I would buy the ps3 the xbox 360 has a nasty habbit of breaking just before your guarantee is up?<br>  the ps3 is more reliable|`|AA11613052	I have been asking the same question and everyone i ask says PS3..<br>  The new 160G version is out soon so wait a little while before yoiu go and buy one!!..

It is near the entrance courtyard, go out onto the Viaduct and its there. <br>  <br>  With the thestral food, you first levitate it behind the first couple of rocks but then a bit up the hill there is a ditch in it where if you levate it there it will stay then there is another a bit further up then once your there you can place it at the clearing ground. Its easy. The ditches have a pinky colour on the ground , a different colour from the grass so there easy to see.<br>  <br>  With the mandrake root, you go to the greenhouse and go to the last room where you go to the earmuffs put them on then cast a spell over the mandrake (probably accio or winardium leveosa) and it comes out.<br>  <br>  With Hanna Abbott, go down to the bottom of the stair case where she is and go to the other end where when you go up the stairs there is a portrait of a man.

There is a HUGE difference between a standard TV and HD TV.<br>  <br>  As far as the consoles, I'm a Halo junkie so if it were me I would get the Halo 3 edition.  But if your geting a new one, get the Premium. 20 gigs can last a long time, but you never really know how much your going to download in the long run, so might as well get the 120gig system.|`|BfDfSs4waa	i would go with the normal one. i play without hd and i went to my friends house and i didnt even realize we were playing in HD. there isnt much of a difference. but thats just me.|`|B5gTvfTTaa	TopGun, you do realize you need to plug in the HD cables then flick that switch right?<br>  <br>  I have not played my 360 on an HD tv, but I have on my laptop and the difference is past amazing. (Compared to a regular tv)<br>  <br>  I would go for the elite version.<br>  The hard drive is a bigger issue than you would think.<br>  I have a Premium 20gb and have no space left.<br>  I only have 8 demos on it.<br>  <br>  Demos are usually 1gb.... even short ones.<br>  The 360 also has a 8gb or so cache, so on a 20gb hard drive you only have 12gb of space or so.<br>  <br>  Plus, the black 360 looks cooler.|`|zT3iHUaVaa	I use a premium console as well and no HD here. However, reguarding price of the Elite etc., there have recently been leaked images of a price cut. It is not sure if all models will be receiving this, but it'd definately be worth it to wait and see if the price cut would make the Elite a more affordable choice for you.

AIvZDyhoaa	No you have to download the video to your pc then from your pc connect your pc to your psp via the usb cable and simply drag and drop the files in your psp.<br>  <br>  This is the easiest and quickest way, When I download videos directly from the internet on my psp the videos freeze or stop downloading for some reason|`|XFhn2apeaa	yh i have searching around and most videos you download are .avi (supported) and .wmv (not supported) with the .avi it allows you to download straight to video cause it recognizes it but when its downloaded  its either "Unsuported" or "Corrupted". I hate that only a few websites with videos work.

JedjRKbEaa	Great idea but needed to be mapped on the control scheme better, and the OL AI needed to be beefed up, had the problem of no matter what team I was playing the DL seemed to penetrate to quickly before I was able to get the cone lined with the reciever to throw.  If these things were fixed I think its great.|`|Gm3RgfALaa	I do... but u can turn it off|`|i7XVQlucaa	no its useful and makes gameply more interesting
YHAd7qcHaa	Personally, i think the 360 has about the same games as the PS3, but has a bit better graphics and is also less expensive. it also has halo and other great games.  But the two are almost the same so get a Wii.  Or you could get a wii and 360 and take back ur ps3 if u still have the reciept and can get a full refund.

TKks47Raaa	I'm stuck there too. But I've found that the order in which you find items is important. You can choose to ignore an item which will open up another item to be found. That means you only seem to be able to find one item at a time.<br>  <br>  However, even if you find different items you still can't solve the mystery so I'm stuck as well. Also note that once you find an item, the witnesses stop talking.

Then go to "cheats." <br>  Next you MUST write this code in correctly with spaces or it <br>  won't work. <br>  The code is: up up down down left right left right b a select start<br>  if not entered correctly the code will not work. <br>  <br>  Googun:<br>  -------<br>  In level 2-2, walk right on the screen after the first metal bridge. You will<br>  go up an incline. Once at the top, there is a stump. Jump it and there will be<br>  another. Hold [Modify] and crouch to fall, then shoot to the right to unlock <br>  the Googun. <br>  <br>  Extra weapons:<br>  --------------<br>  In levels 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3, you can get a machine gun and/or machine gun ammo <br>  clip from every heli you destroy. Get the heli down to enough health, so that <br>  it will only require one grenade to kill it. Use Hyper Jump (hold [Modify] and <br>  press [Jump]) to get very close to the heli. You must be close enough to touch <br>  it. Use a grenade to finish it off. The heli will drop a machine gun clip with <br>  only 25 ammo in it. Note: This will not effect any of the weapons that the helis<br>  usually drop; every other time you use this trick you will get two items. <br>  <br>  Level 2-2: Hiding location:<br>  ---------------------------<br>  In one of the grass levels (level 2-2), you can go under the hangout if you <br>  press [Space]. You can then hide from the enemy. If you jump up onto the bridge<br>  above, you cannot go straight down. You must walk over.<br>  <br>  Nuke:<br>  -----<br>  In training mode, hold [Space] and switch to Timebreak mode. Hold [Shift] and <br>  start out with the pistol. While holding [Shift], shoot a horseshoe shape around<br>  your body, sort of like a forcefield, with all the bullets. <br>  Continue holding [Shift] and switch to every weapon and do this until you get to<br>  the railgun. Release [Shift] and enjoy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a orange cloud using the flamethrower:<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Go to the training room. Select the flamethrower weapon. Shift through the <br>  different times (timebreak, etc.) and at the same time fire the weapon, You <br>  should see a cloud shape forming. This is useful when taking down copters.<br>  <br>  FlakCannon:<br>  -----------<br>  In order to unlock the FlakCannon you must go to the training area. Then go to <br>  where you can shoot the targets. Go into top of that "tower" and use Time Distort<br>  (everything slows down). Do a Hyper Jump to the platform where that gun is located.<br>  <br>  Chain gun:<br>  ----------<br>  To get the Chain gun early, go to the training level and follow the instructions <br>  until you get to the ladder. Look to your left. You should see a wall. If you shoot <br>  the wall it will break. Keep shooting until it will not break anymore. The Chain <br>  gun will be there. If you have already unlocked the Chain gun, you will just find <br>  an ammo drop.<br>  <br>  Cheat:<br>  ------<br>  Submitted by: pavneet864201<br>  <br>  Press at cheats up up down down Left right Left right b a select start<br>  <br>  Hint:<br>  -----<br>  Submitted by: mert128<br>  <br>  you should use your weapons that you get from helis at lvl<br>  4-2.soundwaaves and bladerangs are most afecctive to big helis.<br>  <br>  Hint:<br>  -----<br>  Submitted  by: SOMEONE orkydork<br>  This isn't really a cheat but its cool, go to the training camp place, <br>  go to flamethrower, and then right when you fire, switch and hold the <br>  time mode thing (ctrl R). Then make a circle around you of the blue <br>  flames, the more the cooler, then let go of the time thing, a burst <br>  of fire pops out!!<br>  <br>  Training level: Get flak cannon ammo: <br>  -------------------------------------<br>  Go to the area where you have to shoot the robot holograms. Get on top of the highest <br>  column and do a hyper jump to the left while holding [Crouch] just before the platform<br>  in the air.<br>  <br>  Hint:<br>  -----<br>  Submitted by: cheatterror<br>  <br>  New heli attck cheat is if u wanna go lvl 6 type <br>  \new level 6 unlocked\ its cool but a hard lvl<br>  <br>  Hint:<br>  -----<br>  Submitted by: ronnie<br>  <br>  the code is unlimited life hears wht you do go to cheats and type in boogie 5 and go <br>  to start and you should have unlimited life.<br>  <br>  Spark Plug gun:<br>  ----------------<br>  In level 1-3 there is a bridge. Hold [Modify] (default is [Space]) and [Down] on the <br>  right side of the bridge. You will drop down. Then, use any weapon on the right side <br>  of where you dropped down to break the five sections of the wall to unlock the Spark <br>  Plug gun.  <br>  <br>  Soundwave gun:<br>  --------------<br>  On level 3-3, go to the second metal bridge and use [Modify] (button can be found in <br>  pause menu, which is P). Do it again and you will land on a third bridge very low down. <br>  Shoot to the right as far as you can go, then shoot up. You will find the Soundwave gun.<br>  <br>  Special effect:<br>  ---------------<br>  Enable the "All weapons" code. Go to the training level. Find any clear space that has <br>  no walls nearby, and select the Bladerang. Hold [Left Shift] + [Space] + E until you <br>  see Timebreak. Hold [Left Shift] and shoot as many rounds as desired around your body. <br>  When you are done, release [Left Shift] and watch! <br>  <br>  Earthquake:<br>  -----------<br>  Enable the up up down down left right left right b a select start, then go to the <br>  Training Zone. Hold [Left Shift] + [Space] + E until you see Timebreak. Next, switch <br>  your weapon to the A-Boom Launcher. Hold [Left Shift] and shoot 25 rounds of the A-Boom <br>  in an arc around you. Then, release [Left Shift]. As soon as the first A-Boom hits <br>  something, the entire screen will start shaking non-stop for 47 seconds. You get an <br>  even longer earthquake when you use the BlackHoleGenerator. Note: If you choose to <br>  use the BlackHoleGenerator instead of the A-Boom Launcher, it takes about 475 seconds <br>  (about 8 minutes) to set it up. However if you use the A-Boom Launcher, it takes about <br>  95 seconds (about 1 minute and 35 seconds) to set it up.<br>  <br>  Machine gun ammunition:<br>  -----------------------<br>  Finish off any enemy during a hyperjump with any weapon. <br>  You will automatically receive machine gun ammunition.<br>  <br>  Predator weapons:<br>  -----------------<br>  If you tipe in alien bownty hunter you can play predator from alien V.S. predator <br>  with all of predators weapons.

sxaZ995Yaa	Hi there. I have played through KOTOR 2 many times, now and always with cheats. How you do this will depend on your operating system. If you have Vista, I have found that you will have to download an alternate notepad program to do this (I find Notepad++ works well). Otherwise, just use notepad as normal and save it under the save name at the same location.<br>  <br>  What am I talking about? Well, to do this, you will need to go into the KOTOR 2 directory in your program files; generally found at: "C:\Program Files\LucasArts\SWKotOR2". Double-click on the file labelled - swkotor2.ini. (the .ini is the file type, if you don't see it, just click "swkotor2". This should open up notepad (or your notepad application, if you did it through windows explorer). Once you are in the file, go to the group of settings with the heading: "Game Options". On the first line underneath the heading, type in this: "EnableCheats=1" (with no quotation marks). Then you can save the file and open the game. When you are playing the actual game, just press the ` button and type in the command. Once you have done this, press enter and watch the fireworks.<br>  <br>  Troubleshooting:<br>  <br>  If you are having problems with this cheat:<br>  <br>  Check that you typed the EnableCheats=1 code into the file: swkotor2.ini and not swplayer.ini.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you are pressing the right button in the game. If not, there is your problem.<br>  <br>  If you have KOTOR 1 installed, make sure that you are not editing the files in that (note: the EnableCheats=1 code works the same in KOTOR 1, as it does in KOTOR 2.<br>  <br>  If you type in the wrong command, nothing will happen at all. The game will continue without the cheat or a message box telling you that the cheat didn't work.<br>  <br>  Lastly...<br>  <br>  I recommend the site gamespot.com for cheats and reviews for games. It has a list of dozens, if not hundreds of KOTOR 2 cheats and I have used their site for many years.<br>  <br>  Thanks for reading. Answer you later.

AA11475571	I am afraid that the right answer might be that you have a defective funkey.
YKQUl7Ahaa	I'm a big RTS fan, so I think I'm going to pick this game up, but as far as limited edition, well, its $20 more, and what you get is:<br>  <br>  -Honor Guard Wraith (Just aesthetically different from normal Wraith)<br>  <br>  -6 Leader Cards (turns out these are just physical cards in the box that have pictures and info about "leaders" in the game, no in game content)<br>  <br>  -Halo 3 Map Pack a month earlier than you would get otherwise.<br>  <br>  -A graphic novel by Danielle Steel (not really, but you'd probably be more interested, wouldn't you?).  It's really "Halo Wars: Genesis"...woo hoo!  If you're a halo nut, you might flip through this.<br>  <br>  -A "spirit of fire patch for identifying yourself as a real crew member."  Not a game update kind of patch, just a patch, like for the hole in your jeans.<br>  <br>  You get the flaming warthog if you preorder the game, regardless of limited edition or not.  Code emailed to you within 10 days, post release date.  May vary by retailer.  Check amazon.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm voting no on limited edition.  I might be tempted if I still played Halo 3 to get it for the map pack, but I'd probably still say no.  I'm going for the normal edition.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	Limited edition does include Mythic maps and a cool art book.

It's an article with a good website link list of places to watch free movies. You can watch old movie classics or new releases. They have a foreign movie list too.      I like this article because the websites on the list don't have 50 million pop-ups and you're not require to register or install something useless before you can watch a movie.  Saves me a lot of hassle of going through a lot of crappy sites.    This list is all you'll need since most of these "free movies or TV show" websites get their movies from the same sources.    Enjoy!    Peter|`|efqgNTX6aa	Watch movies on http://www.reoro.com & http://www.tvnux.com
J4v5xNg2aa	No, No Gran Turismo for Wii. They are coming out with a Wii specific game, GT Pro Series, or something like that. It's cell shaded so it's not as graphic intense as PS3, kinda cartoony actually. I prefer Need for Speed myself.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Nope. Polyphony, the studio that makes Gran Turismo games, is wholely owned by Sony.|`|QuktVKL2aa	no, but to get informed, go to game websites such as gamestop.com, or search Google.|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	Uh. No.  Gran turismo Is A Sony Made Game.  Why would sony give Nintendo A game?|`|q11Ktlojaa	wii sucks. pure and simple|`|Q5kHHBIHaa	No they havent yet.|`|q6uyloYdaa	No, and it is doubtful that they ever will. Gran Turismo is a Sony franchise, so those games will (at least for now) only come out on PS3.|`|QQFSc07iaa	nope ps3 exclusive unfortunately :(|`|ZK6aLX9Kaa	No im positive but I think they might soon

Steal the permanent marker and just scribble on the back of your hand, try not to get ink poisoning, so no one can tell..?
23LFplkjaa	No, it has single play, but you need an Internet connection in order to download it.  The file is almost 2GB.  Took me damn near an hour.  Its kind of fun.  For 20 bucks I can't complain|`|I2jS1AMKaa	its online and ofline u can play co op and multiplayer.|`|cCKASg4Waa	You just download it from XBOX Live. No it's not purely online.<br>  <br>  It's basically an entirely new game set in Liberty City. You play as a member of a biker gang (the same biker gang you get in a scuffle with in the original GTAIV). You interact with other certain characters from the original game too.<br>  <br>  I heard it's actually pretty good.|`|vdJimPfqaa	idk

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	I think you need to check the law for Scotland, as part of the UK it should have the same laws as England when it comes to the treasure trove law. The person that finds the coins plus the landowner are entitled to a fair market value. The Crown has the option to call the item a nation treasure so to speak and by it or let the finder and land owner sell it. They did this so that the finders got something out of the find and the archaeologists plus the museums get a chance to add the find to the history of the UK. It helps all people and is a very fair law, I wish the U.S. had such a law.|`|jI85GYGoaa	Not quite sure what you mean by 'hammered' coins?/    Doesnt it rather depend on whether the coins are made of gold or silver to be considered treasure trove and subject to Crown Law.    Copper / bronze artifacts whilst of great historical value/significance are not subject and remain the property of the current Landowner and since a significant proportion of 'Detectorists' are not the legal land owners hence the ambiguity.    Sincere apologies to legitimate enthusiasts.    Best Wishes

NxzMU91qaa	It could be that you are viewing the wrong type of files. Have you checked the memory card on the computer to make sure it is still on there? if it is on their and not showing up on the R4 try pressing "Select" when looking at your games to switch views.    Hope that helped.|`|evhwdzG3aa	when you have the list of games on screen and press x the game highlighted deletes maybe someone was using it and done it by accident|`|ECjAFUNRaa	i second the first person's answer. it happened to my friend once too. i think that one entry of your missing game on the list is your save file, so just re-download the game and put it on. you should still be able to continue play from where you left off.
NxeuJRwKaa	First of all. Think what may happen to you if you rode the ride you just built. whiplashes, hard sharp turns etc. etc. when building roller coasters in RCT3 the first drop should always be the highest (depending on what coaster you make) the ones following it should be less than or equal to it's former hill or inversion. never slow down the coaster sometimes quick short rides can be intense depending on what kind of inversions, drops you have on them.

Z2EzfQFvaa	Very good.Nice moves and team combo.8/10.Don't listen to Twilight fan 1..shes just stupid.She likes twilight..so she can't think for herself..she is a slave to the media..a brainwashed slave.|`|RTa3g9ZHaa	Please don't listen to that girl who called you a loser, I'm 15 and I love Pokemon.    Typhlosion - Take out flame Wheel for Thunder Punch so you can be Super Effective on Water Types. You can get the Thunder Punch TM from Goldenrod City Mart.    Suicune - Go to the move deleter in Blackthorne City and get rid of Waterfall for Surf. Get rid Blizzard for Ice Beam.    Gyrarados - Get rid of Dragon Rage for Earthquake.    Sudowoodo - Fine    Butterfree - Get rid of Psybeam for Sun Spore     Pidgeot - Get rid of Gust for Toxic    Try to get everyone to around level 55 for a chance of winning.|`|fxH6T7vCaa	That's a good team, you have a pretty good chance of winning! I have the game pokemon,diamond version on ds, it rocks!!!!!|`|31sPPNpTaa	Wow... that's quite an impressive team.  You guys are going to dominate this tournament.  And once you do, you'll be able to have any woman that you want.  Way to go, killer!|`|ZGj4ww9jaa	those are all great pokemon. i cant remember which ones i used i havent played it in years! id get them all up to at least 55. i still do play pkm though|`|lFC2mqCcaa	First I just wanto say how Pokemon is the most awsome game, and crystal is probably the best one!  Ok keep the typhlosion especially with its fire punch and flame wheel.  Suicune is good too, but try a TM on him...all his moves are water except gust which isnt very powerful, so I would recomend somthing that is normal.  Gyarados is a very good choice but hard to rase...you did a very good job with it, you probably have the best moves for it, cant give you much to work on with him besides rase the level.  Suddowoodo, well, lets just say hes not the best of the bunch...but with those moves that can KO in one move you may just find him a winner  Butterfree, LOSE THAT GUY!  butterfree stinks except his psychic attack, but you only get either 10 or 15 of those so...i mean I would swap for a pokemon that you can catch in the victory road like rhydon or somthing.    Pidgeot, been there done that, he doesnt work, though hes one of the easyest to raise in the begining of the game he stinks thoughout the rest of the game, though koga and his bug types are weak aginst wing attack, he really cant do much damage.  I mean Wing attack, quick attack, and gust are only 40 dammage attacks, ya cant do much with those moves.  Pokemon get up to level 60 in the elite 4(5 if you count ur rival) so I would recomend giving all your money to ur mom and then taking them on with the idea of loosing.  Just rase them up with all that expo points.    Hope I helped you out, just raise them a couple of levels and you will do great!    BTW the people that you will battle are    First a person who has DARK type pokemon  Second a person who has Bug type pokemon  Third ???????  Forth a person who has Dragon type pokemon (i thinks i cant remember)  5th its a jumble of diffrent types, and he is tough so be preparred for the toughest battle you have ever faced!|`|cxGoIP7Zaa	I think that you have a pretty powerful team.
456d5ad3a8a71be15284cd432035dd05aa	No, the person who told you "worlds 3 and 6" is wrong.  You defeat worlds "2 and 5" as mini mario.  To hurt the boss with mini mario, you must ground pound them.    But he is right about the luigi one.|`|W1RUAUbPaa	get the alternate routes for world 3 and 6.     i think when there is the button to start the game in one player, if you hold L and R or either one (cant remember) you can play as luigi
DDQwdurBaa	Garry's mod is only free for older versions. The new, updated, and far superior version costs $10. You shouldn't bother with the older versions.     The Orange Box costs $30.     I recommend buying both through Steam.|`|AA11414384	get a steam account and downlod garyys mod for free and u might get a deal on orange box i got it for 29.99 dollers wich is 15 pound uk

Yp9oJpuGaa	dont listen to the guy above me, ps3's arnt that great, but your xbox might have a hardware problem. You should call microsoft support and ask them about your problem, and if its nothing they can do, you have to send it in( if it hasnt been a year since the date of purchase of your xbox sending it in is free)|`|CkDNruLgaa	get a ps3 or call microsft and they will send u a new one|`|lOuz0nU2aa	I recommend getting a Ps3.<br>  You won't experience these problems.<br>  But if you are going to keep your Xbox 360 then it's probably a hardware problem. Call Xbox 360 support and send in your Xbox if they don't know what the problem is.|`|sKWAgN2Waa	Does it call the games a dvd mines did that and after a month it got red rings.

Z0odTlyQaa	Yeah right now every time Brucie calls (at the same point in the game but after each reload), it freezes. I just figured my disc was damaged though. And we've had so many problems with our Xbox 360 anyway, this is our 4th one (all replaced by Microsoft due to their issues). And we've never even had the Red rings!|`|n84CnN9eaa	disk is scratched or may contain an error within it. if u bought new and its been like that, send it back and get another.|`|EJhmbTOtaa	i had this problem simply download gta 4 to your hard drive and play it from there my game hasnt crashed since and the noise from the xbox is quieter|`|6moNWAoHaa	that just is a malfunction with a point in the game<br>  It's done that to me in Vice City too<br>  happens a lot, especially if the graphics are better<br>  that's why most old games don't do stuff like that =p
