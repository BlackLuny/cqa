I own a huge collection of DVD's, and none of them are Blu Ray or HD. I'm just wondering if I should feel the desire to swap all my regular DVD's for Blu Ray/HD ones, or if the hype isn't justified. Is Blu Ray and HD THAT much better? My family just bought a new widescreen TV that's pretty darn big, so I know I'd probably see at least a slight difference quality-wise between my regular DVDs and a HD/Blu Ray one, but what do you think? In the end, is it that great?      I don't need my movies to be ZOMG CRYSTAL CLEAR111. I mean, I want good quality, but sometimes this HD stuff seems a bit ridiculous. At some point the human eye isn't going to be able to see the difference, y'know? XD

20090131201012AAcaDw7	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Palm Treo vs. Blackberry?	I've currently got a Blackberry Pearl. There's nothing wrong with it but I'm just not as happy with it as I thought I would be. Perhaps I was expecting too much? It seems to do everything that a 'normal' cellphone would do (internet, MP3 player, etc.).      I may be able to pick up a Palm Treo 650 locally. Do you think I'll be more happy with this phone?      I like the internet capabilities and applications of the iPhone but I'm sort of against buying one. I don't like that I have to buy a seperate plan and I'm not into upgrading my plan at the moment.      Any other suggestions are welcome. Also, I have AT&T if you were wondering. Thanks in advance.

Today, I got a phone call and he said that because of my good record with the VISA company, I am able to get a Wal-Mart voucher. The only thing he asks is to give him the # of a gift card or debit card or credit card. He did not ask for the safety 3 digit # on the back of the card. He said that he need to verify the information if it matches the address or something. Is this a fraud?   If ONLY the 16 digit card # is given but not the 3 # on the back of a card, would people still be able to charge your card or steal money from the  card?
20090131184425AAFDMNa	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Is there any hope for backwards compatibility in the future, or should I just buy a PS3 now?	I absolutely love my PS2 games and want to be able to play them in the future, but I also want a PS3. However, I'm really shocked (and ticked) by the fact that the PS3 doesn't have backwards compatibility. I'm just wondering if I should hold out and see if Sony pulls their head out of their butt and makes a model that IS backwards compatible, or if I should just buy a PS3 now.      I mean, Sony might never make a backwards compatible PS3, and even if they do it could take YEARS for it to come out, so...Ugh! I'm really not sure what to do, so I'd appreciate any tips you guys have!

To my knowledge, they have been around for years.      To switch the light on, you push a button – the button goes in and stays there and the light turns on. As you walk down the stairs, the button slowly comes back out. When it has come fully out, the light turns off.      When they next person comes, they can push the button and the light will turn itself off after a certain time.      Do these lights have a special name?? What are they called??

20090131185442AAMZDtb	Consumer Electronics;TiVO & DVRs	Why can't I toggle between tuners on new DirecTV DVR?	My parents recently got a new DVR from DirecTV and apparently DirecTV is no longer associated with TIVO. I guess they're making their own DVR's now.      I will be moving soon and getting my own satellite service and I'm very concerned with a feature that appears to be lacking from the new DVR's.      On my TIVO dvr, if I wanted to switch tuners, I would press down or up on the grey circle at the top of my remote. This would immediately get me to the other tuner. So I could pause one, hit up or down and get to the other one and then come back when I was ready.      I'm told that the TIVO-based DVRs had two 30-minute recording buffers, one for each tuner, so you could easily toggle between the two tuners. The DirecTV DVRs have one 90-minute buffer, so only one tuner at a time.       Does DirecTV plan to fix this? Does DISH still have the dual buffers? This could honestly make me switch.

I was wondering if anyone has used these to capture athletic type video (track races, practice drills, etc.) and how do they perform.  Are there any brands in that $100-150 range you preferred or any that were horrible.

20090131201023AAIVst3	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	How is my phone charger still working after being submerged in water?	When my phone's alarm went off this morning to alert me I had to be in for work, like usual, I unplugged it and hit snooze (falling asleep again with it under my pillow). Apparently still asleep when I unplugged it, dropped the tip in water (probably 2 inches in and the actual plug still in the wall drawing electricity).      This evening my fiance saw the glass of water and took a sip thinking it was fresh, stating later it tasted like "battery acid".      How come there was no fire since I had the charging tip submerged? And is it possible for the water to taste like battery acid, or is someone just not used to bad tap water?

20090131143857AABgNjU	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Are cameras better than a human's mind or worse?	This little thought came to me. You know how if you were to use a camera or camcorder to record something on the computer, and after replaying your little video, you see how the image from the computer screen is disoriented and moving. Or maybe you've been to youtube lately and found a video of some one trying to do that, and you get easily annoyed because the picture keeps moving.    Anyway, are cameras more precise than our brains to be able to pick up on the screen changing, or are our brains the smart ones to be able to put the image together and create one image; rather than 50 a minute?

But it stopped working, so I sent it in for repair and they refused to fix it even though I was under warranty and had a ridiculously high shipping price of like 40$...and it wasn't overnight or anything. This was because it had 'water damage'. Which I guess sweat or something must've leaked in, but i did not go dipping it water or running in the rain. so... APPLE OWNERS BEWARE...   Anyways, so I deiced to boycott apple and their mini 'legal' scam.   but aside the fact, I used my phone for my MP3 play, which sucked not because the quality is bad but because the stupid phone doesn't recognize the attachment, which in all fairness it's probably all dirty and I've had the phone for almost 2 years.   But I'm getting a new phone without an MP3 player (which is sort of rare now an days) but I still use my music A LOT. So I'm in need of an MP3 player, one that can hold a CRAP LOAD of music.    I've considered a zoon, but I wanna hear other ideas.   Thanks a bunch...
