20090219123711AAqDuNp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband called me lazy?	I am stay at home mom for the past 6 months.  i've worked all my life since I was 15 yrs old and this is the first time I am staying home.        My husband and I were having a conversation about our daughter starting to walk.  I once before told him that I as a baby never crawled and instead started to hold myself and walk around (per my mom).        Last night we were talking about how cool it will be when our daughter starts crawling and walking and he made a comment 'maybe she'll be lazy like her mom and will never crawl'.      I said nothing back but its bugging me all day today.  I understand that I am no longer bringing in money and it was our mutual decision for me to stay at home with our daughter for a year.        I clean, cook fresh meals daily, do laundry, breastfeed our daughter, take care of husband's side business bookkeeping and advertising, etc.  So I do have a ton to do and in the past 6 months my daughter has not been away from me not even for an hour.  I am always with her!  I can't even go to gym although my doctor suggested because I feel bad to have my husband watch her when he gets home from work tired.       It hurt me really bad that he has said that and is dragging me down all day.      Would this hurt you or am I taking it too personal?    Has anyone gone through similar situation?

While i was in this state, a guy who was a friend of a friend, completely took advantage of me.   not long after the party, I got together with my bf & fell absoloutly head over heels. but then he recently found out that he had clamydia & seeing as he was tested b4 we started dating, it was obvious it came from me. He never accused me of cheating but he did break up with me because he said he wudnt beable 2 4get what i gave him.   I have lost the love of my life, I wanted to grow old with this man & have his children. But he broke up with me because of something that happened before we even got together & I had no control over.   I have been treated now, and completely clear. But I feel like my heart has been ripped into pieces, ive never felt so hurt in my life.   I dont know what to do, I feel like I want revenge on the guy who gave me that disgusting disease but that wont bring the man i love back. I cant stop crying. Please help me, Im scared of what i might do.

I would like to be able to have a girl that lives with me, but I don't want to get involved sexually(i.e. no kissing, sex, or anything like that) I have a very bad body that I will not show anyone. And I think sex is bad for guys like me. Poor girls! So are there girls out there that want nothing to do with sex but still want a man to share their time with?

20090219124456AA0uN8y	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	To married couples: did you find that your partner changed much after getting married?	I have heard and read of stories from various sources (friends, family members, articles etc.) about changes in behaviour of married couples.  For example complaints about laziness, not being as affectionate, not going out very much etc.      Is this common?  In what ways did you or your partner change?  If so, why do you think getting married has this effect?  By the way, I am pro-marriage.  I am young, never been married and find this topic interesting.

20090219124941AAD3jAp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's so bad about the term "partner" instead of "husband" or "wife"?	In ref to:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...       'Had to ask this again because people either misunderstood, or their answers were non-thinking, traditionalist, and totally lost in the "proper" convention and rituals of marriage. My primary reason for the use of the term "partner" is  "wife" has historically implied ownership by a husband. A "wife" has historically been required to be the subordinate of her husband. I was told repeatedly that saying you have a "partner" is a term exclusive for gay couples, which is ridiculous. The terms "life partner" and "domestic partner" are quite common and don't only refer to gay couples. When you view my original question it shows you just how heterosexist our culture is.

20090219124428AAapGx5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? Will he ask me out?	I've always had a theory that the guy next to my locker has always like me. The school dance is coming up and i want to know for sure if he really does like me and everything.  One time when we were voting for our school election ( i was running) i asked him who he'd voted for afterwars. his exact words were "Oh, i voted for you because you're nice and everything. Plus, you gave me that pen." and one other thing that really caught my attention is that he had defended me, twice from the same guy.       once, we were sitting next to each other (a coincidence) and this guy, keeps on buggin me for a pen. He is half pleading, half teasing.Then the guy (who defends me) looks up from his work (apparently he was lsitening and was doing his work quietly) and says to the guy buggin me: "dude stop stalking her, shes not gonna give you a pen." i was too nice to give him a pen, but i refused to give him one.         yesterday, we both ended up together in the lunch line. The same guy who was buggin me for a pen was next to the guy who defended me. So i'm standing there not talking, looking around and everything and the guy who was buggin me for a pen, asked the guy who defended me a question. He didn't respond to him, and kept on lookin ahead. I heard him mention my name so i demanded to know what was going on. I tried forcing him to tell me and the guy (who defends me) starts telling him this : "why can't you just shut up!" then no more came out of his mouth ( guy who was asking for pen)       What do you think? This had been going on now for more than 5 months. What should i do?!

20090219125041AAqzgh4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if my girlfriend is too holy?	I have started dating this girl and I am getting the impression that she is really holy.  I know that she is a Christian, but I didn't know that it was her whole life.  She was married before and even slept with a guy on the rebound.  So she isn't a virgin or anything.  But, she won't have sex with me.  She says that she wants to wait until she gets married.  I might be able to wait, but I don't want to have a super boring life because she is too narrow minded to enjoy some fun.  So, how can I tell how narrow minded she is?  Are there some movies or TV shows that normal people would watch but narrow minded people wouldn't? I really like her but I don't want to waste my time if she is too narrow minded to ever have fun.
20090219125049AAgZWxd	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would I come off as stuck-up?	Well, on the Facebook honesty box (I hate that thing - it's basically encouraging cyberbullying), someone said I was stuck-up and should stop being a grade grubber. I did skip a grade and I work very hard in school, but I never thought I came off as arrogant. I might get frustrated when people don't understand simple things (I'm talking really simple! Like finding the perimeter of a circle!), but I don't say things like, "God, you're so stupid!"    I admit that I do grade grub, and I know I should stop. But it really upsets me that people would think I'm stuck-up. Do you think I would come off that way?      P.S. Sorry, I wasn't sure where to put this.
20090219125415AAYhO5z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Worried about chemistry when meeting an online friend?	I have met online friends before in a safe, public place and notified a friend where I am going. So I am always safe and prepared.   I have been talking to a guy on the phone for almost 4 months and we both confessed that we love each other.    He is absolutely wonderful.      however, I am kind of afraid that when we meet the chemistry will not be the same. Because I am a nervous girl and have anxiety problems. (he knows this)      I am just afraid that the chemistry will not be there and we won't be boyfriend-girlfriend material.      Any avice? have you ever experienced something like this?

20090219125644AAapWjQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When someone has hurt you how do you get over it?	My husband took his mother's side against me several months ago. He and his mother caused a small problem to become really blown out of proportion. Basically, he gave her a free ticket to be disrespectful and she took it - even getting other family members involved. I feel very hurt by both of them.       If he had been supportive, the whole thing would have ended in days but it went on for months. My self esteem took quite a beating and I still feel very emotional about it.       Now I don't want anything to do with his family - I only see them when I absolutely have to. He says this is really stressful for him and it upsets me even more because I think he made some bad choices and he doesn't like the consequences, so he wants me to fix it for him. He should have thought more carefully about what he was doing to me, our marriage and my relationship with his family. Now it is what it is. Nobody can undo what was done.      For me, it is still very painful and I'd like to forgive and forget - not for them, but for me, my marriage, my kids. I just don't know how. Does anybody have any advice?

20090219125114AA43yPr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crush on friends husband.....Help!!!!?	Well my boyfriend and I have been together 6 months Valentines Day. I'm really happy in my relationship and I love him more than anything. We are totally soul mates. I know full well that he is the one. I am the one for him too.      I've recently became friends with one of my friends husband. Well when I say my friend I mean my boyfriends mums friend.      Ugh we'll got by names its easier.   Vicki is my friend (boyfriends mothers friend) and Lee is her husband. Tracy is my boyfriends mother.      So I have been talking to Lee over the last few days because I'm having trouble with my laptop and he's good with them. Now I like Lee, he's great and everything. But yesterday I felt something else towards him. Like I was getting a little crush on him. I did get a smile on my face when he logged in on MSN. I was kind of upset when me and Lee started talking and he asked what was wrong and I told him I didn't really know why. He said something really funny and made me laugh. I suddenly thought to myself that's it, I have a crush on Lee. Today I was too shy to talk to him. I needed to ask him a question but I was too shy.      My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. He lives in England and I live in Ireland so there's no need to say don't try anything on with Lee because I can't as we live in different counties. Not that I would anyway. Lee & Vicki live in the same place as Seb. Just across the road to be exact.      I'm 17 years old and Lee and Vicki are something like 35 years old.      What can I do about this? I just want this "crush" to go away. I want to enjoy my life with my boyfriend.      Thanks for your help. No rude/mean comments.

Well I'm actually 27 and considering I had university to date women, I left that to study and came out of it actually having no improvement in my confidence with women.

20090219125440AAixeJE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do most people view girls with tongue piercings?	I've really wanted to get my tongue pierced for the longest time, but have been wicked skeptical about it too. I just think it's the cutest piercing! I have a patriotic tattoo on my shoulder & my cartridge pierced..so the whole pain factor doesn't phase me.      I was just wondering what the overall perspective of getting a piercing would be? My Dad hates it. My Dad doesn't think girls should be tatted up or pierced up. He said he'd never stop Loving me, but he'd just be upset. My best friend thinks I should do it, and she wants to record it, haha. My boyfriend thinks it's sexy & told me to do what I want.      How does a normal person feel? Like if you just walked up and met me, saw my piercing, what would you think? It's not like I'm one of those people who feed off of everybody's thoughs, but to some extent I care about what people think. I don't want people who don't know me to think I'm trashy.      Thanks for your opinions!! :D

20090219125134AA0Ce3O	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She loves me, she loves me not ?	I've been friends with a girl since September of 2008. Back then I had left home (and college, and the city) to look for a job because my dad was getting unbearable.      Back then she used to call me regularly, send me phone credit, nag me to call my sisters, and try to convince me to come home. We became good friends and talked a lot (didn't get to meet a lot since we lived in different cities).      Recently, (starting from a couple months ago), I think she started getting a crush on me since she'd call me daily, sometimes twice a day, if I couldn't get to the phone right away (or canceled if I was busy at work) she's call 4 or 5 times in a row.       This month I said something about how she cheered me up and she was like "really ?", I said "yeah, why are you asking", she said " I don't know, I'm just afraid to believe stuff like that". I asked her what else she was afraid of, she said love.      So anyway, today I woke up thinking about her, so I sent her a message   me: I miss you   her: but I just left last night, you didn't even have time to miss me :d   me: I missed you right after you left   her: huh, what's that all about ?   me: sorry, I guess I picked up the wrong vibe   her: I told you before I'm afraid of this stuff [meaning love]   *a while later*   her: I hope you know that I don't want to ever be the reason that you're feeling bad   me: it's okay, you know my negative feelings don't last for long ( blatant lie)   her: maybe that's because what you're feeling isn't really that important to you   (at this point I was thinking, she said she's afraid yet she's still torturing me about it)   so I said: whatever you want to think      She called me later on asking if I was mad, I said no, and that's how it ended.      Sorry for the long story, she's a person you can meet only once in a lifetime, I usually don't give a damn about girl problems, I let them solve themselves, but I don't want to lose her. I think she's the first girl that I actually think I could spend the rest of my life with.
20090219125221AAITS9L	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	So my girlfriend of 8 months wants to take a break.?	She's a senior in high school and she plays lacrosse and is stressed out to the max between college choosing and lacrosse.  She takes lax very seriously because she's on the best high school lax team in the country or something and she has practice everyday.        Now my girlfriend and I live very long distance.  I live in Massachusetts and she lives in Georgia.  The thing is, I don't think the stress is related to our distance anymore.  It kind of used to be, but we've seen each other twice and recently for like 3 or four days at a time.  Honestly, i miss her like hell but we're getting through it and we're okay.      Okay..anyways, back to my problem.  We saw each other over Xmas break and everything was perfect.  (btw, she was always the most adorable and sweetest gf in the world, shed send me cute notes and packages and whatnot)  We've been through a hell of a lot, and my girlfriend even came out to her two best friends and parents because she loves me so much.  She told me she wouldn't take that risk (especially in Georgia) for anyone else.   After she left, she did a complete 180.  Her lax season started and the college dilemma became more stressful.  So whereas she used to be adorable and caring and sweet, now she seems incredibly stressed out, we always fight, and she's nowhere near as cute as she used to be.  Today she told me she had too much on her plate and she couldn't handle this stress right now, so she said we should take a break.      I'm completely and utterly in love with this girl.  I have no doubt in my mind I want to be with her through it all.  She told me she does NOT want to break up, she'll always love me, (I believe her, i really do) but that maybe we should take a break until her lacrosse season is over and she's not stressed.  She said maybe until school is over...which is painful b.c that's 4 months away.      My mom and I talked and she suggested that maybe since we have a routine of talking every night at 9, that maybe we should talk maybe every 3 days or so-give her some space and a chance to miss me.  She also suggested that maybe we could still be together, but keep a every-3-day-we-can-talk schedule going, so she can clear her head.      I kind of agree with my mom, it just hurts so much and I always look for a 3rd party opinion.  What do you guys think we should do?
20090219125255AAwbHUM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	The nickname thing?  There it went! Here it goes?	That's so sweet World!   What did I do to yous that would make YOUS sound off like that!  Thanks alot! Yeah that helped 100 plus percentage points.  HELLO!

So,what the heck was all that sh*t about you give a decent, formidable nick name, I run your suggestions by her and here's a thought;  she ACTUALLY might go with 1 of your suggestions.

So, if any 1 still reading thus far and cares about a simple answer!  Look, I know this is a toughie, but please try!

I always lead on that I had more girls before her, but the other night I came clear and told her there was only One before her, and That I may want memories/experiences with other girls, and to know if we are in love.

20090219125614AADRKLi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls: Would this be considered flirting...?	I REALLY like this girl in the year below me and we already flirt with each other all the time round school, like locked eyes and smiling at one another everyday and time we see each other.      Anyways on MSN she comes out with wierd/flirting comments -      like i would be talking about Alton Towers and she says stuff like:      "OOO we should go sometime :)"      About dancing lessons she says stuff like:      "You should come and join me at my dancing school :) I think a pink tutu would suit you :P lol"      Also i was talking about getting some martial art lessons and she said:      "OMG same here! we should to it together!"      Just stuff like that happens all the time on MSN but when it comes to talking to her in person shes really shy and quiet around me?      Would it being considerd flirting like saying this kind of stuff?   Thanks xxx

20090219130009AAU1ubI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Her Choice or Trouble?	Hello,      Through a third party, I learned about an acquaintance of theirs who is getting ready to marry a divorcee. He has a concern, though: She has two grade-school-aged boys and often walks into their bedroom -- bare-chested -- to talk to them. Other times, she walks around nearly naked.      The boys are young but an age where they are certainly impressionable. The man is suspicious they are getting sexually excited, judging by their reactions.      He has tried talking to the woman, yet she claims she sees no problem with creating a situation like this.      Having also grown up in rather stimulating environment, I understand the conflicting feelings that can arise from such constant exposure to these sights.      This man is actually concerned that if she continues to show herself this much -- especially going into the boys' bedroom like that -- that eventually they may not be able to contain their urges and something could happen.      Is she entitled since it's her house -- or is she asking for trouble?      Thanks for reading this.

I know hundreds of girls ask a question along these lines every day, but I'd really appreciate good answers.      I like this guy who's a sophomore in high school. He's an amazing singer with an amazing smile, somewhat popular, funny and nice from what I can tell.   My problem is that I'm only in 8th grade.   I'm friends with him on facebook but I'm not sure he quite remembers me from when we went to school together.   How can I get him to notice me? I'll be going to school with him next year, so tips for then would be helpful too.   What do guys like him like in girls?   Any other advice for anything you think I would need is much appreciated.   Thanks for taking the time to answer this question!

20090219131052AAX1RsK	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when..?	you've had enough of people walking over you and taking advantage of you because they know you'll never get angry at them and they know you'll understand? and what  if their expectations become so high that they can't cope with it when you make a mistake? how do you subtly let them know you don't appreciate it, without making a drama out of it and having a serious conversation with them?

20090219133743AAIG1uc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when you don't like any of the women who like you nor what turns them on about you?	I hate how I look.  I'm 6'3", broad shouldered, and started losing my hair at 17, so I'm forced to shave it now, so I look like some meathead soldier or cop or something.        I've never attracted a single girl I liked, and I gave most of them a chance just to make sure I wasn't making snap judgments.  Just as I predicted, they were needy, desperate, and looking for a father figure.  Creepily enough, all of them wanted to be dominated sexually: if I held them down by their wrists and overpowered them, they were in ecstasy and I hated myself even more.        I can lose weight, but I can't get my hair back nor can I change my general stature.  I hate it, but I can't do anything about it.  I don't know how to get over it.      Oh, and please don't tell me to "learn to love yourself the way you are" or assure me that "some girl will come along who loves you for your inner beauty".  I'm immune to pop psychology platitudes.

20090219132516AALGw5m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship help please give me some advice?	Well ive been dating this guy for like a couple a months we had a strong connection for each other and a month ago he asked me to be his girlfriend and told me he loved me. Well lately I haven't felt the love like he would tell me he loves me but its one thing to tell someone you love them you should also show it. He never takes me out or does anything special for me all we do is either hangout at his house or my house. And on valentines day we spent the day at his house he didn't surprise me or do anything special for me he asked me what I wanted to do and I thought to my self why don't you at least  surprise me. I feel sometimes like im taken for granted. It also really becomes really hard for me to say I love you back because I really don't feel the love I don't even feel like having sex with him what should I do? and should I be feeling this way?

20090219134941AA2wBqI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ugh what to do about all of this, help please?	Okay here's the deal..   I like my guy friend, he sometimes likes me and sometimes he doesn't.   He knew I liked him but know he thinks I'm over him and I don't want to tell him I liked him again cause that didn't really work out the first time I told him.   Well I've tried to move on to someone else but I always end up comparing that person to him and they don't deserve that.   So I've tried to not talk to him and get my mind off of him but something always leads me back to him.   I see him everyday at school, he looks at me most of the time I'm near him.   I haven't talked to him since Saturday because when we talked he seemed busy so we didn't talk long, but it seemed like he was annoyed talking to me.   I don't know why cause I didn't hardly say anything.   I've heard he's talking to some other girl but apparently they aren't cause they don't even talk to each other.      I don't know what to do.   Help will me much much appreciated.

There is this guy at school but I'm not sure if he's interested in me or just being friendly, so here are some examples of our convos:            - He was sick and went through two entire klenex boxes so I       jokingly told him that if he just shoved one up his nose and left it there he could be my hero. He asked if he could be my hero without having to do that and I agreed.             - We were walking to our next period classes just taking about class and then we realized we had to go in different directions. He stopped mid-sentence asked me if I had to go the other way with a disappointed look on his face, but when I tried to ask him what he was going to say he said it didn't matter and waved goodbye.               - Also once he waited outside with me in the snow so we could  keep talking, I thought he had to catch the bus too, but then he got a ride (meaning it wasn't necessary to wait outside).

20090219132253AAWufZ1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	HELP!!!!!!! He doesnt know hes stalkin my twin sisters..What can I do? 10 points best answer?	My guy friend whose name is Landon has been talking to me about some gurl he's been seeing around the halls at his University and also at the some store that he likes going to, he tells me that she's cute but he's afraid to even talk to her. He caught a picture of her while tryin to take a pic of some water fountain outside of the patio at his school. When I saw it, I told him that that's one of my older sisters but yet he doesnt know shes a twin. Well Kandice is the one who is going to the same University that he goes to and Tiffany works at the store he likes going to... the only way you can tell which is which is by the way one has a lil mole near the ear which is very tiny.   Both look very similar and is hard to see who is who unless by the way they dress at times. Both are 22 years old and Landon is 23. So mainly he's kind of stalking both of my sisters who are twins. should I till him that there twins? and see who he rather date? I dont mind him datin one of my sisters since hes a great guy and in the past only had two girl friends which they dumped him for stupid reasons. but i just dont want him to stalk both of my sisters in a creepy way....and i know he'll like my sister that works in the sports center store since she loves sports and he loves playin sports and can have major common things together unlike my other twin sister who goes to his university....what should i do?

I started to write my name on most of my things in the refrigerator( because i believe he or another roommate at my chicken in the freezer) ... now suddenly out of nowhere he's writing his name on it. He has been my roommate for several years and he's very self- absorbed.      I live with 4 people with dirty dishes. I am very particular about who uses my sponge( my roommate likes to clean something on the kitchen floor and then still use it on dishes). So I keep my sponge in drawer.... guess whose keeping their spong in a cabinet..      it's so stupid..he doesn't realize he's only making this worse. I'm already fed up with him.       What do you all think? I think he's really petty...
20090219152517AAeL5T9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this considered a first kiss or not.?	this hot guy moved in across the street from me back in august. ive never had a bf before, and I was really attracted to this guy. i introduced myself and we began texting each other. eventually i found out, he was not a very honest or serious person. he was very immature. so anyways, I told this guy that i had never before been kissed, and he said he'd wanna kiss me. so i told him. if you wanna kiss me, u can do it, but i ain't gonna ask for it.  so one day we were talking and he leaned in and he kissed me.keep in mind, ive never kissed before. I just stood there and didn't kiss him back. (not knowing how to properly kiss). anyways. later on that day, he texted me and told me he "regretted" kissing me. which made me feel kinda insulted. i felt sad for waisting my very first kiss on him! but wait, is this really considered a first kiss if i just stood there and didn't kiss him back???

20090219144640AAO2UQ9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just started work and my boss asked me to pop his pimp!!?	My boss asked me to pop his pimp. It was after lunch and I was working in my office. He came in and said he wanted to wait until he got home but his pimple was throbbing, pulsating and hurting (his own words, ew!!).      So he took off his hand-knitted sweater (THAT HAD BLOOD AND PUSS CRISPY DRIED FROM WHERE THE PIMP WAS LOCATED) and turned and said, "Please do the honours."      I thought it was gross so I told him I can't stomac the sight of blood and he told me to suck it up and just do it so I can get back to work. So I grabbed a wad of tissue in both hands closed my eyes and mashed the pimp as hard as I could.      I did it as hard as I could as a punishment to him, I ground it up good. Then he started yelling and yelping and saying I did it too hard, he had tears in his eyes, so he threw his shirt back on and left, he hasn't spoken to me all day but I'm worried I'm in trouble.      The tissus were covered in blood and puss and some puss got on my glasses but I washed htem.

20090219160105AAVwdI2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you choose between 3 or 4 certain guys!?	Alright, first things first, this is so weird for me to ask so please serious answers! <3      Alright. The boys: Simon, Jordan, Jacob.      I can't pick which one to "go after"      Simon is a year older and he was in my cooking class. So he knows me right. Well I like him because he's just so quite and hes just soo great. I mean we don't talk or anything, just when needed but I see him glancing at me. Not sure if that means anything. Probably doesnt.      Jordan, He's 2 years older than me. and he was such a good welcomer when I moved schools. We talked often online but we never really like hung out at school but he always encouraged me to say hi to him and what not. He's just such a down to earth kind of guy and really sweet.       Jacob: He is also 2 years older and hes just soo adorable. I mean he's always so quite hanging with his friends. I see him every day since he hangs with his group of friends at my locker. He'll glance at me and always walk super close by me and stuff like sometimes I think he's going to start talking to me but he walks right by.      I know it seems like I probably have no chance with any of them and I should go for the one who cares about me the most but I can't figure it out.. What are your opinions if you were in my shoes!? Thank You sooo much! and any tips on how to yenno maybe "start something"
20090219152259AAqoV0L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if he likes me [details]?	So there's this guy I've liked for a few months, but I'm not really sure if he likes me. We're in the same spanish class together, but he's in the grade above me. We used to sit right by each other and we'd always flirt and talk. He'd always look over and smile at me. But last week we changed seats, and we don't really sit near each other so we don't talk that much.      I kind of thought he liked me, because I'd catch him looking at me, but now I'm not sure. I over heard him talking to his friend about a girl he was texting (that obviously wasn't me). Now he's been talking to this other girl that sits by him. So I don't know if he likes me or not. I've been talking to this other guy to make him jealous, but I don't even know if it really matters. How can I tell if he likes me without straight out asking him? thanks

But i'm confused and I don't know if my friends  are as confused as me or not. anyways i like this guy (a lot!) and we're friends but not like close close friends. I think  he might like me then again i'm not sure....here's what he does:      I was walking past where he was and i was acting like i didn't see him cuz was shy at the moment. He walked past me and then lightly hit me in the back of the head and then when i turned around he wasn't looking at me but then looked up and smiled.       At a game at the school he would come right up and stand next to me while i was talking to my friends but he wouldn't say anything. Just stood there listening playing his guitar quietly (he's in band and they were playing during half time that explains guitar lol)      Same night one of my friends (a guy) kept callling me acting like a stalker. My crush takes the phone and says "hey man you better stop calling my girl" and then smiled at me      He looks at me when i enter the cafteria      Today he took his friend's seat in geometry which was right next to me and started talking to me right away             So i don't know. Maybe he just likes me as a friend but some help here would be very much appreciated. That way i don't go crazy believing something that isn't true.

Her friend tells me she's "smitten" and I really like her too but we aren't officially exclusive or anything.  Personally, I dont date more than one person and have never even LIKED more than one person at a time.  Everyone's different though.  If she is "smitten" is it likely that she could be dating multiple people?  She seems really in to me and affectionate I just don't want to get played and I don't think its a good time to ask her if we're exclusive yet.  How many of you date multiple people?  Do you date multiple people if you are "smitten" over one person in particular?

He told me that at the moment he didnt want a relationship with anyone, so we settled on friends and i began to get over him.    A week later, he askes me round his house so i go, I mean we were mates..its not a big deal right? So we sat there and talked, watched tv ect then suddenly i find myself laying on him and he's kissing me; and leats just say if it hadnt been for his mum to knock on the door, he'd have been fingering me. So i was all confused. I still am because i have no idea what to do or whats going on.    SO last night i decided to tell him how i felt and i needed to know where i stood. I ended up staying over, and he asked me if i wanted to sleep in his bed with him. I said no, because i knew what would happen.   What i need help with is: If he likes me as a mate, why is he doing this?

20090219141237AAgMhiP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Locket Engraving for Girlfriends Sweet 16?	So, my girlfriends sweet 16 is coming up, and I thought it would be a good idea for me to buy her a gold locket.      This is the locket:    http://www.heartsmith.com/lorraine_gf_58...       I have $20 extra which I can use to engrave the locket. Heartsmith offers $10 for an initials engraving on the front and $10 for an initials engraving on the back.      So, obviously I would have her initials engraved on the front, but I was wondering if I should also have my initials engraved on the back (so the locket would have both of us on it), or just leave the back blank. Or maybe I could even have "16" engraved on the back, since it is her sweet 16.      So, what do you guys think I should do? Thanks for the input : )

20090219142650AApDAbG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are guys so complicated!?	I like this guy named Shane. He's in my grade and he's in 4 of my classes. I have never spoken to him. In the beginning of the year, at lunch, I had one of my male friends, Brandon, ask Shane if he had a girlfriend. Shane said no. Soon Shane found out that it was me who told Brandon to ask him the gf question. He found out that I liked him. Shane and his friends avoided me. I didn't try to get his attention after that. A couple months ago, I noticed that Shane has been looking at me A LOT inside and outside class and he started to hangout by me and my group of friends at lunch. We're outside at lunch and during the middle of lunch, Shane and his friends come out and stand a couple feet away from me. Whenever I look at him, he turns his head and looks the opposite direction. I told my friends about this and they said he's starting to like me. Is that true? What is Shane trying to indicate?

I dated this guy for a really long time and we were very much in love throughout the time we dated. We were always very happy and everyone else noticed it as well. He broke up with me a few times but always ended up coming back. A few months ago I decided to break up with him because i found out some things he was doing behind my back (things you shouldn't do while having a girlfriend) and basically he wasn't the same guy. After a few months I'm still not over him and I know I can have him back if I wanted to but im just scared of getting hurt again and that he's just going to end up failing at the relationship once again. Basically I don't know what to do and I need an outsider's point of view. Please help.   * Also the thing is I was perfectly okay until he slowly started trying to make contact with me and doing other things showing me he still has feelings for me.* (this is what triggered all my feelings for him to suddenly come back)   Help!

20090219143706AAQf4Wf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I say without saying too much?	I've been hanging out with this girl for a while and I like her a lot. I'm pretty sure she likes me to but she said she wanted to get to know me before we actually started datng so we're just friends now.       The issue is that she's really self-conscious about her looks and she calls herself "fatty" or "ugly" all the time,which she definitely isn't. Even if it's in a casual way most of the time I still really want to say something. How do I casually tell her that she's the most beautiful girl I'll ever know without sounding like I'm trying to rush her into a relationship?      Any help would of course be greaty appreciated. I'm kind of new to the whole relationship/dating thing.

So I kept our phone call short. Should I tell her something? Or back off and forget about her.

20090219144019AAeM2x6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My inner vagina lips (labia) protrudes out and are thick and long.. Is this not sexy? I am very sad about it?	I am just wondering if long vagina lips are a total turn off for men? Would they rather have long or short ones on their girl? :( My inner vagina lips are about 1 and 1/4 inch long..      Me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 years (we love each other VERY MUCH) and he has never said anything about it. i told him that i am self conscious of them, and he said he 'loves them'. should i believe him even though i dont like them? he is always turned on when going down there orally..      we have never had sex but does it interfere with intercourse? im nervous to have sex.      i've seen porn and the girls dont look like that at all.. i feel like a freak.. i cry about it. :(

20090219144150AAWQ3W0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I IM him or not, and if so, how should I start the conversation?	have had a crush on this guy for about 2 years now and recently I acquired his Aim screename from his facebook pg (he's not my facebook friend but he's my myspace friend). I have tried talking to him twice face to face but it only led to curt awkward conversations. We both dont open up very quickly 2 strangers. I dont know whether I should IM him, because it would be so much easier to talk to him online, but then I dont want to seem like a stalker. We dont say hi to each other but he knows who I am. Do you think I should take the risk? and if he asks me how i got his screename, what do I say 2 not sound like a stalker? XD

20090219144603AAJpzkP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i know if i really did lose my virginty? Loads of questions?	Ok, so i know everyone has asked this question, but i'm going to ask again.      So two days ago i was fooling around with my BF and it got a little advanced and he ended up pushing his "willie" into me. It hurt quite alot and there was loads of bleeding. I want to know if I actually did lose my virginity because he didn't go all the way thru, he was only like half-way thru? The bleeding lasted only a day, but when we tried again today, i started to bleed again and there was loads of pain.       Is this normal? Am I technically still a virgin? Has the barrier been broken yet? How long should i wait till we try again? Should I just tell him to get over with it and go on and shove it in?

20090219145309AAupj9p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does he think of me?	So I like this guy, Myles. We've talked a bit, and I'm wondering if he may like me... Or what he thinks of me.      Our most recent conversation (last night) went like this:      Me: heyy   Myles: you like germany   Me: i do   Me: a lot   Me: and i really want to go back   Myles: thats cool   Myles: konnen sie es sprechen   Myles: no   Me: ja, ich kenne deutsch   Me: but technically   Me: if i were to correct that   Me: sie is formal you   Me: so itd be kannst du es sprechen   Myles: wow, im impressed   Me: :-)   Me: but well, being in german 4 id hope i know how to ask if you know german..   Myles: haha   Myles: yahh   Myles: i guess your right   Me: are you in spanish?   Me: or french   Myles: yes , im in spanish   Me: do you like it?   Myles: well, i like all languages, its preety easy, but i like it   Me: thats good   *Six minutes later*   Me: so what classes are you taking next year?   *Four minutes later*   Me: ok, well i g2g for dinner   Me: see you tomoror   Me: w   *Eleven minutes later*   Myles: byeee se ya tomrowww      So I don't know. Do you think he likes me or something? A little before he said bye (and I wasn't there at the time) he wrote a note... '25 Random Things About Me!'   We have some stuff in common that he mentioned, and other things that he mentioned are just 'oh my God he's amazing' worthy...   This is what he put in the note, and in parenthesis are my thoughts on it...   I really like romantic books like pride and prejudice, things like that (awww)   i loveeee playing soccer, its my passion when it comes to sports (I don't like soccer, but it doesn't bother me that he loves it)   i play the piano alott (he's a great piano player!)   im an outdoor adventure junky, cant get enough of good old nature (I'm not really a fan of hanging out outside a lot, but I can deal with it and it's calming)   cooking is one of my major hobbiesss (this is one of the oh my God ones...)   i really like the european culture, especially italy germany and spain (I love Europe!)   can speak three different european languages, only two full fluency (aaaah!!! I need to ask him which languages these are... I know he's fluent in Italian, and he's taking Spanish at school, but I don't know what the other language is)   i love acting, possiblity of trying to be a movie star when i grow up..maybe. ( :-) )   im also a history junky (Not my favorite subject by far, but good for him)   all difirent types of pasta are my favorite foods (me too!)   my favorite pet is the golden retrever, can get dirty and rough, good for the wilderness (golden retrievers are nice... I guess. I'm not really a dog person, but I can deal with them)   i want to live in europe when i grow up (ME TOO! Or at least travel around more of Europe)   im a straight guy, but yess.. i do happen to like the twilight books (OMG AMAZINGGGG I love Twilight)   brown eyes (they're gorgeous)   im italian, german, and irish (I didn't know he was German or Irish... But that's pretty cool!)      Ok... So what do you think?   (At one point in one of our conversations, he said he had a question and never asked it, and we've also talked about our exams and how they went after the first day and I mentioned that I'd had a driving lesson and he said that he could teach me how to drive and how he's a really good driver and how it would save us some money and stuff (note that he's 15... and we have to be 16 to drive, so he isn't old enough technically))
20090219154310AAhAa2j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So do you think he likes me?	So I like this guy named Myles. I'm wondering if he likes me or anything...      Our most recent conversation (last night) went like this:   Me: heyy   Myles: you like germany   Me: i do   Me: a lot   Me: and i really want to go back   Myles: thats cool   Myles: konnen sie es sprechen   Myles: no   Me: ja, ich kenne deutsch   Me: but technically   Me: if i were to correct that   Me: sie is formal you   Me: so itd be kannst du es sprechen   Myles: wow, im impressed   Me: :-)   Me: but well, being in german 4 id hope i know how to ask if you know german..

So either way, he'd have to have looked at something of mine on facebook... Any reasons you can think of?   Please and thank youuu
20090219145332AAdnU3k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Super sensitive and insecure?	First of all, I really hate to even ask this, it truly does sound so immature, and I really do not consider myself to be immature, I am anything but a kid, I guess I am just bugged by something dumb and wanted some unbiased thoughts on it. Here goes.      It's about stupid Facebook.  I have been on Facebook for well over a year, never do much with it.  Never made it a huge part of my daily activities, had a few pics of my boyfriend and I up, came across some old friends etc.  My boyfriend was never on Facebook, not until December, to which, he never told me.  He ended up telling me mid January after I had mentioned I added a few pics of us to my page.  (for the record, we've been together for two years).  After about three weeks or so, he adds me as a friend.  He has no pics of himself on there, let alone of us, and from what I can tell, doesn't have much interaction with the many friends he has on his profile.  Here is the part that I'm a bit bothered by.  Some friends of his have tagged him in four pictures, two of which include himself and his ex-wife.  I totally get that he did not post these pics, has no control over what pics his friends post and tag him in, he has made no comments on the pics that were posted,  but I guess I'm a bit bugged that the only pictures of him on his page are now pics that include him and his ex-wife, his status is not listed as in a relationship and there is not one picture to even indicate that he has a life with someone else now.  He goes on Facebook just about everyday from what I can tell, adds friends pretty regularly, and plays a game now and then, but never has any interaction with me, via my page.  Like I said, just bugged that the only pics on his page are of him and his ex-wife, understandably due to no fault of action of his own...but sheesh...a little recognition of your current relationship please.   Thoughts, am I being totally super sensitive and insecure?

20090219155228AAQa0WM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you help me? some people took this question wrong....?	Can you help me? some people took this question wrong....   Me and my boyfriend want to do a Common Law marriage "paper marriage" but I DO NOT want my parents to find out. The reason why we are doing this so fast is because he needs a green card and they only way to do that is if he gets married to someone who has a citizenship. If my parents find out they will be extremely mad and they will probably even stop talking to me. But we have to do this marriage. If me and my boyfriend do common law marriage can my parents find out? if my parents can find out, how? and how easily can they find out about it? Thank you! By the way I am 18 years old.

20090219150952AAJkBdm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would you change your facebook status to "in a relationship", but not link up with your partner?	My girlfriend of 2 months told me she had changed her facebook status to 'in a relationship', so when i said ok, i'll accept so that we would be linked i.e. so it would say in a relationship with *my name*, she said that she didn't put me down specifically, just that she's in a relationship now.  All her friends and family know we're together, I just don't get why she wouldn't want to acknowledge specifically that she's in a relationship with me?
20090219151530AAR4ZlT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How often should I be seeing my girlfriend 2 months into a relationship?	At the moment we see eachother at the weekend, maybe she will stay over sunday night, but that's about it.  She makes plans Saturday night as all her single friends are going out places and she doesn't want to miss out.  Should i say something?  I just feel like she looks forward more to seeing her friends than she does to seeing me.  I could quite easily not sort out meeting up and she would probably not bat an eye lid.  Yet, she maintains she's very happy in the relationship.
20090219151039AAOKWDy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I trust my instinct?	I have been in love with the same guy for well over 10 years...since high school where we first went out. Over the first 5 or so years, we spent much time playing games with each other that was largely due to our age/insecurities.       In our early 20s we got back together romantically and took our relationship to the next level physically. Unfortunately, after a while it became apparent that he couldn't commit the way I wanted, needed or deserved, so we again went our separate ways. But remained friends...He then got into a relationship about a year or so afterwards and when I asked why, he mentioned the lack of 'guilt' with that current partner. He also said he'd always feel for me in a special unmatchable way.      A couple of years into that relationship, we had a slip up and I decided that we needed to part as my head was in bits, after thinking I may be pregnant. 4 years with no contact went by. I had other relationships and believed myself to be 'over' him.       We bumped into one another one night nearly 4 years to the day of last sight. He was with his partner (with whom he has a child) and the majority of his family, whom I know. We spent the 3/4 hours trying to avoid one another yet mesmerised by each other. That sighting highlighted for me the fact that I had not really dealt with my feelings and that I needed to do so for me. We began speaking again and he apologised for being an @rse etc and said that I was his 'one' etc. It's been approx. 7 months since that first night and he says he can't let his child grow up away from him and so can't be with me, as much as he wants to. At the same time, we still meet up from time to time and communicate on a regular basis. I    have no difficulty with walking away from something that's not right for me but my gut instinct tells me that he is my soulmate and that I need to see this through...?

Ok, so I don't think I'm as pretty or hot as the other girls at school, but I've been told that I'm "cute." However, I'm smart, funny, nice, and I have a lot of friends. The guy I like is a jock. He's really quiet, and I know a lot of girls like him. Are these qualities enough to measure up?How do I get him to like me? I know you guys don't know him, but some general advice would be awesome. :)

20090219153108AANbKlP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would he take the time to do this?	okay this is really stupid but it bothers me.      I dated this kid over the summer, and then I got hired at a camp. When I got to the camp I dumped him becasue there were a ton of guys I had more chemisty with and plus I was moving at the end of the summer. So I talked to him online for a few months. In december he got a myspace and I friended him. We talked nonstop for a few weeks on facebook. Then today I needed to ask him something and i realized that he deleted me from his facebook and also took the time to deleted every comment he ever wrote me. I dont know when he did this but it was probably around the same time we started talking again and I don't know why he would do that and take the time to delete every comment. So can someone help me out I'm just wondering why.

20090219153123AAuJIUg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's it like to be a good looking man and be able to have a women and love in your life?	I am a true believer that looks is all that matters, I mean a women does not care if the man is a jerk, a drunk, a druggie or even if he has a job just as long as he is a head turner!  Now I know attraction is part of it but come on! Also, women can be more prejudice then a man when it comes to looks!  I can not wait too hear all your answers I will most likely either get insulted of just some real dumb answers that make no sense whats so ever, because we all know that every one on the net is a brain surgeon!

Ok, so I basically just started talking to this girl, whom I like and I was just curious if any of the things below are signs of interests or anything like that, thanks...      -She jokingly calls me by my full first name whenever I walk by her   -She always laughs at me for the dumbest things (forgot to do some homework for another class)   -She is always jokingly mean to me (saying she has better things to do calling me gay, etc.)   -She calls me from the back of the class to ask if I did homework for another class, a class which I believe she already knew I didnt have.    -She asked me before anyone else what grade I got on the test.   -When I asked her for markers to do hw for another class, she said "of course" and then I said can I borrow them she said "she didnt have any markers" (smiling of course)      So what does anyone think of these possible signs and what should I do? I am probably going to try to get her number for the weekend because I dont see why she wouldnt give me it. So yea, any advice would be apreciated, thanks!

20090219155836AAAK3WB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Attracted to Asian girls?	I am totally digging this Filipina girl, problem is she is my my GRE tutor at Kaplan. She is totally smart, attends Brown, and Fu*k is she hilarious. It doesn't hurt that she use to be an import model (she had to to help pay her tuition). Would it be inappropriate to ask her out. I mean, she has mentioned some aspects of her life to me, and you wouldn't share that if you weren't comfortable or interested in a person right? Also, a small problem...she has a boyfriend, but I think I trump the guy in the looks department. He looks like one of those "scholarly types" as my friend puts it. I've been told that I look a lot like Colin Farrel, so would she dump the guy and take interest in me if I asked her out. She looks exactly like this model here  http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...    but she is with this guy in the white  http://flickr.com/photos/melisdramatic/2...  Which I really don't get the attraction. So should I ask her?

20090219160222AAzfe2j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HOLY CRAP My girlfriend just told me she's a virgin - Should I tell her that I am too?	Alright we're both 20 and we've been dating for 1 month.  Both of us are pretty good looking (shes a really hot blonde) so neither of us expected the other to still be virgins!      Looking at her facebook, she's in tons of party-pics, shes even in a sorority, she's had a serious ex-boyfriend before and there are lots of pics of him left over on her facebook.  There was no way I assumed she was a virgin!      Well, looking at my social circle and everything else, I party 2-3 times a week, we go out to bars and clubs and everything.  I've had a girlfriend before (the serious one was actually back in HS).  I take tons of pics with girls and before we met, girls were always flirting with me and she could see that.      Well, she probably assumed that along with my popularity and good looks, I was probably sexually experienced.      Anyhow, she says she wants to lose it to me sometime soon, rather than some random guy at a party.  Well, should I tell her that I'm a virgin as well, or keep that a secret?  She has never asked me about it, so I never had to say anything.  I gave her oral the other day and her hymen really is intact.  She said she loved it and can't wait to get in bed hahahaha.  Well, I'm not really nervous or anything but still...should I tell her?

20090203061640AApaHmA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I try and get him back?? I'm lost!?	My ex fiance left me on christmas eve saying that he needed time to think (we had an argument a couple of days before an I had said some nasty things, mentioning my ex) He didnt contact me for the whole of the festive period, so I thought it was over. Then after new year, he said that he wanted me back. To split up with me again 2 weeks later. I found out that he had had sex with two girls over christmas, although I had ended up in bed with his friend on new years eve ( I was drunk, upset and he was there ) although we didnt have full sex. My ex was saying that he wanted me back, that he couldnt live without me, got me some roses sent to where I work, etc. Then when he asked his mate about what happened with me and him and his friend denied it, my ex thought I had lied about it to hurt him, and split up with me again. Now I see him out and he is getting off with loads of girls, kissing and trying it on with other people, and I dont think its coz he knows that I am there either. I just cant get over him. I am constantly thinking about him, talking about him, analizing everything that has happened. I just cant seem to move on, and surely if he cared as much as he said he did he would be the same? I mean, I know I'm not angel but I dont think I deseved to be treated how he has done me. What do you think? I am 20. I just think that I will never find anyone as good as him, he is a successful builder with his own house and a lot of money, and I have a crappy part time job and live with my parents. Everyone has took his side too. What do you think, help me please?
20090220080657AAh73o9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Feeling unappreciated, please advise me.?	I feel my fiance takes me for granted. I always do everything I can for him and try to be a caring supportive partner. He has a pathological aversion to rows-he expects everything to be perfect. He is quite immature and I have to be the adult in the relationship. I have tried to talk to him but nothing changes. This morning he asked me about his work clothes and I told him they were in the wash and he said I never did anything(housework wise-not true)  He said it was a joke, I feel he was criticising me. I had things organised for him for today to wear for work. The romance is gone, I feel we've been together for 10 yrs rather than 16 months. He doesn't want to do things as a family (I have a daughter from a previous relationship) I'm fed up of this. I do love him, but every time I try to sort it out he tells me I'm starting a row and that I'm paranoid. I can't live up to his idea of perfection.

He accused me Of cheating when i wasn’t.. he didn’t contact me till 2months and i told him 2 call me bk cos i was out.. he called me back and asked about my BF and said i don’t know. and he said hes not tryna get into my knickers he was just ring to see how i was doing and that hes got a girl and hes happy and that we can still be friends. I asked him why he didn’t contact me after we made up after the argument and he said i didn’t ring him and i wasn’t expecting him 2 do the same thing so obviously i know what that means. He said when he called me earlier i was with a guy and i could’ve told him instead. But I wasn’t with a guy. He then told me to look after myself and hanged up. Am soo heart broken it hurts so much.. Why did he have 2 come bk and finish me off telling me he’s got a girl.. i was finally moving on. I was loyal 2 this guy i never ever even looked at other guy when we were together.. Why did he treat me this way? What did i ever to him 4 him to be soo cruel. Am back to the broken heart again i was finally picking up myself and now he’s ruined it all 4 me all over again.

20090203055359AAyPLlQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you go about this? What would you do?	Okay so I've been with this guy since 07 on and off. Ive known him since I was 16 (I'm 22 now) and now we have a baby on the way (due July 29th). I thought about just proposing myself but then I decided against it because I thought that if he wanted to marry me he would propose to me. Plus he's 21 so I'm kinda like thinking he might not be ready for all of that. In the beginning he wasn't to happy about me being pregnant because he said he wasn't ready and I understand that because right now we both aren't in a good position. He just got fired from his job recently and I quit mines back in December (trust me it was worth it). But that still isn't a good enough reason for me to kill an innocent child especially when we were the ones having unprotected sex. But I think he still is harboring resentment towards me for keeping the baby. Before we spoke of marriage but now he doesn't bring it up at all and I want to know what should I do?
20090219223038AALJjOK	Family & Relationships;Family	Family forgets bday, should I bother to visit?	Except for my mom, my family always forgets my birthday and other holidays that don't involve gift giving. Dad (however I don't think he ever really gave a crap about me anyway), sister, nieces, nephews, cousins, all of them. They never so much as call, text msg, email, or send a card.  I call on their bdays even if it is just to leave a Happy Bday vmail. I live about 3000 miles away. No one has ever visited. Although they always call near Christmas (to ask for stuff), my bday, thanksgiving, etc is silent. None of them forget my phone number when they want me to wire them money. I have a pretty good job and they know that. I have no problem with helping family, but, man, this is the 4th year in a row. I visit about 2x a year and when I visit only my mom takes me out and treats me. I think my mom feels sorry for me because my dad (while in the home when I was growing up) never took much interest in me and she knows it.  When I'm in town, everyone else asks me money and material items (like XBoxes, games, rent money, etc). I don't want to go back "home" just to come back broke. My next visit I think I am just going to visit mom and friends and skip everyone else. Should I?

20090203052451AAIrPvr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I just want them to leave!!?	My grandparents recently moved in with my aunt, uncle, sister and I. Everything they do makes me mad. My grandfather has something rude to say about everything and he thinks he runs the house now. Its not like they're even old, my step-grandmother is in her late forties and my pop-pop is in his mid-fifties. He complains when I watch my nephew, when I ask to take the car to the store and just about everything I do. My grandmother is pretty much telling me not to go to college because I won't make it even though I'm an honor-role student (senior in high school) I'm 18 and I'm ready to just move out. The only thing stopping me is my little sister. She is 16 and she hates it here just as much as I do. I just need some advice. Should I talk to my grandparents about how I feel? Should I just move? I really have no idea what to do. Please help!

20090203061221AAylOAn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to get her to initiate...?	I need help.  My wife and I have a good, better than average sex life, however, she never initiates it.  It is a huge turn on to have her initiate sex, but she never does.  She says that if I don't, we won't ever have sex.  She says she likes me to take control.  Ok.  No problem.  Sometimes it is just hard for me to tell if she is in the mood or not so a lot of times we miss each other...meaning she will want it but I think she doesn't so I won't initiate anything.  It is frustrating.  I want her to initiate it and then I can take control, but she refuses to initiate anything.  I have talked to her about this but she says she is not going to do it.  Any suggestions on how to get my wife to initiate things?  I mean c'mon...what guy doesn't want to feel wanted by his significant other?

20090220084429AAzgs4k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you believe that u can be with the same person forever and be happy?	I wish it were true..sometimes I think it is.  I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years and we just started living together about 6 months ago.  Im 22 hes 24, I want to get marired but he says hes not ready..which is understandable i guess..  sometimes i feel like im missing out though, there are a lot of fish in the sea, you know, and sometimes i think about running and just hooking up with differnt guys but other times I realize i love my bf and how wonderful it would be to be with him forever.      so my question is it possible to faithfully stay with the same man for life?  Are my doubts normal or should I rethink this whole thing?
20090203060534AAi78WB	Family & Relationships;Family	Unsure how to approach my emotionally complex mother about help for eating disorder? ?	My mother and I don't get along very well. We argue frequently, mostly over something small I usually have said or done which makes her overreact and blow things out of proportion. She always feels alienated at certain aspects of my character and is very black and white and narrow minded, believing that i am always going out of my way to antagonize her when she doesn't see that she takes things way too personally and that i can't just completely change the way i act, the i am to accommodate for her emotions and personality. When we're not arguing though, we are generally friendly and civil.      I don't know in what manner to tell her, face to face, a letter...I know that if i say it in simply the wrong tone it could spark a huge fight. Has anyone been in a similar situation or has a similar parent? I could really use some advice, as I'm in my last year of school and don't have the energy or time for this problem.

Alright, hypothetically speaking, let's say you were very good childhood friends with someone. As time went on, for whatever reason you lost touch with one another only to meet again later and fall in love. However, your new love informs you that due to various circumstances, he/she took the lives of several people but was never caught by the police. They regret their past actions and have sworn to never take the life of anyone, ever again. Could you still love that person and could you forgive them? Would you turn them into the police knowing that you'd never be able to see them again?

Now he's blocked my phone and e-mail and even his friends won't put me through to him.   I am really upset.

I already experienced it 5times and it really sucks...every time I have a boyfriend, they will eventually dump me for a friend...first is when I am in grade 5 then during my high school days (3 times) and then lastly just happened last week. I am getting tired and being traumatized. I am really doing my best to be positive but it really hurts and it really sucks. I want to take revenge again just what I did during my high school days but my conscience won't allow me. I want to stop helping my friends every time they come to me and ask for help as a revenge for what they did but I can't. Every tome I try to turn them down, I eventually feel bad about my self. it's like that i am a total failure.I love my friends and whatever they do wrong, I really try to understand and forgive them even if I am hurting. My family and other friends are calling me a total lunatic and some of them are leaving me because according to them I am no good...Will leaving a friend in times of need be good even if she did you wrong things? I really feel bad about myself and I am starting to hate my self.All I want is to be happy but why can't I? I am tired of pretending to be happy and I am tired of pretending to be good always but every time i start to show how mad I am and see those fears in the eyes of the people around me, I eventually fall down and start feel sorry. I don't exactly know what my question is but I am hoping someone would care to give this fool an advice. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

20090219162017AAN2COP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me back?	Okay so my crush sits next to me in some class and I was wondering if he likes me back. He always talks to me in class and tries to make me laugh and like sometimes he'll put his elbow almost on my desk. But I read somewhere that if he points his feet towards you then he likes you and I looked at his shoes one time and they were pointed towards me. Do you think he likes me?
20090220081005AAVij7c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my boyfriend so scared to....?	to move in??      He and I have been together for about 3 years. We had a few times where we went a few months without talking, and to be honest, it was usually his fault. those days are past us now...we've been happy with each other for quite a while, so I'm ready to full commit....and for him to move in and be my life-mate. He is TOTALLY opposed to this, and anytime I try to talk to him about it he says I'm "pressuring" him. In fact, he only sleeps over on nights he doesn't have to work the next day, and if he does have to work, we only hang out until like midnight. It sucks. Its not like we just met. I've had to put up with his inability to commit and move in for a year now. I love him, but im so ready to have a live-in boyfriend, and be with someone I can think about marrying. He still lives at home with his parents and has no idea what it's like to be independent. I am fully self reliant. I think he and i are two different people and are drifting apart. His total lack of desire to grow up, move in, and fully commit is killing my desire to be his girlfriend. I love him, but im not happy. What do I do???

20090219161221AApzuLn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me at all?	so i've know this guy for such a long time ( four years) and we've always had this flirty relationship, but he is one of my best friends. i likes him so much three years ago, but he wasn't ready and i honestly don't know if he liked me. so i tried to move on and ended up dating someone for a few months but would constantly be thinking about the other guy. i ended up breaking up with my boyfriend because it just wasn't working, but the whole time i was dating that guy the one who i had liked for a while became extremely flirty. anyways about a year and a half ago we were both single and were basically best friends but i always had a thing for him. we were such flirts, but he is a flirt too. everyone would tell me that we would be soo cute together, and i think so too. im so comfortable around him, and im probably more comfortable around him than anyone else. we don't really talk at school because we hangout with different groups and he is always flirting with other girls. the other day we hungout and were home alone and nothing happened. i mean he put his arm around me and sat on me but nothing else. im close with his family and he's close with mine and i really think i do like him, but i just don't know how he fills. i mean is he interested in me? i really don't know & he's never been in a relationship.... please help. what do you think? what should i do ?
20090219161909AAtdbXA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hot asian girl I want to win over?	I want answers from someone who is in this situation or in a similar one. And please, spare me your judgments about my "lack of character". Anyway here is my story. I am totally digging this Filipina girl, problem is she is my my GRE tutor at Kaplan. She is totally smart, attends Brown, and Fu*k is she hilarious. It doesn't hurt that she use to be an import model (she had to to help pay her tuition). Would it be inappropriate to ask her out. I mean, she has mentioned some aspects of her life to me, and you wouldn't share that if you weren't comfortable or interested in a person right? Also, a small problem...she has a boyfriend, but I think I trump the guy in the looks department. He looks like one of those "scholarly types" as my friend puts it. I've been told that I look a lot like Colin Farrel, so would she dump the guy and take interest in me if I asked her out. She looks exactly like this model here  http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...    but she is with this guy in the white  http://flickr.com/photos/melisdramatic/2...  Which I really don't get the attraction. So should I ask her?

20090219160754AAgb11c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Every time he gets stressed, he says he doesn't want to be with me. Advice?	I'm seventeen (still in high school), and have been seeing the same guy since grade 10. We used to be really on and off because he wasn't mature enough for a relationship, but over time things have been getting better and better and we been on for quite some time, and are getting better at working through problems. Last week, he blew up at me and said he didn't feel right about our relationship. It was completely out of the blue, and within 2 days he apologized and said it was just him freaking out due to stress from school and his family. We had a really great Valentine's Day, and everything seemed awesome this week, until he snapped AGAIN today. He said a lot of really immature, angry words, but also said that he thinks clearer about our relationship when hes mad. I know for sure this time that he is stressed about school, and he has reasons to be. One of his coworkers also passed away. I'm not trying to make excuses for him, but i'm just so used to him taking out everything on me. I don't doubt that he'll be apologizing in a couple days. But I would like some advice on how to handle him, what to do/say, and so on. =(

20090219161721AAkErc5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why carn't i just stop crying?	My boyfriend has just moved away, not far away, but now we will hardly ever see each other because he was thrown out of his house and now living alone with no money etc, I don't even know the address he's living at and i cant ring him because he smashed his phone. But now he's gone i cant stop crying i listen to all slow sad songs and just look at the pictures we took. I just think about him all the time. I don't cry when im out with my friends but that just makes it worst because all of my friends hated him for no reason they never had the chance to get to know him. It makes me really sad though because i know all the things he's been through and hes had a really tough time growing up, & now hes gone and i don't think im ever going to see him again, i never even had the chance to say bye i just lay there reading the letter he wrote me before he went.    How do i stop crying and learnt to let go?
20090219161729AAgNpFD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I feel different from other girls who are excited about prom?	My aunt bought me a dress, (I never asked for it though) my mom set up appointments for hair and make up (I could do make up myself, or no make up since I like looking normal with no blues or greens on my eyelids) and I have to recite a welcome speech which my principal forced me into doing.       I know I should be excited about prom because that's how normal girls are, but it's not that I don't like getting dressed in formal attire (I'm going to wear my biker jacket with my prom dress) and getting my hair and make up done, it's just that I don't like being around my schoolmates. Even at school, I just can't stand being around people. My principal is making me sit at her table and she even said       "I've arranged all your tables so that the people you're next to aren't that close, so that you can all get to know each other"       After prom, the "Neutral" clique, people group me with them most of the time. They're the guys (they're guys) who, are always late for school, sometimes don't even go to school, they should be in college but they're still in high school, their jokes are clever (Not stupid toilet jokes) and they leave school early, they have this level of respect from other cliques and they leave them alone, I don't know if they're scared of them or what... but they're pretty nice. They're gonna be having drinks at one of the guys apartment building, one of my close friends (he's like a big brother to me) is going and he invited me. I wanna go for the sake of the drinks though.

20090219161920AAjd7nV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Wrote this song? What do you think?	Ok, so i like this girl in the grade below me. im a freshmen in highschool which puts her in 8th. Shes extremely shy and keeps to herself. but shes so beautiful. a mutual friend says my chances are slim since shes never had a boyfriend. but i really have nothing to lose by it so whatever. ive NEVER talked to her before. but its not that im afraid to, since i am all over girls and i have no problem with them. but its just that i have nothing to say. i dont wanna go up and just say "hey whats up?" thats lame. and doesnt work. our friend asked her if she knows who i am, she said yes so thats a start. haha itll take awhile but might be worth it so whatever. i thought i might write a song and have my band play it for the talent show. might dedicate it to her haha. i dont know yet. but this is my first song ive ever written. since our guitarist always writes but here it is...            INTRO:   You may have seen the shadow,   That’s bleeding from your footsteps,   You may have seen that boy,   From whom that shadow came,   And silently... silently,    He’s screaming out your name.      CHORUS:   The boy in the shadow may not,    Be exactly what you’re looking for,   But a key to your heart,   May be the start,   To prying open that door.      VERSE I:   He’s a hard punk rocker,   She’s a small town girl,   Who mostly keeps to herself,   And doesn’t notice the world.   He only wants to hold her hand,   But they’re so damn different that he’s worried,   That they’re over before they even began.      CHORUS:   The boy in the shadow may not be exactly what you’re looking for,   But a key to your heart,   May be the start,   To prying open that door.      Verse II:   As he stands across the hall their eyes meet,   She quickly looks away,   His friend’s word’s echo as though he’s got nothing to say.   He can’t look away since her beauty has him dazed.   As he stares minutes turn into hours,   And hours,   Bleed into days.      Verse III:   He wants nothing more than to show the girl of his dream,   The man he knows he can be.   She hears through the grapevine how he cares,   Yet, she doesn’t believe since all he’s given is stares.      CHORUS X2      OUTRO:   You may have seen the shadow,   That’s bleeding from your footsteps,   You may have seen that boy,   From whom that shadow came,   And silently,   He’s screaming out your name.

20090219165505AA9oSTs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this really love we're feeling?	My boyfriend and I have been together for awhile now. We've been through so much with each other. We've lost our virginity to each other. He thinks I'm amazing and I feel the same way about him. He said he dreams about me. I can't stop thinking about him and I odn't want to. We want to spend the rest of our lives together. We tell each other everything like our dreams and our feelings towards one another. He can always makes me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. He's sweet,funny,smart,sensitive,caring. I'v ebeen hurt so many times before so I have trust issues but I trust him completly. I care about him more than words can explain. Every time we hug I feel safe and warm. When we're together I don't see or care about any one else besides him. Nothing seams to matter now that he's a part of my life. He holds a special place in my heart. Our eyes always light up when we're together. When we're driving in his car and we're sitting there in silence he looks over at me and says "You're so pretty." That always put a smile on my face and it makes my heart melt. He leaves me cute little text messages that say "I miss you." and other stuff. He tells me he loves everything about me. He said he's falling in love with me and it feels incredible. He said he wanted to look me straight in the eyes Saturday and tell me he loves me for the first time but he got really nervous. I told him their was nothing to be nervous about and I would of said it back. He told me he whispered it to himself. We both get this over whelming feeling that signal love whenever we're together. I feel like I want to go outside and scream "I love Tommy!" so everyone can hear it. I just wanted to know if this sounds like we're in love or just lust? I really want to make sure I mean it before I say it because it's a big deal. I never knew I could feel this way about any one in my life. I don't need smart comments that say "If you really were in love you wouldn't be asking a bunch or straingers" etc. Thank you to every one who answers.
20090219165816AAKksdW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are the chances I will be a virgin forever?	Even if I am not that bad looking. Now I know this may sound kind of conceited, but when I look in the mirror I see a fairly decent looking guy. I am kinda short, like 5'7 and have a fairly athletic frame and weigh about 135 pounds. The reason i am asking this is because Now that I am 16, I feel like I am way behind in dating and stuff like that. A lot of my friends I remember started dating in like 5th or 6th grade and by now have all lost their virginity. I am in no rush to lose my virginity, its just I kind of feel like a loser when my friends start talking about girl friends and I have never even had one. I have never been asked out by a girl (except like 2 times these girls tried to give me their numbers, but I didn't really like them and just made up some random digits lol) but I think that is partly because until this year I was not fashion concious. I wore glasses, never cut or combed my hair ( so it looked like a rats nest) and wore kinda geeky cloths. Basically I was pretty ugly looking and shy. Now I wear contacts and take better care of my hair and stuff and I think that I look a lot better, even though I am still shy. Anyway, for some reason I feel like I am just gonna be one of those people who is a virgin their whole lives and is depressed all the time. Girl wise I don't think I have that high of standards. I even like some women who are older lol. As long as they aren't grandmas, increadibly fat, or really ugly I wouldn't turn down a girl because of her looks. so does it sound like I will be a virgin forever If I am shy, short, and kinda decent looking? thank you.
20090219165911AAWBaHD	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I fix a friendship when I don't know what's wrong?	A friend and I are having a bit of a rough spot in our friendship. She's upset with me and the only problem is that I don't know what about. I've asked her several times already and she either made excuses to avoid the question or simply says "I don't want to talk about it, it makes me upset."      I've told her that I just want to fix things and not telling me will only make things worse, but she replied with "We'll have to cope, or something."       I have a feeling that it has to do with me feeling left out whenever another friend of hers hangs out with us, as they always seem to talk only with each other. She avoided this when I tried to talk about it, too. How can I fix this?

20090203044519AA9cIyQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Too friendly with my mom?!?	okay, so ive been seeing this guy joe in secret for a couple of months. we just tell people we are friends because we both dont know if we want to officially date or not. just last weekend i introduced him to my mother for the very first time, we had a family dinner with my little sisters but my father was away on business.      joe always said he wanted to meet my parents and hes actually an employee in the same company where my mom is an intern (she wants to work soon). anyway, he always said she should pass by his office and say hello but she never did since she had never met him.      but we had a great dinner and my mom really liked him.when he said bye he even told her in front of me that she should come to his office and say hi and maybe they can have lunch or coffee. then the next weekend he even sat me down and was being really sweet, opening up to me and even suggested we change our relationship in a positive way.      however, he contacted my mom via facebook to thank her for having him for dinner. she replied saying he was welcome and he should come again. then he replied saying he was serious about her coming to his office and that if the weather is nice they can walk and get some coffee. this is where i started freaking out.      is he being too friendly? i mean hes only met my mother once and shes a good looking woman. is he hoping to hit on her or something?! im also worried because i heard he has a crazy sexual past and he has shown a sexual side with me as well but now hes changed and is being very sweet and charming.      im also not american and joe is american. can someone please answer me if its normal (especially in american/european culture) for a man to behave this way or does he have other intentions. we live in africa.      i'm really worried he may be trying to get closer with my mom in an inappropriate way. first my mom said its a bit weird and then said no hes probably just being friendly and wants to connect with your family and replied saying she'll come and say hello.      what do YOU think? should i talk to joe about it or will i just look crazy and jealous? he believes my mom thinks we are only friends and doesnt know about us.

I'm not talking about being mixed and being raised by a white women, because that person still is half white. But I'm talking about being completely white, and being raised by a black parent. My boyfriends best-friend is white and is raised by a black women, and his white dad. I mean he calls her mom and everything (I think because something happened to his mom when he was like 2 or 3 years old). Do you think it's weird?

20090220081526AAQLrIR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	RELATIONSHIP CRISIS HELP!!!! PLEASE?	So I have been with my bf for just about two years now.  Things were really great at first but now everything had died down.  I know we are both at fault to blame for the way things have gotten.  It takes two to fight.  For the longest time I kept him away from my friends bc I was afraid he would leave me for one of them.  I have started to try and include him now.  We fight pretty much everyday and it is starting to wear the both of us down.  When things were going good we talked about wanting kids.  Im only 22 and I know that’s young but we really wanted one.  Well we have never used protection.  With the way things have been recently I told him that if he wanted to do it he would have to wear a rubber.  He doesn’t like that bc we haven’t used one before and I haven’t gotten pregnant yet so he doesn’t really see the point.  I told him  what if that eventually happens.  With the way things are right now bringing a baby into this wouldn’t be fair.  We haven’t had sex in about 2 weeks.  I tell him that why do I want I want to have sex when all we do is fight.  He keeps saying hurtful things to me and each time he says he wont do it anymore.  Im really getting tired of the hurtful things.  I know I could be more understanding when he says things and explains them.  Im just so worn down.  He says he misses me but still continues his old behavior.  Yeah he has bought me a lot of things and pays for most of the bills bc I don’t make enough.  Gifts don’t matter when youre not nice to the person.   He always says what haven’t I done for you.  We have tried so many times to make things things work and each time things only get better for a couple weeks      Well about a month or so ago I met a new guy and we have hung out a couple times.  I talk to him almost everyday.  He treats me great.  When we hung out he doesn’t let me pay for anything opens my car door.  Everytime I talk to him im so happy.  Im starting to fall for him.  He says he misses me he thinks about me a lot.  He is such a gentleman.         Idk what to do.  Please help

20090220081655AA82FQt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did I made the wrong decision?	Did i made the wrong decision?   my husband and I had a fight last night. it was a very small arguement that escaladed to something stupidly big. I was trying to explain him something and he was telling me a different version of what i'm telling him because he want me to accept that he was right and my opinion was wrong. I got annoyed by him pushing his way when I was trying to tell him something and he does not listen to what I said. I ended up telling him to stop it and just leave it alone because obviously he's not listening to what I said but he kept going on and on. I told him I don't want to talk to him about it, I want to just leave the subject alone and he can say what he want to say and I respect his opinion but I just don't want to talk about it anymore. He did not listen to what I was telling him because he wanted me to accept what he thought is right which I don't have the problem. It was not about who's right or wrong, what I was trying to tell him is to listen to what I thought about the subject. It aggravates me a lot when he started telling me that I am stubborn because I don't listen to him and he started calling me names and calling me a "noodle" in front of his kid. I told him not to call me names because I don't call him names but he kept calling me names. that I am a noodle and i need to grow up. I snapped and left the house and ended up sleeping in my cousin's place to get away with his sermon. I came home this morning to get ready to work and he never comes out of our room. Was I wrong in going out of the house and slept for the first time, at my cousin's?

20090220084144AAP7YDS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make it up with her? What do girls like as gift? Help me please!?	I am a par time photographer. But I really care for this 24year old girl. We have known each other from school days itself. She used to be my best friend and I even used to tell her about my exploits abt other women I had in bed. She seemed to enjoy it all. She modeled then but never did nude art and was always uncomfortable with it and refused to pose for me then.That was during our college days. We kept in touch through phone and net. Nothing happened. She always maintained her distance but was really a good friend but I wanted more.Few months back I learned that her modeling career was not going so well. I asked her to pose for me & this time she agreed. We did 4 to 5 sessions and I asked for a nude art session but she bluntly refused. I persuaded her telling it would give the much needed boost to her career. Actually I really wanted to help her out. She wouldn't take money directly from me or from anyone.      I invited her to my apartment and made her take strong drinks till she was tipsy. Then we did the photography. I made her pose provocatively and then finally once more I begged for some nude poses. This time she agreed. The drinks and she herself nude made me lose all my control. I fingered her and she liked it. And finally she ended up in bed with me. but I am sure she enjoyed every bit of it. She was a virgin and later she was crying and all in the morning. Its all my fault but I still love this girl. She has asked me to go away from her life. How do I convince her that she was not just another women that I had my way with. (well That’s how she puts it). I miss her very badly. At least I need her friendship back. She even refuses to talk to me. I gave back her photos(I didn't feel like giving it to anyone even while I took it when she was willing) and she was really mad at me and literally shut the door at my face after tearing the photos savagely. I wouldn't have minded even if she has slapped me on the face or something...I only want her to be all right now..I really miss her badly.      How can I get her back? I know I acted crap. But I love her. Just tell me how do I approach her. She is not even responding my calls...and please dont make me more miserable I know I acted carp..If you can think of any good ideas to make her fine ..please tell me..I love her so very much.   Please .I am asking for ideas to get her back and if you want to criticize just go on, call me a bastard or whatever u want..but give some good ideas to get her back...I really miss her and want her back at least as my friend.

20090220093326AARZGgQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is technology helpful or hurtful to your relationship?	Communicating via text message, email, etc. - does that help you and your spouse speak with each other or has it become a replacement to spend time together and speak in person?      My husband and I have different work schedules and only see each other 2 nites per week.  The other 5 days we are on completely opposite schedules, and we basically just text message each other all those days because we barely have more than 5 minutes to talk.  Unfortunatley the use of text message to communicate has just hurt our relationship... its completely taken over every other form of communication and though we text its still not satisfying enough to be able to communicate with each other.  The text messages have really  just hurt our relationship more because rather than take the 5 minutes to call we just text and that just makes us farther and farther from each other.  Text messaging and emailing aren't good enough... if we don't see each other then communication is pretty much non-existent.  Hence our rocky relationship.      So I would like to know what you think... do you think texting or emailing are good ways to communicate with each other or do they just become a replacement to real communication?

We just celebrated our 11 yr anniversary and now he's telling me how he's ready to get married and wants more kids. How do I tell him that I'm over it and don't really want to be a Mrs. anymore nor do I want anymore kids?
20090203071715AAFtbyz	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why is my fiance so to headed?	Im engaged to an amazing NYPD man. He is so caring and treats me wonderful plus he is so gorgeous ha. He is known to be very sarcastic and out spoken he also has a really short temper & is very hot headed apparently on the job also. Despite his apparent co*kiness he is amazing i guess cause i see the 'real' him. My 3 best friends are fond of him but my other friends don't get him at all and ask me why i am with him, i try to make them see but they refuse to. My family are the same,They are very comfortable money wise and are so stuck up im not like them at all. They tell me i could do so much better but i absolutely love him. I hate the tension that's going on. I am 25 years old(my fiance is 30) & this shouldn't bother me but it does. Once when he had a fight he ended up putting his fist through the wall. He snapped at me the other night during sex again i just walked away. We don't fight that much at all but when we do i just walk away or leave the house, sometimes when i get back he has done something really romantic for me. He grew up with an abusive father and his brother is an addict he is the only one who came good from his family. Could that be a reason for him being so angry? I love him so much, i adore him. Please help?

20090220084540AA2VCrY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I have a problem with sex addiction?	I found that the only time I enjoy sex is when its a promiscuous encounter.  A one night stand, or casual sex.  I think that i feel more open and less pressure in these situations.  I have been sleeping around a lot lately, but truly enjoying the sex.  Actually, I feel more sexually fulfilled than ever before. I know this is terrible for me, there could be consequences but I just dont see why I should have to sit through awful sex.  I feel like as women we are expected to endure it.  I like being single for this reason.  I think I purposely screw up relationships so I can be alone. Then, on the other hand, I have times when I go to bed at night and want to cry because..damnit..Im lonely.  I want someone to love me for me, but it never happens. I have a serious problem!

I dated this guy for a month (lets call him Bob) but after a month Bob confessed to meeting this girl over the weekend and he likes her more than me. I'm pretty open and non judge mental and i appreciated his honesty. He is now going out with the girl. Bob and I are cool now and we still talk and hang like buds but i just recently met his brother and I like him a lot. Lets call his brother Bill. I have lots of stuff in common with Bill and i think he likes me a bit too. if you were bob would you get mad. would you end up hating me? I don't want to cause any fights between brothers. is this ethical?

20090220090905AA9Ppzj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Child support and visitation questions?	ok so here is the story my brother in law has a four year old daughter that he has never seen and today i went his court hearing because he doesn't speak english and he needed help he is unemployed and behind on his child support. he wanted me to ask them if he could get a DNA test and if it is his daughter than he also wants visitation. They told us we would have to find a place to do the test and even if it isn't his kid he still has to pay the back support and they also told us that we would have to go and file papers for him to get visitations. so my question is if the child isn't his how can they make him support it and why cant he see the kid he has done nothing wrong legally except not paying of course. also he will be working again in april and we told the judge that he could start paying again then.

I know the overwhelmingly majority of women have a problem with men who never wants kids and wants a vasectomy. Women who want kids can't imagine what I think about them, mostly negative thoughts.      Do you have a problem with men who never wants kids and prefers to have a vasectomy? If a man was to get one, which would you recommend? A conventional or a no-scalpel?
20090220101623AAwgLXD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Boyfriend's ex-wife is starting to harass me again?	When my boyfriend and I started dating a year and a half ago, his ex-wife gave us a lot of problems. I'm his first serious girlfriend since his divorce so I think it was difficult for her. She consistently came to my house, (I never answered the door) called me (she says she "wants to talk"), and followed me in her car if she saw me driving. My boyfriend confronted her about her behaviour and told her enough is enough. She's going to counselling and for the past 8 months things seemed to have calmed down.      However, two weeks ago she knocked on my door again. I haven't said anything to my boyfriend because I don't want to rock the boat and start all the drama again. Things have been so peaceful! Should I say anything to him or just ignore it and hope she goes away? I'm trying not to let her craziness interfere with our relationship, that's why I'm hesitant to tell him.
20090203063612AA4hSbX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is wrong with him?	I work with this man, we used to be good friends but feelings developed and our friendship got awkward. Basically, I thought he was more into another woman and he did seem caught between us, so I wouldn't entertain him, despite the fact he claimed they were just friends. However, he was uncomfortable if the three of us were at a social do together, so.....Anyway, it seemed to me that when I tried to be friends with him again, he was cold. He came around then and we were getting on great, but just then, he turned cold again. So I have kept my distance, I have been polite etc, but don't go out of my way to engage him in chat etc. Thing is, THIS is pissing him off. The fact that I don't make an effort to be friends seems to be making things worse, in the sense that he now barely says hello back to me even on the odd occasions that we bump into each other during the day. I dunno, is he trying to make us more distant by doing this, or is he annoyed that I won't make an effort so is paying me back? Also, if I look well, he avoids me like the plague, makes a point of looking away or pretending that he can't see me (so I'll see him doing it, even other people have noticed this and this is a guy whose entire interaction with women is based on flirtation and compliments) BUT if I look casual, he will bouyantly say hello and it is like old times. What gives?

20090220091748AA4ikQp	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How to gracefully back out of a wedding?	I need help or advice. My daughter and I have been asked to be in a wedding of a family member. My dilemma is that financially we just can't afford it. I accepted last year and when things were better for my family but now things have changed and the savings I did have is now gone. I asked my mom is she could help with the dresses and she said she could. My mom also said that she was pretty sure that the dresses wouldn't be real expensive because the bride and other members in the wedding were also having financial problems and couldn't afford much.    So today I find out that the dress is $150 and the wrap is $30 not including taxes or the dress for my daughter who is suppose to be the flower girl. And the dresses have to be ordered so it can't be purchased on a lay away plan. I am freaking out and my blood pressure is racing this is too much money to ask from my mom and I wasn't expecting such a costly dress. Possibly if I could have paid over time it would be alright but it can't be.    How can I handle this to make it all right. I amconsideringg asking if I could possibly leave my daughter in as flower girl and maybe participate as a hostess.

But then i asked her to hangout as friends i guess tommorw and she alright but she was saying it was going to be awakrd and stuff but i was hoping to show her good time likes the times we used to have and i am going to get haircut because she's been wanting me to forever and i am going to shave because also she wanted me to shave and wear the shirt she just bought me 2 days ago. Do you think this would be the right apporach to get her back? I know she still loves me because she keeps calling me and says she loves me and misses me shes called me 4 times since we broke up last night. what do you think i should do and dont say let her go or anything like that because i want to get her back. So is this the right approach on trying to get her back or what is the right approach and if i do hangout with her should i act as friends (which would be weird and hard) or should i act like nothing happend and were still together but no kissing. I think if i hangout with her and do everyove i listed above i might have better chance. What do you think?   10points to best answer

20090220085017AAXTuaU	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Help with my Wedding Plans please?	Hiya.      I'm recently engaged and don't really have any female friends or family to discuss wedding plans with.      My husband-to-be has made very little input... "Lets just me and you go to Oz and get married and honeymoon there. The end." which kind of cuts out any kind of ceremony or family or anything. It would just be like any other holiday.      On the other hand, however, i don't really want the big stress of a huge planned wedding either.      I am currently thinking along the lines of going somewhere snowy relatively close and we also take along a kind of film crew and making a professional looking silent film (with music playing) of the big day from me getting ready, getting to the church, getting married, having a dance and some champagne and being carried over the threshold.      Then flying to Oz and making a home movie of the honeymoon.      Then we get back, have a party with food and everyone there - play the movies so they get to see the event but without us having to worry about everything going to plan.      What do you think? Sounds like it covers everything? Can you spot any problems? Any suggestions?      Also - where do i start going about arranging it all?      Thanks

She stated that she wants her closest friends, me included, to partake in the ceremony. I have done a little research on what exactly handfasting is, but feel I could learn alot more about it and what my role may be, so I don't mess anything up.   She asked me if I had a cape, which I do not. I don't think I have time to order one online, but just in case does anyone know of some good web sites that supplies the things I need?      **Handfasting is a spritual binding between two people, much like a wedding.

20090220085918AAoJCva	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do I sound selfish about not having a ring?	I'm not really into jewelery. In fact, all I were is a cross and different earrings, but I feel kind of sad my husband didn't buy at least cheap wedding rings from at least a pawn shop. He says he will be the one to buy them. We were just recently married through the Justice of The Peace (we don't have much money) and just a couple weeks before we did his income taxes came in giving him approximately $245. I don't know everything he did with the money but what I do know he did is buy apps for the games he plays online, buy a computer game on ebay, a $80 gift for a close friend on ebay he owes money to to partially pay him off, plus more expensive cigarettes. A few days after we got married I found out the tax earning were gone. The money he gets paid monthly is small and I help support us financially as well. Am I being a cry baby, a ***** or selfish feeling bad he used all his tax earnings on different things and not wedding rings? Does it make a little sense? We were engaged for not super long, but awhile.

He told me he loves me, but i'm not allowed to date.. this wouldnt be a problem, i could do it behind my parents back, but i just dont know whether he is worth it..   we are best friends and get on really well..but i'm sure he likes 2 other girls as well..one of them being his ex. He tried to kiss me last week but i stopped him and told him that i didnt believe him when he told me he loved me - because he loves everyone, later on he walked me home and we hugged outside my house and when we broke apart he just said: "I'm not lying. And you know that." But still i think he has feelings for his ex and i just cant see him until he stops..what do i do?! he tells me he doesnt love her anymore, but i cant believe him!   Its just he always knows the right thing to say..
20090220092314AA3S93o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do I seem to attract married men/men in relationships?	After a long term relationship, I've been single for a little over a year or so. I've gone on dates, have met a few nice guys, nothing serious.      BUT the guys that actually pursue me, talk to me daily, want to be intimate, have ALL had someone else in the picture. I dated someone for the last 6 months only to find out he had a girlfriend. Before that, same situation. I was seeing someone 4 months and saw him with his "girlfriend" at the bar. Recently, was asked out...and found out he was engaged. Even friends of mine ask me out after a break up-- probably just to take their mind off of the other girl. And I always get the same story when I confront them-- I'm so amazing, love hanging out with me, I deserve so much better, blah blah.      I don't understand. I'm nice, down to earth. I have morals, not a wild party girl. I'm against infidelity/shadiness. very open, honest. And am looking for the same things in a person. Why do I only seem to attract people that are already attached?
20090220100056AAC4Jwf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What to do for friend's wedding?	My due date is 6 weeks before a good friend's wedding.  She was in my wedding 5 years ago and paid for my bachelarette party.  She also lives several states away.  I am thinking I am not going to make it to her wedding and will stay home with my baby but what should I do for her?  I was thinking of sending money to her sister to go toward her bachelarette party but now I am thinking if I should send my friend who is getting married an extra big wedding gift of money instead of sending it to her sister.  Any ideas of what would be best to do in this situation?  Thank you.
20090220094107AABfM0G	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	People have said I'm shallow. If it's true then I might as well marry for money anyhow?	I don't want people to think of me as shallow.   I don't want to be shallow.   I just know I'm the way I am after the way I've grown up.  Marrying for money is shallow...but unless I can change, I might as well go for having a comfortable life...   I don't want to change from how I am...so that leaves me no options.   Does anyone understand my dilemma?

20090220085147AAaNoSP	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding colors question? which do you like?	At first I was going to go with pewter and persimmon (orange). My fiance hated it but I think it's a cool unusual combo. My wedding is in November, so orange is appropriate. The main thing that threw me off of this color scheme is the bridesmaids dresses. My bridesmaids are all pretty fair skinned and orange woudn't be the best color. It was more of a burnt spicey orange, not like home depot orange. The pewter dresses were pretty but it felt too boring and gray.    My other choice now is gold, purple and a sage-moss green. For decorations mostly gold, sage, and cream with dark purple accents. The dresses would look beautiful in any of these colors, and they have always been my favorite. What do you like?

Our daughter looks exactly like her father. My boyfriend and i have a great relationship and we are a happy family but his mother is causing fights between us. She always calls and says our daughter is not his and our daughter is too ugly to be her sons daughter. This is making it extremely tough. How do i cope with this? This is stressing me out to no end and i ball my eyes out. She has NEVER liked me and always says im a white trash hoe. I just don't understand why she won't except our beautiful baby girl. I've bent over backwards to get her to except me and my daughter but she won't.

But throughout the entire car ride, he sat there staring at me. the first time I could feel he was staring at me, A turned to look at him and he turned beet red. but he still kept doing it. and whenever I wasn't looking at him, he was looking at my hair and at my earrings. Tis guy also teases me a lot. and is trying to always convince me that he's all muscle, by talking about his workout routine. Also, when someone asked us if we were dating, he blushed and said, ''um...lacey's 2 years younger than I am..''. Does he like me????
20090220091238AAg8lj9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He withdrew from me... and i need to know why???? Guys (and girls) help!!!?	So heres the breakdown... We started off as friends... turned into FWB... and i was ok with it... and like all friends with benefits relationships turn out... I started to like him... He always made it very clear that he wasnt ready for a relationship... but i had "hope" (stupid... i know!) anyway... it got to the point for me where It hurt, but after a while of hurting i just became numb and ignored my feelings for him... all the while... we were still being intimate... He always encouraged me seeing other guys, cause again... "hes not ready"       Here we are almost a year later of seeing eachother... we love eachother dearly... but in more of a plutonic way... anyway... I noticed he started drifting a little... so i addressed it last night... and he basically told me he didnt want to sleep with me anymore, because one of us was going to get hurt... and he didnt want it to be him... (or me) but right now him!! SO WAIT A MINUTE??? i didnt know where this was coming from... he always encouraged me seeing other people... but he now confesses that its been bothering him... and maybe even feeling a little jealous... which was extremely hard for him to say to begin with...       Why would he rather go through this... and feel this way instead of being with me???

20090220091955AAp0wOI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why are we so schizo about sex?	If you ask most parents when kids should start having sex, they'll say 18, 21, when you have a good career, etc.  Then ask them when they first had sex and most of them say well, um, gosh, well I was only 15, but you should wait.        Why are we so unrealistic and hypocrtical?  Do we really expect young people now to wait longer than we did?        Kids hormones start exploding earlier all the time, and they WILL do something about it!  We can do like our parents, and scare them into doing it in the backs of cars or other crazy places, or we can accept that this is a normal part of teen life and support them!  What else can we do?
20090220092451AA1TP6j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Change of Heart...from abuse to a "Gentleman"!! Maybe? How Should a Man Treat A Woman?	I am living with my ex-boyfriend.  We broke up Nov.2008, and all because he would talk extremely abusive to me.  I've asked him to leave repeatedly, and although he is almost moved out, he's taking his time, and acting really nice with me lately.  Buying me dinner every so often, paying for a few things here and there...but not household stuff.  He's being more affectionate than ever before, too.  But when I want to go see my family or a few aquaintances I have, he gets extremely mean with me.  Says things like, remember those who are always there for you...because you are going to need them.  Guilting me into not having a good time...or making me feel as if I shouldn't go.  We used to fight about my going to see friends a lot...my family doesn't like him at all. I hardly have any friends because of him.  Also, he surrounds himself around me and my 2 sons more, as if he likes to engage in family time...more than before.  He is an artist. A toy designer and illustrator, graphic designer...you name it he's got it.  He's getting famous all around the world: London, Japan, Australia...he does awesome work, that I admire very much.  He stopped the physical abuse about 2 years ago, but the verbal and psychological abuse continued...sometimes even to this day.  It's on and off with his tirades, mostly because I tell him that he is being offensive, and also, I ignore him and that gets him even more insecure about himself- he develops a baby personality and backs off. He does suffer from a clinical disorder. Seen 2 psychologists already...but hasn't been clinically diagnosed.  Only reason I know he has a disorder is because one of those psych's is my Stepmother. I go through feelings of I admire him, I love him...then I really want him out of my life. We are still intimate, but don't call each other boyfriend or girlfriend anymore. Most of his friends, especially in the art field, don't know I even have children and am divorced.  He is also divorced with a son.   I try to stop being intimate with him, but then he does and says everything so nicely and gentlemanly for the next few days, that I regress to my old habits of giving in.  I haven't asked him to stop packing, because I believe this will be good for him...he's never lived alone...but he then hurts my feelings when we have a disagreement about something,and then says that he will not want to stay in touch with someone like me after he leaves my home.  He thinks I'm not a "good girl" according to his eyes...oh yeah--he doesn't pay rent, or food, or utilities...he complains almost everyday, until I call him on it...then he blames it on something else. And he's always talking about other girls he knows that don't have big ****, that show through their blouses, and dresses like a Banana Republic model.  He dresses like that too.  We've known each other since 1995, and been living together since 2004.  Am I afraid to move on? On top of my issue in not knowing how a man should treat a woman? I don't mean spoiling, I mean respect, consideration and loyalty. I really need advice, because I don't want to mess up something that could be good for us in the long run...but then again, how can it be good, if he's behaving cruelly now?  I don't care about money, as I'm paying for everything anyway...but my heart aches, because I think I'll be losing a friend soon too!
20090220092218AAn1Tc4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can this be forgiven or should I run away from this man?	I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years.  He told me he was getting a divorce when we first met.  I was doing the same.  My divorce wasn't going through and my doubts about ending the marriage were obvious to him because I didn't hide my feelings from him.  I thought his divorce went through and he was divorced.  He always told me the best thing he did was get out of that relationship.  About a year later, I catch him at his ex-wife's house and then find out he isn't divorced.  They had been seperated and living states away from eachother.  He had filed but never had her served because she was using the kids against him (so he says).  He and I have spent so much time talking and together that I don't know how he hid this from me.  According to him he rarely spoke to her and only seen her 3 times when it involved the kids, although he did to admit to sexual encounters with her on 2 of those occasions.  He also lied to her about me.  He told her he wasn't seeing anyone else.  I left and he followed me back to my state.  Now he wants me to forgive him and move forward.  He said he didn't know how much I loved him and now he does.  He said fears of being alone is what fueled him to lie.  So should i give him a second chance and see if he's changed because I do love him (god knows why) or should I cut my losses now and run away as fast as possible.

20090220093220AAq3kQt	Family & Relationships;Friends	Are these poems my friend wrote any good? shes 12?	It's not because their bad.   It's because they're sad.   Was that a raindrop?   Or a tear?   They want to live.    Another day, another year.   Dreams don't always come true.   Knife at hand.   Blood pours out.   You look up in a daze.   And hear your loved ones shout.   They shout for they're scared.   They're More than scared.    They are seeing their flesh and blood die.    In a few minutes, they will be on they're knees.   Asking, Screaming, to God, WHY!?   What did we do to deserve this?   We gave Her everything!   Food, Clothing, Bedding, Bling!?!   Was it something we did?   Something they said?   Why couldnt you have told us that she was ready.   we could have saved her!   WHY DIDNT YOU HELP   her little sister is wondering why   why her mommy is starting to cry   "Don't worry Baby. Mommy's Okay."   Sissy is going. Somewhere beautiful to stay."                              Sad, crying   heart is dying.   Trying not to.   Nothing i can do.   The tears just keep coming.   His voice in my head, keeps humming louder.   Im sorry that I wasn't interesting enough.   Or didn't have the right words.   All i want now are the cures.   It lasted what? 3 days?   Is that long enough to decide?   All that I can do now is hide and cry.   I know you dont understand.   You probably won't even try to lend a hand.   No, Im not okay. Thank you for asking.   Nothing you can do or say, can help me now.   I miss you.   Do you?   All I want is the right guy. That isn't you?   I thought i was right. I thought I knew.   But all I knew is that i loved you.   And that I knew you loved me too.   Man, I was so wrong.   It didnt even last long.   So, here I am. Thinking.   All we really said was "So...."   If only you could know.    You would understand.   Just how much it meant to me when you said, " I love you too."   My heart dropped, my breathing stopped,   I thought that it showed something.   But I guess not.   I remember when we met.   I thought this was something I wouldn't regret.   But now, I need help.   I need help more than ever.   So just know this.   I'll never be able to stop loving you.   It was a shoot and miss.   It was my last bliss.

20090220093310AAT530s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you girls think about this?	I have been in a wheel chair for just over 5 years now. When i first had my accident my boyfriend would help me with everything even going to the bathroom. the first few times that he helped me out in the bathroom i noticed that he didn't flush the toilet after i would "potty". after about a week i found out that he was actually getting my "stuff" out of the toilet and keeping it. I asked him about it a couple of days later and he said that he couldn't watch something that came from me go down the toilet. I thought it was nice that he loves me so much that he even wants that part of me. it took me a while to adjust but i haven't used a toilet in over 4 and a half years. We have developed a bond that will last forever. When you can take the worst part of being human and turn it in to a positive then you know its meant to be. Have any of you experienced anything like this befor.

20090220093930AArnEsa	Family & Relationships;Family	Children with developmental and/or physical disabilities playing Little League?	Children with developmental and/or physical disabilities playing Little League?   I was wondering if anyone out there has a child with a mild to moderate developmental and/or physical disability who plays in Little League baseball in their area. My 8 year old son has multiple learning disabilities and some motor skill issues from being hit by a car a few years ago. You really wouldn't know unless you really interacted with him. I recently put him in our local LL Baseball league. I'm kind of worried because a lot of these kids have be playing for a while and my son is new so he doesn't really know how to play the game. But they are also very good at it with the throwing and catching. Some of them are also very competitive. My son takes a long time to learn sometimes and I worry that some of the kids yelling at him for making mistakes will start to get to him. He told me he likes to play when I asked him and his coach told him he did a good job at the end of practice. When I enrolled him I wanted him to have fun, but I didn't take into consideration the competitiveness of his teammates. I didn't tell the coach about his issues because I didn't want him to judge him ahead of time. But now I worry that I jumped the gun when I enrolled him. I don't know what to do. Does anyone out there have a child with these issues that plays LL? How was their experience?

20090220095919AA7L2wh	Family & Relationships;Family	Weird family issue--Is something wrong with me?	I will be eighteen in May. Ever since I was 13 and my step dad died, I have been the man of the house and have helped my mom take care of my brother and two sisters. I don’t want anyone to insult me or anything, but for about a year and a half now, I have been having these feelings for my mom. She is a very beautiful woman and sometimes, I even feel like I’m her husband or something. I help her with the kids, and she comes to me for advice about them. I even help her pay the bills with the money I make at my part time job. I had been seeing this one girl off and on from school for about six months, but I lost interest in her really quickly and when we had sex, all I could think about was my mom. Please don’t think I’m weird or deranged. I really am a normal guy. But I do think that I have something wrong with my thinking. Am I the only one who thinks like this? What should I do about it? I don't know what would be best, personally, but I don't think it would be a good idea to say anything to my mom.
20090220095932AApFGdL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife is forever spending time with her family and it really bugs me! What should I do?	Ok before we got married, we we knew each other for 5 years of dating and friendship and everything was good. But until the day me and her sister had some fricition {IM NOT GOING TO EVEN BOTHER GOING INTO SUBJECT ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN THERE} I have always been uncomfortable with her visiting her sisters, and family like 4 times a week! I adore her parents, because everytime they see me they always welcome me, offer something to eat and ask me how am I doing at work and stuff like that. Her brothers are also cool with me, they always say "hello" or ask what's new....but her sister <-----who happens to have the big mouth of the family, rarely talks to me or says anything and it makes me feel so uncomfortable and unwelcomed! She doesn't give me mean looks but just basically ignores me. I have tried talking to my wife about how it makes me feel so uncomfortable that when we go out with her sister, she doesnt talk to me and my wife says "I have talk to my sister and she says, she has nothing against you but just has nothing to say to you" <---which I find complete BS, it's only polite to talk to every one in the party of 5 {including me} during dinner!!! Not be interactive with everyone else and ignore me! I explain this to her but she completly falls back on her sisters side! uggghhh! it's so frusterating. So I'm so sick and tired of her always going out with her sister 4 times a week to who knows where {even if it's something as innocent as eating out} it still bothers me! So what should I do? One thing I know for a fact is that she has made me look bad to her sister by telling her things like "he's an a**Hole, he cuts off my credit card" or things like that {HELLO!!!! YOUR PAST YOUR LIMIT AND DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY! TO PAY IT!}. So what should I do guys??? Should I start to turn into the jerk she describes me or what? She also has no problem leaving me every f***en night when ever we argue about it to her sisters house to stay there.

20090220100951AA0O2Xv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do i feel confused?	i have this online male friend. we have known each other for at least a year. we have a good time chatting, and have recently become closer friends. of course we are both adults. i'm 23 and he's 49. for about a few months he's been saying "love u" and giving a yahoo kiss when we say good night. i don't say it back to him because i don't want him to think anything. truth is i'm not sure how i feel about him now. we used to have "fun" together online but haven't done that for months now. reason is i believe i want more then just i guess the best way to describe it would "friend with benefits" although we have never met in person. and at the same time i was starting to feel that i also felt fear of sexual things being the only reason he talks to me. he doesn't ask to have that kind of fun and we still talk just as much as we did back then. i've also been thinking about meeting up with him. we have talked about it. he would come up to visit me for a weekend and we would probably eat out or something. he says he would never hurt me. and anything sexually related would be up to me. if it was to happen he said i would have to be the one to make that move. i want to just tell him lets make the final plan for him to come see me. but fear keeps holding me back. probably because i've been lied to in the past way back when i was in school. and my friend today knows about it. so what do i do here? i feel like i'm confused. i know i trust him on some level because when things happen at home between my parents like another argument or saying they are going to leave each other. i always want to turn to my guy friend before anyone else. i don't know what to do about all this. i hate the fact of thinking i might be giving him false hope of meeting when i talk about it. he does say he really likes me now. even tells my friends that.

20090220102314AAZ1t6m	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	PROBLEMS with my hubby? Need answer fast?	Is it about the money or the truck? Ok, this is the deal..I'm remarried. When I got a divorce from my 1st hubby, the settlement included my car which was PAID for. Well, last Aug. I was in a wreck that was someone elses fault. The insurance paid out on MY car and so I decided to put the money in a seperate account at my bank because I think that the money from the car should either go for a new car or to my children seeing as to the fact that it was from my previous marriage. Well, my new hubby has this idea that I should buy him a truck with the money. Well, he literally blew up at me when I told him that the money was in a seperate account with my name along with my sons name on it. He wanted to know why and I told him that it was my money and he told me that it is "our" money. Now, I'm not stupid but I'm not going to give him money for a truck when I don't have a ride. Well, before I had the wreck, he had purchased a new van for us. (in his name) We are in the process of selling the old one (which is in his name also). During this whole marriage (2 yrs) it has been rough due to his kids making my life a living **ll. Well, last year his son took a knife to school and tried to blame me for it saying that i put it in his bag. Well, what do you know, my new hubby turns his back on me and takes his sons side. I'm not over that and he thinks i'm stashing money so that if I want to leave, i can. I did tell him that i was scared he was going to make me leave sooner or later so he thinks i should give him the money, acting in good faith that i trust him, so he can buy the truck and in a couple of months he will put the money back but in an account with both our names? sound fishy?? HELP!!
20090220102443AABtpTw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Im confused? my husband left me for someone else,he continues to call and want to see me behind her back y?	well to make a long story short...my husband left me and filed for a divorce after he hears from his own family annnnd his current girlfriend that i cheated on him wich was not true whatsoever, his family really had in it for me or should i say this family lives for the gossip and drama ..well we have been seperated for a year now we have a daughter together he's since started dating another woman a friend of his family of course and at the beginning of they're relationship he would call me to rub it in my face wich really hurt being that i still loved this man and couldn"t see how he could just walk out like that... on a rumor anyway. he started calling to see his daughter but every time  i allowed him to come see her he ended up visiting with me and still uses that same excuse till this day  the drama has gotten so bad with his family that he doesnt even tell them he calls me to see his daughter he acts as if he dont talk to us at all around them or his girlfriend when in fact he still calls to see me he's still in his relationship of course and im in no way shape or form a homewrecker but if i remember right he was "my husband" before all this started they did the homewrecking  and i only allowed it for the obvious reasons since then iv'e tried numerous things to stop it  im confused as to why he does it and i want to stop although i am not strong enouph to let him go yet i know"i have to" cause it is not healthy for my daughter to go through  this i've put a restraining order on him i've sent him to jail over this and i've also told him i met someone else wich of course didnt work for long i've even called and told his girlfriend what he's doing and she told me to stop trying to ruin what they got ...What? ...lol of course i love him and i want him to come home but never would i lie to anyone to cause this i just want to understand why he still wants to see me? but he's the one that left me? and he's still in the other relationship my thoughts to this point are maybe he has realized that what his family said was a lie that he still loves me but he knows he messed up and now its too late who knows? i just wanna understand this to be strong enough to walk away it no matter what i tell him or what i do i've even moved 300 miles away and still he calls to see when can he see me? if i call the cops hell stay away for a while and then before you know it he's calling again to see his daughter..lol i heard from a friend of the family that his family was on his case bout leaving me and getting together with the new chic and he would rather be miserable and stay with her than to come back home because his family would turn they're back on him but to be honest if he loved us enouph that shouldnt matter right?   i dont know what to believe either...  i do believe in "his actions' although i do ask him does he do this cause he still loves me? before he use to say hell no and now he just doesn't answer ??? and when i ask him if he's ever gonna come home he says no cause i cheated on him...lol so why does he do this and still comes to see me behind her back? this is never gonna stop and it's emotionally draining me??????? by the way he's a pisces im'a scorpio if that helps yes i would love for him to come back home and work out our marriage but not like this i deserve better and so does our daughter can somebody please explain to me why he's doing this does he still love me and just doesnt wanna say it because he feels he messed up our marriage or what? is it the pride? i dont know???? sorry guys i tried to make it short....

20090220102921AAyQRsH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend's best friend died?	My girlfriends best friend died recently and she recently has been very irritable (understandable). I recently asked her if it was something I did  and she said no. She said that being with me is a distraction and she can't focus on our relationship (which makes her feel bad) and try to deal with this situation at the same time. So she said we should stop seeing each other for a while. The whole break up is sort of under the pretense that we'll get back together eventually but I'm wondering if I'm just rationalizing everything because I don't want to lose her. Is she being honest about this whole thing?

20090220095636AAXPArA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls/Woman? How many girls would you guess the average man of around 30/yo has "slept" with?	I am curious to find out how many woman/girls would be considered "allot" for someone of the age of around 30 to have been "sexual" with, according to you (mostly curious about woman but men as well).   Let's assume he was good looking man that has no problem talking to or getting girls so there is no impediment to the man having sex other than his own restraint. Also assume he started around 12/14. So that would be close to 20 years worth of partners.      #1) If he was never married, how many would be allot to you?   #2)ALSO, how many would you guess the average man fitting this criteria has been with?    #3)Would it matter to you if it was higher than you expected? What would your reaction be if you heard this higher number from a boyfriend?      Seriously, think about it. Don't just arbitrarily come up with a number and say, that's way too many. Sex is not "icky" or anything and there s 365 days in a year times almost 20 years. What would make sense to you?      I'd REALLY appreciate you answering the 3 main questions at least, pleeease. :)      (this is to help solve an argument, so please help and take seriously....and be kind :)  )
20090203091221AA40kQc	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is 9 years old too old for a flower girl?	Is 9 years old too old for a flower girl?   I will have one flower girl that is 5, my ring bearer is 3, and I wanted to include my 9 year old cousin as my flower girl as well. She is also a little bit tall so she is not a petite 9 year old.    Do you think calling her a "flower girl" is weird because she is already 9, or that it wouldn't matter? The 5-yr old flower girl will be in white, so I was thinking that this flower girl could wear a light shade of the bridesmaid's dresses, just to show that she is not quite a little girl anymore, but still young.   Any ideas?
20090203074027AAcExtd	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it OK to have 2 junior bridesmaids together?	Just to give a little bit of background: I come from a large family and I have many cousins on both sides (mother's and father's).  I am choosing which of my cousins to include in my bridal party which is turning out to be a daunting task! I feel terrible for leaving people out.     Two of my girl cousins (let's call them R and G) are ~11 years old, so they are too old to be flower girls and too young to be bridesmaids. They love me dearly and look up to me, and I feel close to them since I don't have many girl cousins, and I would hate to leave them out. I was considering including them as junior bridesmaids, but the only problem is that I don't have any boys to pair them with. (I am obsessed with the numbers being even; I am not changing my mind on that.)  The other problem is that R's sister is a flower girl, and G's sister is a bridesmaid. I feel like they would feel rejected that I chose their sisters and not them.   THEREFORE... I was wondering if it would be okay to have them both as junior bridesmaids, but have them walk down the aisle together. (This will be a Catholic wedding.) I already have 6 bridesmaids, however, and including 2 extra seems like a lot to me. As well, there are a lot of other cousins I am excluding, so to include these 2 might be a little bit offensive to some of my aunts/uncles whose children didn't get included.   If I asked these 2 girls to be my "helpers" on the day of the wedding, instead of giving them an actual position as junior bridesmaid-- do you think that would be offensive to them? Or do you think at that age (~11 yrs. old) they would be thrilled to be my helpers?  THIS IS SO STRESSFUL. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

Sure we still have the occasional box of macaroni still but for the most part we are eating fresh, homemade meals and choosing better snacks for ourselves. We trying to be careful about portion control.       I am very proud at the choice I made for our family and I can't wait until Jacob is eating the foods I cook fresh and with love for our family. I hope to show him he can eat whatever, just in moderation...and I hope that he'll love a wide variety of foods.       Have you done something for your family lately that makes you proud and happy?

20090220074918AAwxeqV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Has anyone ever been in this type of situation before?	So i've been goin out with this guy for seven months and he's been struggling with his mental illness (he has schizophrenia) Because of his illness that includes him having paranoia and insecurities, it has kept us from having a strong, healthy relationship. We've been trying to have a good relationship, but all we keep having is A lot of ups and downs, and it's not healtly for both of us. The relationship has been both physically and mentally abusive. My question is that I know that the realtionship isnt really going anywhere, and it's just emotionally stressful for me. I know I should get out of it, but there is this barrier that keeps me from doing so. What should I do? Am I afraid of being alone?
20090203085949AApVCf5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I cant get over him???? help!?	My ex fiance left me on christmas eve saying that he needed time to think (we had an argument a couple of days before an I had said some nasty things, mentioning my ex) He didnt contact me for the whole of the festive period, so I thought it was over. Then after new year, he said that he wanted me back. To split up with me again 2 weeks later.    I found out that he had had sex with two girls over christmas, although I had ended up in bed with his friend on new years eve ( I was drunk, upset and he was there ) although we didnt have full sex. My ex was saying that he wanted me back, that he couldnt live without me, got me some roses sent to where I work, etc. Then when he asked his mate about what happened with me and him and his friend denied it, my ex thought I had lied about it to hurt him, and split up with me again.       Now I see him out and he is getting off with loads of girls, kissing and trying it on with other people, and I dont think its coz he knows that I am there either.       I just cant get over him. I am constantly thinking about him, talking about him, analizing everything that has happened. I just cant seem to move on, and surely if he cared as much as he said he did he would be the same?       I mean, I know I'm not angel but I dont think I deseved to be treated how he has done me. What do you think?       I am 20. I just think that I will never find anyone as good as him, he is a successful builder with his own house and a lot of money, and I have a crappy part time job and live with my parents. Everyone has took his side too. What do you think, help me please?

Ah man this will really suck, because i'm friends with all his friends and his family adores me etc lol    he was my best friend. and he used to to get a girl, he allowed me to falll in love with him so that he could get her - my friend. Then when he was walking me home i was mildly physically abused and he just stood by and watched, and used his "guilt" as an excuse to end it.    I feel like i'm a pile of stinking ****. I'm tired of being walked over and used like this, i wanna DO something!    So, should i tell him i'm not his friend any more because i have SOME self respect and if he were a true friend he wouldn't do this to me?    i hate this, because i love him, but i don't want to hurt any more, and i'm not wanted by him.

20090220081316AAmt9Wh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it normal for a man to be this close to his ex?	For the past 5 months I have been dating a great guy who lives about 20 minutes away from me. In a coincidence, a couple months ago his ex gf who he dated for 3 years (she broke up with him) moved into his neighborhood on the same street. They had not talked since they broke up a year ago, but now they are like best friends. He talks about her often, they meet up for lunch or dinner, go to movies, etc. as "friends" he says. I don't think he's cheating, because he answers my calls when he's with her and tells me they hang out, but when I told him I was uncomfortable with their friendship and didn't think they should hang out, he got mad and told me I'm being jealous and insecure and i have no right to tell him who he can and can't be friends with and there's nothing going on with them.       I will admit I'm threatened by her. Not only is she just a few houses down, but she's beautiful and successful (drives a new convertible and has a BMW and owns a home) single and also very sweet...I've met her a couple times. Is their relationship is inappropriate? I don't think they should hang out like that given their history and the fact that I know he loved her deeply (He talked about her before she moved in)

20090203082152AAQ9p0h	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will my so called wife's new relationship last?	Yes I have asked this question before. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT! I enjoy reading all of your answers.      My wife left 1-9-09. She has moved in with a guy. Yes as a couple. She is 27 and I found out he is 37. She moved out of here and straight there. I also just found out that him and his wife separated in November. It my have something to do with my wife. Don't know that for sure. They both work at the same place. Friday night I called her. Yea to see if she would come home. She told me how happy she is and how much better f**k he is. Also I let her take the kids Thursday. She told our kids that her bf can't wait to meet them and she was getting a puppy. I will not let her take them around him. I told her to give the kids time to adjust and she said she has. BS 3 weeks!! She also told me she is going to take the kids. I have filed for custody. I don't think I can do that again. We have two kids together that are with me. We have been married 8 years.I thought everything was fine. We had a few spats. But we were doing better than ever with jobs,credit and getting along. She has done this before. Will that relationship last? Do you think she will get payback for doing this to me and my kids? No this is not any of my business. I just want my chance to turn her away like I should have done years ago. The only reason I ask is because I really tried the last two years. It looks like she came out so much better after doing this to us. They have only been living together a few weeks so I will have to see.      I will add that she has done this so many time that the kids don't even miss her. Nothing has changed and one of them said they wanted to live with me because I was a better parent. Now that came from a 9 year old!      I don't want to see it last not because I don't want her to be happy. I just want to her to see that you don't walk out on your family for someone else! Also I CANT LET HER COME BACK. Not this time.

Recently she stopped responding to everyone's texts and I think she's in one her of moods of just wanting to get rid of everybody and trying to re-invent herself.

20090203085538AALXUAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help making sense of this relationship?	A few months ago I was dating someone I met online. We had both recently divorced and agreed that neither of us were interested in a serious relationship. We remained non-exclusive and casual (I knew that he had a dating profile on a couple different websites).     A couple months after we started dating he started dating someone else. He told me that they were also not serious, and that they were very different and he "didn't really like her" but that she was fun for the time being.     Several weeks later, he told me that he loved me. We started saying "I love you" frequently. A few days later he told me that his relationship with the other woman had ended. Although we had never discussed it, I believed that since he had ended it with her and since we were saying the L-word our relationship was moving beyond casual into something more serious.    Less than a month after this I received an email from him saying that he had decided to pursue a relationship with the other woman and that he was "sorry" but that it was over between us. I was shocked! I had no idea they were still talking, and he and I had had a wonderful date just two days before. I emailed him and asked what was happening. I asked him how he could date her when he said he loved me. He responded that he had  not said "I love you" to this woman and that she was not pregnant (I asked), but that he though, as he put it, it was time to piss or get off the pot. He said that he though we were just casual, keeping each other company until we met someone else and that he never meant to lead me on or confuse me.    I admit that we had never talked about dating seriously, but I was falling for him and I thought (assumed) that saying "I love you" meant we were getting serious.     Now I am heartbroken and needing to make sense of what happened here. What do you think?

We use to be friends and over xmas I told him that I was interested in dating him. He said that he didnt feel the same way about me.      Since then (about a month ago) I havent seen him or even emailed him. It's for the best that I dont contact him....to get over my feelings and move-on.      However, we may run into each other 2-3x/week. Right now, I am avoiding that.       I want to tell him, that I'm NOT mad at him, to get rid of future awkwardness... Would this look like I am being submissive to him...      Cause before I asked him out....I chased him, which made me look submissive....and this is a turn-off for guys.

I'm so crushed, my best friend/lover of 5 years dumped me, said I'm not up to their standards no more. You don't understand i was so hurt when she said that, plus shes got a new job and met new people, that's why she's acting like that she feels shes better than me.      I've been hurt but not like this before, we always have our ups and downs but we always solve it. I told her she hurt me pretty bad cause she said a lot of awful mean things to me, and she just laughed, and I'm a nice person I've done everything for this person and I'm always there for her and i felt like she took advantage of that, but I'm trying to move on.

20090220113354AAMnYz9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce is not an option....?	My husband and I have a rocky relationship. We just can't seem to agree on anything. One day, it's good and the next we're arguing nonstop. We have a four month old and I just don't want her to grow up in this type of environment.      We've attempted counseling but he refuses to go anymore because he thinks he knows more than the counselor. I've tried talking to him but sometimes it doesn't work. So I try not to argue with him but he's becoming increasingly annoying to me as time goes on because I feel like I'm ignoring the problem and not dealing with it effectively. He just gets on my last nerve half of the time and I don't know why.       Divorce simply isn't an option so I'm stuck dealing with this situation. Anybody know how to cope or have you been in a similar situation?

Saturday morning I got up early, quietly dressed, made my lunch, grabbed the dog, and slipped quietly into the garage.

The wind was blowing 50 mph, so I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad all day.      I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. I cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a different anticipation, and whispered, "The weather out there is terrible."...      what shall i do?

20090203081956AAZDEtO	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I assume we are invited to their wedding?	My fiance is a groomsman in his best friend's wedding. I've never attended a wedding alone before and am a little nervous about it, should I assume I am invited too? Their wedding invitations were very basic, just an announement basically, not a you + guest or anything. I didn't open it so i don't even know if it was addressed to both my fiance and myself and he doesn't remember. Also, I have a 3 year old boy. I know its rude to bring kids to weddings when they specifically ask not to, but what if they don't say? I'm nervous about attending because I don't really know any of their other friends so I am afraid I'll be alone the whole time while my fiance is grouped with the wedding party...hence why I'd like to bring my son. Any suggestions to ease my worries?

20090220105251AAe71Vy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has your spouse ever brought up divorce just in an argument? (just as threat?)?	Sometimes a spouse will threaten to divorce their partner when all they're really doing is making a threat. They may wish to get their way or intimidate their spouse. It's a cowardly form of behavior but one to be aware of. Does "I want a divorce" mean "I want to get my way"?      I think its important to never use the D word in your marriage no matter what (unless you are serious about it). I think overuse of it kills emotions and love dont you?

20090203072404AAM6UP2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Drastic change in my beloved really hurts.?	There is a girl I really love. We have been through thick and thin together and we share irreplaceable memories together. We decide to save sex for marriage. But then one day she got raped and she changed. Maybe it is because she gave up on her virginity being lost and starts to engage in other sexual activities for the esctasy to fill the emptiness in her heart due to the trauma she faced. She claimed to me that she have discovered her new self after the initiation and enjoys the esctasies of having sex with lots of people. I only found this out when a friend of mine brought me to see her in a hotel after I couldn't contact her for a week, seeing her having sex with a lot of guys and semen covering her entire body, she was whinning and craves for more. My friend told me that she was raped and totally lost herself. I was so shocked that I am totally heartbroken. I know I should stand by her but I just couldn't accept it, I just can't find the old her in her now. I just feel awkward and sad with her. How can I handle the change in the girl i love and fill the emptiness of seeing her becoming like that? It is really hurts beyond words to describe.

20090203074954AAUEwpK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How realistic would it be for a 38 year old man to go to college when he has a job, wife and 5 kids?	My husband is a salesman.  He's good at what he does and makes about 80,000 a year.  He is worried about job security and has always wanted to be either a mechanical or electrical engineer.  When he was 18 he attended NC State but had 0 help from his parents.  After a year of struggling to pay for school, rent, food and work a job he dropped out.      I want him to pursue his dream but I am concerned that the stress on the family will be too great.  How will he work 55 hours a week, go to school and still have time for me and the children?  How long will it take to obtain an engineering degree when you can only go to school part time?      It would be great to get some feed back.  It would also be wonderful to hear from some people who have been through this in one form or another.  Thanks!!!

20090220053139AAcKY09	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys How Do You Treat Your X's?	I need to know what is the typical manner in which a man treats his x. I can't understand mine. When we broke up he said we will always be in each others lives no matter what. He says he doesn't love me anymore, but says he cares about me still. He still has all the little notes and cards and gifts I have given him. Still has all the pics of us. In his cell phone I'm still under the nickname that he called me when we were together. Could this mean that he still has feelings for me?

20090220083403AAMjBtZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I being a cry baby and/or selfish?	Me and my husband have been married for a week now. We have a small budget and could only afford to be married through the Justice Of The Peace. Since we've been married we haven't had a private day together. A friend came to visit and spend the night for a few days, and another friend who half way lives with us (he has an apartment but no phone, tv or internet) hasn't spent every night but been here every day. We couldn't afford to go out to eat and of coarse no honeymoon, but I was hoping we could have one private day together. I'm currently pregnant and our baby is due in 2 weeks, which means that will subtract private time. Does it make sense I feel said we haven't had a day alone to celebrate being married?

20090220095535AAgbyze	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For guys - How would you prefer a girl handle this issue?	You're friends with a girl.   She is bubbly, good looking, great personality etc.   She recently became single   You have secretly liked her, and now that she is single you want to go out with her.       Since you haven't approached her about how you feel, your friend took it upon himself to tell her how much you really like her, and said not to mention that he said anything about it.   She told him she isn't interested bc you are not her type.       She senses jealousy and competitiveness from you when she mentions that she is hanging out w/her ex, and that is making the friendship very uncomfortable.  How should she let you know she's not interested in a relationship if you haven't even brought it out in the open, but you are sort of acting out those feelings?

20090220051836AAcHAsW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just end things?	Usually when a guy is not treating me right, I just break up with him. But this time is different. I actually slept (gave up my virginity) to this guy. Now I don't want to end things because I've already ruined myself and it's only been three months since I started. My friend, who started having sex last year, has already slept with 7 guys. I want to keep my number at 1 for as long as possible. Plus, he started acting different ever since we had sex.       What should I do? I tried breaking up with him but then he said he didn't want us to end things so I stayed but it's getting to be exhausting being with him. It's like he doesn't know what he wants and he's super defensive. But he can be so sweet (just haven't been like that lately).

He's told me that past girlfriends he's dated have not been into romance like that and they never were romantic w/him so he doesn't see a point in all of that. He says romance to him is a woman showing up naked to the bedroom for his birthday. He does (unknowingly) do some romantic things. Like he washes the dishes without me asking but I'm a huge romantic. V-day is coming up next week and I want to do something small yet romantic for him without freaking him out. We've only been dating for a couple months so I don't want to be too extravagant. My friend suggested lingerie but that seems a little too soon. Any ideas?

20090220064859AAA7nnf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I probably gonna be a virgin forever?	Even if I am not that bad looking. Now I know this may sound kind of conceited, but when I look in the mirror I see a fairly decent looking guy. I am kinda short, like 5'7 and have a fairly athletic frame and weigh about 135 pounds. The reason i am asking this is because Now that I am 16, I feel like I am way behind in dating and stuff like that. A lot of my friends I remember started dating in like 5th or 6th grade and by now have all lost their virginity. I am in no rush to lose my virginity, its just I kind of feel like a loser when my friends start talking about girl friends and I have never even had one. I have never been asked out by a girl (except like 2 times these girls tried to give me their numbers, but I didn't really like them because they were annoying and just made up some random digits lol) but I think that is partly because until this year I was not fashion concious. I wore glasses, never cut or combed my hair ( so it looked like a rats nest) and wore kinda geeky cloths. Basically I was pretty ugly looking and shy. Now I wear contacts and take better care of my hair and stuff and I think that I look a lot better, even though I am still shy. Anyway, for some reason I feel like I am just gonna be one of those people who is a virgin their whole lives and is depressed all the time. Girl wise I don't think I have that high of standards. I even like some women who are older lol. As long as they aren't grandmas, increadibly fat, or really ugly I wouldn't turn down a girl because of her looks. so does it sound like I will be a virgin forever If I am shy, short, and kinda decent looking? thank you.

20090220111413AAZlSwJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Problems with my hubby!! NEED ANSWER FAST!!?	Is it about the money or the truck? Ok, this is the deal..I'm remarried. When I got a divorce from my 1st hubby, the settlement included my car which was PAID for. Well, last Aug. I was in a wreck that was someone elses fault. The insurance paid out on MY car (my name on title and insurance) and so I decided to put the money in a seperate account at my bank because I think that the money from the car should either go for a new car or to my children seeing as to the fact that it was from my previous marriage. Well, my new hubby has this idea that I should buy him a truck with the money. Well, he literally blew up at me when I told him that the money was in a seperate account with my name along with my sons name on it. He wanted to know why and I told him that it was my money and he told me that it is "our" money. Now, I'm not stupid but I'm not going to give him money for a truck when I don't have a ride. Well, before I had the wreck, he had purchased a new van for us. (in his name) We are in the process of selling the old one (which is in his name also). During this whole marriage (2 yrs) it has been rough due to his kids making my life a living **ll. Well, last year his son took a knife to school and tried to blame me for it saying that i put it in his bag. Well, what do you know, my new hubby turns his back on me and takes his sons side. I'm not over t hat and he thinks i'm stashing money so that if I want to leave, i can. I have told him that I wasn't leaving butI did tell him that i was scared he was going to make me leave sooner or later so he thinks i should give him the money, acting in good faith that i trust him, so he can buy the truck and in a couple of months he will put the money back but in an account with both our names? sound fishy?? HELP!       BTW.. we have an account together that pays bills only. I have an account that MY child support (he doesnt make his ex pay child support) is deposited in and "we" also use it to do whatever with and its actually with a bank out of town and I don't have a problem putting him on that account but i'm not putting him on the one that I share with my son. He turned his back on me 5 months ago and I'm scared that he might make me leave and I don't think I shouldn't have money to fall back on. I have told him that he should sell his van and buy the truck. He still says that it is an issue of the account not being "ours". We live in a house that is "his", the new van is "his". He even has life insurance that he pays that includes his ex. I beg him to take her off and put me on for 2yrs..no progress. plus, his mom is the beneficiary. so...what do you think now?         anyhew, we both have 2 kids from other marriage. Both my kids call him DAD. His Kids hate me. they hate my kids and have been very verbal about it. They don't want us living in their home. SO, why shouldn't I have money put up...im not that stupid..

20090203073615AALFgNO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband want to divorce me?	This happened 3 years ago, when I was only 19. I was really young and stupid. I have never gone to party or clubs or anything like that when I was 19. After I finished high school and started getting my own apartment...Well I had a boyfriend, but he was a jerk, didn't pay rent or anything...so at that time I was depressed and I went over to my friend from school (it was a male) and well we had a one night stand. Brandon who is the guy that I had a one night stand with, well he was really kind and understanding. But he didn't want to have a relationship with me, though he did advise me to dump my loser boyfriend and beware of online boyfriend because it was dangerous.       Anyways, I dumped my loser boyfriend and I met this online guy through a friend (who is my husband right now). We started doing this online dating, though I didn't consider it was a date or relationship since we didn’t not me. But My husband did and about a few days after later I slept with Brandon again...I know I shouldn't have done that...I was stupid I was only 19 years old at that time!      No, I don't have any HIV or any diseases. I’m in good health; just a bit underweight.      After a month later my online boyfriend and I decided to meet up in real life and we did. And we started get along so well. It was so different talking to him in person in real life. Fast forward, now I'm 22 years old and married to him for one year and a couple of months.      He never really trust me because he always asked me about that night when he was trying to call me and I didn't picked up the phone because I was...yeah you know....I know I'm a slut in his eyes. I was the first girl he ever slept with and I have only been sleeping with 3 guys including my husband in my entire life.      Well every time he asked me about that I tried to change the subject or tell him a different story. Last night when he asked me that again...I told him the truth because the guilt was pilling up, and he got upset with me. My husband was saying that I cheated on him when we were “dating.”      I deserve it...now my husband want to divorce me...and I'm only 22 while he is 23. I'm currently a college student and about to finish with school. My apartment lease is going to end on this month, February.      Anyways, after I told him, he got upset and hurt. Then he started to call me slut, whore and etc. I didn't argue back, because I know that I hurt him. He told me that if I told him early, he would have break up with me, finish his degree, and etc. He told me that I messed up his life. Once I heard that from him, I break down and cry. I know that I'm a useless, selfish slut woman in his eyes and I don't know what to do. But the worst thing was when he said that I destroyed his future and his life. That makes me so freaking low.      I apologize to him, but he didn't want to see my face nor talk to me. So I stayed up all night writing him a letter about how sorry and until this day I regret sleeping with any guys beside him. If I can go back in times, I would have never done anything that will hurt him.      So in the letter, I told him that I will find myself an apartment with a female roommate. Because I can't afford to pay rent that is over 500 bucks since I'm a full time student and a part time sale associate. Also, there is no point living together, if he want to divorce me. I don’t want to see us being roommates, that would just hurt so much.      I just talked to Gina and she got a room for me to rent at her house for only 390. It’s a good deal and I’m planning to move in sometimes this month. My husband doesn't want to see me nor talk to me. I left the letter on his pc table this morning before he left to work and to my surprise he took it with him.      I know that what I did was consider wrong in the past. But that was 3 years ago. I mature...and gosh I was freaking 19 years old at that time. All I wanted was to have fun and experience...now I regret it all.      My husband won't forgive me and he said that I cheated on him twice. He mentioned that since I cheated on my ex and now him, it makes me cheated on him twice. I know it is on the same guy, but gosh! L I'm not a bad person at all...if I met my husband in real life I would have never slept with Brandon!      Since I met my husband in real life, I have been faithful to him since now.       To be honest, I don't want to divorcée my husband...22 years old and already a divorcee.      I'm so depress and I cried all last night. This morning I beginning to pack all of my belongings and put them in boxes. My husband doesn’t want to see my face nor does he want to talk to me. It’s understandable; if I were him I would do the same thing. I feel like I’m the biggest slut in the world. I feel 100 times horrible. I know that my husband won't forgive me...I just hope he will...but I know it will be a miracle if that happens.      Is it hard for a husband to forgive his wife?      No I don’t have any kids.

20090220051826AA0D7kR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend of 1 year and he has no trust in me.?	I have been with my boyfriend 1 year and he does not trust me for unknown reasons. what do I do?   I am 46 and he is 39. I love him very much, and he loves me. He treats me like a queen. It is just that he accuses me of looking at other men, when I dont. He is so insecure, why?   23 hours ago    Additional Details   Well he is 39, with a pace maker, and has diabetes, I would be there till the end with him, but he always accuses me, he is the one that cheated on his ex wife. We had two times where the police were called for DV, and he has ended up in jail twice, one of those times were physical, the other he lie and told them that I beat him up. They went to arrest me and I admitted that he lied. We go to court on the 24th of this month, and he has been in jail since the 12th, his bond is 100.00, plus I have a TPO against him, what should I do?

OK so weve known eachother for 3-4 years. My uncle is only 1 year older than me, incase your thinking I'm sick lol. Anyways, I really like this guy. And like a year or two ago we both admitted we had crushes on eachother. But thing is, we live like about an hour away and only see eachother like once a year? But I've always had a crush on him. We talk on myspace all the time.  My uncle moved last Dec. to New York, so he's gone. So the other day on myspace I told him that I basically broke up with my bf and wanted to know whats going on with his love life. Surprisingly he said there was no lady? So then I replied that "Now you have my attention". I am interested, I really am, but I don't want him to think I'm throwing myself at him, also I meant I'm interested in why he doesnt have one because hes so cute and charming. But he replied, "what type of atttention jess? lol i havent been really interested.. but now my hormones are starting to kill me.. you know what i mean.."      Thing is I know how to answer these questions when they arent concerning me, other thing is can I have a translation of what he means? Whats going on in his brain lol. Also what do you suggest I write back thats cute and has him wanting more but not boring-AND NOT SLUTTY, I'm serious, if your gona write a rude answer just move on to another answer plz. Thanks. =)

20090220063650AAqYzde	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help as to what is going on?	We are friends/group mates. we work on things together, speak to each other in class sometimes. he always looks at me when we are speaking, even when others are.ive caught him staring when i walked into the class and sometimes in class but i could be dreaming.what's worse is, sometimes the both of us have prolonged eye contact. it is very daunting and very awkward for me as he is able to hold like 3-5 sec eye contact without looking away. and sometimes he does it smiling.       He's quite gentlemanly and seems to notice that i'm usually not paying attention in class. When he speaks to me, he seems to sound more gentle but he doesnt ask me personal stuff when we're alone but more sch qns.In a group where my good male friend is, he doesnt look at me much..      and when i did accidentally touch his hand today, he didnt move it away. and he swivelled his chair to look at me a few times though i wasnt speaking (was beside him). anyways as a result im shy, quiet and self-conscious and am afraid of smiling (i dont think i look nice).      what is going on and how do i get pass my awkward behavoiur? we're both in college. thanks!

20090220080315AAJg84q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to find out if he's cheating?..I need help ASAP!!?	Hey guys. This is gonna be a long one, but I really need your advice. I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't totally confused. Ill try to be brief thou.   (you can refer to my previous questions if you wish, since this is not new)      Last week Me & my (9 months together) boyfriend decided to move in together. After a lot of whining, two months ago I decided (new year resolution) to start focusing on the good stuff and saying thank you for all the sweet things he does, and I found out they outweighed the bad stuff, and also I decided not to listen to third parties anymore. And surprisingly things got better, and better and then he surprised me saying I love you let's make another step.       But the thing is, my best buddy Larry, (who, BTW is NOT into me since he's dating my best gfriend and they're moving fwd also). Larry told me he was a jerk from the beginning, even before we started dating. Actually he has a pretty bad reputation here (we are all co-workers). And LArry's always telling me to be careful with him coz he's a cheater.      There were times in which he used to NOT answer the phone, and be mysterious, but we TALKED and he said HE WASN'T CAPABLE TO CHEAT ON ME. so we went past it. I trusted him better than rumors.      But then, yesterday when i told Larry that we were moving fwd, he told me HE'S BEEN CHEATING ON YOU!. Btw my boyfriend is larry's boss. Larry said: Everyday he came in and told me about his "girls", told me I slept with X and Y and blablabla. I couldn't stand his cinisism, but also I never had more proof than his words so I didn't tell you all of it. Tried to help you open your eyes thou!!.      WHAT TO DO?   Im over the top confused.       Sorry it was long, but I feel completely broken.
20090220080406AAn1P6n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need a girl's advice on this one please?	Well it was my friend's brithday today and i gave her a card which i though would be a nice gesture, and i was the only boy in the class who gave her one. Well its obvious that i like her, thats why i'm asking this question. Anyways. i gave her it infront of her friends and she said awww which i guess meant she may have appreciated it and after i left i over heard her telling her friends she didn't think i'd remember. She told me after a while thank you for the card. My question is i gave her a card which said happy birthbday and it had balloons and streamers printed on it, but i had another card in mind that i wanted to give her, which said stuff like its your special day and you deserve to be happy etc. Did i make a big mistake not giving her that one? I didn't give her that one because i didn't want to scare her off, but i felt that i missed a really big opportunity there, do you think i still have a chance to let her know i like her?  Oh yes i also wrote in the card "May all your wishes come through on your special day" What about the comment was that ok. I'd like to hear all your opinions and what should be my next step, because i really missed an opportunity there.
20090220115536AAyBrmF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i even continue to pursue her? can a girl please help me decide?	The girl that i like is my friend and i've liked her ever since i saw her the first day off college, she's in my class and we are friends, not best friends, but i talk to her alot or atleast i try to anyways. Well i try getting to know her, like asking her questions about her life and so on. But i don't seem to be getting anywhere, it was her birthday and i gave her a birthday card i thought it would be nice to do that and in it i wrote "May all of you wishes come through on your special day", i was the only guy in class who gave her one, she seemed to appreciate it and told me thanks with a smile. But the thing is i don't know if i should continue to go after her, i like her alot but sometimes i feel that she's not interested in me at all. The only thing that gives me hope sometimes is when i notice her noticing me sometimes. So what do you think, should i continue to pursue her? And what do you think i need to do capture her attention or atleast let her know i like her?

20090220092432AAeK1gN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did my girlfriend say this (10 points for best answer)?	Alright me and my girlfriend are young I'm 16 and shes 19 but we are really close, closer then most couples are at that age. Meaning I get a long with her family and all that good stuff and its getting serious. So we love each other and we tell each other all the time, she constantly talks about our future together.      Last night went great we had a really good cute conversation, and ever since then everything has weird since the morning. First off we made plans last night for her to come over, she was going to come over and we were probably going to have sex and she would never pass on that chance usually. But anyway this is what happened.      This morning I don't get text from her first thing like I usually do. She usually texts me before school before 8am. And didn't hear anything from her, so I ended up texting her around 10:30, didn't end up hearing from her until after 11 where it was almost like she was talking to me differently.      Instead of being cute like she usually is and say I miss you so much, she just said miss ya. Then we were just talking about whatever over text and shes like oh I'm going to a party tonight with my girls what are you doing. And I had plans with her but I didn't want look like an idiot and say I thought we were doing something. So I said I don't know I guess I will go to the bar almost like I tried to throw it her face considering she can't go to one.      And then she started saying stuff like that if you go out don't act stupid. When you do... you get me mad and I want to break up with you. Then I'm telling her yea I'm not going to mess around don't worry and shes like good boy or else. And I told her I don't want to lose you so I wouldn't put you through that. Told her I loved her and she has not responded to me in like the last 40 minutes.      Well actually as I just finished typing this she did send me a message saying I love you. But there is still kind of an issue here in my opinion.
20090220092747AAJV9a2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I say to my boyfriend?	Last night my boyfriend asked me to hang out, but later on I found out that he invited his friends to come along without even asking me... It was disappointing to say the least. He has this one female friend who was all over him and would one-up me every time she got a chance. He ignored me and played along with this girl's inappropriate behavior the entire night. I basically had a really horrible time. I went home feeling like a second-best piece of crap. And I think my boyfriend thought I was probably being "boring" and "quiet", when I was just pissed off about his female friend's behavior the whole night. I want to text him and start a conversation, I just need a little reassurance from him that we are OK. But I don't want to initiate a fight... So what should I text him saying?
20090220094241AAYmUA5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel like such an idiot.......Help Please?	Ugh! I like a guy in one of my classes and I *think* he might like me, here are the signs I have picked up on:   -I have a gut feeling   -He looks at me alot   -It seems like when I'm sad he acts really goofy in class   -The one time we talked he was listening to me with steady eye contact   -I was standing in one part of the room and instead of him going by his friends, he stood near me looking at a poster   -When he catches me looking at him his mood changes if he seemed upset before   -He tries to draw attention to himself   -Stares at my feet sometimes(he sits across from me)   -Usually he will position himself facing me if we are assigned separate groups   -He seems shy when we are in teh same group   -Once in awhile after I look at him, his friend that sits next to him will whisper something to him, I looked at his friend after that and he was looking at me.      Keep in mind I *think* these are happening.....it may just be me wishing. He is a really nice guy so I doubt he would be messing with me.      Yesterday we had to go down to get a book from the library and he walked back to our class with another girl(he does have alot of friends that are girls). I got back to the room and he wasn't there and I checked out my book after he did.....I became very jealous and I can't stop thinking about it. Maybe he likes her? I actually cried when I got home(I do have my period right now so my emotions are kind of wacked out). I just don't know what to think anymore. If there is a chance he likes me, I don't want to get over him, but if there isn't a chance then I do. Is there any way I can tell once and for all without asking him? Thanks, sorry its so long

My best friend started dating this other guy probably like the month after me, and he just asked her to be his gf. How come my guy still hasn't asked me. I'm happy for my friend but at the same time i'm upset cuz i felt like my guy should have already asked me out before them. What is your take on this. Oh & we're dating exclusively, and are always hanging out together and we've met each other's families already.

They told me that if I told anyone about what happened they would kill me, so I didn't tell the cops everything that happened.  I agreed to what the other victims said he did. I am now suffering from PTSD and depression and anxiety attacks, along with many other problems due to this event.  Is it possible for me to tell the cops everything that happened? Would it help me any?
20090220102447AAUONIU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he feel the same way?	I'm in love with my best friend. We are always around each other despite not having any classes together. We hang out before school, I take him home after school, and we usually hang out on weekends. We sing together in the car, go to shows, I think you understand that we do everything together. We have talked about the future and how we'll always keep in touch. I have been in love before but it was never quite like this. All I want is him; I can't look at any other guy the same way I see him. We're always looking at each other in the eyes and touching each others hands.Or leaning on one another while laughing lol. At the movies we held hands for 10 seconds but he let go. We've been best friends since school started. He keeps to himself, but when we met we hit it off instantly! I just hope he feels the same way, and will ask me out. Why hasn't he asked me out? Thanks for taking the time to read. I could've added alot more detail.

I am a woman in her 40s, single and without children. It happened as I did not meet a guy that I honestly thought it would last with. I live a responsible life, have a job which keeps me and allows me to travel now and then. I have many friends and don't take drugs or alcohol. In other words, really I live a moral life. Do you think that I am seen as cold as I didn't just settle down and become a wife and Mother? By the way, I am not gay, I like guys, but just know that many marriages break and don't want that for myself. Luckily, I get asked out as I take care of my appearance.

I'm married with 1 kid, but having issues with my current husband, so was looking for some diversion. In the meantime, I became close to this 48yr old guy. We both work at the same company.

He is obviously a very matured and soft spoken person.Guys out there, please help me how to approach him. We are planning to meet for a dinner again next week. Would it be okay if I tell me how exactly I feel about him, or should I give it more time for us to meet and get to know each other.

20090220111250AAuRGHi	Family & Relationships;Friends	Best Friend and a Girl, did I cross the line?	Ok, so here is my whole story in a nut shell. My best friend Jeff has been great friends with a girl named Sara for a long time. A year ago, Sara was in a relationship. Sara was dating this guy for a year until six months ago, they broke up. Jeff was one of the reasons why because a love triangle developed (Sara and Jeff ended up becoming best buds and started to develop feelings for each other). Basically, Jeff and Sara are more than friends, but not "officially" dating.      Jeff and Sara would hang out alot, go to movies, go to each others' houses, and pretty much do boyfriend/girlfriend things (not counting sex). Eventually, Jeff ended up secretly dating another girl named Ashley. I knew it because I was his best guy friend. His other circle of friends knew of it as well, but Sara had no idea. Because Jeff and Sara are technically not dating, he doesn't really see anything wrong with what he is doing, even though I told him it was when he asked me about it. ANOTHER love triangle begins.      Now fast forward to two months ago. I was in the college parking lot waiting for my class to start. Low and behold, Sara ends up parking next to me by accident (she didn't know which car I drove). I had no intention of being friends with her, but she talked to me first. It just happened. We ended up hitting it off and became friends quickly. I had no idea whether she was just being overly nice or if she had some interest in me. The end result was that Sara and I eventually became friends.       Jeff did not like this at all and spoke to me about it. He is angry at me because I am friends with Sara. He is afraid that Sara and I will eventually date. I basically told him that he should decide between Sara and Ashley. Sara and I were only interested in friendship and I told him I will not feel guilty for a friendship when you are dating some other girl (sure, I am a guy, so I've thought about Sara and I eventually dating, and it's a possibility, but I never was maliciously trying to take Sara away from him). I told him that Sara started talking to me first. I also told him that we were only friends, to which Jeff replied "You are only friends now, but y'all might date eventually." Afterward, he stopped talking to me and cut off our friendship.      I wanted to repair our friendship (because I know he won't try), but what holds me back is my friendship with Sara. Unless I am not friends with Sara anymore, there is no way I can try to talk to Jeff again without appearing to rub it in his face.      [I wasn't supposed to be in this situation. I am not a manipulator and I am not a snake.]      - Did I cross the line between Jeff and I's friendship?   - Was I wrong for becoming friends with Sara when I knew of the past love triangle and the current love triangle?   - Was Jeff right to get angry at me and cut off our friendship?   - From the outside looking in, do I have deserve any sympathy in this situation? Does Jeff?   - Wasn't Sara technically "fair game" anyway?
20090220111622AAf40f5	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What is your biggest comeback ever?	I used the family guy comeback for this tramp that thinks shes the sh1t.      Ingrid, I think I have a theory about why you're such a *****. You see, Ingrid, you're popular because you developed early and started giving hand-jobs when you were 12, but now, you can't stand to look at yourself in the mirror because all you see is a whore. So you pick on May to avoid the inevitable realization that once your body is used up by age 19, you're gonna be a worn-out, chalky skin, burlap sack that even your step-dad won't want. How's that? Am I in the ball park?      That comeback burned her soooo bad, everybody was Hypin (saying oooo's and stuff), and she cried. I ruined her prom night mwuahahah.

20090220111743AAwM2R7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I right in thinking that she should make the next move now to save our friendship?	Had a fight with my friend at xmas. Tried to work things out with her and her last response was "Im not mad, I was never mad, I feel nothing towards you good or bad". Which struck me kinda odd because she sure seemed pissed off up until she said that. I told her I wasn't going to kiss her butt to be my friend and that was that. That was a month ago.      I have totally ignored her since then, won't even look at her. In the past few weeks friends tell me she keeps looking over at me at the bar we both go to.       Don't know why I did it but I wished her a happy VD on Saturday at the bar, maybe it was the beer, I don't know. She really seemed happy to talk to me. A big smile on her face, very cheerful. I wasn't looking to get into a conversation with her just wish her a happy VD and walk away. But she turned it into a conversation asking me what I did etc. I kept the conversation short about 3 minutes the told her I had to go. It ended with her giving me this awkward, half hug, shoulder bump thing.      Now I'm at a loss, I don't know what to think. Do I go back to ignoring her and wait for her to make the next move? It seems she misses me and she wants to talk but I don't feel it should be up to me to fix this at this point. I already tried that months ago and basically told to F off.      The more I think about it I shouldn't have even wished her happy VD.       Any advice? Or ideas of what she's thinkin?

20090220113016AAChOaG	Family & Relationships;Family	What do i do now????	I'm really protective over my family (thats only my sister and nephew), and i hate it and get angry when people hurt them. My nephew Ryan is 14 but 15 in 2 weeks, but anyway, his dad who is also my brother died last year, he took it pretty hard so i look out for him now more than i used to when his dad was around and try and act like a role model and some one he can look up to, sorta like a father figure but recently, before half term, this kid in Ryan's form was arguing with him about something so Ryan called him an idiot so this guy said to him "Well at least my dad aint dead" pushed him over, stamped on his stomach and kicked him. When i found out i was really angry and i got called in after school to discuss this with Ryan, his form tutor, the kid and his dad. While discussing it and what would happen the kid said more stuff to Ryan about his dad being dead so i just lost it with him, i was shouting at him and grabbed his collar, so his dad pulled me off and said well it serves Ryan right, i grabbed him and pinned him against the wall and raised my fist. Ryan was shouting for me to stop and his form tutor eventually got me to calm down and took me out the room. When Ryan's mum found out she was scared and now she is scared of me and so is Ryan and she won't let me near either of them. i haven't had the chance to apologise yet because i cant get near Ryan.      What do i do now?

20090220113150AAh74Xv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please can some mature adults answer this?	Okay so I've been dating this girl for a couple of months and things seem to be going really well. Earlier this week her friend warned me not to "smother or bug her" but it came up in a way that leads me to believe the girl ive been dating complained about it. Her friend said go at her pace let her text me first, etc. My fear is that she will lose interest in me if I change my behavior and not communicate with her. I understand I could cool it a little bit, but I dont want to change everything thats been working for me so fast because as far as I knew she liked it when I would text her. If all of a sudden I'm more distant and stop texting her aren't I risking her losing interest? I just dont get it because she would always say she likes my texts and they make her day bettter and make her smile whenever she gets them (said that like a week ago multiple times) and now it seems like its annoying and I havent changed my behavior at all since we started dating.

20090203083123AA712hr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it me or is he crazy?	In a relationship for over 3 years.   Over the past couple of years, our relationship has deteriorated.   He is very jealous, insecure, and controlling.  When going through the bills last month I noticed that Verizon had sent a "thank you" for your new service... I didn't order a new service... Upon further inspection.. this service is a downloadable device that will enable you to check incoming, outgoing, and voicemail from your computer....I got online to see if the service had been activated... It had.    He has also made 3 unsuccessful attempts to access my cell phone's voicemail.  He often leaves messages like"to hell with you... I am done"   "Get on your high horse ***** and keep riding".... then call me later and invite me out... act all sorry,  hug me  and then act like nothing has happened.   I think he's crazy.   I have done absolutely nothing to invoke this behavior from him.   I am confused, hurt,  and just plain pissed off.  So,  please let me know what you think.  When he calls... should I answer... He never takes responsibility for his behavior.   He's always the victim.

20090203084223AA1BcHm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, Gals, serious advice needed here....10 pts for best ans?	Ok...this story is like super long, and it goes back to a year ago....there's this guy that i like, we're friends, and he knows that i like him since a year ago.      We met 4 yrs ago, he was a 2nd yearr university student, and i was a freshman. same hostel, same faculty, my direct senior....was a nice guy, and we were just friends, although i had feelings for him, until last year.      What happened then was that we went clubbing together (first and only time)....and he got touchy and stuff....ended up cuddling and all.... later on, i realised that he actually knew that i have feelings for him....and asked him about how he feels....his reply then was that we should wait for me to finish my studies first, then talk about it (i was in my final semester for university)      after i graduated, i asked him about it again, and told him that if he didn't like me he should just tell me straight, and not come up with excuses so he'll not feel bad about rejecting me....his reply then was that he still has somebody he could not forget, and it's kinda hard for him to move one....what does this mean? is he interested in me and just really having commitment issues or what?      in the past year, we seldom contact, like only occasionally on msn(in the year though, i ended up in a firm he used to work, so my colleagues there all knows him). also heard from my colleague that he mentioned about me before when he was still working there, and i have yet to enter the firm.      recently, we were talking on msn again, and he suggested we meet up again...      what should i read out of that...i mean i still have feelings for him...is he interested in me?....

Well, I hooked up with this guy on a business trip. No one knows that we were together. I recently walked in on a conversation that he has a girlfriend and that she is filipino. I didn't know that he had a girlfriend. I also found out that she lives like an hour away from the city. I am really pissed about this, because he lied that he had a girlfriend. Not to mention, he talks really bad about filipino and Asian women. Why would someone lie like this?
20090203084842AAqSw63	Family & Relationships;Family	What am I supposed to do?	My father has been an alcoholic since he was 18 years old. He's been in and out of jail for over 20 years - and has also been through the 12 step program many times. Everytime, he will do great for about 6 months and then he relapses.      Everytime he relapses is worse than the time before.      Recently, he fell off the wagon once again - only this time, I'm the only one who will "attempt" to help him. The rest of our family (including his wife) won't even speak to him.       My husband is afraid that this may cause problems with us, just because... well... we tend to look at this situation differently. Basically, he doesn't want me to get involved either.      I received a (sober) phone call this morning from my dad and he asked me to come over tonight after work because he needed to talk. He kept saying things like, "Please call me and check on me throughtout the day" and "Call and make sure I'm alive"... etc. The last time he really screwed up like this he attempted suicide, and I'm so incredibly scared that he's going to try again.      How do you help an alcoholic that's been "helped" multiple times? Someone who's graduated the 12 step program mulitiple times?      Please someone.... help me.
20090203084951AA1Jyf3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This is a marriage and relationship question and if you are can not be civil or helpful in your reply, ....?	My question is that I come from a country where you can have a love match or an arranged marriage. You get a choice. The problem is I had an arranged marriage that ended so badly because of so many lies and other things I can't discuss. So I really want to fall in love this time. I have been divorced  5 years and I am in my mid-30s and my parents are putting on the pressure for an arranged marriage. Meeting a good man is so hard in American but in spite of my loneliness, I refuse to just fall into any relationship like I see women in my position do. I would like a christian view on this or a considerate input from anyone. Truth be told, I am this close to caving in to an arranged marriage. But for this one issue, I have a good life and good job.. Help!

20090203085546AAusFGv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make our "Break" more comfortable?	My girlfriend and I recently decided that we needed to take a break. We had been together for 14 months, which the first 10 months had been really good, but the last 4 were a little rocky.       She made out with a guy about 4 months ago and that's when the problems started. I know she didn't do anymore than make out because she's a very honest person and she could've not told me of her making out with someone else. The guy she made out with lives 2,000 miles away, so they never see each other. She has been in contact with this other guy. They have been texting and e-mailing each other off and on since they made out. She said that she's going to try and not have any contact with him anymore, but it's hard to trust her. She admits that she likes him a little bit, even though he lives so far away.       It's been about 10 days since we went through with this and it's been really hard. We still live together and were stuck together in a lease for the next 6 months, so please don't suggest that one of us move out because it won't be happening anytime soon. My girlfriend and I consider each other best friends and it's really hard to just throw it all away. She really wants it to work between us and so do I. When we see each other at the house, we just look at each other awkwardly and make small talk, which is very uncomfortable since we both have strong feelings for one another.       What can I do to make this process go smoother? I realize that some of you will say "move on", but it's not that easy, so I would love some reactions that do not involve "move on". I know that eventually if things don't change that I will have to "move on", but I'm not going to "move on" just yet.      Thanks in advance for your response

20090410163722AAavOMJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Child custody help please, wife is cheating?	I have asked this before but after more advise please;   I have 2 boys under 5 years old, my wife of 12 years has been having an affair for over 2 years, i have had enough. I thought we could stay together not to get back together but to document all of her actions. In the last 2 years she has been away with him for a total of 4 months.   I am the primary carer for my boys with atleast 80% care, im the one who gets up during the night, they come to me when they hurt themselves, i feed, clothe, play and bath them.   I always drop off and pick them up from school/day care and am with the boys for atleast 3 hours before she gets home, so i engourage her to do things with them, occassionally she bathes them but this usually ends up in the boys getting upset.   I have tried to discuss this with her but she always builds a brick wall and I cant get through to her she says "whatever" and walks off.   She has said that she wants the boys 50%, I know she is the mother but to me thats unacceptable, eg. she would go out for 'drinks' when our kids are sick and not check on them when she returns home, with me to look after them.   In an ideal world i would love her to just leave, or have them on every other weekend, but she acts as though she has done nothing wrong and she still wants 50%.   1st question, why should i give them up as i have never missed a day in there life and she is the one putting another man between her and her kids.   she left her phone open and there was a message from her to him saying "hello darling, i wish you could be here with us" meaning the boys, now question number 2, why should i have to share them and let another man care for my kids, i am clearly the primary carer, but i live in australia and am unaware of the laws here.   she does get stressed when looking after them , and i always make there dinner, creative dinosaur dinners, happy faces etc.she often swears and talks sarcasticly to them by degrading them. i cant stand it, she is a pshcopath, i have been told that.
20090220005256AAb5jAX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How am I going to explain that I am too shy to wear these?	I am a 24 yr-old girl that is just about to get married in a month’s time. I have a reasonably attractive and have a good figure, but I am very shy and don’t wear anything that will attract attention to myself, but do dress nicely in a modern way.      The problem is recently while putting away some ironing of my husband to be that I discovered 3 string bikinis and 2 sexy swimsuits that he has obviously bought for me for our honeymoon.   He doesn’t know that I found these and have tried them on twice, but each time when I have tried these bikinis and swimsuits on all I feel is naked and vulnerable and this is at home in private, so I don’t think I will be able or want to wear them in public.      How am I going to explain this to my husband to be, when he gives me these bikinis and swimsuits probably on honeymoon?
20090220014530AAPrL6v	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Just found out that my boyfriend was married all along.?	As the title says, I was seeing what I THOUGHT was a single guy for a year now. We got along SO well, and clicked like nothing else I have ever known, more than with my ex husband even (I am divorced over 10 years now, I got married way too young)      I found out when his wife gave me a call! This was last month.       I am devastated. I have joined some "infidelity" support forums online but they all slammed me as they could not see past the fact I was the "other woman" - even though I DIDN'T KNOW I was the blasted other woman!      My "ex" has (obviously) changed all his numbers now and cut off all contact...I have researched this kind of thing online and this is apparently normal behaviour after an affair, his wife may have made him do it.      I just can't believe the deception and the fact that not only do I have to deal with a break up which is awful enough, but that I have to deal with the fact he had a wife all along!      Please, no unhelpful comments such as "But you must have suspected" or "did you not see the signs?"      I have been to his house twice, but he came to mine for the rest of the time, simple.  The awful truth is he must have his her stuff....I don't know :(      I may feel angry at him for going back to his cosy life but even despite my hatred for him and the fact he hasn't lost anything, I still miss him - WHY???      I know he won't be missing me as he'll be so happy his wife took him back, and that's hard to handle, seeing as he was always so affectionate and almost quite needy with me.      Please no cliches such as "take up a hobby" - I just really miss him and need help in getting over him.      Thanks all,   Jem
20090220043816AA6K1eQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which guy would you pick!? or just figure it out in the end...ah! ?	Alright, so here's the deal. I've got two guys that I like a lot but each are very different situations.       Boy 1: He's really hot, the kind of guy that every girl notices (possibly because of our hot emo styled boy definency, but he's not so popular...just hot =] ). He's got a hardcore style, listens to music non stop (we like the same music), can't seem to sit still, happy, fun, really sweet, very social to the people he's friends with but very quiet otherwise, and is in a screamo band. We text a lot but both can't seem to remember how to talk or wave in person. But don't put that down as him blowing me off or making him off as a player. He's the fartherest thing from a player, and he isn't just blowing me off...we BOTH just can't find words but we cutely stare and stuff. Believe me, actions speak louder than words. I'm sure he's interested in me. I think all we've got to do is verbalize and this can go somewhere lol, we're both just really shy with this sort of thing. It's actually really cute.         Boy 2: He's equally as hot, just not as noticed usually. He's got a skater style and lifestyle, happy go lucky, fun, hilarious, way more outgoing than boy 1, and we relate/connect very well. We talk on AIM a lot, we're good friends, we wave and always say hi to each other in the halls, we are capable of verablization. I'm positive he likes me too, more positive than the other. The bad thing though is that my friend also has a crush on him too...and not so sure of what to do about that...      I think I'm just going to let it play out and then figure it out...right? lol. But, i don't know!, what would you do!? I honestly can't decide who i like more, and to makes matters worse...they're friends and run the same circle...

20090220050741AA5nTgY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend is confused? Anyone have any help for me?	So me and this girl have been dating for almost 2 years now. This relationship started in high school, she was a junior and i was a senior...Anyways our relationship went going perfect, we never got into a fight until she started talking to this other guy about 5 months ago. They would talk non stop over the internet and it upset me so much. One of the main reason i was upset because she had recently been upset with one of my friends in Europe that has been my friend since i was 3. So i didn't understand why i couldn't get upset? But anyways it hurt her really bad that i was getting so upset so i finally got over it. I also thought a relationship wiht jealousy isn't really a good one either. Finally got over it about 2 months ago. A couple of weeks later i feel that something else is bothering her, and she finally says that she doesn't want to have sex anymore(she doesn't think its not that necessary)...i can kind of understand that because she was kind of young when we first started. I asked her why she didn't just say she was not ready and she said she was afraid that i would leave her...when i would never do such a thing, So I agree to just let that go and wait for her to finally be ready for it.   Now recently i found her weird again so i again asked her what was bothering here and she says: "she gets annoyed of me". I asked her if it was because the way i acted or if its something i do and she just says that she really doesn't know. I asked her a simple question if she still loves me and she says yes. Now last night she says she doesn't love me and that she would want a break. She says that this annoying feeling had come towards the end of january and it only happened sometimes. I am not a strong believer in breaks and getting back together....i don't even know if it would be good for me to go back after all that she has been telling me all the sudden. I really think a break would help her...we pretty much already started and she said shes already missing me, which is a good thing right? she hopes that this break will help her see if she truly loves me....is that true? or is she just too nice to break up with me?   I am really confused as well, i don't know what to do or what to think anymore...Can anyone relate to this or have an opinion of what she might be thinking or what i should do?      Thanks

I sent him some chocolate via the internal mail service on the valentine's day but I didn't have the guts to leave my name. So I just wrote "SA" on the envelope (I didn't want to leave it blank as I didn't want the delivery guy to ask who sent it). My friend said she would find it creepy to get chocolate from an incognito. What would you think if you were that manager? I don't have the guts to tell him I like him and I don't want him to think I'm harassing him. Just thought it might make him happy.      I often wonder if he dared to eat my chocolate.
20090220054016AAAG1eo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls ever lie???????????????????????????…	Do girls ever lie about whether they like you or not? I mean I think there's a girl who likes me. Every time I'm around she acts really self conscious; she can't even look me in the eye without turning away/looking down; I noticed she smiled at me once (without knowing). She even started a rumour about me fancying her (which is true) because I asked somebody else to the prom (I knew this girl isn't going so I didn't ask her) and told her friends not to tell me what was going on.      Anyway I asked whether she likes me the other day (through email) and she said no and said she doesn't really know me but complimented me for having the guts to ask. We're both going to the same uni next year and I ask her would she give me a 'chance' then (right now I'm too busy). She said 'we'll c how it goes'.      Btw she thinks I'm a total jerk which is quite true (because of something I did not to her though). I asked her the other day what she thinks of me (and told her to be honest) she said she thinks I'm in general quite rude and insensitive. She also said that she doesn't really want to get to know me better. Do you think she's serious or trying to see how I would react?       Anyway I asked her the other day telling her I'm not whom I appear to be on the outside. She says she likes people to be who they are and if I can't then she don't know...

20090220054606AAfbnT8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I fell because of a girl...?	this has something to do with my previous question:        http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       I was always that guy who never fails. i'd always achieve my goals one way or another.      last year, i went abroad to study, and in my last few months, so close to my exams, my gf dumped me( she was in uk and i was in australia btw). she said she wanted to enjoy her life in uni over there. later on, some pictures of her were posted on facebook which i wished i had not seen.      anyways, i was left feeling lifeless, i couldnt focus i felt lonely away from my family( i was 18) and it resulted in me not being able to get into the university i wanted. i had just missed by 3%.      i came home, my parents were so upset with me because i was their hope and they had wanted to apply for a scholarship for me.      the point here is that, i had help her through her college life and when she got into uni she just forgot about me and that lead to my failure.      so i would forever live my life with the truth that i fell because of a girl.      im now at some uni i don't really want to be at but i guess life goes on.      how do u actually handle this situation?

20090220055537AA9b2UN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	On a break with boyfriend,  should I call?	About 3 weeks ago, a guy I was dating said he needed a break because he needed to think about whether he wants to be in a long-distance relationship (we live 90 min apart).  It's been about three weeks now, and I'm figuring his "break" was really a "break-up."  I keep having this urge to call him to tell him that I'm moving on and get some closure, I guess.  I also kind of want to tell him off and tell him that I feel he was really selfish by driving all the shots.      Should I bother calling him?  Or just let it go?

I apologized & suggested we patch up, which he vehemently refused to agree. Before the misunderstanding,he'd shown signs of laxity in commitment to the relationship. Could it be that he was planning for the breakup?

20090220060259AA84Gwc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm no longer sure if im happy in my relationship.?	I have been going out for a guy for nearly 3 years, When we first started going out everything was great and i was really happy.      I then went away to university to study and remained happy, as i was quite home sick, and on-top of that my dad passed away, which often leaves my mum alone and depressed at times.      Through everything that has happened, i feel like i've really had a kick about life, and have grown lots. I really want to be successfully with my career which might mean lots of trial and errors.      My boyfriend i feel hasn't changed, and often goes on about moving in together, even kids. And i don't really feel i want that in my life, or even if i want kids, and im starting to feel we want different things.      Also im starting to see him less, we only really see each other weekends and holidays and the time apart doesn't really effect me. Yet he seems like a puppy dog when he see's me.      End of story, I fell in love to early, and life has given me some **** hands to deal with recently. Yes this guy is nice, we don't argue, but i'm starting to feel i found it all to early.      I don't want to hurt him, i know it will destroy him, and i also feel since we have Alot of the same mates, and we've been together for a long time. People EXPECT us to be together, and also with the invention of face book its not helpful keeping it private.      If anyone can advise me on what to do, or even if they've been through the same. i feel a little muddled up in life, and what i should be doing       =]      xxx
20090220060310AAJDe60	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I get a womans point of view?	She is a family friend and I've known her for years. I was good friends with her brothers but lately I've re-connected with them, and gotten closer to her. When I saw her 2 years ago I sent her mail which she replied, and asked me to write back, which I didn't I was busy at the time.      Then 3 months ago I went to visit her again we went out a few times and she had a good time, picked flowers and gave them to me. She tells in the past she'd cry because she was so lonely and had no one and last in her family to get married. We went to her place so I can fix her computers and she put on soothing music and dimmed the lights but I didn't make my moves. I think I respect her brother too much. I live pretty far away for work. I decided to send her roses and mail to tell her why I didn't write back before cos I was busy, and that I want to keep seeing her but now she tell me she has a boyfriend who has been divorced and has kids so she can't tell her parents yet. She then tells me if there is anything she can do for me to ask, and ends mail in see you next time. Since she says she has a bf, and I have met him I'd like to forget about her but I've known her so long and I love her - why didn't she mention this when we went out? (to see my reaction?), I can't focus on work because I always think of her,

20090220062735AAO3TDq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does his ex keep contacting him? What do you think?	My boyfriend and I have been together for over five months. He was in a four year relationship with a girl who was...for lack of a better word...stupid. She cheated on him before, and then broke up with him in April 08 to date this other guy. She got knocked up by the new guy like three weeks later.      So now she has a baby and is in a relationship with this new guy. Lately she's been calling and texting my boyfriend over trivial little things ("are your brother and his ex back together", "I saw your car outside of work", etc).       I just don't understand why she feels the need to come back into his life. She screwed him over, and now has a baby with another guy. And she suddenly wants to play nice?       What do you think? And yes, my boyfriend answers the phone when she calls. I don't know how long they talk. He says it isn't long - he also says he never recognizes her number because she got a new phone and he didn't bother to memorize it. My only problem with this is that the number is different from most in our area, so it wouldn't be hard to tell who it was.      Thakns!

He said "NO, N-O means no" well after that my friend stopped talking to the guy and the guy didn't really talk to her that much anymore. But then yesterday the weirdest thing happened, my friend was talking to me and then Joey came up behind her and hugged her in a really loving embrace, I was SHOCKED. My friend didn't know who it was so she didn't do anything.  But then he whispered in her ear "Do u know who this is?" and she jumped and her face turned completely red.  She gave him that 'WTF' look and he looked at me confused at her reaction.  So can u tell me what is going on here? Thanx XD

So before I get started I don't realllly mean sex when I say IT...just sexual stuff, if ya catch my driftttt...So I'm 15 and my boyfriend of one month is 17. We like eachother A LOT, but the fact that my boyfriend is leaving for college at the end of the summer really affects our relationship. He keeps telling me that no matter how long we last and how much we like eachother he has a NO SEX rule because he wouldn't want to do that and then just leave me for college...which I understand COMPLETELY and love that he cares about me that much.......but he's alwayss, always reminding me of this stuff and he also tells me that if I find anyone else that would have more potential (someone I could pursue longer than just until the end of the summer) to dump him. Does he really, truly care this much? or does he just not like me as much as i like him??? any thoughts?   thanks

20090220075957AAh71To	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my BF providing a valid reason for his actions?	Hi,   My BF was recently in Italy for a serious negotiation.   He says that he was under tremendous stress and hence strayed. He hired a hooker for the night. She even gave him a BJ and drank his ejaculate. He won the contract and went to celebrate with the same hooker, this time a threesome.   Now he says he is sorry. He will learn stress management. I like him but I am getting confused. Should I forgive him? Italian girls are very beautiful, and I cannot match this degree of actions.   Will he stray again?

20090220071724AAVhLZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls would you forgive me?	About a year ago when i was 15 me and a couple friends well basically played girls. We knew what to say and how to act to get the girls numbers. At times I would be talking to like 4 or 5 girls each of them thinking i really liked them. When all i was really doing was messing with them to get in bed. And believe it or not it worked most of the time. I know what an ***. I was stupid and wanted sex and didnt care about how i might be effecting the girls. It was a big mistake in my life and i regret it everyday. But then in August i met this girl who i absolutely fell in love with. That's when everything changed. I started to look at girls not as a target but as people id want to get to know. Since I fell in love with that girl I have apologized in person to every girl that i played and may have hurt. There were a lot of girls and i just finished. But just about all of them said they forgave me. But my question is do you really think they forgave me or were they just saying that? And would you forgive me? I really am sorry for what i did and i just want them to know ive changed and stuff so please answer this.      Sorry this was so long
20090220072921AAFsN4y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Deciding between two women, how many dates?	I meet two really great women within a few days of each other, and I went out on one date with each of them.  They are both really nice, and we had great times.       Since I'm not used to having two people interested in me at the same time, I feel almost a little guilty about going out with both of them, even though it's only been one date and of course nothing is set in stone.  I feel like i need a little more time to decide which one is the best match for me.  I don't want to lead anyone one, but at this point I just want to get to know both of them better.

How is that possible? She's dating a guy now and she had only known home for 1 month before she started dating him. Was she fugly in high school and nobody wanted to date her? She's hot now, so that's why it's strange. And if it takes so much to impress her then why did she date this guy after only a month of being in the US? She lived somewhere in the middle east before.

I'm dating a very Southern guy - which I love in many ways - but we're starting to get serious and talking about our life if we were married. He expects me to clean the house and do all the laundry, take care of the kids, etc. AND also have a job. He said that he's only responsible for all the landscaping and outdoors. I think we should split all the responsibilities 50/50 and he claims that I feel that way because I'm a "Yankee." Are there any Southerners out there who agree that it's not the woman's "duty" to do all the indoor cleaning and laundry if she also has a full-time job?

20090220080832AAQs4ij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have guy troubles! My best friend is going out with a ****!?	Ok I have a really really good guy friend and i kinda want to make it a little more than just friends. He knows because its pretty obvious but the only thing standing in the way is his girlfriend. Honestly I don't know what he sees in her but its not my job to tell him what to do. But anyways, his girlfriend is extremely mad at me for wanting to be more than friends with him. I know that she is jealous because I hang out with him so much as friends. But now whenever his girlfriend is around, he wont talk to me he wont even have eye contact with me. He stopped answering my texts when she is at his house. On aim, he completely ignores me when she is on aim. I've talked to him about it and he has gotten a little better about it. But life would just be soooo much better without her! Not to mention she is horrible to all of her friends and she is completely obsessed with him. In the middle of class she'll start groaning because he left to go to the bathroom for 2 min! It's so gross because of how obsessed she is with him. She told my other friends about how in the summer she was planning on doing "it" if you know what you mean with him. He has no idea what she is planning! And they are only 15! i just don't want him to get hurt so I want to tell him about what she is planning but I'm afraid he will hate me for getting into his love life! How can I get him to like me? or at least just dump her without getting him all mad at me? Any suggestions?

20090220071017AACg3yf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls that go to clubs have any interest in relationships?	I met this girl at a club on valentines day night. We ended up dancing for the longest time. i also made out with her. at the end of the night i got her number. At first i figured it all happened because it was valentines day and all. But i proceeded to call her anyway two days later (MONDAY). She answered the phone and we talked close to 20 minutes. I asked her if she would like to go out this saturday for a couple of drinks and get to know each other. she said yes, she would like to. I also told her that i would call her Friday (tomorrow) to make definite plans. Do you think that she would still be interested in going out? What are the percentages (your guess) of girls who are club goers actually might be looking for relationships? How much interest could she actually have in me?
20090220071259AAfgqWk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im in love with a man and have been for 5 years problem is he is dragging his feet?	I met this man 5 years ago. I feel in love with and am still in love with him. We have dated on and off the whole time. He acted at first like i was just a friend so I met another guy and got married knowing the whole time i was in love with someone else. The marriage didn't work out and i went running back to the one i love.We made any many wonder memories together then I caught him with another woman, I forgave him and started seeing him again. But he acted like he ony wanted me when it was convient for him so I started dating someone else again and moved in with this man. But the man I love is still in my life, he told me the other day that he loved me but he could not let himself be in love. Then he dropped the bomb on me that I could have been with him from the start. I know that my back and forth situation with men and my running back to this one man sounds bad on my part but it sucks loving someone that you cant be with the way you to be with them. I am confused and am out of ideas on how to handle this situation. and in case your wondering I do love the man I am living with. HELP.......................................

20090220062828AAzGv8p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Girl's Ex-Boyfriend, and my roommate...?	So I'm in college rooming with one of my friends from high school. One of our other friends from high school is here to. This is where it gets fun:      She and my roommate used to date, but I liked her too, even before that. But they broke up after a few months, almost a year ago now.       He still has two pictures of the two of them, one time while they were on a bus and one time at our senior homecoming.       So I have two questions:       1) Is it normal for him to still have two semi-romantic pictures of the two of them a year after they dated? Most of the guys on my hall say no, that it's actually weird and maybe even creepy.       2) Is it okay for me to like/date her? I know there's the whole "no dating your friend's ex-girlfriend" but most of the guys on my hall again say that my roommate had his chance and it didn't work out. The problem is, I think he already doesn't like me since he knows I like her. So do I have anything to lose?

20090220063202AApDxtL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you stay friends?	I've got a situation that I'm having trouble getting over. I have these two friends from school that are dating. I was interested in the girl for a month or two but she wasn't a great match for me and I could take it or leave it. What I didn't know was that my other friend was dating her and they kept their relationship from me. I found out about it from her after getting drunk at a bar one night. Obvious she knew that I had some interest in her and they both told me that they kept this from me so as to not upset me. To be fair to them, I was going through some really difficult stuff at the time. They were both extremely apologetic to me after I found out.      I had asked the girl to be honest about her feelings with me and she said nothing. I can't get over this. It's been over six months and this entire situation is still bothering me. It's weird whenever I'm around them and I don't know whether or not I should/want to stay friends with them. Even though they are generally good friends I can't get over being lied to. I feel betrayed and am not sure whether or not I can stay friends with them.

We are in a long distance relationship and we meet every 3month for three weeks.            She cheated on me with her ex boyfriend who she had live with in same house for 1 ? years and that he told her he’s sorry for how he treated her and that he wants her back. She told him that she had moved on (with me and that we are serious because we are going to marry) and that he should not expect to be seeing her again.            She has had 5 boyfriends in the past and tells me that he’s the one she had loved most among all of them.            We tried making a baby the last time we met and now am wondering if she is really a serious, because why would she sleep with another man when she think she might be pregnant with my child (that’s what her argument was until when I told her to tell me the exact truth and she finally confessed everything to me. She says they used protection but am now fearful that they may not have used condoms since the man would want also may be to make her pregnant- because he has done it to another girl before.)                  And if she finally tells me she is pregnant, can I really be sure that the kid is mine? (She has done 2 pregnancy tests since I left on Jan 19th but still says she has pregnancy symptoms.)            Please Note: we had sex 3 days before her periods and 1 day after her period and then I left for work.            She has apologised a million times and says she is very sorry for let me down and that she will never do it again.            She says he called her to his place and that she wanted to tell him about me and our plans and they ended up having sex.            Am devastated because, I’ve always loved her and all our parents know us and that we intended to marry next year.            Could the distance have been the problem? (Because she actually has a very high sex drive).            If she could cheat on me when she thinks she might be pregnant with my baby, how sure am I that she will never do it again?      she has told me shez deeply embarrsed and very sorry and say 'i wish you could come home now or I come and be wiz you now ,we could talk about this one big mistake that has brought us so much pain, we could laugh and smile again.watever the pregrancy results,it will be ok because the DNA test will strengthen our bond: if I am pregant, the baby is yours.            Please help me with your advise!

20090220070752AAnhiPo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I received anonymous flowers and my BF is upset; what should I do?	I received lovely roses for Valentines Day and seeing the card was not signed, assumed they were from my one-and-only long distance BF. I text msg him and thanked him. During our nightly phone conversation, he informed me in a chilly tone that the flowers were not from him. Flabbergasted, I reassured him that I knew of no other person who was interested in me to send flowers. The only person we could guess would be my forlorn ex-husband. I have no contact at all with my ex, much less any romantic interest in him. My BF and I have known each other since we were 8 and we just reconnected 6 months ago and have been dating exclusively. We are now in our 50s and we do not like drama or games in our relationship as the 1200 mile distance between us is stressful enough. After my BF expressed his displeasure with me receiving me the flowers, he in a joking tone laughed, "well you're not getting anything now, you already have flowers". I laughed with him and agreed how immature it was for a person to not sign his name but low and behold...I did not receive anything from him for Valentines Day, not even a card! He just blew it off stating that it really upset him about the anonymous flowers but he stated he was not mad at me and still trusted me. I am perplexed and disappointed and feel like he took his anger out on me. He hasnt mentioned it again but I am very hurt and it is still eating at me. I am very happy with him, he has been very sweet and generous and has bought me nice gifts in the past so I know he is not a cheapskate. Should I drop it or try to bring it up again?

20090220071150AA6GfLM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy not over his ex...? please answer....:)?	This boy who I liked over Christmas told me he liked me on monday night. I moved on after christmas because I was not sure he liked me..but now i really like him. but my problem does not stop there, it is quite complex. Up until monday, I liked a boy who is a mutual friend of me and the boy I liked over Christmas, lets call the gut who told me likes me S, and the boy I did like until monday M. I was planning to go into town and see a movie with M and another couple but S suddenly invited himself, and me being the unobservant girl I am, I had no idea he liked me and in fact I was quite annoyed that it couldn't be a sort of double date anymore. Anyway, I guess when he told me he liked me, I realised that I am absolutely not over him at all and he told me he wanted to have a relationship with me after having lots of meaningless girlfriends. I felt exactly the same, but i also knew that he is very good friends with one of his exes, and I found out 2 days after going to the cinema that he likes me and her also. I told him how hurt I am about this after what he told me. he also told me he didn't fancy her anymore when I was speaking to him before tuesday, therefore he lied. Then yesterday he texted me and told me that he hates himself for hurting me and that he will sort his feelings out. I sent a text back saying please do that and that what he is doing is disrespectful to me and my feelings. He did not text back, so you think he will when he has made a decision? The thing is, even if he does choose me over his ex girlfriend, I have enough self respect to realise that I do not want to be in a relationship where the ex is always on his mind, so if he does choose me I am planning to speak to him about making sure she is not always in the background. He has not been in contact for a day or 2 now, and I am starting to worry in case I have lost him. I am willing to work to make a relationship happy with him, but I will not be disrespected. What i need to know, is what should I do if he does get in contact again? or if he doesn't?  he has hurt me and I dont know what to do. And the worst thing is he eliminated any chance of me and M getting together now by coming on what was meant to be a double date. What do you think I should do in this situation....? I feel so lost right now.

20090220071647AAZmDrn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will he ever come back to me? Please help?	Me and this guy dated and got together on christmas after he broke up with his ex he shouted at me and told me he loved me so much and he told me he is going to take me and not hurt me anymore because we were friends before we got together and he never knew i had feelings for him .      Things went well in the beginning, as days went by we went through arguments, the smallest arguments ever which caused my ex bf to feel like he was mistreated.      Once on valentines day he didn't spend much time with me so i didn't have the courage to tell him so i told my friend tht is his friend to tell him that I was waiting for at least a phonecall from him. He said he has family too and then we both got into an argument in the end he broke up with me.      I've messed up what I had to say like I did from the beginning now I lost him forever. And I love him I can't forget him .      Everytime I talk to him he tells me Its done its over, hes not giving me a chance to talk to him 1 on 1 by himself, he always brings his mom into the relationship and gets it worse.      Nowadays when I try to be his friend he said he will think about the request I accidently blurted out tht I still have feelings for him and If we became friends that we can get a better understanding of eachother. He misunderstood and thought I was angling him into a relationship to mistreat him again.      The pain of him ignoring me, and the pain of me mistreating him and him giving me chances is giving me guilty feelings. Now that I understood what I did wrong and now I lost all my chances I don't know what to do. He loved me so much now I feel like hes ignoring me and every time I talk to him he's getting pissed off and annoyed.      My friend told him tht i wasnt talking properly to her and he said tht iv been avoiding her and that jus talk to her.       Do you think he will ever come back to me :"( Please dont be mean?

20090220072249AA47tYv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help how to tell someone I feel no chemistry after first date?	Hi,         An old friend of mine was so nice and set me up with her friend that is a really nice guy.  I wanted to see if there could be any chemistry between us because when I met him, he seemed very nice and a gentleman.  He took me on an awesome date, and was really into me-but I felt absolutely no chemistry at all.  How do I tell him that I don't want a second date and just want to be friends without hurting his feelings.  He went all out on our date-and I don't want my friend to be angry with me at all and want to see him again as a friend.  They all hang out together.  Its hard to make friends at 33 here for me, and I would like to continue to be in their circle.  Thanks.

Ok..So i have been with my boyfriend for a year+ and i have had sex with him once. I love him dearly and don't regret having sex with him. I do feel comfortable with him and would like to have sex with him. I however, was a virgin the first time we did it. I am still scared. I have a lot at hand. I'm trying to start a business and I'm a college student. But im scared that i might end up "knocked up" and have to give up all my hard work because of it. Not to mention that if my family were to find out they would disown me for having sex b4 marriage / taking birth control. I do love him but i have so much at hand and i do want to do it again but i just don't want to let down my family and myself and especially not him...      So my questions are...       what should I do?      Where could I get Birth Control without  my family knowing i take them?

20090220074933AAqCB6H	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Dumped and hurting, how to get through it!?	I am really struggling right now after being dumped a day before Valentine's Day by my fiancee of 15 months.  A couple of weeks ago, mainly on his request we were planning our wedding and trying for a baby.  As far as I know I could be pregnant now and I have a house full of wedding stuff.   Now he says that he doesn't want me anymore and is tempted by other women.  All my friends hated him as in the time we have been together he consitently lied to me, was violent towards me a few times (including spitting my lip open), stole from me, broke my belongings in temper and cheated on me twice in a month in October after I lost my Mum to cancer, using money that he had stolen from me.  I have stuck my him, offered to go to counselling with him when he said he wanted to chance and lent him ￡6000 to pay off debts that he had ignored for years after the worry was that they would send the bailiffs into his parents house.  he (by his own admission) has cheated on every girlfriend he has ever had and actively looks to cheat on the internet.      I know that this all sounds awful and ridiculous and the question is why I stayed with him and why I am so upset now?  I just don't know, I am an attractive, intelligent and independant woman who is normally quite confident and gets lots of offers.  I love this guy and I can see underneath all the horrible stuff that there is a genuine decent guy struggling to get out.  When we met a few of his exes messaged me warning me off him and telling me that he had 2 children under a year old by different girls (that he got pregnant at the same time) that he shows no interest in whatsoever apart from having to pay maintenance through the CSA.   He denied it but half way into our relationship I found out it was true and after talking it through I stuck by him.      At the moment I feel awful, I can't eat and struggle to sleep - when I do I have nightmares and when I wake up I feel so alone.I know I should have expected it but I just hoped that he would and could change for me.  Despite getting lots of offers I can't even think about dating other men and I feel like I will never trust anyone again.      Last night I found out from a girl that he works with that he has been messaging a girl in his office, despite him promising me faithfully that he was not looking for anyone else.  He has also admitted that he has messaged at least 10 girls on an internet dating website.  I have told him that it is obvious that he doesn't love me if he is doing that but he is adamant that he loves me and is in love with me.  I felt so hurt that he could move on so quickly when I feel so bad.  I tried talking to him about it but it ended in a row and I ended up emailing the girl he was messaging and telling her about his 2 children and a couple of other things.  Part of me did it as I wish that I don't want anyone to go through what I have gone through and part of me did it for revenge. Although the revenge made me feel better for a short while I feel awful that I resorted to that.  I just don't know what to do with myself, please help?  Any advice would be good. x
