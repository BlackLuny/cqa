Once you have them on the phone, you will be able to explain your situation. The biggest concern for employers is that you will expect them to pay for your relocation, or that it will take you a long time to relocate. <br>  <br>  Another option is to explain your situation in your cover letter but I say that leaving off locations is the best way around this situation.<br>  <br>  I work as a Senior HR Specialist and I also do resume/cover letter/interview coaching.

It can help ordinary web site owners understand how their site can get to the top in Google, not to mention that it helps remove the half truths and myths on how to do well in Google.<br>  <br>  Download Google's Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide (PDF format) . <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/se...</a>|`|3mAgM405aa	The most effective way to advertise on the Internet is<br>  to first set up a website and publish its domain name<br>  on major search directories such as Google.com,<br>  Yahoo.com [at <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?......" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/addurl/?......</a> and<br>  MSN.com since 85% of Internet shoppers rely on these<br>  search directories to provide them with goods and<br>  services. In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Best way: Have other reputable sites link to your site. Google (and others) put great weight on "recommenders," and the higher quality the recommending site, the more credence they'll give to yours.<br>  <br>  Just like if you wanted to find a good carpenter. The lowest on the food chain would be something like the Yellow Pages, where anyone can play and there's no way to judge quality. Higher up would be recommendations from friends who might have had some experience with having the work done. Even higher up would be builders and general contractors who work with carpenters all day, know a lot of them, and know which ones are good and which ones aren't.<br>  <br>  Same with web sites. Lowest level would just be creating a web site. You're listed in WhoIs, but really nowhere else. Up a bit would be links from personal friends--those are links, but your friends' recommendations might not count for much. But if you had incoming links from some big, reputable sites, that would count for a lot.<br>  <br>  The answer immediately above also has excellent recommendations: Good content and heavy use of relevant keywords. Those steps would also be in the top 5 of what you should do.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|W8Uf5LsAaa	"There are 2 ways you can get your site onto top positions in the search engines. <br>  One way is by paying the search engines and putting the sites as sponsored as we usually see some sites on the search engines' top positions. <br>  And the other is by doing seo.

And for this reason, many brokerages are now reluctant to let their clients short financial stocks just like before.  <br>  <br>  The government can change the rules on them at any time.  And none of them want to have any problems with the government.

a20a4fa04465742160b7e256b054466aaa	I was in the same situation a while back. I come from a poor family, they didnt have a dime for me to attend a university. I went to a community college, applied for financial aid, got a part time job. I made frequent trips to the financial aid office, and bugged them to tell me about scholarships other than the ones that were posted on the internet, or in their systems. I was approached by the financial aid lady and she told me she found a scholarship for me at a university. I transfered to the university after my associates degree, and finished my degee at the university. I only paid like $5000 for my education out of the $40,000-$45000 it would have cost me for 4 years. I paid the 5000 out of my part time job. I didnt have a car so I took the bus or asked my dad to drop me off or pick me up. I even took online classes when I had to work on certain days. When I graduated, I moved out of state because I didnt have lingering education debt on my mind. I come from a poor family. I ended up getting credit card debt when my parents were sick, but fortunately I am paying off every penny, and I will be debt free soon. I think go to a community college, those classes are easier so its easier to get a better GPA, with that you can find scholarships when the GPA is good to transfer to a university. What I'm trying to tell you is she doesnt have to take on debt to get a higher education. There is free money at colleges/university: She can work at the college, work study programs, tutor kids at school, work at the school library or simply get any job to pay for school. She can always go to her business school by transferring with a better GPA and applying for grants and scholarships.  When I graduated and landed a job with the firm they didnt care if I went to XYZ university they actually asked me about my experience working, yes working, any experience is good experience such as customer service, hosting meetings, trouble shooting anything. I was asked if I volunteered, what software did I know, I learned all those things by working. The things I learned at school were theories, ideology, history. I learned practicality by volunteering, workstudy, working, networking on my own. So no your daughter should go into debt by paying for college all by herself, she should search for help, so start at the financial aid office and ask about your options for paying for school. I actually had a friend who left to attend an awesome business school at Cargenie Mellon, he is in $120,000 just for a bachelors degree, he had a dorm the whole nine yards. Anyway, he landed a great job at a fortune 500 company, because of course Cargenie Mellon is an ivy league and they have better recruiters for jobs, so at some level going to a good school does help, but when he started working at this great company, they just laid him off because he was making too much because he got hired at a good salary because he went to a good school. He is still in major debt. I on the other hand went to a so-so schools, got a job at a medium sized yet good firm, didnt take on any major debt and I'm still employed because i didnt care to be making x amount of money. Anyway, if i was to be laid off today, its ok, I dont have any debt. I dont mind going back and working at my school library! Lol, it was quiet, and peaceful and no corporate politics.|`|l5cxmTb9aa	One should avoid debt as much as possible. Pay as you go so there's no huge debt burden once you graduate. If you have to take on debt, pay it off as quickly as possible. If a college student is living on a shoestring it shouldn't be too hard to pay it off. <br>  Also it should go without saying, don't go $200,000 in debt for a degree in something that's not going to pay off.<br>  My wife is a CPA and says there's a need for accountants so it sounds like a good field to go in to.|`|xoqQbHi1aa	She should try not to go into debt.   A state school's tuition should be under $15K per year (at least around here) and she should be able to earn that, or pretty close, by working between now and when school starts in the fall.  She should also start applying for every scholarship that she can find.  There are many small scholarships that are never awarded because no one applys.  I worked my way through college to pay for room, board, and books but I also applied for every scholarship that I could find.  I usually won enough of the small scholarships to cover my tuition (or pretty close to it).  One year I applied for about 300 and won over 200.  Most were small (anywhere from $50.00- $500.00) but they all add up.  She will get very god at cranking out essays for the scholarship applications and that skill will serve her well in college.|`|q2P7OMZCaa	From experience.<br>  <br>  What ever course you take whatever program or degree you take make sure that at the end of it the earning potential is high enough to make the payments on the loans.

I could just kick myself.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	In reality there's nothing you can do when you're upside down. You can't sell a car without a clear title and you can't get a clear title until the loan is paid.  Even if you could no one is going to pay $ 20K for a truck worth 12K. You cannot refinace the full amount because the lender would only lend the blue book value of the truck. You shouldn't just let someone take over the payments because the truck will still be in your name and you  would be responsible if they defaulted and if they had a wreck and it was there fault. Your only option is to try to talk the lender into extending the loan or the interest rate so you would have lower payments. If they end up repossessing the car, they will sell it at auction and come after you for the remaining debt. Just pray the lender will work with you on lower payments. My son was in the same position and called before he was even late to try to work out a  payment and  the lender and they wouldn't even though with his payment record it made sense. They followed the course I just described and they are now in the process of garnishing his wages..........garnishment may not apply in your case but they can file suit.|`|5P6m4Gs4aa	Best thing for you<br>  refinance if possible<br>  for lower payment<br>  Keep truck til it's <br>  dead<br>  This best financial <br>  arrangement for now<br>  Get GAP insurance<br>  If you don't have it<br>  and the truck is<br>  totaled you will owe <br>  difference between<br>  what it's worth and <br>  what is owed<br>  The best thing that<br>  could happen in your<br>  case is that it would <br>  be stolen and totaled<br>  by the thief AFTER<br>  you bought GAP <br>  insurance<br>  <br>  Jack|`|q2P7OMZCaa	Yes your loan company can do that BUT its usually done at an astronomical loss to you.

And keep this close to your heart.<br>  <br>  Then every time you deny yourself something (from spending money), write down the date, the item and the amount. Every week, month, etc, total the amount and see how much you have saved so far in your financial diet (it's like jumping on a scale to see how much weight you have lost so far in a food diet). And look at the item to see if you had really need it then. Chances are, you might be happy you never bought it.<br>  <br>  But remember, times are getting harder and harder these days. The world is in a financial mess. Treasure your money. Spend wisely, for tomorrow you will be happier for it much more than you are today.|`|q2P7OMZCaa	For me the food diet is more difficult.

You don't eat fattening food for a week for example, and then you visit a friend who offers you a piece of cake - and you can't resist.

You have a legal document saying you have paid it already. You could say you have already paid it and have a receipt - how can he prove that you didnt?!|`|45M7V8aoaa	Well dont let this guy intimidate you over money, he is probably in trouble for not lodging your deposit correctly and HAS actually broken the law.<br>  <br>  check your contract again if it does say BOND PAID then i would tell him where to get off.<br>  <br>  If he even hints at sending someone round again call the police straight away, he is again breaking the law, you can actually request that all correspondance from now on is in writing, he CANNOT intimidate you for money on a rented house. If he has a problem he needs a solicitor.<br>  <br>  I would also ask him if he is a registered landlord, a soon as you mention this you will see his pants turn brown. As your bond should have been lodge into the independent bond scheme to protect you both, you can actually claim 3 times this bond from him if he has not gone down the right and proper channels.<br>  <br>  It will actually take him months to evict you correctly. I would also expect any judge who looks at your case to tell him where to go and they may actually side with you and fine him.<br>  <br>  whats a pikey doing renting out houses anyway, i thought they all lived in caravans on other peoples land.|`|EPzw6hHKaa	you knew you would have to pay a bond at some time so you should have saved it, if you are so against gyppos as you call them why are you renting from them, don`t see any problem here, pay up or move somewhere else.

vEj71xuIaa	If you can pay for your expenses and set some money aside for later, you're good. So the first step is to figure out how much you spend each month -- rent, utilities, food, clothes, entertainment, etc. Then add 10% or 20% to that to give yourself a margin of safety, and make sure you're bringing home more than that after taxes.<br>  <br>  So if you spend $1500 per month, you'll want to have something like $1650 per month after taxes. The details on how to get that much would depend on where you are and what your tax situation is.|`|VbAm6N59aa	How much are you expenses.

IKakoOfyaa	If you close an account, even one that is fully paid off, it detrimentally affects your FICO score if it has been open long enough to show on your credit report.  It's stupid, I know, but that's the way it is.  It's better to just keep it open and not use it (and even then, the account may be closed by the issuing company due to lack of activity.  If this is the company's policy, charge something like a tank of gas every month and pay it off when the bill comes).  The longevity of your credit history is taken into consideration, but not the longevity of a particular account.|`|RxeQJcqhaa	What the above people say, PLUS - do not accept too many credit cards - that is also harmful to your credit.

Mortgage companies look for at least 3 years of continuation of income for employment.  They run third party verifications and will likely confirm your employment with your employer.  When your employer gets the form, there is a "probability of continued employment" line, and obviously they will have to disclose that you are being laid off.  Lenders are serious about limiting bad loans because they have had so many, and this is a big reason why the economy is the way it is right now.

Usually this is because the original loan was some type of sub prime loan with a balloon payment or an ARM aka adjustable rate mortgage that is too high now for the owner occupant to pay on.

It's up to you to target safe places...you don't just accept jobs that look like they might be 'risky'.  You may try to see if you could begin with cleaning your former professors homes, if they know you.  From there, get referrals from them.<br>  2.  Call around to franchised cleaning places and ask what their prices are (for either various sq ft homes or # of bdrms & baths) and what they do for that price.  Franchises are always more expensive than a self employed cleaner so you can discount from there.<br>  3. Yes, you run it as your business.

A household means the unit that is mutually financially responsible for themselves and each other - i.e. pays for their own food etc.  Under most circumstances, a couple living together would be one household.  But individuals living in shared accommodation would each be individual households.<br>  <br>  The way you have explained it on here suggests that he is more like a flatmate than a boyfriend.  Flatmates would normally be considered two seperate households and therefore you should be entitled to benefits and he shouldn't keep you.<br>  <br>  However, it sounds like that isn't how you explained it to the benefits people.  You told them that you live with your boyfriend and as with any couple who lives together, they will consider you to be one household.<br>  <br>  So, if it's the way that you've explained it on here, then you told the benefits people the wrong thing in the first place so why do you now have any right to be "upset" now that they've turned your claim down?  It's your own fault through not explaining properly in the first place.<br>  <br>  However, I suspect that it *isn't* the way that you've explained it on here because you then go onto say that you now have to pay two lots of rent and "our low resources" are even more hit.  This statement (and use of the word "our") indicates that you clearly do pool resources and therefore you are in fact living as one household and not as two, and therefore they were correct to deny your claim.|`|HvFIHu3saa	you said you want to remain independant how is that possible if you are collecting benefits from the state and we as tax payers are paying YOUR rent, get a freakin job and pay YOUR share with your boyfriend and if your religious beliefs forbid you to share the same bedroom then you should NOT be living with him AT ALL, sounds to me your beliefs are on your terms and not the religon itself.|`|vZMN82U8aa	appeal, two separate rooms, two separate rent books... so long as your boyfriend doesnt stay overnight (in your case he wont be) they ought to pay. <br>  <br>  but dont deal with the muppet on the counter, arrange a face to face interview|`|3yrpDNavaa	You two are under the same roof.

sj3Bq7vEaa	So I'm gathering from your question that there was a loss to the property and it was caused by the tenant's negligence. The landlord filed a claim with his company to repair this damage. They repaired it and are coming after the tenant for reimbursement, since it was due to their negligence. During the repairs, the landlord made "upgrades" to what was there prior.<br>  <br>  Is the landlord coming after the tenant or the insurance company coming after the tenant? If the tenant was negligent, they do owe to reimburse the insurance company, since the tenant is legally liable for the damage. The landlord would only be able to come after the tenant for their out of pocket expenses, which should the deductible.<br>  <br>  What might look like "upgrades" may actually be like, kind and quality replacement. For example, let's say that a tenant turned the heat off, the pipes froze and one burst causing water damage to the carpet. If the carpet that was there is no longer available, the insurance company will pay for what is comparable in today's market...no more, no less. Now, if the landlord decided to get hardwood floors instead of carpet, that would be an upgrade. The insurance company would only pay what it would cost for the carpet and the landlord would owe the difference in the upgrade. The tenant would only be responsible for the amount before the upgrade.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	If the insurance company is asking for repayment of the claim from the tenant, then the insurance company should be taking the tenant to court and leaving the landlord out of it.|`|bR8u9hpbaa	The landlord cannot force the tennant to pay anything to them if their loss was covered by insurance outside of the deductable they paid out of pocket. The insurance company can and will go after the party(s) responsible, and attempt to recoup all or part of their loss claim. If they succeed in getting back all of the amount back plus the deductable paid by the insured, then they will reimburse the insured. If the tennant is not insured they are at risk. If the insurance company deems the amount worth perusing in court then if they win the tennant will have to pay the judgement out of pocket. This is why may landlords today are requiring tennants to have renters insurance.

Basically the old owner takes the place of a bank and you the buyer would make your mortgage payment to them.<br>  <br>  Creative financing is just that Creative. Forr example you could do a Mortgage where you pay 5% interest only payment for 24 months. Then you pay 6% fully amortized payment for 30 years. Or you could do no payments no interest for 6 months on the note... The idea of Creative financing is that you are creative with the terms, payments, and/or structure of the note. Keep in mind that just because it seems like a good idea to you doesn't mean that the person who you expect to hold the paper (loan) will accept the creative terms.|`|507cbb6a51a66a0a157491c1262dcfe8aa	Seller financing can come in many forms, depending on the position that they are in regarding the home.  If the seller owns the home free and clear (does not have a loan to a bank) they have lots of different options on how they can work with you to sell.<br>  <br>  One term you may hear is "seller carryback".  This means that the buyer and seller agree to terms that are very much like a loan, only the seller is the one receiving payments.  The seller "carries" the loan.  This means that the buyer does not have to qualify through traditional lending channels...no banks, etc.  As long as the seller chooses to extend the credit to the buyer.<br>  '<br>  Another creative financing option is the "lease option".  It is also called the "Lease option to buy".  This is where you basically rent the house for a year and make above-market rent payments that accumulate as a down payment until you can qualify for a traditional loan.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

The odds of your listing agent finding the buyer that will pay you the highest price is very small.

I agree with SG that you have to meet them and evaluate their performance. They should have no problem with you contacting a few from their solds from last year not one or two that they set up to give rave reviews. #2? I wouldnt recommend it. These days agents/brokers are getting thrown extra percentages to sell homes so cutting commissions will have your home on the back of the list to show seeing buyers are fewer than before and the agents on both sides want to maximize the buying client. #2a. taking magazines ads off depends on the type of house and market you are in. If you own a ranch and they are putting you in great ranch deal magazine then I wouldnt. Whats more important is their internet presence and their ability to have your home seen by more people ready to go not what will turn up as their parakeets bathroom. Make sure they syndicate your listing to the national websites (about 15), make you a listing website like this (www.13419piedragrandepl.com) and their own site have it ranked for your area on the major search engines with your property highlighted on the front page. #3 top listing agents sell it because they are getting it seen by buyer agents not just thrown in the MLS and waiting for something to bite. Get an internet savvy agent that has past clients you pick from random saying they know their business and demonstrate their ability to put a deal together and not just be a clerk and you found yourself a winner. The non negotiated commission you pay will bring you a higher price and/or quicker sale. Give them room to discount at the end if you are a few hundred away, etc.

I'm talking about accounts that were completely PAID OFF.  I even had a gym membership that was canceled 6 months ago and paid in full take $200 out of my checking out last month. I haven't been charged by them in 6 months and they just conveniently "accidentally" charged me last month. My home phone I disconnected three months ago and they continue to take the monthly payment even though I have a final bill statement from them. They won't even acknowledge that they are still taking money from me, much less refund it. <br>  I'm sure I can't be the only one that companies are preying on. I've canceled a lot of accounts over the last year that I just could no longer afford. Those companies still need money and I'm sure my account isn't the only one being strip-mined. <br>  If I would've left that money in there, it would have been 'stolen' by companies that I've had accounts with that no longer have any right to my money and whom I no longer even owe.

Having another child is blessed, and if you want another kid, go for it, just pray its a healthy one. If you truly want another kid, go for it, even though you make enough money. But try to save some money on wasteful spending. You don't have to be rich to have more than one children. Forget the money and debt, and if the heart of both of you is about having another child, go for it ;)

They are a 28 year old health and wellness beauty company.    They are a very well respected network marketing company like Avon, but I think better in many ways.  <br>  <br>  Many people are looking for healthier options in most things they purchase.  That is exactly what Arbonne offers. Pure, Safe, and Beneficial Products.  <br>  <br>  Arbonne like Avon offers products that everyone uses and NEEDS.  Products that MUST be replenished every few months.  This is important with any company you choose.  Clients come back because they must have shampoo or lotion. Tastefully Simple is a wonderful company and I love their soups and dips, but I don' HAVE TO HAVE THEM.    Shampoo I have to have.  <br>  <br>  Arbonne also offers one of the most generious success plans (payment plans).  The plan encourages you to help others in your shopping network grow their network.  Important to review with other companies.  Some companies will penalize you if someone you sponsor does better than you...makes you wonder if your sponsor is really helping you as much as they could if they would be penalized if you did better than them.   Arbonne encourages you to have your people do better than you and when this happens you will not be penalized...it helps your network grow. <br>  <br>  By making my store - Arbonne rather than say Wal Mart and sharing the same concept with friends and family, I turn Shopping into and Income.  Arbonne has over 400 products, so you don't have to switch everything you use..just a couple of items and the simple concept works.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best with whichever company you choose.  Please consider Arbonne when doing your research.  Take a look at my website below.   There are links there that will share with you Arbonne's Success Plan, How much they have paid out to consultants so that you have an idea of what you could make, and all about the company, products, and people.  Arbonne offers tons of FREE Training and have advance web based reports and consultant platform. <br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  Karen Harrington<br>  Consultant ID # 16973176|`|4RI5QSsqaa	First.

IKakoOfyaa	Some banks and loan companies offer debt consolidation loans but will require some type of collateral.  Most people use their homes for that purpose, but if you have other property you may be able to use that.  Check around and don't get sucked in by one of those predatory companies with outrageous interest rates.  If you get a loan from them, you'll wind up further in debt.|`|AA11727490	Yes its called a "consolidation loan". Make sure when you purchase your home too, that the payment pays yoru property taxes and home owners insurance...all in one. Make sure to get a 'fixed rate' loan also. Good Luck. First time home buyers also get a stimulus from Obama's new stimulus bill.|`|ef652b889fbb589b6a5a57ae7d6d8afcaa	I'm not sure exactly what you're asking.  You may want to clarify, but I'll take a shot:<br>  <br>  1.  I'm ASSUMING you do NOT have a home and are not trying to buying one<br>  <br>  2.  What you're asking is that if there is a loan you can get, without collateral, that allows you to consolidate your bills into one.<br>  <br>  If that's what you're asking, here's my thoughts:<br>  <br>  1.  There are loans that you can get, called personal loans, that do not require you to have collateral, i.e. something that you put up against the loan, that you could use to consolidate your bills.  These loans will carry a very high interest rate and may not make sense for you.<br>  <br>  2.  If your bills are overwhelming your budget, there are ways to go to credit counselors that can work with your creditors and consolidate your bills.  You will likely pay a premium in a number of ways to make it work and it may not be the right thing for you<br>  <br>  3.  If you have a lot of outstanding bills, the fact that you could find an answer for this problem may not avoid you from having another problem based on your knowledge of credit and spending behavior<br>  <br>  So.... there are some other things that would be good to know:<br>  <br>  a.  How much of your debt is based on your regular spending habits versus something extraordinary, i.e. a health emergency?<br>  <br>  b.  How much of it is credit card debt?  How much of it is utility type bills?<br>  <br>  Based on your type of debt, you have several different ways to handle things.  I would suggest, based on whatever your situation is, that you do the following in order, as applicable:<br>  <br>  1.  Healthcare Debt - If you have a lot of healthcare bills, call the those you owe and tell them you are having a hard time paying and that you need to work out a payment plan that extends the debt, with no interest, for a longer term.  If you got these bills because you don't have insurance, then take a different tack.  Tell them that you won't pay the bills because they are inflated because you don't have health insurance.  Settle for paying only up to 40 - 50% of the amount you owe and then tell them you want an extended payment plan.  They will work with you and if they don't, tell them you can't pay.  Stay on them, they will work with you.<br>  <br>  Utility Bills - If your debt is utility bills and you're concerned that lack of payment may mean they will turn of your utilities, contact them immediately and tell them you're having a hard time paying.  If you qualify, they may pay your bill, reduce it, dramatically extend your payment period, or adjust your bill based on seaonality to allow you pay less, but consistent amounts every month to make it affordable.  If you tell them and work with them, most utility companies won't turn off your utilities because the regulatory folks won't allow them<br>  <br>  Credit card debt - If you have a lot of credit card debt, it's time to get that under control.  First, as painful as it is, freeze your credit cards (or cut them up).  As a minimum, freeze them... put them in a tupperware thing of water and put them in the freezer and leave them there.  When everything is under control you can decide what you want to do with them.  The best thing you can do here is not negotiate, not melt down, but to do what is called a debt snowball. First, put together a personal budget that allows you to find as much money as you can to pay off your credit cards.  You figure out what you have to work with and then you take all your credit card debt and put it in order from the LOWEST balance to the HIGHEST balance.  You then make the minimum payments on ALL the credit cards EXCEPT the LOWEST balance until the card with the lowest balance is paid off.  Then, you take the money you no longer have to pay on that card and apply it to the next lowest balance.  This way you have the minimum payment of the "next" card you were paying plus all the money you were paying on the first one which will allow you pay that one off just a little faster.  You keep doing this until all your credit card is paid off.  You have to sacrifice to make this happen but if you do, you can get this debt down faster than you might think.  The cool thing about this is that if you do this and don't cancel the accounts, your credit rating will go up because you will have more 'available' credit and owe less. <br>  <br>  Revolving Debt - These are your non-credit card debt and includes car payments, and even mortgage payments.  If you are having problems here, I would suggest two things: a.  Make these payments a priority after your utility bills.  These are your most vulnerable payments as you can lose the underlying assets if you get to far behind.  b.  Contact them and ask for help to work out payment plans, refinance options, extended terms or something.  These will be the hardest to deal with most likely and your real goal of the previous three areas is to free up enough money to pay for these.<br>  <br>  I know this is confusing but please consider it. Rather than changing one problem for anoth

It was quite uncomfortable and caused me anxiety as it seemed to worsen with time.<br>  I researched the problem online and came upon Indian Health Guru Consultant’s website. I wanted the procedure as soon as possible. The staff at the surgical facility were so competent and kind I was astounded. The procedure was done on time, quickly and efficiently and with great kindness and dignity. The total time was les than 20 minutes. I had minimal pain during the first eight hours and none thereafter. There was virtually no bleeding, scab or scarring. I flew 1000 miles two days after the surgery and spent a few days sightseeing and visiting with my son. Seven days after the procedure I want back to full work. I have functioned normally since then with no effects from the operation except the relief from the discomfort, anxiety and risk of the hernia. Fourteen days after the surgery I ran three miles and used weights at the gym, including squats.<br>  I am so grateful to Indian Health Guru Consultant’s treatment and care. I would never hesitate for a moment to recommend for professional services of Indian Health Guru Consultant’s. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indianhealthguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianhealthguru.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.

NCZK0QyGaa	Starbuck's name comes from Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, a classic American novel about the 19th century whaling industry. <br>  <br>  Current Price: March 5, 2009 8.64<br>  <br>  High/Low: Jan. 24, 2008 $20.45 and Nov. 19, 2008 $7.97<br>  <br>  Starbucks has an "employee first" philosophy. The company recognizes competitors can replicate the products Starbucks serves, but competitors can’t replicate the Starbucks people serving their products to customers. Its people, not products that make Starbucks Starbucks.  This is different from other corporations that have a product-focused philosophy.  Focusing on employees creates product differentiation that can not be easily duplicated allowing Starbucks to have more pricing power.
Bw1h5xAcaa	I'm an RN and I make about $33 per hour. I choose to only work 60% of full-time, which is six 8 hour shifts in a two week pay period, and I have to work every-other weekend. I work a rotation of day (7am - 3:30) and evening (3pm - 11:30pm).<br>  <br>  I used to work 12 hour shifts, 75% of full time, which was 5 shifts in a pay period, I would work every third weekend instead of every other, but I had to rotate to nights as shifts were either 7am - 7pm or 7pm - 7am. The nights were long, and hard for me, that's why I switched.<br>  <br>  I also have to work a handfull of holidays during the year. <br>  <br>  Nurses can find themselves a job with a schedule that works for them. If you don't want to work full-time (and most don't) you don't have to.

GSJ9gqVWaa	Shares go up and down.  Over the long term they will outperform cash.  But over the short term you could lose a lot of money.  If you are investing for the short term, you should stay in cash.  For the long term you should invest in shares.  At the moment it might be a good idea to stay in cash for a bit to wait for the market to reach the bottom.  But the market might have gone as low as it will.  Much smarter people than me are trying to work this out.  They haven't worked it out yet.

Average is about 720.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Yes is it.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Yes since the minimum for a home loan at the lowest interest rate is 750|`|ryjnt3dhaa	594 is a very weak score.  It is unlikely that it will affect your getting hired anywhere.  Paying off your debt will not raise your credit score but it will stop it from lowering you score any further.  Paying your bills on time will raise your credit score over time.|`|BO28Mn8haa	Yes. Very low|`|RxeQJcqhaa	Yes.|`|ef652b889fbb589b6a5a57ae7d6d8afcaa	Yes, a 594 puts you in the lowest, most risky category.<br>  <br>  Your ability to get credit will be more related to what makes up that score than not.  There are also things you can do about it, but it, again, depends on how you got there.<br>  <br>  1.  If you're young, it could likely be because you have no credit history.  You have to build a credit ratings to have one and if you're young, you just don't have the history.  If this is the case, you should work toward getting a better credit rating.  There are ways to do this.  For one, if you have a job, you might be able to get a credit card even though it carries a very high interest rate.  If you do that, and then use it, pay it off every month.  If you do that, over about a 12 month period, you'll build a better rating.  If you have the cash to buy something like a car, finance it instead, even if its only for a year, or get a co-signer from someone willing to do that.  By doing that, you'll build up credit.<br>  <br>  If, on the other hand, you have a 594 because you've been in debt and haven't paid, your strategy needs to be very different.  First of all, you need to pay off your debt rather than going bankrupt or having things repossessed.  Don't cancel credit cards, but do pay them off and then stop using them.  If you pay off more of your bills, keep the accounts open, and get regular in terms of your payment history you'll see your credit score significantly improve over a 12 - 18 month period.  Part of your credit score (FICO Score) is based on the TOTAL amount of credit you have available versus the TOTAL balance you have.  The more "available" credit you have, i.e. the more you "could" use of your total balance but don't, the better your score.  Further, the more regular your payments, with a large available balance, the better your score.<br>  <br>  If, finally, you have a 594 because you have had things repossed, have a bankruptcy or anything like that, the best you can do is get current, stay, current, and ride it out.  Don't get behind on payments any more and over a 3 - 5 year period things will improve if you improve.<br>  <br>  More than you wanted, but sometimes the context is important.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	Yes, it's low. You need at least a 620 these days to get approved for a mortgage so you're not that far off. Yes, if you pay your debt it will likely improve your score. <br>  <br>  You might also want to look into getting a couple of prepaid Visa cards because using those monthly will help your score. Just make sure you pay them off in full each month. The link below will take you to a company that can set you up with that for free.|`|liHpJvVfaa	yes. A fair credit score is about 630
eN2G4L2Naa	Ask lenders for agreement to delete this items from your credit report when paying them. I recommend to get such agreement thru credit repair agency, for example this one - creditreport.undonet.com|`|tmh42R6Caa	If these are current payments, then it won't hurt too bad.  If you haven't been paying the bills on time or they've gone to collections, then they will be very bad.  You can go to freecreditreport.com and order a credit report.  It will not give you a score, it only shows the report itself.  I think you can pay extra to get the score if you want.|`|QmbrXrdIaa	What most people in debt don't realize is that you can contact your lender to negotiate a payment plan - afterall, they're people too! Contrary to popular belief, these companies want to get their money. They do not want to send you to collections, as this is costly, or write the monies off as bad debt.<br>  <br>  Step one - contact your lenders. Let them know that you want to get this all sorted out and negotiate something that works for the both of you. <br>  <br>  Step two - get this stuff paid off!<br>  <br>  Step three - contact your bank for a credit card. Advise them you're trying to increase your credit. Any small balance will do.<br>  <br>  Step four - Use your credit card but pay it off every month - on time. <br>  <br>  Step five - I would also suggest getting an RRSP loan (Canada) or somthing of that nature. Even if you can afford to buy a lump sum, paying this monthly loan is a quick and easy way to increase your credit (and it's tax deductible).<br>  <br>  Also note, that I wouldn't be too quick to request a copy of your credit bureau. Each time your bureau is pulled, this decreases your score, regardless of who is pulling it. So don't go applying for a bunch of credit cards or loans- this is a red flag.|`|h82BZ7Braa	Are you smart enough to listen to some good advice from someone who’s been where you are?

DC4Civrvaa	Did you refinance through your bank or through a mortgage broker?  This would make a big difference.  Also was it just to get a better rate?  I can tell you off the bat that the processing fee and underwriting fee are charges that a bank or broker would charge for themselves.  The insurance and escrow fees are inevitable and are things that are required to be paid regardless.  The application fee sounds like a bit of a rip off to me.  I think they charge you that so you won't want to go anywhere else.  Next time, you might want to refinance with someone who isn't going to charge you this.  They just want to make sure you feel like your stuck and won't go looking around for a better deal.  Altogether $2800 isn't that bad.  Some people charge a LOT more.  You did ok.|`|mQK1Jrc6aa	first of all  you have to contact some mortgage lenders in your area and get the guide of your refinance problem. or you can try some online mortgage lender where u just fill the form and after they will contact you.<br>  <br>  i know one online mortgage lender who provide the all types of home refinancing services <a href="http://www.iloanshop.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.iloanshop.com</a> you can try this.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.......!|`|AA11173563	you got a deal my friend not even 1%

The IRS may need additional information and you may have to send it to them in the mail. If you have children the IRS may be checking the children to see that you are entitled to claim them. There are many other items the IRS could be looking at, you should have a code or letter that would indicate the IRS issue.<br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

GJKWgx0Paa	Paper money is backed by the ability of the government to get the people to pay taxes and nothing more.<br>  <br>  If the nation collapses, or the currency ceases being used, or the people refuse to pay taxes, or the government inflates the paper money out of all proportion to the economy, the paper money becomes worthless.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  these possible making worthless processes happened so many times in the 2,500 year history of China that the ordinary people's store of value became gold and gold jewelry.  The fiat money [taxed backed money] of the Emperors became worthless so often that no one trusted it for very long.|`|JsGX1bfRaa	Paper money used to be tied to a country's actual gold reserves but that is a thing of the past. No country does that anymore. The US stopped using the gold standard in 1971.<br>  <br>  Why don't they use it anymore? Because it caused problems when countries started exchanging gold for currency across nations. For example, during the Vietnam War (US trying to liberate Vietnam from the communists) France would buy a bunch of gold from the US for "x" amount of dollars while the value of the dollar was going down because the US was printing money in order to facilitate the war. France can then sell the gold back to the US at a profit. Now France has more gold and the US has less, plus the dollar's worth is dropping. US President Nixon saw these things and took the US off of the gold standard.<br>  <br>  Today, currency is tied mostly to the world's stock markets and currency trading (people who trade currencies like they do stocks). Other factors include the price of oil and perceived strength of a country's economy (weak economy outlook = weaker currency for that country).<br>  <br>  There is speculation that the world might reinstate the gold standard because of the problems that are going on right now. If that happens, the price of gold will skyrocket. It is a big "if". Gold is also viewed as a "safe haven" investment when there is a downturn in the economy but lately it hasn't been performing that way.<br>  <br>  Here is some historical info about the gold standard:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standa...</a>

Any group insruance policy (whether it's through an employer or through your bank...often refered to as mortgage insurance or creditor insurance) is owned by the company and not by the individual.  That means you have absolutely no control over the policy and they can cancel it, increase the rates and do whatever they want with it.<br>  <br>  You're only option if they are cancelling it is to get your own individual private insurance.  Contact an insurance broker to go over your options for private insurance.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	If they were paying for it, then yes, they can stop paying for it.<br>  <br>  You are legally free to make arrangements with the insurance company to continue the policy at your own expense -- but keep in mind you'd be paying individual rates, not group.

If a company has collections from long-term notes receivable, they are reported as operating cash flows if the note receivable resulted from a sale to a customer, or investing cash flows if the note was taken for another purpose. Typical investing activities include the purchase and sale of equipment, purchase and sale of securities, and making and collecting loans. <br>  <br>  In the third section, financing activities, the reader learns how the company chose to pay for its growth. Financing activities reports the activity in the long-term liability and stockholders' equity accounts. Typical financing activities are receipt and payment of loans, issuance of stock, payment of dividends, and repurchase of the company's stock. <br>  <br>  In reporting the changes in cash in the investing and financing activities sections, each type of cash inflow or outflow is shown separately in the statement. For example, if the company sold equipment for $7,000 cash and purchased equipment for $50,000, the statement would report these two activities separately. Similarly, if the company borrows $1,000,000 and repays $150,000 during the period, these activities are reported separately.<br>  <br>  c.Identify three specific types of economic decisions that can be assisted by the income statement<br>  i) Buy or lease decision<br>  ii) Manufacture or outsource decision<br>  iii) Incur debt or issue equity decision
qWytoOMmaa	Hard to say if it is or not without a little more information.  But, if there is proof that this has been happening before his tenure at the store, then I would argue that it is an accepted business practice - albeit a bad practice.  I'd also suggest that finding a solution to the issue would be more important than investigating his actions.  And from the standpoint of credibility and value to the company, I would be doing everything I could to have that solution at hand before the investigation in order to show the company what the problem really is and how to solve it.|`|GwQevn2Gaa	He may have broken the rules but all he can do is too take the case to a disputes tribunal.

BoAEgaAGaa	The IRS determines custody as the parent the child lives with the longest.  This would be the parent that has the right to claim the child unless there is a court decree that states that the non-custodial parent has the right to claim the child in a specific tax year.  Or the custodial parent signs a form 8332 to release the dependency to the non-custodial parent.  <br>  <br>  So bottom line, if he has lived in your home more than half the year, you and your husband should be able to claim him as a dependent and for any other tax benefit that goes to the custodial parent.  <br>  <br>  I am referencing page 27 of the IRS Pub 17 linked below.  It describes the rules for divorced or separated parents.<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	I would think so since when you claim a dependent you mark that they have lived with you for at least 6 months out of the year.  I had it put in my divorce that I got to claim my son every year since he was living with me full time.  I would ask your tax preparer about it, they have more knowledge on those kind of things.  Just wondering why you are paying child support if the kid is living with yall full time and yall are providing 100% of the care.  I would see about changing that.  Not very fair for you, that money could be going to his college fund or something alot better than giving it away to someone who does not even have the child.

Luckily you live in country where debt is relatively easy to deal with.<br>  <br>  Some of the answers on here I assume are by Americans who don't know our insolvency laws which is why I'm suggesting you get proper advice for the sake of your employees and family if not for you.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Suicide would be the absolute most selfish and unloving thing you could do to your family.  Killing yourself doesn't dissolve your debts---it just makes them totally your family's responsibility.  Hopefully, when you started your business, you incorporated so that your house could not be taken away to pay the business debt.  Running away might have worked when you were 2, but it wont help now.  Your debt will follow.  Why did you wait so long to begin seeking help?  It's possible that a good business financial counselor could help you negotiate the fees on your debts and structure a plan for repayment.  Bankruptcy may be your only other option (which I usually don't recommend because it just leaves the taxpayers responsible for your debt now).  As a last resort, I suppose you COULD just walk away from it all but, aside from losing everything, you'll be ruined (credit-wise) for the next 7-10 years.  Chances are, your credit is probably pretty bad already, and filing bankruptcy also ruins it for 10 years.  Without a decent credit rating, you wont be able to get an apartment or rent a house, and you might not even be able to get a job.  Personally, I think it's WRONG that a prospective employer can decide whether or not to hire you based on your cedit history, but that seems to be the way the world is going.  Consider starting to sell off your belongings.  You have a house full of assets.  Sell your bedroom suite and sleep on the matress on the floor.  Sell your dining room furniture and eat on the couch in front of the TV (both of which you may also have to eventually sell).  Advertise it all on CraigList (which is free).  Start doing some online researching and find out what kinds of government help there is for you.

No more picnics, no Christmas parties and the list goes on.  People leave and no replacements are hired adding to already impossible work loads.  Meanwhile the top execs are purchasing a new jet, having their offices paneled in exotic wood, collecting ungodly salaries with humongous stock options and so on.

There is military doctrine in the infantry about how you prepare to defend a battle position.  It's something like this:<br>  1.  When setting up positions, you put at least two people into a fighting position "foxhole".  <br>  <br>  2.  If there is an odd number of people, you put three in one of the positions rather than have one person alone.<br>  <br>  Why?  It's simple.  Many will join the military because of patriotism but they stay on the front line and fight like heck because there's a buddy next to them.  They feel compelled to ensure they are doing their part when there is someone else there.  When alone, even the most brave has a higher potential of retreating because they can't see the immediate reason for doing anything different.<br>  <br>  Creating a spirit of teamwork, loyalty, and support between employees, not the company, can create a much more productive environment because the people will work to make their peers proud of them, to not let them down, and to share in the experience of success.<br>  <br>  Employees feel loyal to a company when they come to realize that the reason they feel so good about the job and the people they work with and feel loyal to is because the company is smart enough to understand, attract, and retain people who want to succeed.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  OH, you might also want to look into the theory of Job Satisfaction founded by Frederick Herzberg (I think that's the right spelling).  He defined job satisfaction using two categories of factors:  Motivating factors and Hygeine factors.  Creating a sense of team, providing recognition, etc are what motivates employees.  The physical environment, polices and procedures, and even salary are hygeine factors.  You might find that interesting.<br>  <br>  Cheers.

In just a few weeks new listing come on the market that could be priced lower than yours or other sellers might have lowered their prices. to compete with you.<br>  <br>  Has any home similar to your gone "pending" since you put your home on the market?  Be prepared to lower the price on your property.  Is your Realtor offering a full 3% commission to the buyers agent?  Might consider offering $2000 extra bonus to the agent that brings in an acceptable offer.  Make sure your property is in the MLS.  Is your agent promoting your home to other agents in your area at the weekly MLS meetings and elsewhere?  Hope you have a sign in the yard and a lock-box.  If you don't get both.  <br>  <br>  In this market especially, the best house at the lowest price sells.<br>  <br>  Get a list of competing homes from your agent and at least drive by the competition.

Sometimes good. sometime not so good.<br>  <br>  -----------------------------------<br>  Demand that your Realtor offer 3% to the buyers agent and keep 2% for himself.

Is it on any websites such as Realtor.com? If not, then why not? Ask you agent what websites he is using. Also, has he had broker's open houses? It is important that other realtors in the area have a chance to preview the home for their customers. Either way, it may be time to reprice.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Relax.

Don't even think about carrying a small balance if you don't have to.  You'd be paying interest on EVERYTHING you buy, not just the small balance you'd carry.  Paying interest is ridiculous if you don't have to.<br>  <br>  I have about the same credit score as you.  I pay off my balances each month.  We don't need to worry about improving our credit scores ... we're in the best bracket.  Just make sure you use your credit cards at least once every 4 months, so that the credit card company will not close your account.  When your accounts close, your credit score drops because your debt/credit ratio increases.<br>  <br>  Keep up the good work.  It's nice not to have credit card debt, huh?|`|ePkiOzPSaa	You should just keep paying off the entire balance.  You would not gain much (if anything) from keeping a balance on from month to month, and it builds bad habits.  You're much better off just keeping the money you would have paid in interest.<br>  <br>  Also, with a credit score at ~800, you really don't need to worry about improving.  You should be in the top category for whatever you want to do.|`|2H4QOwFzaa	Pay it in full if you can.

I think that females in power, especially ones who are a little older and grew up during a different generation, feel that they need to assert themselves more than men in the same positions. It's really not her fault. It's just that a lot of women feel that they need to be more assertive than their male counterparts to show that they are as qualified for the position as the men are. A lot of women just haven't figured out the difference between assertiveness and bitchiness.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Maybe she's jealous of you or you actually remind her of herself at that age. Or maybe she doesn't realise how's she treating you. Who knows? She must have liked you at some point to have given you the job. People get jobs at interviews because the employer likes them and can see them fitting in well in the company, not just because of their qualifications, skills and abilities. She might be harder on you because she wants you to be successful. I've always had female employers and I've never had a problem with them. Good luck though!

Just be honest - lies will catch up with you. You could say that as you are only young (true?) this would be your first job so that will make you eager to learn. You enjoy movies and and like mixing with people. If you have babysat or any other work like that for parent's friends you could add that too. List your academic qualifications so far also. You could finish it up by saying that you will come in and do an unpaid shift to gain work experience and can they even offer you a months trial to prove yourself. Good luck - everyone has to have a "first job". You might not get the one you want first time but if you are hardworking and honest you'll get there someday! One last thing, get someone to proof read your application. Bad grammar and spelling are a real turn off.|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	I would think your academic qualifications.

HeFlBmGSaa	The previous poster saying you will have a bad credit score for 10 years in not really correct. You can actually have a bankruptcy and get a home loan 2 years later. <br>  <br>  What I would do is contact the collection agency and see if they will settle the debt for less than owed and/or come up with a comfortable payment plan for you. They probably purchased that debt from the hospital for 20 cents on the dollar or something low like that so they will usually be willing to negotiate.|`|f2GFX5B2aa	It will cost you 1,500 to file bankruptcy plus court filing fees and you will have to attend 2 sessions of how to manage your money type of classes. That's additional cost but not by much.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Well, you should have made payment arrangements with the hospital.  If it has already gone through the court system and is a judgment that is being collected, you're out of luck.  However, if it hasn't gone that far yet, you could file bankruptcy and eliminate that debt.  It usually costs a couple hundred to file, plus a couple hundred for the lawyer.  You will have a BAD credit score for at least 10 years.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	It will cost around $1000 depending on the area that you are filing in.  A large city the cost will be more.  Bankruptcy would remove this debt from you.  I am not sure what type of health insurance you have, but most of the ones that I have had have a clause where things like a premature baby you will end up paying at most $10,000 and the insurance picks up the rest.  With having a child, I would make doubly sure that I have good health care over wants.
AA11966821	You have to pay the bill.  They can call your place of employment and verify you work there, file and get a court order garnishing your wages.  You should have arranged a payment plan with the hospital when you had your baby if you had no insurance or insufficient insurance.  <br>  <br>  Between you and your husband (or the baby's father), you ought to be able to work this out, or else use your child support from the father to help pay this.<br>  <br>  Now you have to pay the hospital bill with interest, collection costs, legal fees, etc.  It's going to end up costing you at least twice as much the original hospital bill.  Try negotiating a settlement with the collections agency now, or else let them take your wages.|`|9972cdeaacdbbbcad131174971c64b6baa	They can't legally harass you anywhere, including work.  You should write them a letter stating they aren't to call you or go to your work place.  Make sure you send it certified mail.  If there's absolutely no way to pay the debt back, then you can choose to leave it on your credit and it will fall off in 7 years.  Creditors are more likely to overlook medical debts than any other type of debt, so although it definitely will hurt your credit, it's not as bad as not paying $32k in car bills/house bills/etc.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	If you had insurance, look in the paperwork.<br>  There is a 10,000 out of pocket for bills a lot of people don't know about.<br>  /|`|0rAgtGNgaa	yes they can serve you at work and as long as they are not telling anyone why they are calling then yes they can call you at work.

Suddenly coming up with the idea of a charge just because you think he'll gain something is a little on the rude side. Charge everyone else going forward if you want, but make it clear up front.

MmTe8W8uaa	The federal government allows residents of ALL states to deduct EITHER sales tax OR state income tax.  There are no special deductions for being a Texas resident.  You qualify for the same deductions as residents of the other 49 states.  <br>  <br>  Most states have higher state income taxes than sales taxes, so their residents usually elect to take deduct their state income tax (which is usually more), instead of their sales tax (which is usually less).  However, Texas has no state income tax, so its residents usually elect to deduct sales tax (which is usually something), instead of their state income tax (which is usually nothing).  However, residents of all 50 states have the option to deduct whichever they choose, but NOT both.|`|snh9wzpnaa	Yes, everybody get to deduct either state sales tax or state and local income tax on their federal return if they itemize.  For states like TX that don't have a state income tax, deducting sales tax is their only choice - again if they have enough things to itemize.

It is designed for people who are spending more than 31% of their monthly income on their mortgage, so if this is you then absolutely call your mortgage company and find out what they can do for you.  But you definitely have a long battle on your hands.  <br>  <br>  One more thing I'd like to mention is, do NOT pay anyone to help you modify your loan.  There is no need, you can call the bank yourself and work things out for free.  Anyone claiming differently is trying to scam you.|`|UU5RoAKHaa	Home mortgage modification is THE hottest buzz word around right now!<br>  I am a Realtor in OH. If you want to look into modifying your current loan that isn't going to reduce your principle. It will change the terms of your loan...they will either extend the term (if you have 22yrs left of payments they could be willing to go up to 30 which would reduce your payment)  OR they could reduce your interest rate...or a combo of both.<br>  Now....if you have both a first and second mortgage that just complicated things.<br>  But you would start by contacting your mortgage servicer (who you make your payments to)...and be ready for no quick easy answer. They right now are being bombarded with these requests due to the topic being so hot in the news. Be patient and call and see what they say. I do know of one major servicer that just hired 2500 people to do nothing other than answer calls such as the one you are about to make.<br>  Good luck to you!<br>  Dawn

AA10259042	Well, there certainly are a lot of cheap ones out there and every day they get cheaper and cheaper.  At the rate they are getting cheaper by the end of the year there will be practically none worth over a buck a share. Are your sure you want to do this?<br>  <br>  OK.  If you know which ones you want to buy you can open an account with Scottrade or TD Ameritrade.  They are both inexpensive.  You can do that on line by going to their web site.  After you open your account, you will need to fund it or link it to your bank account.  There is only a 3 business day settlement for purchases and the mail is too slow to get a check to the broker before the settlement date ends so it is best to have some money in the account before making a purchase. Both those brokers have people you can call for help.  I use TD Ameritrade and they are decent, not great but decent.  From those whom I have talked to Scottrade also appears decent. <br>  <br>  here is a link that tells of some of the best companies but not the cheapest.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://munciebirder.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://munciebirder.blogspot.com/</a>|`|AA10472839	Take the next year or more to learn the basics... before you do anything.

AA11966821	You need to learn about income taxes or you will waste a great deal of money (and time!) over the rest of your life.  Go the library and start studying a good income tax guide.  Get the forms and go over them line by line with the book and the IRS instruction manual.  When you understand what you are doing, then fill in a form as a "worksheet copy" just so you really understand what you are doing.  Then you either handwrite a neat form for the IRS, or get tax software for your puter, or go online.  The key is to learn how to do it!<br>  <br>  If you go to a tax preparer, you will never learn how taxes work so that you can arrange your affairs to reduce your tax bills.  Plus you spend all that money on the preparer.<br>  <br>  Your choice: get smart fast or stay broke for the rest of your life.|`|A1kiUMgvaa	It would appear that you have no idea what you would be doing if you attempted to do your own tax returns.

(are you responsible, gentle, fun with kids, etc).<br>  - Give personal info : Name, age, and obviously phone number to reach you.<br>  <br>  Where to put them: Sometimes there are places in a town where you can hang up flyers.

This is especially so if they can get you access to whatever product available in the market today. It does not matter what merchandise you are searching for, be it a pair of branded jeans, sports wear or the latest MP4 player. As long as you can lay your hands on it easily with a simple one-click order, your customers would be pleased. Right here, we would take you behind-the-scenes so that you can learn how to differentiate an honest, reliable and real one from a fake.<br>  <br>  Real wholesale dropshippers would never charge you extra fees to ship a package for you to your customer. A middleman masquerading as a direct wholesaler would charge you a delivery fee simply because the margins are thin and he got to earn some profits. True blue distribution agents or companies need not do this as they have the distribution network ready and all product prices have incorporated the delivery service charges.<br>  <br>  One problem you would also face when you unwittingly deal with the middlemen is the longer delivery time. In the long run, it does no good to your online business as profits are eroded and your reputation and credibility are affected. So it pays to find reliable wholesale dropshippers and establish long-lasting partnerships. They ensure you always enjoy products of the best quality at the lowest prices possible. You also need not worry that the goods do not reach your customers on time.<br>  <br>  A real wholesale dropshipper is also first and foremost a distributor. Do not be confused between the two. Suppliers hold the stocks in their inventory and dropshippers take care of the delivery. However, wholesale ones are both as in they being suppliers also offer delivery services for their customers. These customers are mostly resellers or online retailers or auctioneers like yourself. The shipping is anonymous to the end users, the consumers who purchases from you. To your customers, they would think the products came directly from you and the whole process is seamless.<br>  <br>  Since they own the wholesale business, they would transact directly with the product manufacturers. Stocks are purchased in bulk and stored in their warehouses or other storage facilities. Wholesale dropshippers are able to negotiate for deep bargains with the manufacturers. The whole transaction is mutually beneficial. The manufacturers clear their stock inventory fast and the wholesalers get great deals.<br>  <br>  At the same time, real wholesale dropshippers are able to give you what is called the wholesale prices for their merchandise while still earning a profit margin for themselves. This price is often about 15 to 30 percent below market rates for each individual product. You can then resell the product for a handsome profit.<br>  <br>  Seek out the top international dropship wholesale distributors listed on my blog to maximize profits.

A1kiUMgvaa	First you get a transcript of your state and federal returns for the year 2003 along with your income statements for that year.  You can get those from the IRS and the state taxing agencies.  With that information it is likely that the returns were not correctly prepared.  You would need to amend all three returns.  Your biggest problem will be the lapsed time from when the problem occurred and your correction.  You likely got some notices back in 2004 or 2005 concerning this and they had specific amounts of time to make corrections.  At this point it is much more difficult to make these corrections and may not be possible depending on what notices were originally issues by the taxing agencies.  You may find it cost effective to employ a tax professional to assist you with this matter.|`|qWaYbxcxaa	A CPA.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cpadirectory.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpadirectory.com/</a>|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	So find an good tax preparer and have them review your taxes for 2003.<br>  <br>  In a year that you move, you have the problem of when did you end living in one state and established residency in the other.

The only purpose such a letter serves is to avoid unemployment insurance increases, and any wrongful termination suits.<br>  The email telling you that Friday will be your last day, predating your letter of resignation should be enough to prove your point, and receive unemployment.<br>  Dont expect that good letter of recommendation, however.|`|AHCelSY1aa	It is hard to determine if this was a wrongful termination since you do not say how long were you employed or how long you were out after giving birth since you may have been protected under the Family Medical Leave Act, but you were definitely coerced into giving a resignation. That definitely would help your claim when you go to the UI hearing if you present it clearly without getting flustered.  More importantly, your story would prove to be quite credible since you have the email from this individual advising you of your last date of employment which is an obvious termination and would fall under "constructive termination."  This document in conjunction with your resignation letter that is dated 3 days later per her statement that without the letter you would not receive a good recommendation for future employment will totally nail them.  Just keep calm and again do not get flustered no matter what you do.|`|yrJQHOOeaa	Ignore the previous smart*sses and shop around for a lawyer.

qWaYbxcxaa	People are still holding GM despite all the massive and obvious information about how much in trouble they are in?<br>  <br>  I've written on this extensively since last year.<br>  <br>  In short:<br>  1. GM common equity is technically worth zero, and has been since 2006. The market is just factoring that in slowly.<br>  <br>  2. In any BK, the equity generally gets wiped out. All one has to do is look at the assets - liabilities of GM, and you'll see there is negative equity, thus, a worthless stock in any BK situation.<br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=GM&annual">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=GM&annua...</a><br>  <br>  GM hit their all time high on Jan 4, 1999 at $87, and has fallen every year, over the last 10 years since. <br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=GM#chart1:symbol=gm;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=GM#ch...</a><br>  <br>  3. Chapter 11 or 7 will still wipe out the common equity. GM does not have to close it's doors to wipe out the common equity. They can emerge from a BK situation and issue new stock. Existing equity (stock) holders would 99.9999% of the time, get zero interest in a newly issued stock.<br>  <br>  4. Just because a stock with a big name has a low price does not mean it is a buy. <br>  <br>  Few examples: <br>  BSC, LEH, CC, WB, C, FNM, FRE, AIG, RAD, SIRI, CBS, AXA, AZ, HIG, ING, ABK, PMI, MTG, LYG, RBS, BAC, WFC, LVS, MGM, etc etc, etc.<br>  <br>  See "Value Trap"<br>  <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuetrap.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valu...</a>|`|qBCGH52haa	It depends on what type of bankruptcy they file for.

They are in deeper trouble than they are letting on.  MSNBC today is very negative on GM.  Chrysler is history, but is privately held.  MSNBC is saying today that GM might get parted out also.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	You have no entitlement to either a pay rise or a permanent contract because they were not written into your terms and conditions of employment and were only mentioned verbally.  This means that they don't hold up.<br>  <br>  Additionally, a "review" is certainly no guarantee of getting either of these things anyway.<br>  <br>  If the company has a pay freeze, then yes, this applies to you despite TUPE regulations.  The only staff who would potentially have a case here is anyone who is contractually guaranteed a pay rise.  You had no contractual guarantee to one.<br>  <br>  If they have a pay freeze I'd imagine they also have a hiring freeze, and that will be why they won't talk to you about a permanent contract.  Of course, it's rude of them to ignore your questions - they should simply explain this to you, but the point is that they're certainly under no obligation to give you one.|`|qBCGH52haa	Don't count on the pay raise or contract.  Unless the guarantee of a pay raise was in black and white and in writing, you are no legally entitled to anything.  As you noted, the original deal was they would review after probation and "if all was well" as you put it, you would get the raise.  Well, a month after your probation period ended, you have a new owner, so even if your performance was satisfactory, terms have changed and without a contract, the pay freeze from the new company is valid (there is no law guaranteeing you a pay raise).  In fact, if they wanted, they could come to you tomorrow and say that due to the economy, we are cutting your payrate.|`|AA10309738	Sorry to say it but you don't have a leg to stand on.

My husband has been getting the highest performance ratings you can get and his company are saying they have no money in the pay rise pot either.<br>  Unfortunately it's not going to help matters if you only had a verbal agreement.<br>  I think all you can do is glad you have managed to hold on to the job and hope that the economy picks up this year so that you may get a payrise in the future.<br>  I know it's not fair, but sadly we are all in the same boat at the mo.<br>  Good luck.
Pjm9pg7iaa	Refinance is when you replace your existing loan with a new loan. The old loan is paid off. Usually you do this to lower your monthly payments.

A1kiUMgvaa	If you are suggesting that this person had an increase in their income tax refund because they received a 1099a or c that would not be possible.  If they said that they go a refund despite having received these form that would mean that they had a tax preparer that knew what they were doing.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Not really possible.<br>  <br>  The 1099-A represents a sale.  You use the FMV to determine if you had a gain or a loss on the property.  If this is personal property, losses are not deductible.  For business property, the loss could be taken (and could reduce the tax).<br>  <br>  The 1099-C represents cancelled debt income.  It represents income whether it's personal or business, but can be excluded sometimes with form 982.<br>  <br>  A taxpayer could still have a refund even with these forms, but generally not because of them.

Wehjuvpmaa	no they won't take it unless you owe them money for fraudulently getting food stamps - if you just started getting them then they probably already know that you worked last year and that you will have to file a return|`|kifwyOgKaa	Nope.  When you apply for food stamps, they base the amount on your annual gross income.  The taxes you may or may not pay are included in that amount.|`|cz5XbKfOaa	No. Unless you owe food stamps that were overpaid and they have gotten a judgement against you for that. Otherwise, You have the month that you receive the refund and the month after to spend the money you receive from a tax refund. So pay your bills and you can even pay ahead for mortgage and utilities. You need to have less than $2000 left to continue to be eligible. When you turn your report in provide a copy of your tax return or other proof of the amount you received and provide a spend down. A spend down is a letter stating what you spent the money on and stating how much you have left at the end of the month. Sign and date the letter. You need to report it don't try to hide it as the worker knows when someone should expect a tax return, it is something we are trained to look for during this time of year.

K45ZTwryaa	Without more information, it is difficult to give a definitive answer but generally speaking, the mere promise to enter into a contract is not enforceable.  Minimally you would need at least some legal detriment, e.g. you passed up other solid business opportunities or you incurred business expenses (materials etc.) which were necessary and had to be incurred in advance of the actual commencement of work (and which you would not have otherwise incurred).<br>  <br>  It also might not make good business sense to try to enforce the promise.  If they are having funding problems it might be better to preserve the business relationship.  Consider politely asking them to explain  why there is an unprecedented delay in the execution of your employment contract and, if they fail to respond, follow up with a polite explanation that you need the signed contract or you will not be in a position to refrain from negotiations and engagements with other potential employers|`|795nSfFiaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I would say no due to there being the official contract yet to be signed. At this point I would be looking elsewhere. It may not be that they do not want you to return, but funding source could have fallen through or something of that nature.

This can take two forms. A contract which is implied in fact is one in which the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly. For example, by going to a doctor for a checkup, a patient agrees that he will pay a fair price for the service. If one refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has breached a contract implied in fact.

My guess is that he will be paying back anything he got because of the kids.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	"Should he have claimed the kids as his son and daughter instead "  No, of course not, they aren't his kids.  The only difference is that it would have taken longer to get audited and then he would have been banned from collecting  EIC for 10 years due to fraud.<br>  <br>  "The sister (only 16) stays with an aunt because of convenience to attend school"<br>  <br>  This is your real problem. The IRS is going to start with the presumption that the children live with their mother.  Since the mother doesn't live with your friend, he has to show that the children live full time with him, not with the mother.  From the IRS point of view, if mom is living with Auntie (the address she gave for school and social services), so are the babies.  The children are visiting at his/grandma's house and are merely temporarily absent from her home.  Free babysitting is not the same thing as custody.<br>  <br>  As newborns, there will only be a few documents available.  What address was given to the hospital?  What address do the doctor records show?  If your friend rents, what names are on the lease? (How many bedrooms are there?) What names/addresses were given to social services?<br>  <br>  Your friend made, what, $15,000 to $20,000 a year? If he filed as single, with his withholding, he'd get $100 back as a refund.  If he claims he paid all the bills and these 2 children lived with him and not their mother, then he'd get all his withholding back and  another $6000 in EIC and additional child tax credit.  The IRS will see the low income and argue that he could barely support himself, let alone anyone else.<br>  <br>  The fact that the mother and grandmother have no income and thus won't file on their own and Auntie has probably maxed out her own refund already so she didn't need two more dependents didn't help his case.|`|Wehjuvpmaa	First of all RELAX...if he really takes care of them then he has nothing to worry about...and second NEVER lie about the relationship that will get you in trouble.....now, for proof - he could send copies of the checks where he paid the rent/ house pmt...water bill....light bill.....grocery store....where do the children's Dr. bills say they live? and the mother of the children can also write a letter explaining the living situation.

iT0xlDOaaa	Legality aside, you did tell him you would rent it and then just a week before moving in you backed out. Since you told him you would take it two weeks ago, he probably stopped looking for a tenant. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would offer him half of a months rent, 2 weeks, since that is the time you cost him by not looking for a new tenant. If he wanted to make a case of it, he probably has one. By offering him the 2 weeks you are making it worth his while to not bother with a civil case and save the effort and money going after a full months rent.<br>  <br>   It's not all about whether you are legally responsible or not, sometimes it's just about being a responsible person and doing what is right.<br>  <br>  Broken Wings points out exactly what is WRONG with most people. "Don't pay him, go to court and LIE that you ever had an agreement with this person." You would be furious if someone did this to you, so why would you do it to someone else?<br>  <br>  Realtor.Sailor doesn't know what he is talking about. This is an existing tentant sub-leasing his apartment for less than one year. Per the NY Attorney General regarding Tenants Rights, "Leases for apartments which are not  rent stabilized may be oral or written...An oral lease for more than one year cannot be legally enforced.   General Obligations Law § 5-701.  " A verbal agreement between two parties is enforceable under these conditions. Although as I already stated, the onus would be on the existing tenant to show reasonable proof that a verbal agreement existed and that he was harmed by your withdrawal from it. I think he would be able to meet those conditions which is why I suggest you offer him half the amount and everyone walks away from it.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	It's called the Statute of Frauds;  all agreements regarding real estate must be in writing to be enforceable.  He may be upset, but that's all he can do.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|0rAgtGNgaa	Nope you are not responsible since it was a verbal agreement.  If he decides to take you to court over it all you have to do is deny you ever had this conversation.|`|AA11286455	I think that this is one of those situations where a "verbal agreement" doesn't count for much of anything, much less count for spit.  <br>  <br>  The key here would be:  Consideration.  Did money change hands?  <br>  <br>  If you paid him ANY money, regardless of whether you had a verbal OR a writen agreement about your moving in, you would be screwed on getting it back, esp. since this isn't a life-threatening situation, you didn't get called to report for duty to Iraq, etc.   <br>  <br>  Realtor above also has some very good info. as well.  <br>  <br>  It's not the landlord's problem that you got a "better deal".  He might easily be able to win in court for additional money--seeing as how x number of potential renters could have been shown the apartment and "taken your place".  <br>  <br>  Instead, he turned them down or stopped advertising.  Now THAT would cause him real "harm" and he could win over it, iincluding damages if he asked.  <br>  <br>  So, if he takes you to court, the judge would simply tell him that it's his dumb fault for not getting getting a lease signed or a deposit from you, and/or 1st month's rent, etc....It would have shown intent on both your parts.  You've given each other something of value and have had a "meeting of the minds".  <br>  <br>  You give him money and he's on the hook to NOT rent it to anyone else .  (A very notable exception to this may be the landlord's decision to move a relative in depending on your jurisdiction.)<br>  <br>  At any rate, call the Rent Board in NYC (or in the borough where you would have been living if they have them organized that way).  They can't give you legal advice, but could say what pertinent reading material they can send.  Also ask if they, or the state, has a web site  on rental laws.  <br>  <br>  Also, Nolo Law Books can be found at your local library on housing and renting matters business and personal matters, and tell you where you stand.

Your first figures checked out - if you borrowed 27,000 and are paying 12% interest on a 15 year loan, the payments are $324 a month.<br>  <br>  When I plugged in a payment of $500 a month (the extra $176 goes directly to the principal) I get a repayment term of only 7 years.<br>  <br>  As of today, you still $23,600 (stinks, doesn't it?).  If you pay $525 a month from here on out (an extra $200 per month), you will own it completely in 5 years instead of 11 (the original term of your loan was 15 years and you've been paying for 4 already).  <br>  <br>  Obviously if you want to pay more per month you can own it even faster.  If you want to own it in:<br>  6 years - $461.38 per month<br>  5 years - $525 per month<br>  4 years - $621.48 per month<br>  3 years - $783.86 per month<br>  2 years - $1110.93 per month<br>  1 year - $2097 per month <br>  <br>  No matter what someone tells you, the only way to pay a loan off faster is to pay more per month.  All of the additional money needs to go to the principal - my mortgage coupon has lines to fill in that state where extra payments should be applied and I choose principal.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Write a bigger check each month............
Gun3UGzaaa	There are a few things you need to take into consideration.  The good news is that you don't owe a lot on this house.  The bad news is that the interest rate is high, and refinancing is difficult because of his bad medical bills.<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is to find out when the medical bills will come off of his credit report.  In most states, it is in seven years.  He could repay them, which is the right thing to do, or he could wait for them to drop off and let the drop off help fix his credit score.<br>  <br>  So, then, the question becomes "what does waiting cost us?".  Well, at 12% interest on $20,000, you are paying about $200 a month in interest.  The rest of your payment is going to the principal balance and taxes.  If you can drop that to 8% interest, the per month interest cost drops down about $135.  So, it would save you $65 a month to refinance.  But, it might cost you $4,000 to pay off the medical bills and $2,000 to refinance.  So, that $6,000 in costs would have to be compared against $65 a month in savings.  It will take almost 8 years to make that a worthwhile trade.<br>  <br>  Stay away from using the TSP as a source of financing.  For two reasons.  (1) You can borrow for a house, but you can't borrow for retirement, and there is great value in saving for retirement when you are younger.  And (2) If your boyfriend leaves his job for any reason (illness, layoff, just quits), that money is due in FULL within 30 days.  If he cannot pay it in full within 30 days, then it is considered a withdrawal and will be reported to the IRS.  He will have to pay taxes and penalties of close to half of the amount, and he will not be able to finance it.<br>  <br>  My recommendation:  Find ways to pay a little bit extra against the loan to reduce the balance.  Increasing the payment by just $300 a month will get this paid off in about 5 years.  Maybe you could get a part time job and use that pay as an extra payment against the house.  Or, when the medical bills drop off his credit report, look again at refinancing with a bank.  You also might want to check with your city/county to see if there are any low-income loans that you could use to offset some of this loan.<br>  <br>  See if some of the land could be sold or leased to someone to generate some income.  <br>  <br>  Also, there is a website where you can do a self-screening for government assistance programs.  See if that has something to help.  www.benefitscheckup.org.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  And don't discount being a stay at home mom when people ask for work experience - that is plenty of work.  Just find ways you can translate what you do at home into what needs to be done on a job.  For example, you are a cook, cleaner, record keeper, caretaker.  Or find ways you can volunteer in the community, maybe at the library or PTA, to develop references for jobs outside the home.  There are not a lot of legitimate work at home situations.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	You can do either.  If it was me then I would pay off the medical first.  that way your debt to income ratio wouldnt be as high and would better your chances at refinancing at a better rate.  In the meantime, if you can afford to pay any addtional principal to your morgage along with paying more on your medical then do so.

I have been in telesales for 15 years and the past 4 was in alarms, which were not doing to well and the boss decided to try solar panels, we spent 2 weeks trying and no one was interested, I was made redundant in january and done some part time telesales for a well know double glazing company who also do solar panels but again no one wanted them. Customers just laugh and tell you they cant afford them. The leasing companies are not giving anyone finance at the moment, anyone getting one has to have permission from their council and that puts them off. I don't want to dishearten you but be prepared to work very hard, spend hours in someones house trying to sell them for very little return. Unless yo have years of high pressure selling in the home improvement market you wont like the job. Good luck.
17RmbitOaa	The market is in terrible shape, and this is not the place you should be investing your money.  There will be better times ahead.  You need to buy stock investing books, and develop a strategy for trading stocks.  You don't just buy and hope a stock price up.  You know your entry price, and you know your exit price.  You should have  a time period that you expect to make your profit at.|`|mZfPEJdYaa	The stock market is in turmoil.  I would stay away from individual stocks and invest in index mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETF).  That is assuming that you are a young person, say under 40, and you have at least ten years before you need this money.  I think the next couple of years will be ugly for investments.  I would look at some low cost mutual fund groups, Vanguard, in my opinion is the best.  Morningstar is a very good investment advice site.  Go to the library and get books on investing or buy the books in a bookstore.  Get familiar with the terminology.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  the internet is a good source for general information.  go to almost any large mutual fund site or google for ETF, learning to invest..etc..any key words on investing.|`|jjrv0jBJaa	If you really want to invest there are many good growth companies out there... but i would avoid the equities market completely and invest in Commodities like Gold and Silver or Future commodities. There are many good Commodity Indexes where you will get much better diversification. <br>  <br>  Go for Commodity stocks rather than Equity stocks. FOR Now atleast... Other than that.. if your looking for equity stocks for the LONG term (which should always be your investment strategy) look into Research in Motion, Google, Amazon, General Electric, Apple, Mcdonalds and Walmart|`|8c456045cd95aa9ef21373f9aaca9e17aa	When investing, realize that currently we are in a recession, so most of the stocks have been dropping, and will continue dropping for awhile. The next thing to know about the market, is that have a diverse portfolio will keep one from losing money. Example of this in 2001, when the last stock crash happened, the Dow dropped 38%, S&P 500 dropped 40%, and the NADQ dropped 77%. So having stocks in areas beyond tech stocks is definatly important. <br>  <br>  As far as where to go for studying, the library is the best source. They should have a periodical called Value Line. Value Line takes stocks, and divides them by the industry they are in. They also rate them according to their finincial strength, safty, and timeliness. Other things that they put are how they move with the market (the beta) and many other usefull numbers. So when in more of a speculative field like tech stocks, you can look at how they've been performing, and pick the safest ones. <br>  <br>  Another great thing to look for is divident yield. It will keep the stock prices from falling, and at the same time put money in your pocket.
ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	I don't believe that you an collect unemployment unless you have been laid of or fired. Many people study for their GED and work at the same time. I was wondering what you will do when you get your GED and job if your fiancee still wants you to stay home with her? She should be able to get along for a few hours while you work. Even if you do get unemployment it doesn't last very long. Unemployment is only designed to help people get along until they can find a another job.

Once he understands that he is going to lose you either way he should be willing to work with you and find another tenant.<br>  <br>  If he won't then your next step would be to consult a real estate attorney to see if there are legal steps you can take to be released from the lease. Some leases are so generic that the tenant can be released without damaging his credit or having an eviction on his record.

I assume you did not sign a promissory note, which legally binds you to pay back the money borrowed?  If that is the case, you can just stop paying your boyfriend and there is nothing he can do about it.  Or, when and if you break up, you get out of debt free!  <br>  <br>  If you believe you are lining your boyfriend's pockets over the interest you pay him, you could always go to a commercial business and get a loan.  Although you would be paying more from what you described.  At least with your boyfriend you know the money that is being made off of you isn't going to some corporate trip that costs millions of dollars for all the upper management.<br>  <br>  A lot depends on the amount of money that was borrowed also.

After bankruptcy there will still be a market for it even as there is now, but the market price will be much, much lower.  There are always those willing to take a gamble. As a part of the re-organization the debt holders will be issued common stock for their debt--new common stock--not the old crap that is currently being traded. Everyone who owned the old crap will be left with nothing.|`|Vh49zJjyaa	If GM declares bankruptcy, and then reorganizes and emerges out of bankruptcy, odds are, the common shares will become worthless once it or if it re-emerges out of bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  The common shares will be canceled once new shares are issued. If you are a common shareholder, you will not receive any new GM stock (if there is any).|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Current common stock owner will receive nothing.  Bondholders will probably only get a portion of their money back on the restructuring plan Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.

You will still be responsible under all the normal terms and conditions of the lease.|`|T8f8C3Tfaa	You will need to continue payments as usual or it will effect your credit and or lead to repossession of the vehicle.|`|sI3krJULaa	Nothing.  Car companies either contract out to a financial institution that actually holds the lease or has a separate company (a kind of subsidiary) that handles them.  If the company goes bankrupt, nothing will happen to your lease because it's not held with the company itself.  If they happened to use their financing arm to help in their bankruptcy, then the most that would happen would be that they sell the asset (your lease and the promise of future payments) to another financial institution.  The other poster is correct- you would still be liable for the original terms and conditions, even if this happened.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :0)

Student loans are considered "good debt" and are not supposed to hurt your credit (but should rather improve it) if you pay at least the minimum always on time.  The good news is that everyone is hurting right now and interest rates are down.  Check to see if your student loans are federal, if they are they're definitely eligible for consolidation (private loans, like SallieMae, are not).  Check out www.greatlakes.com for information, I consolidated one of my accounts through them.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are unable to pay your bills right now, ask for a deferment or change the terms of how you owe (meaning, if you have a 15 year loan change it to 25 and your monthly payments will go down).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|UFD4xcwjaa	Practically any type of loan can be wrapped into the debt consolidation process.

d754b3be3baefac8167410c09de8770faa	Since you had your interview last Friday and you've already made a follow-up call, then you should just wait until the next week and call again in the middle of the week. You always want to give yourself and the employer some space and breathing room to make a decision on who they want to hire. It's just the courtesy of it all. <br>  <br>  And as for the thank you letter, I believe you should wait on that thank-you letter. I say that because what if you write them a thank-you letter, deliver it to them, and they turn around and decide not to hire you after all? I'm not saying that they're going to hire or reject you based on a thank-you letter, but what i'm saying is you should wait until you get word that you REALLY did get the job, then go ahead and write the thank-you letter. Thank them for speaking with you about the position and let them know how much of a great asset you'll be.<br>  <br>  On the thank-you letter: This happened to me for a company i was interviewing for two years ago (Hertz). I had an interview one day, then the next day i followed up with a thank you letter to thank her for the time she took to talk to me. The next day, i got one of those "Thank you for your interest in our company, but....." letters. That was a slap in the face to me and i felt like I had just said "THANKS FOR NOTHING!" The mission is to find a job and nothing else! There's no time for the congenialness until AFTER you get hired! Bottom line!|`|xreWOKBYaa	you called yesterday or wednesday? wait till monday and call|`|AH7q8paDaa	I would wait at least another couple of days to follow up. Who did you interview with, HR or the hiring manager? <br>  Do you know the hiring manager's name? If so, call him/her directly to follow up. If you need the hiring manager's name, see if you can find it on LinkedIn or Google. That way you can bypass HR. <br>  Yes, write a thank-you note and get it in the mail ASAP. You could hand-deliver it, but it's less certain to be delivered promptly and to the right person.|`|ZdmR78idaa	i think you should call and be like not to be a pest or anything but can i talk to a manager to find out if i got the job and find out when i can start....|`|Q6W7vA3raa	No, don't call again so soon, you'll pester them and turn them off.

Also you could seek a tax professional who may be able to help you understanding why you have the debt.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, do not ignore this debt, because it will not just go away over time.

No matter what someone says to me, good or bad, what matters is their actions, not flattering talk. If they say they will call and they don't, then I learned something about that company, or that person, and how they operate. Do I still want to work there? Do I still want to date him? <br>  3. If I am not getting called back after interviews, I might not be making a very good impression. For example, am I most interested in what the company can do for me or in what I can do for the company? Employers pick up on things like that.<br>  4.

Take a photocopy of your letter and send it to your general council tax dept.<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion you need to go down there and give them an earful, that's the only way they will listen.

Did you contact the council as soon as you lost your income?

This would affect how much you owe by charging you full council tax for that period rather than a reduced rate.<br>  <br>  No council should be taking property without first exhausting every other option for you to pay.

If you can show on paper a fullproof plan on paper that shows how and when you will succeed, you can usually get approved for the loan even if your credit isn't too good.  I was going to buy a $400,000 business and I'm only 23, but the previous owner ran it will and I proved that I had the experience and the knowhow to keep it going, so they approved the loan.  I never actually got it though becasue the seller changed his mind.  This is in USA, I dunno how different it would be for you.

Once you get a break on your current job (little or big), call that company that called you and let them know you're interested. <br>  <br>  And another thing: I wouldn't be too worried about your present job finding out that you're applying for work at other companies. If they find out, that's THEIR problem, not YOURS! If they want to keep you on as an employee, then they need to give you more hours to work and increase your status from part to full time! PERIOD! You need money to pay your bills and keep food in your mouth and if you're not happy where you are, i don't blame you for wanting to switch! Then again, you know how the economy is. The conventional thing to do is to at least try to hold on to your job until something better comes. But i've been there too. I tried to keep a job until something better came, but it never came and keeping my job was just out of the question after a while.<br>  <br>  It's crazy out here. Keep your head up and pray for better days! GOOD LUCK!|`|0iYoPLGIaa	You can look for jobs online and it doesn't matter what time of day it is.|`|PId8YITnaa	depending on what state your in, yes unemployment will find out and they will cut you off until you re qualify for benefits... inform your pt employer that you need less hours for awhile, then use that free time to look...if they let you go down the road you will still qualify for benefits...i accepted job under the assumption that i would be full time in a couple weeks...it never happened...so i changed my availability.. now i can look for better work/money/environment...we have to be picky  when job searching and on u.e.  you really should not just take any job and then get screwed...

qThXH6djaa	The rate of inflation is higher than the benefit of putting money in the bank (i.e. inflation > than bank interest). <br>  <br>  Say you have $20. You can buy a $20 dvd with that money now. If you put that money in the bank for 5 years, inflation will have caused the price of dvds (and everything) to go up over that 5 years...so dvds now cost $22. You only have $20 in the bank so you can't buy them. Therefore money is affected by time. <br>  <br>  (Obviously this is a simplified example because dvds will have gone down in price what with new technology etc but you know what I mean I hope).<br>  <br>  I'm sure you can get two ways why its relevent to financial planning out of that.

qWaYbxcxaa	I'll bet you the remaining equity in Bank of America that you are being pulled into a scam.<br>  <br>  Further:<br>  1. Get AUDITED financials (5+ year tax returns, bank statements and verify this info with the IRS and with the banks).<br>  <br>  2. Get proof that the "owners" invested $4.7 million in the said mine, and they had that money in the first place, verify with the banks. Do they have money to continue the Op? If they are seeking money, chances are they do not. <br>  <br>  3. Take a look at the PPM - Private Placement Memorandum and what does it say exactly. If you don't have a PPM, run! A PPM is REQUIRED for private investments. Anyone who invests without a written prospectus or PPM is nuts. <br>  <br>  Sample of what a PPM might look like:<br>  <a href="http://www.seclaw.com/docs/ref/sampleprivateplacementmemorandum.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.seclaw.com/docs/ref/samplepri...</a><br>  <br>  4. What evidence can you show that PROVES "the mine will be operating profitable after 10 weeks of mining."<br>  <br>  5. Where is this company located? Corporate charter? Verify the officers and directors with the state records. <br>  <br>  6. Is the company a LP or LLC where the funds are being held? If no, run! And who is the General partner or manager? What do you know about their background?<br>  <br>  7. Have you reviewed the investment docs (PPM, etc) with a business attorney, CPA and financial expert who understands private placement investments? can you afford the risk of losing 100% of your money?<br>  <br>  8.

The cost of extraction and refinement are too great for a small mine to make a profit.  I suppose there might be an exception to that generalization, but don't count on it.|`|TfPDFmE7aa	Actually small mines can be extremely profitable if efficiently run. The type and depth of deposit are key factors along with the grade per ton - how much gold per ton of ore mined.<br>  <br>  Gold is at a very high price right now so if this business can't make money today, it never will.<br>  <br>  Now the bad news - if someone offers you a deal that is too good to be true - it probably is too good to be true.<br>  <br>  Unless you have a few million and don't mind loosing your shirt, trousers and pants, I'd give some thought to a safer investment. As a mining engineer I would want to see all sorts of test results to get an idea of the type and quality of deposit before I put in a penny.

RZzMse3Haa	First of all it is illegal to change the locks when you rent.  You needed to contact the landlord and have them do it.<br>  <br>  Irregardless of the locks having been changed- she needs to legally give you 24 hrs notice of any entry unless it is an emergency.  Her desperation to sell is NOT an emergency.  She is breaking the laws here.<br>  <br>  There is not much you can do about it though.  Most private landlords do not have a license and are not regulated.  If she was a licensed owner or property manager you could report her to the Real Estate Agency.  You can try reporting her to your local housing authority.  The most you can do is legally break your lease and move.  if she tries to take you to court then site all her illegal actions.<br>  <br>  Oregon Real Estate Agency website: www.rea.state.or.us This will have contact numbers to find out if she is licensed or not and to report her if she is.  This site also has the Oregon landlord/ Tenant laws for your general information.<br>  <br>  Feel free to e-mail me if you have other questions.  us Oregonians need to stick together!  :-)|`|YbP8WYKGaa	You have to provide a key to the LL as soon as you change it. Not in 2 days. On the other hand, the LL not suppose to break into your house and this is her fault.  Her son broke the door that you should demand her to repair immediately. Does she know you phone number? She should call you before showing the property. You both need to communicate more clearly to avoid all this mistakes.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Your permission is not required to allow entry into their property.<br>  <br>  It was illegal for you to change the lock and not provide a key.<br>  <br>  You can try suing, but unless you can prove the landlord is directly responsible and could have prevented the break ins you will be barking up trees.<br>  <br>  Almost all break ins are by people you know, you need to be looking there, this is not very likely to be random, but by someone YOU know.
ohOANFjFaa	That's not a bad idea.  But we have a liberal government now.  They don't like to reward hard work.  They prefer to reward NO work.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	i agree!|`|ug00j0S8aa	No I don't, for a couple of reasons.  <br>  <br>  One, for most of my life I was "salaried".  I didn't get paid overtime, but when I moved to that status I got a nice raise to make up the difference.  I often worked over 40 hours, however.  Why should I have paid taxes on all my salary if work over 40 hours was untaxed?<br>  <br>  Second, overtime pay is already better paid at time and a half.  There is already incentive there.  <br>  <br>  Third, it would make it even more likely that people would work overtime instead of having the company hire additional people.
kfvgkZ1saa	Like Dell there, I would be a little bit skeptical about the ability of one of those solar units to heat a sqimming pool in the UK.<br>  <br>  But, a good selling point I use with solar heating would be the lengthing of the typical swim season - where I am from, a pool without solar heating will be 26C (80 degrees F) May thru the first half of September.  With solar, you can  get 26C in March thru October.  When taking into consideration how much someone spends on a pool in the first place, they are usually open to the thought of spending a little bit more in order to use it longer.  Imagine if you only could drive your car 4 months out of the year - would you spend 20% more in order to drive it 50% more?<br>  <br>  Another thing you may want to look into is tax credit or some sort of governmental program for energy efficiency.|`|AA11537248	This seems like a thinly veiled commercial for the company, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.<br>  <br>  I would change the "No gas bill to pay" part to something like "reduced heating bills".  No solar system will be as powerful (BTU/watts-wise) as a gas/oil/coal system.  What if there's no sun?  Does the system still work?  Cover your backside.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	Do not even click on that link, or if you do don't listen to that.  It's a bullshit scam to fleece you out of your money.  And piss on the poster who posted it.<br>  <br>  What you need to increase your sales, is a good quality product, such as Tupperware (what you're currently selling).  It's a global recognized name, so you have automatic brand recognition.  Excellent choice!<br>  <br>  Have excellent presentation.  Wording in your ad, excellent layout.  Clear shipping costs, with no mark ups on shipping.  Offer combined shipping for your items.  Lots of pictures.  Pictures is what is going to sell your item.<br>  <br>   How to Sell on eBay<br>  <br>  Selling on eBay is as easy as going through a few steps. It's user friendly and can always be edited. Here's how you can sell on eBay. If there are any questions you can always go to the "Help" section of the site.<br>  <br>  Instructions:<br>  <br>  Step 1. Sign up. Assuming you haven't yet signed up yet, go to eBay's Main Pageand then click on register at the very top of the page to create an eBay account.   You will also need to sign up for a PayPal account.  Sign up for PayPal first, as it will take a day or so to complete the registration process for PayPal.<br>  <br>  Step 2. Build your account. It's a very good idea to buy a few things and pay immediately so that you will get some feedback ratings. (Don't buy things to resell, just buy things you'd buy anyway.) This will give you experience with the site and start to build up your "site cred". <br>  <br>  -Search eBay for items like those you want to sell. Read the listings. What sort of information or photos do you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer? What makes you think a seller is trustworthy? <br>  <br>  Step 3. Assemble the information you will need to place the listing. Usually this includes measuring the item, weighing the item so you can estimate shipping costs, and having your photos ready. <br>  <br>  Step 4. Log in and go to Sell either in My eBay or on the Main Page at the top. <br>  <br>  Step 5. Enter the title and description, after choosing a category. Be very detailed about your product, and include as many pictures as possible.  The more pictures, the better your item will sell.  Not including one will deter a lot of buyers from your item. <br>  <br>  Step 6. Continue to go through the options, and be sure to look everything over very carefully. There's a lot to look through and you'll want to make sure everything is correct.  Do not waste your money by opting for the "upgrades" for your listing.  In 10 years of selling, I have never upgraded any of my listings and have done great. <br>  <br>  Step 7. Double check everything before saving. Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the overview page) to double check and press submit. If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay. <br>  <br>  Step 8. Watch the auction. Once the item has been shipped, and they have left feedback for you, you should leave feedback for that person. <br>  <br>  *Tips*<br>  <br>  -Consider using a photo hosting service to add extra pictures to your listing for free.  If you use the ebay photo hosting service, the first photo is free, each additional picture is .15 cents.  I use Seller's Sourcebook for all of my listings.  I can choose from over 1000 different auction templates, add as many pictures as I want and I can even upload my listings to ebay from the Seller Sourcebook site.   Every one of my listings look very professional and I am proud to show my items using a professionally designed template.  Other photo hosting sites are Inkfrog and Photobucket.  There is a charge for Inkfrog, but Photobucket is free.<br>  -You need to have excellent feedback to sell well on eBay. <br>  <br>  -Sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback first.<br>  <br>  -As long as you follow the directions and press submit at the end, your product will be viewable to everyone.   It can take up to 12 hours for your item to show up under the general search.<br>  <br>  -Always answer a customer's questions promptly. Be clear, direct, and friendly. <br>  <br>  -Be sure to choose the correct category and keywords... the easier it is for your customer to find you, the better it will sell! <br>  <br>  -You will have to ship the product out on your own, so you're going to have to add shipping into the price; there's a section where you set the shipping. <br>  <br>  -You can always go back and edit it if you don't like something. Just go into "My eBay" and go from there.   Once a bid in placed on  your item, you cannot edit any information in your listing.  You can add to the description, you just cannot edit the main body of your description.<br>  <br>  -Keep good communication with your customer - they're interested in your product and you want to be ranked as a good seller in the end, so be a good seller! <br>  <br>  -Try and have it so your auction ends on a Sunday. Avoid ending auctions on Friday or Saturday when people are not home to bid. <br>  <br>  -Avoid using "reserve price" auctions. These auctions are a form of shill bidding where the bidders are bidding against the seller himself. A reserve auction makes some buyers angry because they have no idea what the seller wants. Instead, set the opening bid at the lowest amount of money you would be willing to sell the item for. <br>  <br>  -Help keep the feedback system honest by only placing honest feedback and avoiding the "trading" of positive feedback. A seller should leave positive feedback if the buyer pays promptly. A buyer should leave positive feedback if the item arrives in a reasonable time and is as advertised. A seller who waits for a buyer to leave positive feedback is really trading feedback. Such a practice skews feedback ratings.  Also, realize that a seller cannot leave a negative feedback for buyers any more.  So, ensuring that your description in your listing is honest and you ship on time, will help you maintain a positive feedback rating and keep your 30 day DSR stars in good standing.<br>  <br>  -People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, so include the shipping price in the total price (or min bid) and people will be more inclined to buy. If you offer it, make sure they know that you're offering it. <br>  <br>  -Packaging is also important. If items are fragile, improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers! Also keep in mind the price you pay for shipping: the box, padding, etc., to decide on a reasonable price or add it to shipping and handling fees.   Also, consider the possiblilties that can happen to your package.  Rain, sleet or snow.  Will the item that you are sending get wet in the packaging that you are using?  If so, wrap the entire item in plastic to prevent this from happening.<br>  <br>  -Payment will be vital. PayPal is the only form of payment available on ebay, and as a seller, you will want to understand how it works and sign up.  A seller cannot advertise these payment options:  checks, money orders and cash.  If you advertise that you accept these thype of payments, ebay can and will shut down your listing.  Now, if a buyer writes to you and offers a money order or check, you may want to consider accepting, since you will save 2.9% plus .30 cents per transaction.  <br>  <br>  **Warnings**<br>  <br>  -Do not sell illegal items. Doing so can bring heavy consequences upon you. <br>  <br>  -Negative feedback can lead to buyers cautious of you and makes sellers think twice about selling to you. Follow up any negative feedback with accurate facts. Do not call names. <br>  <br>  -Be careful when sending feedback. You can be sued for making dishonest statements on the feedback page, so keep in mind that you are responsible for your remarks. Keep it honest and professional, and above all, don't make childish and angry remarks. <br>  <br>  -Don't overcharge for shipping and handling. A reasonable amount for your materials and effort is okay, but buyers don't want to pay $15.00 for shipping and handling and then see on the postage label that it only cost you $3.85 for shipping. <br>  <br>  -NEVER put the starting price lower than what you can afford to lose by selling it! You need to consider the fees eBay, Paypal (if you offer a PayPal payment) and shipping. It is entirely possible to lose money on an item if you put a starting price that is too low for you to at least break even if only one person bids on it. <br>  <br>  -Be careful of selling overseas. Most items are perfectly fine, and can increase your bidding pool. However, what may be perfectly legal in the US may be illegal in New Zealand, Turkey, or Japan (or vice versa). <br>  <br>  -If an item is worth a large amount, you may want to take into consideration using a reserve price. This can prevent financial loss. This may, however discourage buyers on bidding or purchasing your product.  I do not recommend to ever use reserve price, because why keep your buyers guessing at the minimu price of the item.  What I highly recommend is starting bid or purchase price at a minimum of what you want for the item.<br>  <br>  -Do not ever make the following statement on your listing:  "I will not be held responsible for any item that does not have insurance, after I have shipped the item."   The plain fact is that you (the seller) are responsible for the item that you sell to get to your buyer in the condition advertised, regardless weather the item has insurance or not.  If your item sells for a fairly high price, you may want to pay for the insurance yourself.  But, always advertise on your listings that insurance is available to your buyer.  Sometimes, they may purchase the insurance for you.<br>  <br>  Hope you'll find the instructions above useful and have fun selling on eBay

AA10469473	I'm not sure you understand just what a refund is.  Through the year you might have money withheld from your paycheck for federal income tax.  At the end of the year, you prepare a form called a tax return to calculate how much tax you owe total for the year, and compare that to what was withheld.  If you had more withheld than your total tax, you get the extra back as a refund.  If you didn't have enough withheld, you have to pay the rest rather than getting a refund.<br>  <br>  How much total did the two of you have withheld?  You wouldn't get more back than that.  The tax you owe would be calculated and subtracted from what you paid in - any overpayment is then refunded.<br>  <br>  Unless you got back the total that you had withheld though, I'm surprised you got no benefit from the day care expenses if they were so you could both work.|`|ug00j0S8aa	It is not how much you get back, but how much you pay.  Your refund is only the extra money you gave the government above what you owed.  If you made $60,000, had at least $1000 in real estate taxes, and took standard deductions, your taxable in come is $60000 - 10900 (std deduction) - 1000 (real estate) - 17500 (5 exemptions) = 30600. The tax on that is 3791, but you have the 3000 tax credit, so your tax would be only 791.  Even if you made $70000, it would only go up to 2291.  You should be getting back all of your withholding above that.  <br>  <br>  Remember, your refund is your withholding minus your tax.|`|AA10604086	But how much did you pay in. Here is a simple formula.<br>  <br>  <br>  How much was withheld???<br>  now, subtract, What is yourt tax?<br>  The answer is, what you either owe or will get back!<br>  <br>  If you like the big refunds, then you both should claim single,zero withholding..|`|on9xLWegaa	You should be getting back $0 because if you're not, then you're taking too few exemptions.<br>  <br>  Run the taxes in Turbo Tax (free) just to see if everything is correct.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	The difference could be in the withholding your are having taken out of your paychecks.  Check the returns for the last couple of years and see if the federal income tax you are having withheld is going down.  This could account for a portion of the difference.  <br>  <br>  It is true that the more income you make the higher percentage of tax you will pay on the extra income.  <br>  <br>  You may want to go to another tax professional to have them take a look at this years and the past years returns to see if they were prepared properly.  They would look to see if the house expenses and the day care could possibly have been used.  They could also compare to see if the 2008 return could be changed to married filing separately, before April 15th,  to possibly increase your bottom line tax.<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

Leasehold is when you lease the space from a Landlord who owns the building. Business leases can be anything from 3 years to 15 years, and the rent can be increased every 3 years. A Lease will give you security which means as long as you pay the rent the Landlord cannot evict you. . When you sell the business you sell the lease with it. Most leases are Full Repairing and Insuring, which means you will have to pay for any repairs to the building. Rather unfair as it belongs to the Landlord but you are the tenant. ( I had to do this) Rent is on a weekly or monthy basis and you can be evicted and loose your business.

Let me make this very simple because this question appears often in various forms:  EVERYONE CAN FILE IF THEY WANT.  The ONLY requirements are that you have a name and that you be alive for at least part of the year.  You do not need to have income, a job, children, or anything else. <br>  <br>  Note that filing does not necessarily mean that you will receive any money.  It simply means that you are submitting the documentation of your income (or lack thereof) to the government.|`|on9xLWegaa	Just because you didn't work, doesn't mean you don't have income.

3d6794d74a14dfb92cf6530412b084abaa	Dude, you don't have to worry. "Rancho M" or "Rancho Market"? I live in Compton. First of all, have you ever been to Compton? If no, you would be suprised. Compton has good and bad parts. Yes some parts are almost like how the media portrays it;however, the majority of Compton is nice and clean. Not all the people in Compton are poor or involve in gangs. Dude, you are coming to Compton in 2009 not to Watts or South LA that's what you really need to worry about, they have projects we don't.. First of all, like in every other city we have really bad areas(reputation) and good areas(no reputation). I would tell you what areas, you should be not go. North Compton and the Compton Swaptmeet area, Other than that, you are safe. <br>  Check out our new shopping center, at 91FREEWAY and Alameda St, you would be surprised. Oh yes and I saw many new stores hiring, I think I saw Del Taco and Party City hiring. That is one of the "zero tolerance" area of Compton.<br>  <br>  P.S. Maybe this could make you feel better, President Bush use to lived in Compton.<br>  <br>  You would be fine!!!!!<br>  Welcome to Compton. <br>  Remember Bush lived in Compton aswell as William Hanna (Tom and Jerry, and The Flintstones)|`|GVlzdZKsaa	You are correct to be concerned.

U7nj9Kg4aa	Your best bet is to contact an insurance broker.  They will have access to multiple companies.  They may be able to find a company that is willing to take the risk.<br>  <br>  If they aren't able to find a company that will do it as standard or rated issue, then you need to look at Guaranteed Issue.  Be aware that these polices are quite expensive and have several exclusions (commonly: any claim within the first 2 years is automatically declined...AKA you don't get anything if the insured dies in the first 2 years).  Be sure that you understand what you are getting into with one of these policies.<br>  <br>  A broker will also be able to assess your situation and make a recommendation as to when your wife might be eligible to apply for a standard issue policy after a waiting period.  Every company has different rules surrounding the waiting period for insurability after a serious illness, etc.|`|48yMQt8Oaa	This is a huge problem for a lot of people. You might consider buying a couple small term life policies with no exam. They will not cover pre existing conditions right away but they will after you have had the policy for 6 mos to a year depending on the company. Go to one of the websites that looks for the best deal for you. Go for the smaller policies and make sure to tell the truth about what you are looking for. Some sites even have live chat where you can tell them exactly what you are looking for. <br>  <br>  Hopefully things will be changing really soon, President Obama told the nation Tuesday that "health-care reform cannot wait," and vowed "quality affordable health care for every American."<br>  <br>  A key to accomplishing this, Obama said repeatedly during his campaign, is eliminating preexisting-condition exclusions that deny coverage to countless Americans <br>  <br>  Also I don't know if you are working but if you are you might be able to add her to an employer policy. When workers receive insurance through their jobs, an insurer cannot exclude them from coverage, or charge more, because of a preexisting condition.<br>  <br>  <br>  You could also consider moving to a state where turning down a person for pre-existing conditions is illegal. I am not sure of the other states but New Jersey is one of a handful of states where insurers cannot deny coverage for preexisting conditions, or even consider them, when issuing an individual policy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little. good luck!
kifwyOgKaa	Um, ever heard of tax fraud?|`|N7G26k4Iaa	This is tax fraud and she will be fined and could go to jail.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	So, how come you didn't file your own return?<br>  <br>  Had you filed and claimed yourself and your daughter, the IRS would have investigated the duplicate SSNs fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  Where are you living?  If you didn't live with your cousin for the entire year, she couldn't claim you.  If you did live with her, you had to have less than $3500 of income and SHE had to have proof that she paid more than half of your support as well.  Same for your daughter.  If you had income of more than $3500, the IRS will flag the use of the SSN sometime around Fall (they don't have your W-2 yet).<br>  <br>  If your income was $0, then file the fraud form to get the ball rolling.<br>  <br>  If your cousin lied and said your daugher was her niece, she can expect first an audit, then to pay the refund back and may find that she is hit with fraud penalties.  The rules are clear as to the fact a niece and a cousin are not the same thing.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Unless  your cousin had a legal right under IRS guidelines to claim you and your daughter as dependents, your cousin has committed tax fraud. <br>  <br>  You should file your taxes like you normally would. You'll have to mail a paper copy of the forms because e-file will be rejected. Include a letter stating that you support yourself and your daughter and nobody else should have claimed you as a dependent. The IRS will send you your proper refund and then they will pursue your cousin for repayment of the amount she wrongfully got. <br>  <br>  You can't just claim someone because it gives you a bigger refund, you have to fall within the established guidelines.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	The only way a cousin is able to claim you and your daughters on their income tax return is if you live with them all year, they provide over 1/2 of your support, neither of you are qualifying children to anyone else  and you have gross income less that $3500.  If all these are true then the cousin would only be able to claim your exemptions, not any credits that go along with a child.  She would have no obligation to give you a portion of the refund.  <br>  <br>  If you believe you were claimed fraudulently, you are able to call the IRS to report fraud.  The number is 1-800-829-0433.  The only other way to challenge you being claimed by someone else is to file an income tax return yourself, claiming your daughters, and the IRS will intervene to make sure the proper person claims you and your children.<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	YOU cannot personally change another person's tax filing.

When you file, YOU claim all persons whom you are entitled to claim (including yourself, if neither your cousin nor anyone else was entitled to claim you), even if she has already claimed them.  AFTER you do so, the IRS will notice that you and your cousin claimed one or more of the same persons (for example, you or your daughter) and will look into the matter further.  If the IRS determines that you (and not your cousin) was entitled to the claim for the person(s) who you both claimed, then the IRS (NOT YOU) will remove the claim from her taxes and will require her to repay the money to the IRS (not to you).|`|AA10469473	I assume she didn't have the legal right to claim you.

If you are not employed and receiving help from the state then this could case a red flag at the IRS as they cross reference SS#'s w/those on public assistance.

K45ZTwryaa	I would strongly advise against it.  Generally speaking the paralegal job market right has been hit hard by the recession.  There is a surplus of unemployed, experienced paralegals now because of industrywide layoffs of paralegals.<br>  <br>  In addition, even in a good market, employers for entry level paralegal positions do not give much regard, if any, to certifications through an online course (there are no ABA approved online certifications fro paralegals)<br>  <br>  On the other hand nursing positions are in high demand accross the nation with staffing shortages in many hospitals.  It would be more worthwhile for you to invest your resources in taking whatever courses and certifications are necessary to get back into nursing.|`|3mAgM405aa	There is a great need for paralegals especially in the field of intellectual property and immigration law; not in litigation, real estate, business/corporate, family or probate law.<br>  <br>  The opportunities for a paralegal really depends on the specialty. The most in demand paralegals are those in the litigation field; followed by corporate paralegals who are responsible for maintaining corporate records, articles of incorporation, etc. While the "least" marketable [but the "highest" paid] paralegals are in the field of intellectual property [i.e., patents, trademarks] and immigration law. In conclusion, choose your paralegal courses accordingly, with emphasis on litigation preparation [discovery], docketing/calendaring of incoming pleadings [calendaring] and trial preparation [creating Exhibit tabs, Bajii jury instructions, etc.]. The "pro" side of a litigation paralegal is often "unlimited" overtime which can amount to a high salary range of $65,000 to $75,000 per year, while the "downside," being constantly pressured to meet a monthly client billable quota. And failing to meet that quota, often results in the paralegal's overnight dismissal. It's not a pretty picture. I just want to lay out what really happens in the real world of litigators and their relationship with subordinate paralegals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

I think they say the rule of thumb is your house shouldn't be more than 1/3 of your take home income (or pre-taxed?- not sure)...|`|VXcp8hvHaa	the question is "IF"|`|AA11173563	what I could comfortably afford with my other bills. Not one penny more|`|O8qdCBzLaa	How much you make would not affect how much I would spend on a home. But, it would affect how much you would spend.<br>  <br>  Figure that you can probably afford up to about 30% of your gross income in annual mortgage payments. That would be about $24,000 or $2,000 a month.<br>  <br>  Using a mortgage calculator (<a href="http://www.mortgage-net.com/calculators/mp_cl.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.mortgage-net.com/calculators/...</a> and plugging in various values, you can afford about a $335K fully amortized mortgage at 6%. With 20% down (about $84K), that means you would be able to afford about a $420K house.<br>  <br>  However, if you financed that down payment with a second mortgage, then the total amount you could borrow would be less than 335K, because a second mortgage would be at a higher interest rate. So, you're probably looking at closer to a $300K purchase price for the home.<br>  <br>  Of course, how much you could borrow and what your actual interest rate would be depends on your credit score and your debt-to-income ratio (if you owe a lot on credit cards, car payments, etc.).

Be sure to put that down as the reason for the termination of your employment.<br>  <br>  One option for your boss would be to allow you to phase in a work from home schedule where, if you stay with a friend, you work two days at the office and three at home.<br>  <br>  Finally, temp work.  Sign up asap in your new town with a temp agency.  With the economy, employers are aware that applicants are taking any job, just to have a job, and that the applicant will leave as soon as they find a more preferrable one.  As such, it is currently easier to get a temp to perm job.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wihrLsUKaa	Honestly it depends upon the company.

7B9a65xaaa	The interesting thing is that after you file bankruptcy your score will probably go up close to 100 points. typically from a 450 to a 550. The reason: you have no debt and 30% percent of your score is your debt to credit limit ratio, the lower the better. You would now be aa 0%. Don't be too excited though because a 550 sucks and you won't get any offers besides crappy credit cards with ridiculous monthly, annual and opening fees.The good news,  if you go open up 2-3 secured credit cards after bankruptcy  and pay those on time for the next 2 years or longer, your score will be in the mid 600's, still not great, but enough to possibly get a car loan at a not so hot interest rate, but at least you would be on your way.

qNVP4Q1Saa	I suggest that you mail your taxes in.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Let's see.  You filed MFS and included your income.  <br>  <br>  Later your husband efiled, filed as MFJ and since he didn't have the information, didn't include your income.  The efile and missing income are your proof that you didn't participate in the MFJ return and that he filed an "invalid joint election."  Write the service center, explain the situation and ask that you be removed from his return since you never consented to it.  (If you had, you would have provided the income information.)  (If he merely filed MFS and erroneously claimed your exemption--spouses are never dependents--this would be causing him problems, not you.) <br>  <br>  The problem if you don't, is the IRS may conclude that the MFJ return is the valid return and merge them together, adding in the income from your return.  This will invariably create a balance due situation and your future refunds would be taken to pay the debt.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	You need to respond to the IRS with all the details to resolve this issue.

The stimulus package includes a $400 or $800 tax cut that will be delivered in your pay check starting sometime around June.  Expect to see about $7 to $13 extra dollars in your pay check.

A restauarant, walmart, cvs, etc. Have your paycheck direct deposited into your checking account and then have a portion automatically transferred to savings before you spend it. Like if you get paid every Friday, then have it set up so every Saturday it transfers $50 or whatever to your savings account. Do not have the savings linked to an ATM card and just pretend that it's not even there. Do not take any out, pretend once it's in there, it's gone and you can't get it back (until a few years when you need to buy something huge) Don't waste it on a tv or seomthing, save for a new car or a house. I've been working and saving since I was 16 and I have a very good house downpayment account compaired to other people my age.

Buyer's and sellers will each do this separately at a scheduled time. AFTER both parties have signed everything the title company will take all the paperwork to the county records department and make the transfer of ownership official. This moment when the title company notifies the county records department is the moment when ownership of the house transfers, including all rights and responsibilities that go with it. Its common for this to happen a day or two after the parties sign the paperwork because a title company is typically open evenings and weekends, and they can take the info to the county records department until the next business day. <br>  <br>  The date that the title company notifies the county records department is the official sale date and considered the date the deal closed. <br>  <br>  When I bought my house I signed on the Friday before labor day, so I didn't officially and legally own the house until the following Tuesday, because that was the next day that the government offices were open.|`|91XVWCWWaa	First I hope you were told about homeowners insurance.

d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	In the US "everybody" has credit cards. There are highschool kids in my nephews class that have half a dozen cards (or more.) There was for a period an entire culture in the US that specialized in acquiring as many cards as possible, maxing them out and then just throwing them away. There are those who still brag about going for several years without making a single payment, who used as much as $100,000 of credit, and because they had no income which could be attached the courts gave them a slap on the hand and sent them home. These are more or less the same people who used to write bad checks all over town until they would actually be arrested, and again, because they had no reportable income they were scolded and released. Credit is ok to use in an emergency, but it's precisely that undeserved credit that has wrecked the entire world financial system, and now those of us who actually pay our bills are being forced to pay the bills of those who could care less, and indeed given the opportunity, would pull the same fraud again.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	In the US, you have to be 18 to get a credit card. <br>  <br>  This is because under US law, a minor (which is anyone under 18) can't legally be held to a contract.

MMQ7SdvDaa	3 months? the buying opportunities exist in nearly every sector. But the 3 month time line is the killer, daytrading is a bit like playing with fire.. <br>  <br>  I was watching Jim Cramer the other night and if you get a chance I'd recommend watching him. <br>  <br>  Cramer recommends a 15% portfolio content of some type of gold now. This is much different then where he and others were a even 6 months ago.. I've been long on a gold stock, EGO, bought at 2.00, now at 8.50, EGO is poised to go higher in the event our economy continues to suffer and gold becomes a safe haven when governments screw up currency as our FRB has done. <br>  <br>  I like EGO for a variety of reasons, their cost per ounce of production is below $300/oz. They have two very active operations, Kisladag, Efemkuru in Turkey and Tianjianstan in China. Even if gold hovers at $800 an ounce the ROI per share is very good. I see the potential for splits in the future. <br>  <br>  During recessionary times, look at standards, WMT, MCD, COCA COLA, VZ, HD <br>  Cash oriented rather then credit oriented companies over the next several months, Goldman Sacs in the Banking industry, MC, VISA, Morgan Stanley don't have the "credit problems" <br>  <br>  Conoco in the Energy Sector, <br>  <br>  <br>  Tech Sector is questionable at this time..<br>  <br>  Do your D&D, check out the pinksheets as well, one Penny play I am watching in the Energy sector is a long term play for me is OTCBB:CVAC, <br>  <br>  Clearview Acquisitions recently purchased "Helixwind" a viable wind energy development company, It is not the "standard 100' tall windmill, instead it is a building oriented windmill.. It is a single product play, in light of the current Administration's ideas about climate interventionism, This may be a good stock to watch as well.  Pink Sheet (OTCBB) are high risk plays. I don't recommend it for the weak stomach, and only a small part of the portfolio. <br>  <br>  Another Pink to look at is LUKOY, LUKOY — LUKOIL Oil Co.<br>  It is a Siberian oil/gas play. <br>  <br>  Another High Risk play is RTK,  I've watch RTK since 1996, Cramer has touted it off and on, the fundamentals of the company is good, but their real underdog product is CTL with the potential for long term energy issues it is one to watch. <br>  <a href="http://www.whsv.com/news/headlines/40240972.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whsv.com/news/headlines/40240...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If the "game" only allows, Amex, NASD, and NYSE stocks, I'd stick with EGO, MCD, WMT, COP, HD, MS, GS, RGR<br>  <br>  My long term hold plays are F, DELL,<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  Shorting the Market might be a smart thing to do as well..<br>  I believe it better to play things that run opposite the trend while other things are ticking down...

There are several reports out about how new enrollments, re-enrollments, and even attendance is up in all forms of advanced education.  I can vouch for this myself.  While I don't go to a brick-and-mortar school anymore (I already have 2 degrees and most of a third), I do sing in a professional choir that uses the facilities at the local community college for rehearsals twice a week.  After the first week or two of school, there's always no trouble finding parking, no matter what time you show up.  Now, you have to get there early- especially for the 7 pm class sessions- or you are flat out of luck.  And it wasn't a slight increase.

You can start with #1000 or #5000 no difference, even if you throw out the first 50 checks and start from there, the stores have instant access to bank information, so they know if the check is good or not.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question|`|AA11173563	yes every one knows it is a new account and check systems has no history and they are afraid it will bounce.

Writing a check for funds you do not yet have is absolutely not what checks are for.  That is called "kiting" and doing it knowingly is illegal.  A check is just a replacement for cash, like a debit card.  A grocery store can deposit a check the same day they receive it and most local businesses get same day deposits.  If the funds aren't there for a check written on Wednesday, it will BOUNCE on Thursday.  Banks ignore Post Dates anymore; you don't get to date a check in the future.<br>  <br>  Based on this misperception alone, I strongly urge you to find and attend a Dave Ramsey "Financial Peace University" course.

If you get lucky and one slips through, it will bounce, and you will pay $50+ in bounced check fees.<br>  <br>  Get yourself some training on creating a budget and have enough saved up for food on Wednesday.  And, do some google searches on eating cheaply.  $75 for three days' food is a lot of money for two people.

Try that, and see where that gets you.|`|C0whMHa9aa	because nowdays, most checks are presented electronically to your bank at the time you make the purchase.  if your shopping on wed, and the money doesn't go into the bank til friday--then the funds aren't there to cover the check.  they won't accept it|`|0rpS2b97aa	They use a check verification company that looks at history.
