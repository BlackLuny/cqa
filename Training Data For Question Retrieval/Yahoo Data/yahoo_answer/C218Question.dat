20090226193131AA4wxq2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to get my baby to eat more?	Do you find it weird that my almost 8 month old is not eating baby food?  She was eating it about twice a day until then she just stopped being hungry or something.  I have taken her to the doctor but she didn't seem to concerned.  She did do blood work to see if she was dehydrated(she was not) and to check her blood count.  She has lost a little weight, only about an ounce in the last 2 weeks and she does have to go back next week to check her weight.  Her doctor said that she has to have at least 24 ounces before she gets baby food.  Usually I have been lucky if I get 18 ounces down her, and that is WITHOUT baby food!  Anyone else find that odd?  I guess I just figured she should have a better appetite.

My daughter is starting kindergarten this next school year and she is my oldest so this is my first time doing this. I want to know what kind of questions to ask her teacher so that I know that they are a good teacher. My parents never really cared that much about my education and I was a drop out. I did go on to get my GED but it's always something that I wish I could go back and change, so I want to be very involved in my children's education and make sure that they get the best possible education that they can. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

She told me she had cancer and her kids were too young for her to die (9 weeks & 22 months) She starting to cry  and I didn't know what to do. We got to talking about breast feeding and she started crying again because she might have to stop for chemotheraphy. She was only 28 years old.  This makes all the drama I'm having at work with the crazy co-worker who thinks it's stupid of me to take my daughter's 1st b-day off so in return she's going to request her dogs b-day off not a big deal. I hope my weekend is going to be a little better and I'm sick to top it off.

Okay i am on the pill yaz and have taken it a day late a few times. I had unprotected sex on january the eleventh and my partner ejaculated inside me. i had a withdrawal bleed on january the seventeenth like i was supposed to. A few weeks later i had some light spotting and i was told it could be implantation bleeding and i could be pregnant because the egg wouldn't have implanted for a few weeks. I had another withdrawal bleed on february the 13 but it was unusually light. Lately i have been experiencing abdominal cramps, bloating, gas, pimples (i never get pimples) headaches, tender breast and nausea i even threw up one morning. I don't think i am pregnant but everyone else does...i took three pregnancy test all negative but i have been told sometime only blood test can tell. My doctor won't give me a blood test cause she trust urine test. I feel stupid bringing this to my doctor because i have had what seemed like a period. I don't care rather i am or not i just want to know something. Thanks!!

Starting Monday, when I go to the bathroom and wipe there have been clearish, greenish mucus like globs and I have been having more fluid like discharge.  When I was pregnant with my son I never had this happen.  The doctor said that by doing the internal exam everything looks and feels fine but hes running the tests to make sure.  So my question is...have any of you experienced anything like that and was anything wrong or was it normal?   I am almost 14 weeks and this is my 3rd pregnancy, including 1 miscarriage.

20090226200032AAqabQv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My dad knows that I am a vegan, and yet he is annoyed that I won't eat a non-vegan dinner. What's his deal?	I've been a vegan since last summer. My parents are very, very well-aware of that fact. I'm totally fine with buying my own groceries, and I've offered several times to do so. The last time I got all these groceries from Whole Foods, my dad just said to make a list of what I wanted next time and he'd get it, and so that's what I've done. Tonight he got this vegetable lasagna dish from this restaurant that just makes vegan & vegetarian food. I've been there a billion times, and I know that the lasagna isn't vegan, it's just vegetarian. It has cheese in it! I get that he was trying to be nice, and that's awesome, and I told him thank you and I said that I was really appreciative but I couldn't eat it, and he became upset. Then he wanted to know what I was going to eat, and when I said that I actually wasn't hungry because I had a very, very filling smoothie after dance practice, he went berserko. I mean, yeah, if the lasagna had been vegan, I would have had some, but I'm honestly not hungry. He's actually mad about this. I offered to just sit there at the table with them, and he told me to just go to my room. What is the deal? I mean, why should he be upset? What am I not getting here?

20090226200446AAC67Sy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you feel like you are different from older moms? Or even younger ones?	I know this is kind of a strange question. I am just asking it because I feel like I am the young mom out of my son's preschool class. Well, there is one that is about 26. I am 23, and my oldest son is 5. Anyway, when I am in public or around the parents in the class, I feel so different or set apart from the other moms that are older. I know that is so weird.       But, for moms that are older- mid 30s or so, I just feel like the only thing we'd share in common is our kids. I have spoken to a few at birthday parties for our kids, but it just seems like there'd be no way we'd ever enjoy a day out together due the age difference and lack of common interests/personality. And, it's not like I am a little girl that just needs to grow up. I am about to graduate with my degree. I just think it is a difference in generation.      My generation was the first to grow up playing video games, so I still love to do that, the music I listen to (unless it's classic rock), most older women probably wouldn't... Let's see.. just in general, I feel different from older moms. Anyone else relate?

Fluffy back there is jinxing me or something.

Idk.   -My iPod brand headphones broke and I had to get some cheapy ones.   -I'm sick.       It just seems like everyday everything is harder than it seems.   Ex: Going to 2 stores for apple headphones and both being sold out. WTF is that about?! really when does that shyt actually happen?      This type of thing has been going on ever since I moved.    I had to redo classes because my creds didn't transfer HS's.   I got altitude sickness within a week of moving.    A horrible haircut right before going to the hospital for altitude sickness.   Months later mono and missed a semester.   Had some summer school.         Had to do over most the semester.   Failed a few classes due to completely breaking down.   Had to do another semester after senior year.    Failed a final.   Had to do a class over break.   (All in a two year period.)      And the everyday frequent and unnesscessary complications I endure.       Isn't it a little much?   Isn't this just suppose to be a rough patch in life or something that should end soon?      I equate my back luck to a terminal illness(neverending), while other bad luck is like a cold(comes and goes).

20090226202111AAsKtub	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do you ask a toddler if they are having nightmares?	My two year old really hates bedtime. Naptime, whatever, if she has to lay down in her bed and try to sleep she gets really upset. Her room is done in pink princess stuff, there are pictures of her family everywhere, and there's a canopy over her bed. I can't think of anything right off the top that would be scaring her. She fusses before she sleeps and I have gotten used to that but the past few days she has been waking up pale and sweating. She screams and screams and won't stop until she lays with me or her Dad. It really seems to me like she is having bad dreams. What would cause bad dreams in a toddler? She is really terrified when she wakes up and it takes 15-20 minutes just to stop the tears. It's heart breaking. I ask her if she is having bad dreams or nightmares and she doesn't answer-I don't think she understands. Lately she has been talking about 'dreams' and I think it's this Goodnight Moon video I got her, but there's just a few minutes of kids talking about flying dreams and stuff like that. No nightmares. Please help.. I feel so bad for her.

20090226201649AAb4lDq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should keep my unborn's so called father updated?	he left us and clearly stated that he doesn't want the baby but agrees to pay child support (doesn't make any sense to me). so i was wondering if i should update him on my unborn's info? I've got my amniocentesis results back and the baby is normal *cheers* should i keep him updated? i've told the grandparents (his parents) that the baby turns out to be normal and im pretty sure they've told him too but i haven't gotten any calls from him. i've called him a couple times and he didn't bothered to answer.. so i honestly see no need to keep him updated.       but, im planning to sue him for child support so could he use this against me if i dont?
20090226201541AAQK3Eg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	This is more of a fun ultrasound question..?	We had our 20 week ultrasound today and we are having a girl.  My husband was just in awe looking at the screen.  It was pretty neat!  She turned towards us (this was just a 2D, not a 3D or 4D scan) and I looked at her thinking "that bone structure looks like my husband's did as a baby."  I never said anything but later he told me he was thinking the EXACT same thing.        So we don't know if we're crazy, but did anyone else have this same experience.  I look at other people's 20 wk scans (just googled 20 week ultrasound) and they definately don't all look the same.  It's so cute to see a resemblence so soon, I look forward to a 3d scan later on perhaps.

I have given her puree'd avacado and puree'd carrots, both mixed with breastmilk. Im not too sure why this made her so constipated, but she is. She is really straining to take a poo, and she only is pooping like every 3 days or so, and when she does its hard and formed like rabbit poo. Ive tried giving her some baby apple prune juice 2 days ago, but it hasn't seemed to help. I was looking for some natural remedies or something to soothe her, because I really want to hold off on giving her a suppository.

20090226195906AAnw6Xx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it possible for me to be pregnant?	So my boyfriend and I had unsafe sex on February 15th and on February 18th. We used the withdrawal method and he was no where near ejaculating when we stopped having sex. After having sex on the 18th, I took the Plan B within 24 hours. Just today (February 26th) I bled for a couple of hours and I am not due for my period until around March 13th.      I called a hot line and the lady told me I am having an early period because the Plan B contraceptive pill throws off menstrual cycles. Now I do not know what to think. I am not having any other issues such as fatigue or sore breasts yet because it has really hasn't been long.      So my question is...was I pmsing or was that implantation bleeding? And how soon can I take a home pregnancy test or a blood test at a clinic to get accurage results?

It seems like a lot of perverts stalk the women's health section, so this must be a safe bet.

It's been one of the most stressful months of my life.      All day, I have been VERY emotional. It's not like PMS where I'm just b*tchy. This is...

20090226205151AAzMbxS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you find that you struggle with most when it comes to parenting?	I think I struggle with consistency with discipline. I am getting better, but  with my 5 year old son (ha! 5 year old son says it all), I just give in sometimes. I know that's bad.... But, my husband is definitely not the one to give in, so when I say, "I'm calling Dad," he FREAKS!      Also, I think one thing that I screw up on is sometimes putting my own interests ahead of spending more one-on-one time with my oldest son. Like, sometimes a TV show that I REALLY want to watch will come on, so I just watch it rather than read to him. I know we're not all perfect, and that's fine.      One other: sometimes I yell. I hate doing that, but I do.... I just get impatient and tired of repeating myself and him trying to push my buttons and see how far he can go without getting in trouble. I know he knows what he's doing, and he knows that I know that he knows what he's doing....haha.. so..... anyway, I need to improve.      I honestly think that these struggles are pretty minor compared to some others.. What about you?

My almost 4 year old daughter is in a gymnastics class. Her dad signed her up and paid for it. It was her first class, her dad, his girlfriend and my daughter were at the gymnastics facility and I came to watch (I was invited by her father, as I should have!) They were int eh waiting area and I came in, sat down and my daughter saw me, came over and climbed on my lap to say hello. Classes start and she doesn't want to join, typical, i was expecting this. She only wanted me to go with her. Her dad got mad and threw a fit because he paid for it blah blah blah. Anyways, i get her to participate and convince her to let her dad help her because he was angry. In the midst of this commotion, his girlfriend has the audacity to yell at me in front of everyone that I was not welcome there!!! What would you have done?! I didn't do anything, just looked really pissed im sure. LOL. Opinions?!
20090226204022AAqxisZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Stressed About Breastfeeding?	Mya is 3 weeks old now and I'm confused about 'scheduling' her feedings.       -Every nurse I've talked to says to feed her everything 2-3 hours during the day, and not to let it go longer than 4 hours. So I have to wake her up to feed her, otherwise she'd sleep a lot longer inbetween feedings.       -So many women on here say 'NEVER wake up a baby to feed them'. That they will wake up on their own when they're hungry.      What should I do?? Today Mya ate at 2:15pm and then I tried feeding her a little after 5:00pm, and she ate for about 3 minutes and fell asleep. It wasn't just a light sleep, it was a deep sleep and I didn't want to wake her up. She woke up hungry at 6:30pm so I fed her, but then she got hungry again at 7:30pm and then again at 9:30pm.      What are you opinions on feeding. Should I wake her, or feed her when she wakes up on her own?

I'm 32 weeks, and that is my biggest craving.  My baby is going to be really sweet.  I don't know if it's going to be a girl or a boy.  I don't want to know, and my husband wants it to be a surprise also.
20090226210036AAxrNkl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Experienced Momma's: Why isn't my 10 month old sleeping through the night?!?	My daughter will be 10 months old on March 6th and her sleep schedule is all outta wack and it is stressing me out. I feel like I am doing something wrong or else she would be sleeping through the night right?       So she usually goes down at 7pm (we have tried putting her to bed later but it doesn't work, she is really tired at 7pm even with a 4pm nap). So she will get up around 8:30pm and won't go down without a bit of milk- even 3 oz. So tonight I gave her a bit of milk at 8:30pm and she was up again at 11:30pm wanting more.       Honestly, I tried NOT giving it to her and she was up for HOURS. 2 night ago she woke up at 1:15am and I told myself, I am not giving her any milk even if I am up all night. I cracked at 3:30am... I couldn't believe she stayed up that long. So for the past few months off and on, this will happen where she wakes at night.       Is it normal for a 10 month old to be waking at night to eat? I have tried letting her cry, I have tried not feeding her, I've tried rocking her, I have tried only giving her water, but nothing else will put her to sleep unless she gets her bottle. What am I doing wrong? I feel like she will be doing this when she is 3 years old lol.      She is eating 6oz's 4 times a day excluding these bottles at night. Could she be needing MORE during the day and that is why she is waking at night? If I give her 8oz per bottle could this help?

Hi I just gave birth to a beautifull healthy baby boy, I had premature rupture of membranes, and 18 hours later they induced me with a syntocin drip.  At its peak it was running at 24ml hour and i was begging for an epidural, i felt I had no warning as the drip was turned from 12 to 24 and at 12 i was managing (just) at 24ml hr i instantly felt out of control and panicked, ( not how i wanted things to be).  I am just wondering if anyine out there has delivered with and without the drip and what the difference was for them.

I may be worrying for nothing, but since I am on bc my periods are very accurate and I missed my period today and I've been checking for spotting but nothing.

Im not too sure what to expect. Ive already looked at videos of them on youtube and read about them, but that does not tell me what they are like to be with for long hours at a time.       As I understand all children are different, I am hoping parents could tell me how their 18 month old is or was (if they are older now).      How often and when did they sleep?   Were they picky eaters?   Are they into everything?   Do they still eat everything?   Are they old enough for fun crafts? If so, which ones?    How much can they talk?    How fast can they walk/run?    Do they like to play together or alone mostly?   Can they climb stairs?    Is this a good time to start potty training?    What kinds of things are they ready to be taught?    Anything else? demeanor? tantrums? favorite activities and toys? etc.       Pretty much anything you think I should know, like for their safety, entertainment, and educational purposes. I want to be a great nanny for this child so I need to be educated. Thanks!

20090225122102AALpFb6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Tiredness problem..............?	My daughter is 20 months old. Until the last 10 days she would go to bed at 7pm and wake up about 7.30-8.00am next morning. Then have a morning nap at about 9.00 for two hours. Then she's stay awake until bedtime.      Over the last 10 days she's been waking up at normal time and having her 2 hour nap at 1.00 instead.  This time change is because she is no longer tired in the morning.      Now though by 5.30 -6.00 she's really tired and has dark circles under her eyes. She's also really moany with me because of the tiredness.      So, why is she so tired so early when she's having her normal sleep in the day and night?      If it helps, she eats and drinks well as always. Isn't teething or ill.  We go out most days int he morning.

20090225122804AAAbTU6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Weird Pregnancy Conundrum?	Ok.      So I've got a strange strange issue going on that started happening when I turned six months pregnant (about two months ago).      If I don't have sex (and orgasm) or masturbate right before bed then I pee in the bed in the middle of the night.  I know that sounds odd, but I swear it happens every freaking time!      I took me about three weeks to see the pattern, but I figured it out, and over the past four weeks I've just done what I've had to do right before bed.      So last night I decided not to do it and whadda ya f'ing know, I pee'd in the bed again.  GAH!!!      So, simple solution.  Just keep doin what ya gotta keep doin, right?      Well, here's the problem.  I live in an urban studio apartment.  No doors at all except on the bathroom.  So there is VERY little privacy and my parents are coming on Friday night while my husband is out of town.      There's no way my dad will let me sleep on the sofa, so its going to be me and my mom in the bed, and he'll be on the couch.      So I was thinking, well damn, what am I going to do?      I'm eight months pregnant.  I can't exactly slip off quietly into the bathroom.  First, I don't think I can get comfortable enough on the toliet to do it.  Two, getting in and out of the bathtub quietly is going to be a real problem, especially with two parents worried about your every move.  Three, I'm not sure I can explain the need for a shower at 11:00 at night and I don't think I can do it st

20090226211240AADfI4h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Help trying to figure out Ovulation?	OK so I think I may have the most irregular periods ever trying to figure out when I ovulate seems almost impossible. Let me back it up a bit so you can better understand. When I was younger like 11 AF came regular at the very beginning of the month like the 2nd or 3rd.Then when I turned about 15 sometimes it  would come at the very beginning of the month like 2nd or 3rd and sometimes it would come at the end of the month like 29th and carry over until the beginning of the next month. Now just recently last December when I started TTC I didn't get AF at all and I thought I was pregnant but after 8 test (5 of which didn't work and 3 came up negative) I just assumed I wasn't pregnant even though I had a whole lot of other symptoms (tired, sore breasts, nausea, cramps etc...) Then in January around the 6th or 7th AF comes and last about seven days the normal for me. Then two days later she comes back and last for like two days and is gone.Then now that it's February she hasn't come at all and I have been having sex regularly as I'm TTC but since I have such irregular periods it's kind of hard to determine when I ovulated.       Any one else have a similar problem???       Any ideas as to what I should do???

My 2 year old boy seems to have periods of absolute inconsolable tantrums where he kicks and screams on the floor for no apparent reason. There is nothing that seems to calm him down in these situations. He will finally stop once he starts to hyperventilate. Also he has this thing with screaming when you tell him not to do something. It is my first child so I don't know if it is just a phase, but is there anyone with similar experiences that has any advise on how to get it under control?

20090226204035AAVQoIE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Why is my daughter fighting sleep?	My 27 month old daughter recently has decided to kick her night time routine out the door.  Until her second birthday, we used to get her bath in at 7:30pm, in her pj's just before 8pm with her teeth brushed, read for about 30 minutes and she would be out by 9 or 9:30pm.  These days, even though we wake her up at 7am, she will not go to sleep until well after 11pm.  She will fight, scream, cry, kick, just to get back on the couch for a few minutes and than try to play and color.  The lack of sleep is causing me to become depressed.  How can I get her back to her routine??????????

20090225122334AA9Jyuf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	15 month old sleeping alot.....is this normal?	My 15 month old normally goes down around 7:30/8 and wakes around 6:30ish.  During the day she is taking one nap for about 2 hours.  Last night she went to bed at 6:30 and slept straight through until 7:30 this morning.  Today, she went down for a nap at 12:30 and 3 hours later is still napping. She normally doesn't sleep this much.  She's not sick, doesn't have a cold, eating fine, not teething.  I know, I should thank my stars that she is sleeping so well and my gutt tells me she wouldn't be sleeping if she didn't need it and I'm not about to wake her up. I'm just wondering is this normal?  Did you other moms go through this at times?  It's just so unlike her and this being my first little one, whenever she does something out of the ordinary, I wonder about it.   Did your child do this around this age?  Thanks!

When she takes a nap or goes to bed at night she always gets a sippy cup with milk. She is getting older now (19 months) and wets her diaper more at night which sometimes leaves me to changing her bed sheets a few times a week.

20090226202019AAydeLU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	2 year old "behavior problem"?	I am a young  mother (21) to a 2 1/2 year old. He is my only child and I had a very high risk pregnancy. I was induced and baby was carried off to NICU because he has a minimal breathing problem. Anyhow, he has a VERY BAD temper. He has recently started throwing fits and hitting me in my face and trying to pull on my hair. I feel spanking or punishing will not work for his age but I am unsure as to how to deal with his attitude. I have tried timeouts and putting away his toys. I also have tried talking to him and explaining but I honestly feel he just doesn't understand. He is a little behind in the developmental department so it hurts me even more to "punish" him. My family and fiance say I should just spank him and I am too overprotective of him and let him do what he wishes. I am honestly confused as to what approach will work with him and I do know I am a big softy with him but it is my child and well I am lucky he is even alive  [I know this has a lot to do with my attitude towards him] The doctors I work with all have different opinions so I would like to hear how you deal and make sure I do the best for me and my son.      Thanks for reading and any help is greatly appreciated.

One of my best friends has a baby about 2 weeks ago, and she is not producing any milk, her doc. said that she was not going to produce breast milk.

20090226205150AA6GiMc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Im starting my new nanny job on Monday. I will be spending half of the day with an 18 month old?	And the second half of the day will be spent with the 18 month old and a 6 year old. The Mother is a SAHM but she will be working most of the time I am there in her office.    I like to be regulated and everything so I am thinking about making a schedule  (not a rigid one) for our daily activities. I am also thinking about putting together my own nanny log. The schedule will take a week or so for me to figure out, because I will need to see what the children are like before I attempt to make one, but I was thinking about showing up with a nanny log that I would have already made.       My first thought was that doing this may impress the mother, but once I got thinking about it I think it could be too much, and not neceserry if the mother will be home all day. Even though she will be working the whole time, she will still  be there. So.. do you think its necessery or too much? Also, do you think my schedule idea is too much for children those ages? It would be a fun schedule of course
20090226191952AAPLZSP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	How to go about adopting?	My wife and I want to adopt. We're recently married, but we live in Florida now.      We've both had serious talks about whether or not to adopt a baby, (or a child.) He or she would probably be the age of 3 or so, I mean, its not really specific at this point, and we both need a lot of guidance first I realize, on how to raise a child. But anyways, I'm saying that we'd like kids, but realize that now isn't the right time for us to adopt, but I told her I'd ask around and get some general info, so here I am =].      Right now, I just want basic information on how an adoption agency works and how much it costs, or any requirements etc. Or anything else I'd need to know.       We want to adopt because there are a lot of children without a good home, and I think its really the best way for us, (or I should say we think it is).      As I said, I just need the basic info, as it might be a few years before we're able to afford a new house and living space (enough for a backyard for our child to play in and a dog =] ) but I kinda am curious as to how it works and whatnot.       Thanks for your answers!      (Also, please don't use this as a place to flame, or preach your beliefs. I'm only asking for basic info on adoptions from people who have adopted. This is not the place to rabble out your religious or moral views, take it to the political section for that please.)
20090226212418AALbwxs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	If my last cycle was 27 days and  it's now been 30-31 days and  no period, am I late?	I had 2 periods last month and it was a 27 day cycle. It's now been 30-31 days and I haven't gotten my period. So this means I'm late right?   About 2 weeks ago I started getting some uncomfortable cramping in my stomach and lower left stomach. 3 days ago I got a little sick at my stomach half way through breakfast but nothing since. The only change in appetite is that I don't really want any sweets. No stress, no diet change, nothing differnt. Does this sound like pregnancy? When can I take a test? I know that no one can tell me for sure, all I am asking for is opinions and advice.    I have a First Response Pregnancy test but I didn't want to waste it if it is to soon.

20090226213052AAIjO7z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Could it be another ear infection?	My 13 month old son had a virus a few weeks ago that caused him to have a lot of drainage. The doctor said the drainage backed up into his ears and caused double ear infections. They gave me lots of meds and he took them all just like prescribed. Now he will place both hands over the top of his ears and just yell. I can't tell if this is just a "goofy" new trick or if they hurt. Plus he has been a little more cranky here lately but it may be a new tooth, I don't know. My insurance changed over the last few weeks so now it is no longer as easy or as cheap to go to the doctor like it used to be. So I'm trying to figure out what are the symptoms to an ear infection to see if I need to take him into the doctor? He has no fever. Thanks.

She has decided not to have a c-section and has found an ob-gyn who is willing to deliver her baby, even if it doesn't turn around and is breech. She said he delivers 20-30 breech babies a year, but I'm still so concerned about the possible risks. I always was under the impression that a breech baby meant an automatic c-section. Does anyone know how dangerous it is? My friend doesn't seem to be aware of any dangers whatsoever.

Earlier, while my 16 month old daughter was sleeping I noticed this pea sized little knot behind her ear. It wasn't on her ear, it was on her head about half way up behind her ear. It was hard too. I couldn't feel one on the other side, and I felt behind her twin sister's ear, and couldn't feel nothing. She hasn't had any shots in a month and she hasn't really been sick. Last week she was coughing but that was it. What do u think this could be? Should I be worried? Should I call the doctor and just see what they say or wait it out or what? I'm just not sure what to do or how worried I should be! Thanks for all advice.

I am still a virgin (no vaginal penetration) but I have a boyfriend and we have done some sexual things and his penis has been near my vagina.  However, he has never ejaculated near my vagina.  We did fool around about 4-6 weeks ago (and haven't done so since then).  Is it at all possible that I am pregnant?  I have a bit of a raised temperature (99.3) but I haven't really gained that much weight.  No nausea, or breast tenderness.  Part of me wants to take a pregnancy test; but I would rather not buy one if there's a slim to none chance that I am pregnant.  Thanks for the help.

20090226214112AAP9yjC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How do I find a sperm donor without paying a ridiculous amount of money through a sperm bank?	My Husband and I have been trying to conceive for years on end.  The doctor has run tests on both of us, and I am ideal for pregnancy.  My Husband, however, has a extremely low sperm count that is irreversible due to a illness he has had since he was a child.  The doctor believes we won't be able to conceive on our own without IVF (if we use his sperm).  The doctor suggested a donor and doing the insemination in office.  The procedure is going to run us around $2000-$4000, and with the economy nowadays, there's no way we can afford that, and prepare for a new baby.  He also suggested at home insemination with a donor we both know (cut out the sperm bank cost, and doc. cost)  I just don't feel comfortable soliciting men for their sperm.  I want a healthy baby, and don't want to contract any STDs in the process.  Any thoughts?  I'm desperate at this point!

20090225133310AAYxfM3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why do young girls post pictures, get pregnant?	I am 19 and new to this Yahoo Answers thing, but I have seen countless questions by YOUNG girls asking if they are pretty, to be rated, and girls as young as 12 saying they are pregnant and don't know what to do... my question is WHY do these young girls ask such things? As for the whole post a picture & ask to get rated... Is it for attention? Do they not feel pretty? Why do some post sexual pictures? Thats just not right, its pretty gross actually they all are KIDS for crying out loud. As for the "IM PREGNANT @ 12,13,14,15" where are the RESPONSIBLE parents? half of them don't know who the father is or they don't want to be with the father.  when I have kids I fully intend to tell them what a whore is, and hope they dont come to me a CHILD themselves and say "Im Pregnant". MOST of these young girls can't even spell!!! I am 19 with NO KIDS & starting Med. School soon I think it could be in the way kids are raised... I mean whatever happened to Barbies? I know they started looking like whores.    What do you all feel?

I haven't really heard from the teaching institute lately and out of no where I got a call today saying that they'd like to set up an appointment with me to see if they would like to hire me. I told them that I am not so sure about the job because I am getting farther along in my pregnancy and I feel as if there's no point because I will quit around the time I give birth. The lady seemed very mad and hung up on me... Would you still try to get the job if you were in my position or would you just turn it down? Oh and yes I did tell them when they offered me the job that I was pregnant and they were still willing to work with me...

20090225123836AAk0h8o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Why would someone say something like this?	Well, I'm just wondering right now why complete strangers are so hateful sometimes?

What the heck does that mean? Did it not cross her mind that perhaps I WANT to be pregnant? I cursed the minute my HPT was negative. Of course, I took it apart, tilted it in every direction and imagined my faint line... but, we all know AF will be here for me anytime now.       Anyone else have negative experiences about TTC?

I honestly dont understand why she is doing it, we will be sitting and eating and all of a sudden she will just start screaming or she will burst out and yell at the top of her lungs, how can we correct this? my wife just taps her mouth with her fingers and says NO, but I know that probably does nothing. I am up for any suggestions here. Thanks!

I don't know when I'm supposed to get my period so I'm a little nervous. I kinda feel moody and i'm breaking out a lot, but this is all stuff that happens before I get my period. I have been getting craps a lot lately too. Are their any signs of pregnancy at 4 weeks? Can a home test tell me if i'm pregnant or not?

We were having intercourse and some of his seamen ended up on my vagina. We tried wiping it but instead might have gotten some inside.   I hurried to the doctor and picked up some Plan B.   I took it correctly RIGHT after this accident so it was within the 72 hour time slot.      My cycle usually comes on the 20th   It's late (its the 24th)      I know plan b and mess up your cycle but how late can it make it?   Should i be horribly worried?

20090226200252AALkFcq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm pregnant with my ex boyfriend's baby.?	I'm 20 years old almost 21 and I just found out that I'm pregnant with my ex's baby.   We broke up 4 months ago... we have friends in common and we were invited to this party, we got drunk and we ended up having sex that day (while being drunk) the whole situation is kinda messed up since the break up wasn't good... and I'm still not over it.   When I took the pregnancy test I decided not to tell him but ask him if he came that day inside of me and he said he was 150% sure he didn't, that was enough for me to not to count with him, I wanted him to be part of the decision of keeping it or not to.. but I decided to take it myself if I decide not to keep it and he finds out is there anything he can do against me since it was his baby too?

Since I was having cramps 2 weeks ago (I always get cramps weeks before my period) I thought there was no chance.  Although I am very happy with the news (and I know my husband will be ecstatic when I tell him), I am worried because we have gone out many times since my last period and have had MANY social cocktails.  Beer.. wine... even a shot of vodka last week to celebrate a friends birthday (ugh) - and this morning I had the biggest cup of coffee ever and had such a caffeine rush.

I was out of time on what was considered my most fertile time (Nov 7-10). We tried the night I got back which was Monday night Nov 10th. Today is Saturday Nov 15th, I took a shower went pee, wiped and there was a brownish discharge, never have I spotted in between periods, ever!

If you do child care at your house, do you require anything from the kids' mom? (two kids: one is 2 and the other one is 3 years old).

20090225124312AAeYVFv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Adoptees, have you requested your own medical records from the agency?	One of the major incentives that SMAAC mothers are working toward is to encourage mothers of loss to obtain the records from the agency or home where they were incarcerated.  This includes the Social Worker notes, the medical records of pregnancy and birth for both mother and baby, the Surrender Doc, and other medical and social notes from all personnel.        Adoptees also have records there, from their birth on.  These are records to which, under HIPAA, you are legally entitled, but which (for the mothers at least) have been very difficult, but not impossible, to obtain.  It requires persistence in asking, and asking over and over for mothers.        If you have gotten them, did you also have a hassle or were they forthcoming?  What records did you obtain?        If you have not gotten them, why?

I have always kept a clean but lived in house. Right before I gave birth I felt like my house had to kept spotless and somehow I was going to keep it up after the birth. Boy was I wrong. Once I brought her home I didn't have time to clean and now that she is 8 1/2 months it has turned into if I get any "Me time" at all I refuse to use it cleaning. As long as her bottles are clean and laundry is now falling out of the baskets we are all good, it can wait. Has anyone changed how they keep up the house work since having your babe?
20090128093123AAq2Srd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Caught Between A Rock And A Hard Place... Help?	I'm in a situation where I'm caught between a teacher very close to me and my best friend's boyfriend.      Me and the boyfriend aren't particularly close but I love my friend to death and don't want to let her know that. Basically here's the story:      The boyfriend got caught with his phone out so a senior staff member tried to confiscate it as per the rules. He said "no, you're not having my phone."      The woman called another member orf senior staff (the one I'm really close to) and he told the boyfriend to go to T1 (basically just the "you're in trouble" room.) The boyfriend said no and then swore at the teachers.      He got a 1day suspension but my friends "smuggled" him back into school- a bad choice in itself. But he was found back in the school and had to go see the teacher who'd given him the suspension. He apparantly "degraded" the boyfriend and laughed in his face, so the boyfriend spat in his.      The boyfriend then got more suspension and won't be back til Monday, but all my friends hate the teacher. But this guy isn't the type to degrade anyone. He doesn't even raise his voice. I said I was going to ask the teacher about it, but another friend said that I "clearly don't trust them".      What am I meant to do? I don't want this teacher to be hated because the boyfriend doesn't want to admit he was actually in the wrong, but what if the boyfriend was telling the truth (which I don't think he was) and it looks like I don't trust my friends?      Help!!
20090128100815AAPmUF5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	9 year old does not want to go to school. Help!?	Our 9 year old son does not want to go to school. Ever since we came back from xmas vacation it has been a daily problem. He says hes sick. We send him to school. The school calls that he is in the nurses office sick. We have talked to his teacher and she has been supportive and helpful but has no idea what the problem is. We have asked my son and he doesn't seem to know why either. One thing he has been very clingy. He is tuff so we do not think its a bully. But we are concerned and have taken him to a doctor to eliminate a physical reason. But it is breaking our hearts to see him cry and not want to go to school. Any suggestion?

We considered going to a sperm bank, but I get really jealous at the thought of some whack man's sperm in my wife, and she is really tiny, so she doesnt want to go through childbirth, which is fine with me.      I can't have a baby due to medical reasons.       So, our best option is to adopt. What I want to know is the name of a good adoption agency. How much they cost and if there's anything else I need to know about adoption.      We live in Florida (U.S.A).       (please let me know if there's any more info I need to provide for you)      (also, in case you didnt pick up on it XD, we're both females, but I don't think it matters to an adoption agency as long as you have the cash right?)

20090128094041AA3frmS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Pregnancy questions... Please help!?	I am engaged... my fiance and I have not been TTC, but we aren't very careful about being protected when we have intercourse. I am not using any type of birth control and my period is usually pretty heavy & regular...    I had my cycle in December like normal, but my January cycle came early and was lighter than usual. I think it was still too heavy to be implantation bleeding. I had cramps like I normally do, but it was still a lighter period than usual. I have been getting headaches really bad off and on for the last few weeks and this morning I woke up and my left lower back (I think it might be my kidney) is killing me. I have not felt nautious at all and my appetite hasn't changed either. I plan on taking a test... I'm just curious to everyone's thoughts.    I know everyone is different, but has anyone had similar symtoms? No morning sickness??     And is it possible for implantation bleeding to last more than a few days and seem like a period???  I need help!
