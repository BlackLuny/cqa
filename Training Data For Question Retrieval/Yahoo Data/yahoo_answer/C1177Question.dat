There can be any style if you make it to be. I'd appreciate outfits but single pieces will work as well.   Try looking at Urban Outfitters, PacSun, AE, Free People and other places like that. No A&F or Hollister or Aeropostle.   Thanks!

I didnt know if its just me, or if its not a god product, but I just came home with Smooth Away Hair removal, and it did not work as great as commercials said it did.

If you guys could just give me your views on this product, and if/how it works for you, that would be great! Thanks!

20090226175738AAL0efG	Beauty & Style;Makeup	I'm a shy guy & I went to a sauna last week, why does my friend Sarah think this is the funniest thing EVER?	So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese sauna/spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???

20090226171759AA7lefH	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Want to get contact lenses i dont need?	So i want colored contact lenses, but i don't think i need them. Sometimes i do squint though because my vision gets blurry like in school i squint a little to see the board but it's not bad. Although, everyday my eyes are usually red or pretty much bloodshot and i don't know why. Maybe i wear too much eyeliner? I don't know. And they get watery a lot and i can't really go 5 seconds without blinking. Sometimes when i'm laying down, for some reason one of my eyes gets really watery and a tear comes out of the corner of me eye... weird i know. But i don't think there's such things as contacts that reduce eye redness. I have dark brown eyes. They're very dull and boring and i hate them, haha. And i think i want like a green or hazel green color. But what i want to know is what to say when i go to my eye doctor and ask for them. Will they think i'm weird or something if i ask for contacts if i don't need them? Should I just say "I want colored contact lenses but i don't need them."? And should i say something about the eye redness too? I have no clue what to say. Below is some pictures of me and the 4th one is a chart thing of a bunch of colors. I like the 1st and 2nd one in the 1st row, and the 2nd one in the 3rd row. Can someone tell me what color they think would look best and answer my question about what to say when i ask the eye doctor about them?

I normally use a light base with SPF 25 and then a light powder foundation and I never reapply.       If I stop using the SPF 25 base, is there any way that I can put on a really good sun tan lotion and still wear my powder foundation?      Would it work if I applied my sun tan lotion, wait a few minutes, and then brush on some make-up? My skin has been really blotchy recently, so the makeup is necessary.      Any ideas or advice?

I'm considering cross-playing for an anime convention my friends taking me to, but I'm having troubles binding.   I've tried various ways, all using a tensor bandage I believe its called but it doesn't seem to be working properly, its also somewhat painful; I can live with the pain but I still can't help but wonder if there's a less painful way. I'm not sure if its because its too small, my chest is too big or if I'm just doing it wrong.    I tried tying it around my chest with and without a bra; My chest is C something... I'm not all that sure, but from what I tell there are more well chested people than me that can bind so any tips or helpful words of advice would be really helpful.

20090226174527AAkQjCt	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Skin allergy around my eyes?	The skin around my eyes is swollen, itchy, red and feels rough, not soft like the rest of my skin. It's just the skin that surrounds the eyes (not the entire lid) and also the skin from the inner corrner of my eyes extending down a little bit, so it looks like these little pouches of raised red skin in the corners. The only thing I can think of that I did differently is...well sometimes I'll put olive oil on my skin in the winter and then wash it off- it's a great moisturizer and have never had a reaction. But this time I used a different olive oil...could this be causing the reaction?       I don't have health insurance at the moment and am looking for some tips as far as what it could be and what kind of over the counter or at home treatments I could use...I took some benedryl and that didn't really do anything...anything else I could do that would make this go away?

I go to an all girls high school and we're doing a musical so some guys from another school came to play the male roles. I was cast a lead girl and the part involves kissing the guy who plays the male lead. The whole school thinks that we should be together and teases me in a nice way about matchmaking us. I'm confused about my feelings for him and at the moment I see him as a friend but its hard to keep the musical and reality separate so i don't even know what I truly feel anymore. I don't think he has feelings for me and I had to have a meeting with one of the teachers running the show about it. She asked me if I had feelings for him and I said that I didn't know because I don't. Then she said nothing can happen between us and not to get emotionally involved. After this my friend told me that the lead guy has feelings for someone in the show but she won't tell me who?      What should I do?

20090226191931AA5keqJ	Beauty & Style;Hair	I want to dye my hair but I had serious problems last time...suggestions?	I dyed my dark brown hair for the first time last May by putting dark purple panels in it. I went to a really nice, upscale salon where they bleached my hair first and then put the dye in only for it to turn blue! They tried another brand and it turned bluish gray! Finally they put red in it and it turned into the dark purple I wanted. It was all supposed to be permanent dye but it washed out after three weeks leaving me with this icky blonde color that I couldn't dye over. I used color protecting shampoo. Now, I really want to do it again but after last time, I'm a bit nervous. I need suggestions for what to do differently because I don't want to pay a lot of money just to have it last three weeks again. Thanks!

20090226192319AAO5WIQ	Beauty & Style;Hair	Dried out heat damaged hair?	My hair is suffering and it is damaged from years of using curling irons, and I'm using shampoos and conditioners for dry, damaged hair (Tresemme), and I've used several different kinds, but nothing seems to work! My hair resembles straw. I have heard of the Olive Oil Conditioning Treatments, would that work for dried out, heat damaged hair? Would I condition hair, then rinse, then shampoo? How would I go about treating my hair w/out having to run to a salon?
20090226192405AADwsK1	Beauty & Style;Hair	Glue-in Hair Extensions?	I recently got glue-in hair extensions put in for my birthday. They are not the hot glue kind where they burn it and fuse it to my hair - I would never kill my hair like that. My question is, Will the glue I did use damage my hair? My hairdresser said it would not, she put the extensions in for me and said she had used the glue before, but I just wanted a couple more opinions. The brand is Salon Pro Exclusives Anti-Fungus Hair Bonding Glue. Does anyone have any experience with this type of glue and did it damage your hair? I really appreciate any help!      And please spare me the "OMG you should have never done that your hair is killed for EVER!!!!!!!" because to be honest, I'm not worried about that.      I'd just like to know how it reacted to other people's hair and how hard it is to get out.      Thanks in advance everyone!      :)
