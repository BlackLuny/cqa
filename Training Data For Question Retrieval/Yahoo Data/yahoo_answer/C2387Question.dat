I receive wonderful gifts from my students each year, but one of the most creative gifts I received was a "movie night" kit wrapped in a popcorn box (from the theater). Inside were several packages of microwave popcorn, Twizzlers, Junior Mints, and Dots, and gift cards to a local video store! It was a gift that my family enjoyed as much as I did.       2. Spas & Spoiling   Before school ended we gave our teacher a $100 gift certificate to a local day spa where she could induldge in a facial, manicure, pedicure, massage -- whatever she chose. We included a brochure listing their services along with the gift certificate. Each family was asked to contribute $5 -- an easy way to give a nice gift. Variation: We purchased a gift certificate for a manicure, and on the card we wrote "This is for you -- after all, your hands are molding the future. Enjoy!" She loved it. We have talked about maybe switching it to a pedicure this year and including this note: "Please enjoy this gift for you. After all, you are busy changing lives ... let someone else change your polish."      3. "The Giving Tree" with a Sapling   My favorite gift for a teacher is the book "The Giving Tree," by Shel Silverstein, along with a small tree for the teacher to plant.       4. Notepads   If your child is just beginning to write, this teacher gift is very special. Have your child write out "From the Desk of" at the top of a sheet of paper and the teacher's name at the bottom. Then ask him to draw something simple like the sun or a flower next to the teacher's name. Use a black felt-tip pen and a plain sheet of white paper. Then take the masterpiece to a copy shop and have it made into note pads! If it doesn't all fit on two lines, just make copies and cut and paste in place. We had ours reduced so that the pads were smaller and less expensive. The copy shop can help you with this. The teachers loved it!   Variation: As an early-childhood educator, my all-time favorite gift was a notepad from a student. Her mother had encouraged her to draw a picture of herself and me, then took the drawing to a local copy shop and had it reduced in size and placed in the corner of a 5x7 notepad. Along the bottom, the pad was inscribed with "A note from Mrs. Murphy ..." I've already told the mom that I hope her son (who is in my class this year) will draw me another picture for a new notepad!      5. Photos   I took photos at a field trip and presented a collage of the day to the teacher. Since I have a digital camera, I was able to send it in the very next day.       6. Poem   My son's class studied different poetry styles, so with his end-of-year gift we included a poem he had written about his teacher.      Sponge - to soak up the overflow when your brain is too full   Candle - to light a small mind   Modeling Clay - for being a great model   Smarties Candy - to help stay smart   Highlighter Pen - for being a big highlight of my life   Glue - for holding everything together   Bubbles - to keep a bubbly personality   Cup - when yours is overflowing   Marbles - to replace those lost from time to time   Crayon - to color your day   Hanger - to hang in there -- summer vacation is almost here!      7.

This article    http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20090128/us...    is about a fight in Fairfax County, VA, between the school board and the parents, over grading standards.  The district has more rigorous standards than many, and parents are complaining that this is excluding their children from receiving certain benefits (lower car insurance, college admission), for work of the same caliber.    So what do you gals and guys think?  (my opinion to follow when best answer is chosen).

20090128095626AAb4mDi	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Could someone help me fix the grammar/spelling mistakes in my writing......  [URGENT !!]?	The Future   As January reaches an end, the time will soon arise to select courses for next year. It is a time of heightened anxiety for all because it is said constantly that these courses will steer the way to future career paths. In grade 9 it is most nerve-wracking, because students have never experienced the pressure that this time brings. School is a time to trust your own judgment and follow your own interests as opposed to what everyone else is telling you to do.   Successful individuals are not the ones that get the most high-paying jobs and hate their work, but those who work hard at a job they love and consider the pay to be secondary to their passion that is being pursued. Following an interest in the end will undoubtedly pay off because when you enjoy what you do, it is reflected in the work that you complete, and also in your personality because as an individual you will be more content. If a person is happy with their career decisions, the effect is contagious: it sets something off in others that sparks an interest to follow personal dreams.       The most important thing to remember in difficult times that are to follow is that no one knows you better than yourself. Do not let others talk you into taking courses that are not fit for you or are not what you want. In the long-run, the onus is on you to make the decisions that will shape your life.

My career goals: Fulltime book author   Backup career goal: Own a book store   Backup for my backup career goal: Book editor   (lol can you tell I have a thing for books)      So I need to get a degree in creative writing and business. I thought about going to the local community college, but I'm thinking it would be faster to take online courses and their would be less travel. Plus, it seems an online course would be more straight forward whereas an actual teacher would have me wasting my time on presentations rather then just learning. My concern is getting online schooling and have it not be worth anything in the end. There is so much out there, how do know where to look? The school that advertises the most is University of Phoenix. If anyone has any advice, experience, or guidance, I would be very grateful. Thanks -Rain      I should point out that I've been looking more at colleges that are campus colleges that are starting to offer degrees through online. I'm not really attracted to learning with other people. I hate giving presentations and doing group work. I just want to learn, I don’t want to get bogged down by the activities. Plus, from what I've read, these online courses have classroom chats and ways for the professors to communicate or give lessons to their students through online. This is appealing to me. I can get the knowledge I need without having to cut my jobs and I can work at my own pace.

I live in Spain and go to a school called Cambridge House Community College. The thing is, the laws in Spain have changed and to get into a Spanish uni, you have to get quite a lot of points. The system isn't all that good because you get more points from getting three Cs than getting two As, but that's not the point. The more A Levels you do, obviously the more UCAS points you get, and the more points you get to get into a Spanish Uni.      This new law only affects people going to a Spanish University and there are a handful of people that are going to go to English or American Unis. Im going to an English Uni, so obviously I am one of the people that this new law doesnt affect, but we are obliged to do 9 AS Levels.      I am doing      - Business Studies   - Maths   - Geography   - Spanish Language   - Spanish Literature   - English Language   - General Studies   - Thinking Skills   - French      Im lucky that Im only doing 9 as some people are doing 10.

Okay so I am a sophomore in high school who wants to go to a good college and major in pre-veterinary medicine. The problem is last marking period I got a C un biology & a C in geometry. This marking period I think I'm getting a C in biolgy again because I don't think I did to good on my final that I took yesterday. However, I have my math final tomorrow & I think I'm going to ace it so hopefully I'll get a B.

I am not sure if you remember me, but you were my third grade teacher at Masgghjkhggsd Elementary in 2003.    Today we had a presentation by a speaker about character education. He was talking about teacher who made a difference in our life or stood out to us, and I immediately thought of you.     You have to be my favorite teacher. I have so many fond memories from your class; like when Kate Dicamillo came to out school and you picked her up at the airport, and when we came in first thing in the morning she was sitting there with you talking, and how we got to talk to her before everyone else. Or when Tom, Maryanne, Allie and I use to write the newspaper, I think it we called it the “Classroom Gazette”.  I also remember bring home Twilight, and how everyone had to clean his cage, and if we were good we were able to take him out on the rug. I loved how we always had class meetings, and how you inspired all of us to read. You instilled a love for reading in all of us. Unfortunately now, I don’t read as often because the books we are required to read for school aren’t something I particularly care for.    I loved how you made everything so enjoyable. For example, when we read the book “Holes”, we didn’t just read it we did the play after the book, and I remember that I was the fortune teller.    I still have the letters that we wrote that were ten things that you admire about a person in the class. I remember going to the computer lab and writing it, and then when we got our letters, we were all so excited, and curious to know who ours was from. Still to this day I am not sure who mine was from. I loved how the days were so relaxing and how nothing was forced and when we were learning it didn’t feel like learning.    I am not sure if it was your classroom or the positive energy you would give off but I think that I wrote the best poetry I have ever written that year. I can’t thank you enough for all of the creativity you gave me. You were a perfect role model, and your enthusiasm rubbed off on me, to always be writing and reading, and most importantly my leadership.     Writer’s club was the best thing ever. I loved that club so much. Not only did it help me become a better writer, but reading the poems I wrote in front of an audience, has to contribute greatly to my confidence in public speaking.     The best book I have ever read was a “diary” written from Marie Antoinette point of view. I remember challenging myself to read that book and I loved it. I also remember another amazing book I read called “Milkweed” by Jerry Spinelli, that Tom was reading and you said you read it and loved it, so I just had to read that book.    Thank you so much for the amazing memories, leadership skills, love of reading, writing, giving me the tools to success, public speaking skills, and most of all being a great role model.    I hope that all is well, and that I hear from you soon.         Is that to silly to send to my 3rd grade teacher?

I'm majoring in Studio Arts and possibly French or International Relations. My current school is strong in the liberal arts but their visual arts program is underdeveloped and pretty elementary, so I want to transfer.  I feel like I rarely hear about good arts programs at small, private colleges so I'm looking for some suggestions, primarily in the Pacific Northwest but I'm open to anything.  Thanks.

Two days ago I was going to apply for McGill, but instead I sent them an e-mail asking for some information. Two days later 8today) I received a response. It says that applications for the period I wanted to start studying on (Fall 2009) are now closed, and I should try applying for Fall 2010. I don't want to wait that long!      Is there any other university at Montreal, Canada that I can apply to right now? I just graduated from high school in my country, that is why I am trying to apply right now. It MUST be from Montreal.      I am undecided on my career (have so many passions) so it is ok if some universities don't have certain careers. Just give me a list with universities/colleges in Montreal, Canada, and if you know that applications are still open please tell me.      Thanks.

20090128130219AA6sXQw	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Help Editing my speech?	Ever since grade 5, I have been so anxious to be in grade 8. I thought of it as Top of the school and I knew that grade 8s literally ran the school. When _______ started the leadership program, I wanted to be in Grade 8 even more. But, the one thing I didnt think about was how little time I would have to do these amazing things. Now that Im finally in grade 8, I realize my time is short, in about 6 months, I will have to say good bye to everything, and everyone. I will have to say good bye to the school, the teachers, and my friends, and this is something im not ready to do.    When You look back on your past years at ______, what do you think about? Do you remember certain people or do you think of the good times youve had? When I think about my past at _________, I think about a combination of all those things. I think about the first time I met everyone, I think about all the amazing times and inside jokes I have with those people I have met. I havent been a part of the school as long as most, but the time I have spent at _______ has been amazing.     My past at ________ is very happy. I have memories that are as good as gold. I remember going to the amusement park in grade 6. I went on my first big roller coaster with all my friends, and I loved it. In the same day I went on drop zone, the one ride I swore I would never go on. I felt safe with my friends there. In grade 7 we went to _______. I loved that trip. We had so much freedom and I learned a lot. I went for the first time to the Hard Rock Cafe with all my friends. We had some really fun times at one of the resteraunts, and in our rooms at night. Especially when on one of the nights we were there, the American Idol and Girlicious season Finalies were on, and the teachers let us stay up a bit later to watch them.    This year, there is one word that stands out among the rest. This single word now has more meanings then it has ever had in my life. Time. The little time we have left in ______, the little time we have to spend with those friends we wont get to see next year, to lead, and to leave our mark on the school. Time. The amazing times my friends and I have shared. Laughing, goofing around, and those serious times where we were all there for each other, because we knew that those people needed us. Time. To look forward to the times ahead, such as our ______ trip, sleep overs with friends, SOAR activities, and even those times in school when your so happy you feel like you will explode. Growing up happens in a heart beat. One day your in grade 6, shy as ever meeeting your new classmates. The next day you are graduating from grade school saying good bye. Since we have so little time, we have to always live in the present. If we dont.. time will slide by so fast, and before we know it, we will be hit with graduation. The time to say good bye. So we have to focus on the present. Right now. This very moment. This year I have made an extra effort to do this. When Im laughing with my friends, I laugh a little bit longer, to keep the moment. I want these moments to last forever, thats why I will always live in the present.     When you live in the present, its not bad to think about the future. High school. The topic everyone seems to be talking about. The second someone even says the word, everyone breaks out into conversation. But really, who can blame us? There are just so many things to say! Things like, what school we are going to, what courses we will be taking, who will be going to the same school as us, what our school offers us that others dont, and the list goes on. Everyone is so nervous, including me. On the first day of school next year, we will be stepping into the unknown, entering a whole new world, and this world is almost four times the size of the world we are in right now. But that is the least of my worries. There is also the pressure to succeed. High School is when your marks count. Universities will be looking at our high school marks to see whether or not they want us in their school. On top of all that, there is way more peer pressure, bullies, and drugs. The high school I have decided to go to is ________. This school has about 1600 people attending. This is a big jump, seeing as _______ has only 400. I will be leaving _______ as a senior, and entering _______ as a freshman. Whenever I think of that, I think of the start of grade school. All the way back in grade one. I remember seeing all these tall scary people, and I was so intimidated by them because they were so much taller and bigger then me! Now, I look down at the little grade ones and I think they are all adorable. But at least the Grade ones can play the cute card! I have nothing! We just have to look up at these people, just like in grade one.. except this time.. they wont find me cute, they will only see me as the kid standing in their way, while they are trying to get to class on time.    When you look back on all weve done, I hope you smile, because
