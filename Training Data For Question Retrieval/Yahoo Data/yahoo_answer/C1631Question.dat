Hi,      I recently got my residence visa stamped on my passport in Dubai and my labour contract will be available within a week's time.      I want to bring my wife on dependent residence visa.      Please advice on entry permit (residence) requirements/procedure and also the requirements/procedure for residence visa stamping on her passport. My salary is more than the basic requirement.      Below are my specific concerns:      1. My passport doesn't contain her name as spouse but her passport does contain my name as spouse. Will there be any problem?   2. Marriage certificate - Does it need to be attested by Indian consulate in Dubai. I have already got it notarized/attested in India by the home department and UAE embassy in India and finally by the Ministry of external affairs here in Dubai.   If the marriage certificate is to be attested by the indian consulate in dubai, i think they ask for her name to be on my passport (Please refer point 1).   3. Do I need to get a sworn affidavit from Indian consulate here in Dubai? What documents are required?   4. Is Tenancy contract required for entry permit (residence) or residence visa stamping in my wife's passport. I am staying in sharing and they don't give me a tenancy agreement.   5. My wife's age is below 25 years. Will that be a problem. We are married for 3 years now.   6. In how many days does the residence visa needs to be stamped on her passport after arrival to Dubai.   7. How much time does it take to get the entry permit (residence) visa for her.      I want to bring her as soon as possible.      Please advice ASAP.

20090227091215AAyNL4w	Travel;United States;Boston	Where is a good place for a vacation rental in Cape Cod for 8 mid 20 year olds?	Hello,      This August myself and 7 friends are planning on heading to Cape Cod for a week. We want to rent out a house on the beach. There are so many places in Cape Cod though and I am quickly getting overwhelmed. Any suggestions based on the following criteria would be much appreciated:      - There are 8 of us and we are all between the ages of 22-27.   - We are looking for a place with other people our age. Place does not need to be suitable for families or young children.   - We are looking for a place that has a good nightlife, preferable with bars/clubs/pubs within walking distance.   - While we want the above, we would like as much of the beach, water sport, golf and shopping as possible. That is, we would like a balance of the night activities and the day ones.      Thank you very much.

20090307165530AAWxvOY	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	Has anyone had problems with Expedia?	Booked a flight, a car and a hotel for a Shuttle launch in Florida.The launch was moved up and I had to move up my reservation by 1 day. I understood that it would have been necessary to pay the $150 change fee ( chance I took when I booked the flight). I was OK with that until they DOUBLE CHARGED me for the change fee. I went to the airline and saved myself $150. THEN I wanted to move up my motel reservation by 1 night- a $25 CHANGE FEE. THEN I figured things out with the hotel bill. THEY WERE CHARGING ME AN EXTRA 30% A NIGHT FOR TAXES AND OTHER EXPENSES. Taxes are 11%. First and last time with Expedia. Also they are refunding $150 or so - we'll see if that happens.

20090307163416AA0R42V	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Do you REALLY think the Palestinians are using the $5.2 billion to "rebuild" Gaza?	I sure as hell don't.
20090307160558AALW2hi	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Are the Arabs ready for peace yet?	It's a shame really. If only Hamas would stop bombing and launching rocket into Israel. I love how all the Muslims on this forum are "peace-lovers" and need peace. It's a shame their rules don't agree with them. Also, any one of you guys who honestly believe that Israel is an apartheid state has the same opinion as the terrorists. How could you think that? Hypocrisy in the Muslim world is amazing,no?Heck,I can't even enter 10 or more Islamic states in the Middle East. And the Arabs are complaining they don't have free rights. They can run in government, practice religion freely. I would get stoned if I was worshiping Hashem .That is if I could even enter the state.       Israel is always open to peace. It's just you need 2 to ying and yang. Israel is ready for the ying. When will the Arabs be ready for yang?      What about this:   No Arab regime has shown itself willing to truly prepare its people for peace with Israel, which would mean accepting the lasting presence of Jews in their midst. Indeed, anti-Semitism—the real stuff, not just bad-mouthing particular Israeli policies—is as much part of Arab life today as the hijab or the hookah. Whereas this darkest of creeds is no longer tolerated in polite society in the West, in the Arab world, Jew hatred remains culturally endemic.      For a European, it all feels uncomfortably familiar. Take the cartoons one sees in the government-controlled Arab press. They feature The Jew as a murderous conspirator, a capitalist bloodsucker or Satan himself—the classics. He even looks like his predecessors in Der Stürmer, with his hooked nose, thick lip and sinister beard.      Open Egypt's Al-Gomhuria newspaper, and there is The Jew as a serpent strangling Uncle Sam over a caption that reads "The Jews taking over the world." On Al-Nas TV, Egyptian cleric Ahmad Abd al-Salam tells his viewers, "I want you to imagine the Jews sitting around a table, conspiring how to corrupt the Muslims … The Jews conspire to infect the food of Muslims with cancer [and] to ship it to Muslim countries." Al-Salam's colleague, Zaghloul al-Naggar, has called Jews "devils in human form." And this is a country at peace with Israel. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazis' chief propagandist, would be proud.      Meanwhile, Saleh Riqab, Hamas's deputy minister of religious endowment, has picked up smoothly where European anti-Semitism leaves off, declaring on TV that "the protocols of the elders of Zion discuss how the Jews should seize control of the world. In Europe, and especially in the U.S., there was a quick Jewish takeover of the major mass media." One Egyptian cleric has even voiced the widely shared opinion that "Judgment Day will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews." So much for a two-state solution.      No anti-Semitism is ever complete without the idea of sexual subversion. The Nazis accused the Jews of "polluting" the Aryan race. Sure enough, one Egyptian "expert" has opined on Al-Nas TV that "the No. 1 goal [of the West and the Jews] in spreading pornographic films is to destroy the identity of the Islamic nation." A favorite trope is the Nazi-Jew comparison, which has a simple psychological function. Since Nazis are the epitome of evil, so must be the Jews. Thus a Qatari paper has shown the contrails of an Israeli warplane forming a swastika, and a Saudi paper has superimposed it on the Star of David. The official Syrian Tishreen newspaper has depicted an Israeli soldier gesticulating to Adolf Hitler in front of a sea of skulls. The caption reads "The Israeli is explaining to the Nazi: 'We are the same'." Finally, an example that might be amusing if it didn't illustrate the depth of the problem. It comes from Captain Shahada, of Egypt's Unique Moustache Association, who confessed on Egyptian TV: "I respect the moustache of this Hitler because he humiliated the most despicable sect in the world. He subdued the people who subdued the whole world—him with his [style number] '11' moustache." This is the essence of obsession: the compulsive recurrence of images and ideas over which you have no control.      Cynics might argue that this horrid creed is the price of peace—that the regimes in Cairo and Amman (and Ramallah, Qatar or Riyadh) deliberately stoke the flames of hatred to distract the masses from their quasi alliances with the Jewish state. The Palestinian Authority today owes its life to the Israeli Army. So it has to out-Hamas Hamas when it comes to the Jew-devil.      It's a nice theory, and it might even be true in parts. But it's not sustainable. How can you make or maintain peace with Satan incarnate? The Israelis long ago began to change their textbooks from a nationalist narrative to a more inclusive one that emphasizes not only the Holocaust but also the nakba, the flight and plight of the Arabs in 1948–49. But in Araby, we have the Syrian actress Amal Arafa, who makes a very different point. Even in peace, "Israel will continue to be a black … spot in my memory, in my genes and in my blood … W
