Qswzc6w7aa	That is a great question and I'm gonna be honest with you, When I first started on YA I was one of those mean ppl. I would be like why are u asking questions about ur pregnancy and not ur dr. I would be really rude, then I realized, hey maybe they have the money for the copay or maybe it takes awhile for them to get into their dr, or maybe it is late at nigh and they need the answer.     *********** I didn't like who I was, who I was turning into so I changed that. I now answer the question to the best of my knowledge and If I think I'm gonna be rude then I skip the question.    SO I do apologize If I was ever rude to anyone on here. I'm a changed woman. I'm nice again    I do know what ya mean though!|`|AbCeEZIhaa	Amen. It is easy to be mean behind the screen.

You do get some of the points back from ppl answering and you selecting a best answer, but unless you post a few hundred questions you'll never run out of points...|`|1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	If you delete your question you won't get any points back.    If it's reported and deleted, you'd get a violation notice and lose more 10 points as a penalty.    You'd get your 5 points back only if the question expired without receiving any answers or if it expired and the majority of votes went for "No Best Answer"|`|phkXqQ7Uaa	These are what you earn or lose points for.    Ask a question: -5 points  Choose best answer for your question: +3 points  No best answer was selected by voters on your question: 5 points returned  Answer a question: +2 points  Delete a question: -2 points  Log in to Yahoo! Answers: +1 point (receive only once daily)  Vote for a best answer: +1 point  Have your answer selected as the best answer: +10 points  Receive a "thumbs up" rating on an answer that you wrote: 1 point per "thumbs up"     Hope this helps!!! =D

You can use your own Yahoo id to log in.    2) Then upload the picture from your computer to the site using Upload option. Right click on the picture and copy the URL link and paste it when you ask a question. If you want large size images then click 'All sizes' above the photo and paste the 'Grab the photo's URL'.    You could also use these websites: -  http://photobucket.com/  http://fotopic.net/  http://www.snapfish.com  http://www.tinypic.com    ?Photo bucket links may cause Error 999 when you try to upload a picture.

7u77AiBjaa	Create a 360 space at http://360.yahoo.com . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space. Like Yahoo! Answers, Yahoo! 360 is for users age 13 and up.    Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.    - Click your "My Page" link at the top  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).    You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui... .    Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.    NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (http://avatars.yahoo.com ) and forget about using the 360 image.    OTHER TIPS:  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though.  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe... . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

VWtUhan3aa	I'm having glitches as well. Sometimes when I click on "see more from my contacts" the page will be blank, other than a message stating their are no new questions. But if I go to my profile and look, then there they are. And sometimes if I click on Voting I'll get a message telling me "the question has no subject". lol    Then for a couple of days over this past weekend I wasn't being notified of incoming messages. And sometimes, here lately, when I am scrolling through questions, some of those that I starred will still be blue, but if I open the question then they are yellow.     The last time I experienced so many different kinds of glitches was just before the site froze up the last time. I remember that well because I was one of the last users to post a question and then it sat there for 4 hours on the main answers page getting millions of answers. hahaha    And I think that might have been the same time that the BA notification got stuck. I had been chosen for 3 BA's and over the course of 2 days I was notified about 100 times each for them. I've never gotten 300 BA's in 2 days before.

If you have to use a specific mail account that you can't or don't want to change, use a mail software that has a good built-in filter, like Thunderbird. You can mark the "notifications" as "junk" in there and they'll go into your junk folder in the future after marking only a few of them.

This is the name people will see in their Inboxes for messages from you.  7. You can leave the "Reply to:" field blank, so your Yahoo!

Click Save to put your new settings into effect.  Note: The "From name" field can't contain special characters like the "@" symbol. And, the address in "Reply to:" can't exceed 40 characters.

When you delete your inbox email it goes to your trash folder so you can get it back if you need to.  So you are asked the question about deleting spam to make sure you did not click on the delete by mistake.  Hope this helps!!!

suPD7c3gaa	Of course you can't mail it to their web store.  A web store is a web site, not a place.  You should have been honest in the first place so you could have returned the item when you were home over the holidays.  You don't say how far away home is, but if you can go back, be honest and just tell him the coat just doesn't look good on you and maybe he could take you to exchange it.  Maybe you, mom and her bf could make it a nice outing... return/exchange the coat, go to lunch or something.  You certainly aren't going to get the cash for returning the coat.  Maybe your mom's bf could, and you could go somewhere else to find a coat if exchanging isn't an option.  There are a few options, but one of them isn't returning something to a web store.

6qsTmMQaaa	You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!|`|1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	?First of all, the picture you want to set here should be saved on your computer and put on an easy-to-find folder, you can put it on your desktop.(If your picture is on photobucket, download it to your computer).    ?????Take care : Your picture must be in the JPEG format. (JPEG files usually end with ".jpeg" or ".jpg" or ".jpe."). Also its size must be smaller than 5MB.?????    ?Now, Sign in your Yahoo! 360 page     http://360.yahoo.com/    ??? If it is your first visit to your Yahoo! 360 page, Click "Get Started" then do steps needed to start your page (like:click "Next"....etc).    ?Click "My Page" on the bar to the top of the page    ?Click "Edit Personal Photos" to the left of your page    ???OR CLICK ??"Add a Photo" if you you did not add any photos to your Yahoo! 360 page before.    ?Click "Choose File" to browse your picture, then click "Save" at the bottom of the page to UPLOAD it.    ?Click "Set As Primary" and SAVE.    ??? You do not need to click "Set As Primary" if you uploaded only one photo, in this case, neglect this step as the photo you uploaded will automatically be set as primary.    ?Now go to your Yahoo! Answers profile and click "Edit my Info"    ?On "Picture" options, choose ? "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture"    ?Click "Preview" at the bottom of the page then "OK" at the bottom of the next page.    ?Thus you're done, though, it may take up to 24 hours to find your picture showing here on your profile, Qs and As.    Hope this helps :)
6MCrTTRTaa	because usally nicer gurls are more sensitive =(  its sad and wrong but true    GREAT GUESTION FRUIT FLAKE!!!|`|GPtAQXZPaa	Because they get taken advantage of|`|RdvL6CGmaa	Usually nicer girls are only thinking about being nice.... so they don't think|`|PUgvxOltaa	predators prey upon the na?ve.|`|HSjaI8SFaa	Because nicer girls typically care more about the guy than he will ever care about her. Nice girls can be push-overs, which makes it easy for guys to blow us off. It's like, we can be nice to the point where we'll almost feel like we're bothering the guy if we show too much interest. Often times, too, guys get all wrapped up in the "popular" image of girls. They get this idea, from TV, magazines, or their friends of how "girls" are supposed to look, act, dress, etc. So, sometimes guys may not have the attention span to notice how nice a girl is. Sometimes, they can't get past the physical appearance of a girl.    **Not ALL guys are like this. And, the fact that we women can be quite complicated can make it difficult for a guy to know what he really wants.  Hang in there, don't give up on yourself, and PLEASE don't change for a guy - no matter how much you like him. Don't try too hard, it makes you look desperate. Give guys a little space when getting to know them, and if they're interested they can chase after you instead. Be yourself, and the RIGHT guy will find you.|`|eYTzeSSCaa	Cause everyone is to afraid to hurt the mean girls...and they alwasy pick the easiest target :( That sure isn't me!|`|VjBDziDTaa	That is a very  hard Question...I think it's 'cause the nicer ones have less experience in getting hurt and the Not-so-nice ones are the ones who have done(do) the hurting.|`|CyzROlBLaa	Because they're too nice to say no

AA11252878	Asking a question costs you 5 points. This is the only way to heavily mitigate spamming, and at the same time, encourage participation from all users. This isn't any form of punishment at all. It's just the way things work here.|`|faa92e7918909a03139883c276b87752aa	same thing i wanna know! i guess so that you have to answer someone Else's question so that u can gain points|`|qXlBsRLgaa	this whole site is stupid|`|2JSIKsP7aa	haha i agree with you.. i think once you post a question( and lose 5 points) they want you to gain those points back by answering questions..Now what i do is see how many stupid questions i can ask and watch the serious people flip out about it|`|PUgvxOltaa	there can be hundreds of answers to one question; therefore, questions have points taken away to discourage too many questions.  points are given for "answers", which is how they attract people to sell more ads.|`|9fw30IQcaa	I have always wondered that myself.  If no one asked questions, wouldn't this site cease to exist?|`|z4glZ2lbaa	lol these are the things that keep me up @ night|`|AA11408911	Remember nothing is free, Yahoo! Answers makes the rules which all users are subject to. The main reason users are 'billed' five points is a means of deterring spamming of the community forum and this in turn promotes users to use the search bar to try and find existing questions which may already lead them to the answer they were looking for.    All the best   Chrs
Y31Ci8vlaa	If you are saying about avatar,you need to save the avatar to profile and select it as your profile avatar.Then it should be appearing on your profile.If you are talking about picture,it is taking time like morethan a day to set as profile image by yahoo.So,it was yahoo mistake.

AA11065140	It's not a bolt of lightening, that's for sure!<br>  <br>  It's simply a belief.  If you don't believe it, then you don't believe it.  <br>  <br>  Try to keep in mind that what's in the Bible was written by humans, and edited by men.  The current King James Bible does not offer all of the scriptures of the age, by a long shot.  And funny, you'd think they'd want to include the Gospel of Mary (whether it be Jesus' mother, or Mary Magdelene), but nooo!  Naturally, the men in charge of the church back in the day (mostly a political organization tied to the local monarchies) decided that we shouldn't know even about it, much less read it!  <br>  <br>  I completely agree with you that you should use the brain God gave you.  I also firmly believe that He would agree.  He didn't give you gifts just so that you could ignore and discard them.<br>  <br>  Research...learn...believe what you believe, and don't let anyone tell you that your belief is wrong!|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

awUzUxo5aa	Offering Ten points without asking a valid Question is considered cheating as is asking people to star a question just for the points.      I'm not saying you did this as I didn't see your other question, just that it may have accidentally fallen into this category and been deleted by Yahoo or someone reporting it.....|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	I've seen similar question that have received many answers and I've seen many similar questions get reported. it's all in the wording.  every one would like to receive a Best Answer.  you have to ask something more Detailed about people getting BA's other wise you set off violation alarms in people's head and they report you right away.

A better way is to go directly to your online mail server with the browser and read it online. You have a mail account that is accessible with any computer.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Yes you can. The only problem is that by default downloaded mail is deleted from the server. You may want to set the access at your work computer to leave messages on the server. That will allow you to also download the same mail at home and save it all in one place.    Another option is to use a web site such as http://mail2web.com/ to read the mail at work. It has an option to not delete the mail.    ? ??l???q ?|`|x5981rdHaa	It is harder to do this with the pop3 that yahoo provides.

On one of the computers, though, setup Outlook Express to leave messages on the server, you can do this by:    Tools -> Accounts    Choose Account    Properties  Advanced    On the bottom of the dialog, is a check box to leave messages on the server, check that.

74c6dbb8ad833d2cb5f764008fefc7ceaa	okay, so what youre trying to do is try to get x to one side by itself.    so the first one:  2x+b=3c     So when you look at the side with x, you see that its: "2x+b." always try to get rid of the simplest one that isnt attached to x. which is "b." how do you get rid of it? you do the opposite operation to both side. so ask yourself, what is it right now? "+". so you want to "-b" from both sides. so what you have now is "2x=3c-b." dont forget that your goal is still to get "x" all by itself. so now the side with "x" in it is now "2x." how do you get rid of the 2? you do the opposite operation to both side. what is it right now? accompanied by the two. in other words, times by 2. how do you get rid of it? you divide both sides by 2. does that make sense? so now, you have: x=(3c-b)/2  , which is your final answer since x is standing all by itself, which is exactly what you want.    the second one:  x(a+2b)=4(ac+b)    ask yourself, how do you make x stand by itself? what is attached to it? how can you get rid of whatever attached to it? The side which x is on: "x(a+2b)". so x is multiplied by "(a+2b)." how do you get rid of it? do the opposite operation to both sides. so you divide both sides by "(a+2b)." get it? so now you should have "x=[4(ac+b)]/(a+2b)." Is there anything else on the side where x is? x is now standing by itself. which is what you want. there you go. there is your answer.    and youre welcome! =)|`|YMff2MIoaa	the first it think is x= 3/2c- b/2  and the second i think is x= 2c/b+ 2/a    i'm not too sure but it's something|`|xgWf3SKxaa	OMG THATS IMPOSSIBLE|`|VIfKSTq1aa	eh, no!|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	2x+b=3c (the problem is the answer)    xa+x2b=4ac=4b|`|u9CFPBkWaa	x=5    and     x=3|`|84H5kMD7aa	2x=3c-b --> x= (3c-b)/2    x(a+2b)=4(ac+b) ---> x= 4(ac+b)/(a+2b)|`|wqQf6IKqaa	Your welcome, and your avatar is really eye-catching isn't it?|`|MTxsnrWaaa	its ur hw|`|u4CuUmwdaa	dfsdf|`|4UotaSeiaa	do you own 9th grade homework ;P|`|9LdcBLuIaa	Sure you lazy knob.    x = (3c - b)/2    x = [4(ac+b)]/(a+2b)    There you go.|`|T5FDeDYDaa	number one is     203828448     number two is  02343888 - dsd 88383 aod 9393       you are welcome|`|La2MlOqQaa	um don't you have like a textbook thing you can use?

AA11408911	Yahoo! Answers makes use of community moderation, a process where members of the Yahoo! Answers community will report content they feel violates the community guidelines.     Users are assigned a trust level which is based purely on a user's previous reporting accuracy. Very accurate reporters shall have a high trust level and therefore will have more power when it comes to removing content. If content is reported by two or more trusted reporters then that content shall be removed from the community automatically.     When content is removed, the author of the question may be docked points (between 2-10) as a form of punishment. They shall also be sent a violation notice which shall outline the reason for their content being removed as well as a link to appeal the removal of such content should the author of the content feel it was removed incorrectly.    When a user files an appeal, a member of the customer service team for Yahoo! Answers shall review the appeal. If they agree the content was reporting incorrectly, the content shall be reinstated back into the community along with any points originally deducted. Furthermore the user(s) who filed the report shall be considered less trustworthy and will find it harder to incorrectly remove content from the site.    This is further explained in the diagram below:    Your content (i.e. a question or answer)     2 or more reports are filed by trusted users     The content is removed automatically without review     The author shall be sent a violation notice    The author of the content can appeal  Or  author will take no further action     The appeal shall be reviewed by a member of staff    The appeal can be declined  Content is not replaced and ten points removed     The appeal is successful and the content is reinstated along with any lost points    Violation notices are simply a warning to indicate that a user has broken the rules. Your account should be in no danger of being suspended unless you receive many violation notices in a short period of time or post very bac content such as breaking the law.    Hopefully this helps to explain the process a little clearer.     All the best  Chrs    [ This answer was recently edited to correct poor grammar ]|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	I just got reported randomly. I had a poll where the 23rd answerer gets 10 points, and the violation reason was for gaming|`|f8odlwR1aa	I've never been reported or anything. I highly doubted that they'll delete you or somewhat..maybe a warning. o.o  I hoped this helped ^__^|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	cheers answer is good.  that's what they advertise.  in reality, deletion is automatic -- no-one ever reviews the complaint.    when a violation is protested, for questions or answers, the people that do the reviewing are timed.  if the post is very long, the review request will be denied because the reviewer gets dinged for spending too much time on one request.    for deleted id-s, it's just as bad.  one of the "good guys" had his id deleted.  requested a review, and nothing came of it.  finally i complained, to a different address, and the id was finally restored.  it took another email to restore all of his old posts.    i've had both questions and answers deleted.  i've never had one restored.  any more, i just don't bother.  the consideration that something might get done is a waste of my time.  and i give someone the opportunity to claim that they actually reviewed a deletion, and get credit / paid for that time.    Edit:  >    that NEVER happens, other than "it's a violation of community standards."  fact is, it's strictly a computer process, no-one from yahoo ever looks at the post.  if anyone ever does look at it, it's when a violation is protested.    every time, i ask to know the reason something was removed.  not one single time has that happened.  as far as i know, i'm just too verbose for a reviewer to spend time on.  as to the reason for the original complaint, it's just some user's whim -- nearly always because he disagrees with my political point of view.  i even had one guy comment to me, "Stick to your own category."  then report my post and get it deleted.  the sad truth is, you could report this answer, and get it deleted - and i'd not be able to get it restored.

Look under the "view" menu for something like "zoom" or "text zoom" or what have you.<br>  <br>  It's also possible that your screen resolution is set too high.
9BL6LFJ9aa	A Yahoo posting suggests that you disable scanning attachments in your anti virus software.If that  fails go back to classic mail  Hope this helps.
VQdqogD7aa	It usually means CA Yahoo! Anti-Spy can't delete the cookie because the file is in use.  You can sometimes get around the problem by closing your browser (e.g., Internel Explorer, Firefox, etc.) before you click "Begin Scan".  Anti-spy runs as an independent program and doesn't require the browser to be open after you click Run Anti-Spy. I wouldn't be too alarmed by tracking cookies.  Web sites could be tracking your habits without the use of tracking cookies.  Malicious software (malware) could store information in cookies to be used later.  However, that assumes your computer is or will become infected (e.g., Backdoor Trojan or Virus).  A more effective approach would be to prevent the creation of the tracking cookies in the first place.  It's not always easy; however, most browsers provide some help.  For IE click Tools, click Internet Options, click the Privacy Tab.  Look at the Sites and Advanced buttons on that window.  Note that some Sites will not work if you block their cookies.  Now look at Advanced and always click the radio button to block 3rd Party Cookies  (this is always safe to do).  Under Firefox, click Tools, click Options and click the Privacy Tab and uncheck the box that says Accept third party cookies.  You can also block sites from creating cookies.  Have a good one.

6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|awUzUxo5aa	You have to wait four hours from when you asked the Question and then you can decide....

What is the point of the points? Well, it's just the more you get, the more questions you are able to ask.     Edit: You can also put your answer to a vote when you can't decide, and a bubble will appear for that too below all the answers. Oh! And you get three points when you choose a best answer.

AA11408911	Opinion seeking questions tend to violate the community guidelines for promoting chatting within the community, by this I mean such questions will often allow users to post comments for a quick and easy two points as opposed to providing informative and knowledgeable answers to all members of  the Y! Answers community.     All users are subject to the community guidelines and terms of service, therefore Yahoo! has essentially removed user's 'right' to a freedom of speech as a means of ensuring the community remains safe and enjoyable for all users.     This sounds like an honest mistake, after all violation notices should be treated as warning to simply not repeat your actions. Always try to avoid the chatting violation by using the 5 w's of who, what, where, when and why, for example, "WHICH pop-up add do you hate the most and WHY" or "I hate pop-ups, HOW can I stop them appearing"...

tqAEoOAdaa	Glad you asked as you could prevent any further damage from these type of E-mails as they are nothing but a Fake.    SCAM, SCAM, SCAM. Do not trust any of those mails as they just intend to steal your personal information. Claiming the prize is far away as the lottery itself is a fake, bogus! See here what Yahoo has to say about this:- (http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/or... )    You can report this with the mail abuse form below.  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/or...

That message is both a fake and an outright fraud. Don't contact the phishers and give them any of your personal information at all. Spam that scam message straight into oblivion right away. This is one lottery you'll never win because it's "bogus."    Another thing, the phishers telling you to "keep this lottery information confidential" would indicate to you not to say anything about this to anybody until they have finished scamming you.|`|525554f988788400cca693ca89517067aa	Yes.  They are all SCAMS. If you click on the below link this site confirms various email scams hitting the internet and provides an online form for the reporting of all scams and frauds - (with links for your own country.)  http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/lo...  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yoo2.phpahoo/...  Unscrupulous thieves have sent you this email and they are trying to part you from your hard earned cash. They will often ask you to call a premium rate number and keep you holding on whilst you rack up a huge phone bill. They are then paid a large proportion of this phone bill. They may ask you to divulge personal information about yourself or ask for your bank or credit card details. Do not divulge any such information under any circumstances. It is surprising how many innocent victims have been duped by these types of emails. Please remember the thieves who send them are very clever and extremely convincing. I suggest you delete the email and send it into cyberspace where it belongs.  Check out these sites for further information :  http://www.scambusters.com  http://www.hoax-slayer.com/

Give quality answers to real questions to get Best Answer points (10). Vote undecided questions and answer your daily limit when you can (1 pt ea.). And ask few questions (-5), but when you do ask, be sure to choose a Best Answer, as you get 3 points back for that. Click on the link below (or your points or level number next to your avatar). How to move up levels and the whole scoring process is all explained there.    http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...    CHOOSING BEST ANSWER  Once your question has been posted for at least 4 hours, you will see the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button by each answer. After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	level 2 starts at 250 points - you have 105.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.c om/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Fl...|`|sr7jX2wYaa	Answer questions, & vote  on questions.

It will take you to the link.    OR...    Just type in avatars.yahoo.com in the search bar at the top of your webpage. Make sure you're logged on. =)    PICTURE AVATAR:    You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo!

Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile.

For the windshield non-reflective tint is allowed along the top of the windshield above the manufacturer's AS-1 line.    I would think the difference between allowing 28% of light in and 20% of light in would be noticeable at a glance, or at least by someone who's knowledgeable, and probably police officers. 25% wouldn't be as noticeable, but there's an inspection law, and a guide to easily test for acceptable tints. There's a sticker requirement.  The sticker to identify legal tinting is required on the inside of the drivers side doorjamb.  So you can bet tint is checked.

If you change it, it's possible people may not know who you are.  I know I wouldn't, because I'm clueless at times.  When you ask a question and I get the e-mail and it says, "Canadian Ice 455839 asked a question."  My brain would say, "When did this person become a contact of mine?  Was the day that rough that I just accepted contacts from anyone?  What in the world is going on?"  I know this will happen with me, because it has a couple of times.  People change their name, which is fine, and I become clueless.  So I search their bio and after eight or nine hours of staring I finally figure out who it is.  Probably because in their bio it will say, "Daniel, I know you're staring at this trying to figure out who it is.  I used to be BamaPastorDude."    All goofy story telling aside.   You search and ask some beautiful and wonderful questions.  And you give some blessed answers.  I pondered this and came up with this name:  Berean Woman or Woman of Berea.  Because you are continually searching (and Searcher was already taken).|`|jFqWYC4uaa	Strawberry Mary.     Goes well with one who is trying to be Mary and not Martha. Moreover, this way you will be able to retain your identity as well.     Deb S (SFECU) pray4revival~~~~~ your 9th respondent would also be pleased.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Keep it as Strawberry. I think that is good, or at least tell me if you will changed it. I have known you as Strawberry and there is no other Srawberries here|`|xRMwf3XEaa	Strawberry is quite nice.
tqAEoOAdaa	TO GET THE QUESTION IN FRONT PAGE    ?You have to ask a Question, which is Unique and Weird,  Eg:-It was asked a few months before 'How do they get the ships into those bottles'    ?Secondly your Question must get Lots of 'Stars' around an average of 25-30    ?The category you ask questions must be different. If you ask Chat questions or POLL type Questions they are not likely to get posted! Your question will NOT be featured if they are asked in P&S or Jokes and Riddles!    ?Thirdly the category in which you ask questions should have Less Competition for answers. Eg: -Hobbies and Crafts, Cleaning and Laundry, Hairstyle etc.    ?The Last thing is your question is selected by the Random selections of the Yahoo. So it should be qualified to post on the 'Best of Answers'. The exact algorithm is NOT known but this is just a speculation!!! (http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...

The stars can bring a question to the attention of the staff, but they still have to review it to make the choice. The staff also goes hunting for questions themselves. Finally, they DO accept recommendations, according to their blog about it:  Were always on the lookout for great questions and answers to feature. But with the amount of content added every minute, its impossible for us to catch all the great contributions from the community. If youve seen a question that you think should be featured, send it to y_answrs_editors@yahoo.com.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	the Yahoo!Answers team chooses questions randomly and considers the answer for honesty.  It's not usually how great the questions is that gets it put into the headlines, it's how great the answers are.|`|9IGPrWBLaa	your question is actually on the front page right now. your questions are put on the front page generally when they are first submitted. then, another set of questions will be put up within a short couple of seconds or a minute.    hope this helps :)

AoLS7XXTaa	Ive always been in the "popular group" if someone  who was "normal" or a "geek?" (wat evr) i would be nice to them, just approach and get to know one of them, they will help you with your flaws. You'll be in a clique in no time, email me if it doesn't work!    :):):)    -Lyric|`|fusIwst4aa	Maybe you shouldn't hang out with them , just because they are popular, try to hang with your TRUE friends.:)|`|o9F9iJ8eaa	have sex with current members of the popular group|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	wear branded clothes, wear tiny layer of make up, smile more than necessary, play sports, join clubs, and be nice and optimistic.    but seriously, i'm a right old ***** and everyone in my class respects me :) so just be yourself, girl!|`|74792a199b94cdf95f223d686149faf0aa	Dont go for the popular group...they will only get you into problems with drugs and liquor!  I am not in the popular group.  Was in my early years, then got out of it during high school years, and was just fine with it.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	Don't do anything to compromise who you are. You'll be fake and EVERYONE will see right through that. You can never be who you aren't, and you'll never live down being a fraud.|`|qXlBsRLgaa	play sports that should help|`|ac0rRBHCaa	Be Cool obviously you need work|`|6ZRF1jW4aa	Completely sell out your individuality and do everything mainstream despite it being wrong and uncomfortable. Look at Metallica.|`|cfn8mYF6aa	be yourself. if that doesnt work it isn't worth it. dont change to fit in.|`|gX40pgLyaa	Pick out a person in the group that you think that you could become friends with  first and then become friends with her friends and just work your way up!!!|`|ZWfztGfXaa	its not really all that great being in the popular group. they're not all that popular and as you get older it just becomes another group. its better to be happy with your friends rather than be part of that group and all its expectations|`|VRqF9vMRaa	Those people up there, the other people helping you out, as in Valerie, etc, are totally right, except for the ones who support the popular kids. dude, you have to be your self, but the popular kids are dumb, who knows, they might start smoking, would you do that to fit in? dude, make your own group, have fun, it doesn't matter who you hang out with as long as you have fun.    maybe, just mabe if you stick up to a popular kid, you might becom popular, but with a better bunch of friends.|`|AA11578107	Find people you like and make you're own fu**in group!  Those people you want to join may look glamorous and appealing, but they're all stabbing each other in the back constantly and probably have a million and one problems of their own.  Be popular with the right people.  The people that like you for you and not who you could be.|`|0XWVUMCAaa	well me too  but they're not really that cool  they think they're all that|`|gU1kxU6Haa	idk but wear skinny clothes....|`|L4eEuaanaa	Ok, personally, I absolutely hate the popular group, so I don't know how to get in.  From my point of view, I guess you could try to dress/act like them.  Try to become friends with someone in the group who can hook you up.  Sorry if this isn't any help!|`|fyP3WLoPaa	You should have to fit in with a group, you are just part of the one you belong in.  Embrace your group whatever it is and remember the group you are in is always better than all the other groups.|`|8U5jnXBVaa	Hahahahahahah. That is hilarious. Ok here is the deal...the word "popular" doesn't exist in normal life. It only applies to people in politics, movie stars, rockstars...ect...    Most of the people in high school that are popular will be the losers (because they think they are the ****) in college and in life. Put it this way, if the majority of people are "unpopular" in high school...then how is it that so many of them get along and have a huge number of friends in college? Where do all the "popular" high school kids go...they go and chill with each other in their limited number and hence, become the losers.|`|x28X2Ch1aa	let me tell you something..i'm attractive, have the best personality, don't let people talk down to me, everythin u think of a *popular person* according to the movies...my freshman year until senior year (i quit becasue my father got cancer), i was in the Marching band, i hated every minute of it, but no one thought i was in it b/c i didnt seem to *fit* the model.  As soon as i quit marching band (my senior yr) i had more confidence because i wasn't always creeping around hoping people wouldn't find out (marching band was great to some people but i didnt care for it, though i was intimdated by the jocks to try out for sports and such, my  1 mistake , not important now b/c im almost done w/college).  the *popular* guys started to notice my confidence and started drving me home and wanting to hang out with me more, by the time they were giving me attention (they did in the pasti just didnt notice it), i didn't care! LoL.  that was the *popular* people, but honestly, once your down w/highschool it doesn't matter anymore.  basically my advice is to just have confidence in yourself and don't be a *****. Think that everyone likes you. (w/o being conceited..! )|`|WrMNnEumaa	just show the same interest    but dn't try to fit in if they show no intrest in you because most of the time they are a** h**** that are just  seeing who to make fun of to make them selves feel better and those people disgust me!!!    watch what ure doing and check to see if its worth it =)|`|ZDDBiBo5aa	deny your true self, and dress like them, act like them and like everything they like.|`|RwtHiQufaa	Well i was once in the popular group and it wasn;t all that. People just need to lear to be themsevles more. In my school no 1 is popular and almost every 1 is nice and friendly. Im in probalby the best group cause im kinda in the middle. Which is probaly where you want to start. Then you can be friends with all kinds of people and every 1 will like you. You need to just be yourself and if people don't like you then their not your friends. But if you really want to be popular work your way up to it! hoped it helped!
FSKEk1A1aa	If he broke up with you because he thought he hurt you, he's probably a good guy and you should probably keep going out with him. You don't want to say he's your boyfriend though. You should look for other guys and don't settle with one boy yet. There's tons of guys out there for you and he's not the only one who's going to hurt you.

tqAEoOAdaa	Both the above are wrong to your Question.They're telling about Yahoo Mail and not Yahoo Home page    ?Yahoo is testing a new layout, but it is not hitting all users at the same time. They are testing it out randomly on people and some are getting it unfortunately!    "M.yahoo.com" (or another country's equivalent) is not the Yahoo.com version for mobiles, but a new site layout, which is tested on a couple of users without asking them for their consent first. Some users like it, but most don't. Many are upset, as they cannot get to their mails without clicking many different links before they get to read anything.     It explains all about the New Layout here in this link: -  (http://ycorpblog.com/2008/09/17/testing-...       ?Note:- Clear your Catches, Cookies, Temporary Internet Files and type http://www.yahoo.com/ in the Browser window.
