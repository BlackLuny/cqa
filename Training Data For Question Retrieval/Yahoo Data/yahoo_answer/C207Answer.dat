k4x4uSNJaa	its just your uterus expanding! especially if your a small girl like myself you feel everything a little sooner!!! but id check with your Dr. being that's its so early in your pregnancy... i called mine about everything! Just to be safe! <br>  <br>  best of luck & congrats!!!|`|qo79EUHKaa	Honestly I'm not sure because I never experienced any of those through my pregnancy when I was around 6weeks. I would just prefer to talk to your doctor about it because thats who should know best.|`|ooNfqGxzaa	I experienced that as well. It's completely normal. Your body is just getting ready to have a baby!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Your uterus is expanding. It's normal. I'm not sure about the thrush though.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	You need to be on a cream for the thrush.  Abdominal pain is normal, your uterus is stretching, this will continue for the next 34 weeks.
lzcglDnMaa	Well, from what I have read on here from other ttc'ers if your doctor puts you on provera and you don't start your period then there is a chance you are pregnant. The provera only induces a period, but I don't think you will start one if you are pregnant. If you have your doubts after getting negative hpt's and negative blood test then ask your doctor what they think.  He won't give you provera if there is a chance that you conceived.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	provera simply makes you have a false period. you take it for about<br>  10 days and a couple of days after your last pill it will make you shed<br>  your uterine lining.<br>  <br>  provera shouldnt be taken unless you are sure that you are not pregnant. the only reoson it would cause a problem is if your already pregnant.<br>  <br>  i have pcos so i dont get a period or ovulate on my own.the doctor gave me provara to jump start my period and then on day 3 i started clomid..|`|D0oqTblpaa	My doctor put me on provera to start my cycle and then clomid but I didn't take provera afterward. <br>  <br>  I think provera is similar to birth control and I took that when I was pregnant with my first no knowing I was pregnant.  My doctor said that it couldn't hurt the baby.

Ideas that I have been told, but hardly any work for my son...cool cloths, teething rings, gels if you want to use them, teething tablets, frozen fruit in a mesh feeder.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	There's no "cure" but plenty of teething rings help - you can buy some you put in the freezer. Cold, wet flannels for them to chew on. Most of all, lots of cuddles!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, tylenol used to help, but now that there are more than one, we are getting by using motrin but she's still usually uncomfortable; sometimes i give her frozen apple juice chunks in a mesh feeder to numb them up..she's never taken a cool rag or teether in her life....unfortunately....gl|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	1/2 tsp of table sugar.<br>  <br>  My second vomits tylenol up, and can't really take much of anything else.|`|qBl9ShJBaa	i would put one end of a clean wash cloth in water then freeze it and let him have as many as he wanted.and i would use orajel.it saved me many crying nights.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	A teething gel and something cold: wet/camp flannel put in freezer, teething rings you can put in the fridge.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Give your child something to chew on, such as a firm rubber teething ring or a cold washcloth. If your baby is old enough to eat solids, he may also get some relief from cold foods such as applesauce or yogurt. Giving him a hard, unsweetened teething cracker such as zwieback to gnaw on is another time-honored trick. (Avoid carrots, as they can be a choking hazard.) Simply rubbing a clean finger gently but firmly over your baby's sore gums can ease the pain temporarily, too.<br>  <br>  If these methods aren't working, some doctors recommend giving a teething baby a small dose of children's pain reliever such as infants' acetaminophen — but check with your doctor before giving your baby any medication. (Never give your baby aspirin or even rub it on his gums to ease the pain. The use of aspirin in children is associated with Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition.)<br>  <br>  Rubbing the gums with topical pain relief gel is also an option, but you may want to ask your baby's doctor before trying it. If you use too much, it can numb the back of your baby's throat and weaken his gag reflex (which helps prevent him from choking on his saliva). The gels are generally safe to use, but in rare cases can cause an allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  If drool causes a rash on your baby's face, wipe, but don't rub, the drool away with a soft cotton cloth. You can also smooth petroleum jelly on his chin before a nap or bedtime to protect the skin from further irritation.|`|3nv8MXs4aa	Ora-gel is nice but not practical all the time. So i would take a baby washcloth and put crushed ice or ice cube in middle and then tie closed with rubber-band or hair tie, then get it wet and give to baby my daughter loved this she would gnaw on the ice through the washcloth then suck the cold water out as the ice melted was very soothing for her. I hope this works for you i know teething can be a rough time.|`|aytp005Xaa	I use to sometimes use baby oragel but hear bad stuff about it, like it numbs the back of the baby's throat which can be dangerous.<br>  My son loves wet frozen rags... <br>  Wet the rag and put it in the freezer. Now after its frozen I open it up, stick an ice cube in the rag and fold the rag around it and scrunch up the end so the ice cube stays in... works way better than a teething ring and he chews and sucks on that till the ice cube is gone!|`|ZVCm3XAEaa	I found that Anbesol teething liquid was great, it is an anesthetic and antiseptic and also Teetha powders.  When she was particularly bad with really red cheeks and red bottom I would give her either Calpol, Neurofen for children or Medised (not available to under 2's in the UK now though).  Hope this helps, it is a trying time for the wee souls (and us!).|`|YxFDiEaCaa	Any kind of teething rings, especially the ones that go in the fridge as they're nice and cold on their little gums. Bongela or Calgel to put on their gums. Also you can get baby ice lollies them milk ones, my baby loves them and he is teething at the minute now i bet they are cool on their gums.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	ashton a nd parson teething powders work best on my daughter...and a cold damp washcloth form the freezer or a raw carrot for her to chew on never fails to comfort her|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	My Grandmother always said it's dipping a "binki" in whisky but I don't advise this! <br>  <br>  On my boys I use a simple teething ring and my boys also liked chewing on rib bones.|`|QQby0Adoaa	Use a wet wash cloth.  I<br>  <br>  It provides you with the following help:<br>    if she (the baby) needs to bit, then the texture of the wash cloth helps to sooth the gums as well as help push the teeth through the gums<br>    depending on the weather, you can use warm water or cold water on the cloth, this will allow her to not only chew but suck on the cloth and get some fluid in her.  We have hot summers in Oklahoma so i gave my grand-daughter a cold cloth, it cooled her off and helped her teething.<br>    I hope this helps.|`|af4cca259c03cb1870d2f01799ea36f5aa	the thing i found best for my daughter was the teething tablets that you buy at walmart. we also used a mesh holder with cold fruits in them and cool wash cloths to chew on
RgEtKVaKaa	Austin is a beautiful city - you are fortunate to live there.  Congratulations.  Parenthood is the most amazing experience you will ever have.  Have you considered being stay at home parents? What if you used this time before the baby comes to figure out how to cut your expenses to the bone & live on one income?  As you have found, there are no good infant care programs in Austin.  Think about the folks who work in day care centers.  Young, mostly uneducated    ( HS diploma, perhaps) with little to no parenting experience.  Total strangers to you & your baby. Your child wants to spend his/her day with those who are nurturing & loving - not someone who is making little more than minimum wage.  I left my job to stay home & care for my son.  I learned to do everything differently in terms of how I made our dollars stretch. Losing $25.00 an hour is a huge hit to the wallet.  Has it been worth it?   Absolutely! I can sacrifice a lot so I can stay at home with my son & he can stay in his home with his bed, his toys, lunch on his schedule, etc.  Go to your library & borrow a book  - "The Irreducible Needs of Children"  Hopefully this will help you adjust your priorities & make the best decision for you child.  Good luck .  The highest quality infant care in Austin is in your home.
Zb7CtLxbaa	Have her invite him over for dinner beforehand. Get to know him on a personal level. Don't pressure him with questions and make it like an interview. Keep it casual. <br>  <br>  At that point, your decision should be more clear (although I can't promise I will be crystal).|`|8SjoUQmEaa	I think you should let her go, but as a special occasion and not let her make a regular habit of this type of thing. I wouldn't recommend her going alone with this boy though, are other friends going to be with them? Like I said, I wouldn't let this be a regular occurrence or she's going to start taking advantage of the fact that you trust her.<br>  <br>  Just make sure she knows the rules, maybe have her call you at a certain time. If she acts suspiciously about anything, or any problems arise out of this, then be more strict with her in the future.|`|sq9AtIRHaa	Yes, I think you should let her go. I remember when I was that age and I was with the love of my life and he was 3 years older than me and my mom let me hang out with him. I had the best times with him ever; some which I will never forget. Your daughter will be crushed if you don't let her go most likely, just give it a go, let her spend some time with him, but don't let him go overboard. What can go wrong hanging out eating ice cream and watching some bands play?|`|zzpKGLaKaa	Get a little bit of information on this boy, maybe from other parents who know him? Or teachers if you can't find any parents that know him? Ask your son if he knows anything about him. If you find the information on him is acceptable ask to meet him before they go out. Trust her judgment and her. Good luck :)|`|GMIsOYYCaa	Let her go.<br>  <br>  Why wouldn't you? You already said that you have an "open and honest" relationship and that your daughter "trusts" you. By not letting her go you are only showing that you don't trust her character enough to make good decisions with this young man. It's an insult to her, and to the way you raised her.<br>  <br>  If you really trust her, let her go.|`|5F82CQ7Yaa	I would get to know the boy a bit better before hand. Have her keep in contact w/ you, for example, call you when they get to the band thing, call you after it's done. Call again when they are at the ice cream place, call again when they are on their way home. The phone calls doesn't have to be long. It can be as short as "we are leaving the concert to get ice cream."|`|pT7jrsAgaa	So she's around 14?  I don't think I would let mine go off with a boy at 14.  Especially not one who is 2 yrs. older.  Some kids at this age are really mature and level headed....though not many.  This might be putting her into a situation that she may not be ready to handle yet.  I'd wait until she was at least in high school before letting her go off alone like that.|`|iqku0QOQaa	I would say let her go but just warn her of your concerns and give her a little bit of advice that you may want her to hear. Make sure she actually listens and tell her it's because you love her, care about her etc..<br>  This is how i would like my parents to treat a situation like this. I wouldn't reccommend banning her from going as she will probably rebel.<br>  Good luck and i'm sure everything will be fine! x|`|xVEqBjDVaa	My daughter is 14, in 9th grade...and if she asked me to drive her and friends, like girl friends...i would probably say yes...but there is no way in hell i would let her get in a car with that guy. And she would have a set time. For that age, that's letting her go...and being VERY generous. I would check more into the guy before you say yes. Things are weird these days, you have to be VERY thorough and careful.|`|wqbZbwpBaa	It's just a crush, but if it does progress make sure she definitly knows the rules. You are very lucky your kids share this stuff with you :)|`|0ZPABvh8aa	I don't have any children but I do remember being 14 very well and my dear parents who were watchful and careful like you had absolutely no idea what I was up to. I told them exactly what they wanted to hear and then did the opposite to what I had told them, I wasn't bad, I was just 14.  14 year olds are very skilled at presenting an image to their parents and I was the master at it! I wasn't allowed out at all in the evenings until I was 16 and there was a blanket ban on any boyfriends until I was 16 years old  I still managed to get up to no good.<br>  <br>   I have not met a parent yet , who hasn't said what you have said about your daughter. I never knew the world was full of so many well behaved 14 year olds or are they just getting better at playing their parents-Not sure but I wouldn't take the risk of your daughter falling into the parent player category! I would always presume she is lying and I don't think you can lose! <br>  <br>   "Going for ice cream" sounds like something I would have told my parents! I think she might be thinking she is going for ice cream at best ,if you insist she always tells you the truth , but I doubt any 16 or 17 year old boy , who drives, who plays in a band and can have any girl he wants including those that "put out"  will have "ice cream" in his plans.<br>  <br>   If I were you, it would be a big fat no and I would also ban anyone this old for her. She will be very cross for a while but so what, you are not supposed to be her friend, she has plenty of those I am sure, your job is to keep her safe and not pregnant. <br>  <br>  I am so glad I never had children because if I had to deal with a 14 year old like I was, I would have gone bonkers!|`|Pc7EiyBHaa	I have a friend that has a 14 year old daughter dating a 16 year old boy.  They have already had sex and they are starting to lie about what they are doing and where they are going so she doesn't get in trouble.  It's not really good when it is that age range.  I am really worried about these two.  I am not either ones mother but the 16 year old lost his mother when he was seven and he and my son are good friends.  As far as her going to something like Battle of the Bands, I wouldn't think that would be an appropriate enviroment for her age group.  I am a very protective parent and would find it hard to allow my daughter to go to something like that until she was 16 or 17.  Does she have an older sibling that you could send along for protection?  That might be a good way to let her go but still know that she is okay and not doing anything you wouldn't want her to.|`|Q58Eedeiaa	Ok... all these people saying "Let her go" are crazy. There have to been rules and restrictions. When my daughter is 14 years old, I will not let her get in a care with a 16 year old boy just because she likes him. I may drive her to the movies to meet him... but no way would she just be jumping in a car with him to drive where ever they really wanted to go. Maybe she could go to the battle of the bands thing if she has a friend with her. Ice cream and 16 year old boys? Not so much.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	My rule for high school is one year ahead or behind.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	boys mature emotionally later so they are on the same maturity level really

It contains many wonderfully precious cells, like stem cells, red blood cells, and more recently scientists have discovered that umbilical cord blood contains cancer-fighting T-cells.<br>  <a href="http://www.bellybelly.com.au/articles/birth/cord-clamping-delaying-cord-clamping" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellybelly.com.au/articles/bi...</a><br>  Delayed Cord Clamping at Birth May Reduce Neonatal Anemia<br>  <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/530352" rel="nofollow">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/5303...</a><br>  <br>  =========<br>  <br>   Cord Clamping<br>  <a href="http://onyx-ii.com/birthsong/page.cfm?cord" rel="nofollow">http://onyx-ii.com/birthsong/page.cfm?co...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  =======<br>  <br>  Five Good Reasons to Delay Clamping the Cord<br>  <a href="http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/lateClamping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/late...</a><br>  <br>  ====<br>  Donating your baby's cord blood<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_donating-your-babys-cord-blood_1356495.bc#articlesection2" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_donating-you...</a><br>  <br>  ========<br>  <a href="http://www.nationalcordbloodprogram.org/donation/public_vs_private_donation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalcordbloodprogram.org/...</a><br>  However, parents should know that a child's own cord blood (stored at birth), would rarely be suitable for a transplant. It could not be used at present to treat genetic diseases, for example, because the cord blood stem cells and their descendents would be affected by the same condition. (See the story of Anthony Dones.) In addition, most transplant physicians would not use a child's own cord blood to treat leukemia. There are two reasons for this reluctance. First, in most cases of childhood leukemia, cells carrying the leukemic mutation are already present at birth and can be found in the cord blood. Thus, pre-leukemic cells may be given back with the transplant. Second, in a child with leukemia, the immune system has already failed to prevent leukemia. Since cord blood from the same child re-establishes the child's own immune system, doctors fear it would have a poor anti-leukemia affect.<br>  <br>  Some private cord blood banks claim that cord blood, just like bone marrow, can be "purged of cancer." This claim is purely speculative, however. So-called purging can be done by "selecting in" the immature cells (i.e., CD34-positive cells) that include the true stem cells. So far, however, these cells cannot be selected very well when the cord blood has already been frozen. Purging also can be done by "selecting out" the cancer cells. However, there is no evidence that the cells in cord blood that have the leukemic mutation actually express the surface markers or antigens needed to remove them. Thus, purging of cord blood for leukemic or pre-leukemic cells is not proven in fact; and, there is reason to believe, may not be possible.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Public cord blood banking can ensure that nearly everyone who needs a stem cell transplant can get one and get it quickly. Currently, with more than 33,000 cord blood donations, the New York Blood Center's National Cord Blood Program can find a cord blood graft for approximately 85 percent of patients who request a search. The NCBP now collects cord blood in six affiliated hospitals: four in the New York metropolitan area, one in Fairfax County, Virginia and one in Cleveland, Ohio [See About Us and Collection Sites] and will add one or two more over the coming year. We have a goal to reach 60,000-75,000 cord blood units over the next four years.<br>  <br>  If most patients can find a cord blood unit already, why do we need so many more units?<br>  <br>  At present, some patients must still make do with a cord blood unit that is not optimal, either because of a low cell dose and/or a low number of HLA matches. Much larger inventories are needed so that all patients, including ethnic minority patients, can find a cord blood unit that will be optimal for them and give them the best chance to survive and regain their health. This is why we are expanding our own Program and why we have worked to encourage federal funding to help all qualified public cord blood banks in the U.S. build a large national inventory of cord blood units. Federal funding, passed into law in December, 2005 and soon to be available, will help build a national inventory totaling 150,000 high quality, ethnically diverse cord blood units. We estimate that this is the number needed to ensure that 80-90% of patients will have access to a cord blood unit with a good cell dose and a 5/6 HLA match or better.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	No we looked into it. It was about 4,000 just for them to bank it and then another few bucks a month to store it. Our doctor said that it is not worth it. The percentage that you will need it is very very small.

jjV0aikbaa	Well since 5 wks is a long time, esp. for a toddler I would suggest going back to where you got them peirced and buy smaller piercing studs, and just change them.

Also the small small hoops, she only has one more week. Go into the store Claire's with your daughter and pick out some new earrings and tell her if she can keep the ones she has in now in for one more week shell be able to wear her new ones. If she can't keep them in you;re going to have to take them out and her holes will close.|`|sYsfI856aa	Try changing them out to rings. Yes it's early to change them but it will probably actually help it heal better by not having them moving in and out so much and causing her further irritation.  If at all possible actually try to get the surgical stainless steel hoops used for body jewelry size 20G or 18G, these will fit in the stud holes and be easy for her and you to clean. If you can't find any in a store, try calling one of the local tattoo/piercing parlors and see if you can buy some jewelry. Then just keep them clean as you normally would after changing them out. Shouldn't cause any harm.

Also, you are pregnant for a few weeks before you actually know you are, and all of that caffeine can harm the baby.<br>  2. That is a whole heck of a lot of caffeine. If you are trying to have a baby, you aren't supposed to drink or eat anything that you wouldn't if you were pregnant. If you are ttc, don't drink red bull, and you shouldn't drink coffee, but if you "have to" you should limit yourself to one cup per day.|`|N89HLv92aa	I dont think it causes infertility but it can cause complication with the baby if you drink it while pregnant. If you are TTC then I would try to start cutting back. Coffee and Red Bull have a lot of caffiene. You might just want to try drinking regular cokes while trying but not many of them. Once you conceive cut caffiene out completely. I gave up caffiene for Lent. It is really hard to give it up but I havent had it in 2 weeks.

Don't get too excited though, hate to be a downer, but sometimes an egg is fertilised, leading to false positives because the egg does 'take', there is no pregnancy and af arrives on time, if not slightly late. Try to put it out of your mind for a few days and test again when your af is due.<br>  Good-luck.x<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|SvS9T3Dkaa	hi i had the same with ebay tests this month, also 10 miu/ml and all of them were evaporation lines. the same, in certain lights you can see the lines. if you really want to know, but a good brand, such as clearblue of first response, and wait until 12/14 dpo. if it says +, you are pg. if -, you are not. good luck.|`|SaEb8XRBaa	hello, i used first response, i done it 6 days before my period was due, it was faint, now i'm 23 weeks and 4 days pregnant i was trying and with a history of many miscarriages i love it, just do another test after your a day late, just have patients xx|`|pPRYtaUdaa	Oh honey, you are going to be a mom!!! fainted pink or not, as long as you can see two line it is very vey promising!!! It is early that's why it's light pink.  As the day go by, like take it 2 days from now the pink will get darker! That's what happened to me.  Just wait a couple of more days and retake.  I took so many HPTs.... that one day when that light light fainted pink line came up.... it was a great feeling. You can try the digital one actually tell you yes or no.  Best of luck!!! Baby dust!!!|`|lSAdkvDFaa	Hi,<br>  I would wait until your af is due because I got 2 positives last month quite early on. The next day I did another and it was negative. And then my af turned up right on time! Humph! Trying not to think about it this month but obviously I am as I'm trawling the trying to conceive sections!<br>  Its hard to have patience when you want someting sooooo bad, but its best to wait babe. It does soud encouraging though.<br>  x|`|9ncWshWBaa	I think it would be better if you test again in two days before getting your hopes up too much. also one danger with early testing is chemical pregnancy where you concieve but the egg does not implant properly and you go on to have a period. this does NOT mean that this will happen to you but it is always safter to wait until the day of your missed period to get excited about a faint positive. <br>  <br>  If you saw the faint pink line before the cut off time then it means you concieved but please try your best to wait until your period is missed to get too excited. best of luck to you and thumbs up :)
a4Dqu4Vgaa	I'm in the exact same situation except I'm not on the pill (it makes me sick). I would love to hear the answers to this question too!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I highly doubt you're pregnant.  The pill can actually cause some women to skip their periods.  If your next period doesn't show up, talk to a doctor.|`|kRt9Dq7gaa	I say you just just wait some more then take another test.
aaZ0cTdCaa	It REALLY irritates me when masculine names are ruined, because people choose to make them a "unisex" name.. ugh!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I think it's a surname :)|`|Elxuvon8aa	Mckenzie to me is a river   I do not understand why so many want to take maculine names and make them feminine it seems to be a real trend and then when used for a male it sounds funny|`|Kx0XoZpmaa	Just because it means son of doesn't mean it cant be a girls name. There isn't really a designated sex for each name. McKenzie has developed into a girls name. There's nothing wrong with that. Anyway, in most baby name books Kelsey is in the boys section, but most people consider it a girls name. As long as you like the name, it doesn't really matter if it's supposed to be a boy or girls name.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Today people use many names unisexually.  Madison, McKenzie, Leslie, Alex, etc. etc.  After a while it becomes confusing when say more girls than boys are given male names.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	It's just more common for girls to be named McKenzie, and parents follow that naming trend.  Go ahead and name your son McKenzie, but I promise he'll be teased for it.|`|dPULl5hjaa	McKenzie is a girl's name in PA.  NEVER heard that name for a boy.|`|igvUbqkyaa	Although it is a traditionally a boy's name, there is a trend in naming girl's boy's names. Although I don't love this trend, actually most names started as boy's/last names that people don't even know like Laura for example - definitely a girly name, but once a boy's name!|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	who cares? I think it sounds nice for a girl. most people dont know what names mean right off the top of theis heads anyway. I've never met a boy named McKenzie.<br>  <br>  Lots of names can be used as girls names that are actually boys names or vice versa. Examples: Kelsey, Ashley, Kelly, all boys AND girls names.|`|oTlqbdAlaa	My daughter is named Mackenzie...it is a unisex name which means that it can be used on both boys and girls...maybe you need to be more educated on names and that the meaning doesn't tell you what sex the name is for.|`|4iUejzGvaa	I don't know but it's ridiculous how many variations of McKenzie I have in my grade<br>  MacKenzie<br>  McKensie<br>  MccKenzi<br>  MacKensi<br>  <br>  seriously ---- these are all people in my grade <br>  it's so stupid<br>  lol hope i helped!|`|AA10976444	Just because it means SON of something doesn't mean that it can't be a girls name.  Some people don't care what the name means...it sounds nice as a girls name.  Doesn't sound good for a boys name though.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	If you don't like it don't name your daughter it.<br>  <br>  Should people who are not name Kenneth not name their son it? <br>  <br>  If a girl cant be named this than no one whos father is not named Kenneth can be either.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Their the same ones who name little girls Madison.|`|f2MmEMg5aa	I've known a guy named MacKenzie...but of course, it was Mac instead of Mc...i dunno if that makes a big difference. I like the name tho. :)|`|2YzZ7DWoaa	Regardless of it's meaning, many people still use it as a girls' name.<br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, ever since it was used regularly as a baby name, it has been higher ranked as a girl's name than as a boy's. For example, in 1990, it was number 490 in girls names and 926 in boys. Just a few years ago, in 2007, it was 161 in girls and 348 in boys.<br>  <br>  McKenzie is a boys name AND a girls name. Just because it means son, doesn't mean if you name your daughter that, she will be a boy.|`|WCvciOQCaa	Yes, it is a male name, just like Leslie is. And if you wanna name your son that, that's fine. But doesn't mean it suits men better. Names like Leslie and McKenzie are too feminine, IMO, and I would prefer to name my daughter one of those names, than my son. (Although I wouldn't name my son nor my daughter either name.)|`|61NKzPzMaa	I have no idea. Maybe it's because they are gender confused.<br>  <br>  The same goes for Madison, Addison, Riley, Logan, Reece, Noah, Nole, Aubrey, Ainsley, Ashley, Blake, Emerson etc. Those are all masculine boys names.|`|tHkhaWsmaa	I think that the meanings aren't nearly as important as how people with interpret the names.  I do not believe there are many male McKenzies, but many females.|`|w58tUfNOaa	It is the same as Madison, Emerson, Grayson - which are popular for girls but were actually meant for boys.<br>  <br>  I have actually never met a boy named McKenzie.|`|57LFRfqCaa	I know someone who named her daughter McKenzie after a character on a TV show.|`|IqCkjljkaa	idk, but I've never met a guy name McKenzie. I know 5 girls with that name though, a couple more who have it as a middle name|`|fgPaKE3raa	Maybe it's a unisex name i know a McKenzie who is a boy.|`|OJL0RW4naa	Its used as a unisex name - J K Rowling named her daughter McKenzie. I only know of 2 though and they are boys.<br>  Apart from anything else its a surname, not a first name.|`|xpstigPTaa	idk just because I have never met a boy names McKenzie.|`|3bu2QCfnaa	Becuse it is a girls name....|`|kyCJs8SCaa	It's a VERY feminine name. Simple as that.|`|dO0vTP7Gaa	Because it is
yCwPxulYaa	Oh how I can relate with you.  My daughter got RSV when she was 3 months old.  I was so protective over her.  I never let anyone hold her,  didn't take her out in public until she was 5 weeks old, I lysol everything, I wash my hands constantly,  she was not around other kids, I breastfed, I was as careful as I could be.  Then when she got sick, I said "How could this happen to my poor baby, I was sooo careful".  Well I got assured that EVERY baby will get sick eventually and it is good for them.  Just know that this is building your daughters immune system.  So next time she gets sick, it won't be as bad.  My baby's RSV lasted for 2 weeks.  Thankfully, it wasnt a bad case (only a runny nose and a cough), but I will have to say it was the hardest thing, in the moment, that I have ever dealt with.  Seeing MY baby sick and looking sooo pitiful was so so hard for me.  But now looking back (she is 6 months old) it was just a small time period in her life and she has been a very healthy baby otherwise.  She has not been sick since and looking back, it could of been a lot worse.  <br>  <br>  Keep going with the humidier, and try the baby vicks on her chest and feet.  Johnsons makes a vapor bath that worked very well for my baby.  Keep her nose suctioned out, especially right before she eats and sleeps. Make sure she is elevated when she is eating so that she can breath easier.  If she won't take her bottles, keep offering pedialyte.  Try steaming up the bathroom and taking her in there with the hot shower for 10-15 minutes as needed (work really really well for my little one).  Elevate her head of the bed at night while she is sleeping (or let her sleep in the swing if it is bad enough).  Hang in there!  I know it is hard, but it will soon pass and you will have your healthy happy baby back!!|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	It can be very draining, but sounds like your doing everything right. They say that when its at its worse is when it starts to get better, try to elevate his head a bit also when he naps.|`|CL0Ee4D5aa	My baby has been sick the last 2 weeks, doctors said to do the same things you're doing. It is hard to deal with, but it will pass and you will make it! If the baby needs to sleep in a swing to be elevated, do that. Whatever you have to do to get through this! Sounds like you are a good mommy and perfectly normal feelings!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Aww, poor little dot!<br>  <br>  But you NEED to get some sleep. You and daddy have to take it in shifts. You have to. Otherwise you are both going to end up run down, and far more likely to catch it from her - and then you will both feel dreadful just as she's all recovered and active again.<br>  <br>  It's awful when a child is sick. But it is only the flu - actually, it sounds like only a virus. No way flu only lasts 3 days. She'll be better soon, even if it feels like forever now.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Yup, been there many times.  The only thing that I have been doing differently is swapping out the humidifier for an air purifier.  For me, the humidifier seemed to make things worse for my son.  The air purifier seems to be much better an his colds aren't lasting nearly as long or as bad.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  Do *NOT* put Vicks Vapor rub anywhere on a baby.  It can be toxic and it doesn't help.  Check with the American Academy of Pediatrics.  They now urge docs NOT to recommend it to their patients.  Our doc is with the Cleveland Clinic and they very strongly advised us never to use it on our son.

j083iujcaa	have you tried refreshing the page? it might just be the website is having issues atm
9IV1ecuSaa	Hi,<br>     It is a fair bit to read compared to everyone else's answer but there isn't a short answer. give it a read and you'll be in the know.<br>  <br>  Condoms are about 98% effective if used correctily. I know some people think not to bother using them  if they aren't 100% but 98 is near as good and the only contraceptive method that protects against STI's(sexually transmitted infections). The chances of them breaking is unlikely IF use correctly. <br>  <br>  So the rules:<br>  <br>  Choose a brand which has/check the packet for a standards mark. In the uk we have the british standards kitemark, a little like a heart with an s inside or the C E mark to say it is up to european standards. <br>  <br>  Check the date. It would be more romantic to do so before hand. Also check for any tears or creses to the package.  If it is out of date or had had exposure to air then it may of become brittle and more likely to break.<br>  <br>  make sure you have clean hands. oil based pruducts on your hands or on your mouth if you have used it for oral sex can rot  the rubber. it is fast acting, weakening it and making it likely to break. <br>  <br>  Slide it to one side of the packet before tearing open to avoide tearing the condom.<br>  <br>  Make sure it is the right way up. If it is upside down it will be dificult to roll down. It is likely it would roll back off durring sex. If you put it on upside down throw away as it may have pre *** on it so turning it round will expose this to the outside.<br>  <br>  make sure the tip has had the air squeezed out pefore rolling down. Use thumb and finger to hold the tip.  if there is air inside it may break or the sperm may leak out when he cums.<br>  <br>  NEVER EVER use two. one on top of the other will cause friction and it is very likely both will break. <br>  <br>  there isn't really a time limit on usage but a fresh one every time. <br>  <br>  So loads of things to remember but now you have read it you are unlikely to have a breakage if you follow the rules.<br>  <br>  If you are in the uk. Contraception is free, you can get it from gp's(doctors surgerys), walk in centres, young peoples clinics, family planning clinics and youth clubs. <br>  I barely know of anyone who has had breakages and like i said, the only way to protect against sti's which are on the rise in both in the uk and america.<br>  <br>  in the uk you can get the morning after pill in the places i just told you about. dr's and clinics can advice you on the pill.  some chemists do the morning after pill free for girls under 25. your local clinis will have the information on this. if you email me you area you live in(i don't want your address) i will look for you and get back to you with a number.<br>  <br>  :)|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	what the hell are you talking about Sexy Tesuga ??  two at a time will make the condom break anyway. duh.. plus alot of times sex last more than 30 minutes.. where have you been? i think your man is broken<br>  <br>  anyway to the asker.. do not listen to the first person, they are obviously slow... condoms are safe, but do break occasionaly. most of the time when they break it is before the climax so there is usually not any sperm in there. they will last as long as your "session" lasts perfectly fine for over 30 mins. and it really depends on the person using them to determin which condom is best for them.. when you do start doing it i suggest trying different ones to find out which is best for you and your partner.. the bigger names are usually better.. ie. trojan, durex... etc.. but if used correctly condoms are 99.8% effective in preventing pregnacy and most sexually transmitted diseases.. not herpes. and you should still be careful when having sex as to not contract anything|`|FqLR9CUJaa	Roughly safe but to a certain degree.  Chances of breaking is slim but possible due to improper usage.  One example of improper usage is using wrong size, putting on 2 or more, sharp fingernails and more.<br>  <br>  Get the good brands so don't take the cheapest thing off the rack.<br>  <br>  They don't break easily if properly applied on and they can last up to... um... from experience around 2 hours (sorry, can't last longer than that for me).<br>  <br>  PS: Once you remove or use a condom, change it.  Never reuse it again. (yuck and not safe)|`|3kLEE6zhaa	Do you know what the Definition of a bastard is .It is someone who works in a condom factory putting pin holes in condoms, If i was you I would use a back up contraceptive. But condoms have changed a lot , now you can get them in minty flavors and banana, but if you are tasting the flavors you wont be getting pregnant will you!! (simples)|`|WsUSAgLmaa	depends on how rough you guys are being...if it fits correctly...condoms last for as long as the boy is erect and you are wet...once you start getting dry be it 5 10 or 30 mnutes your gonna wanna stop and if you dont feel comfortable tell the boy to still pull out with the condom on before he ejaculates!!!|`|Ul5NFGNkaa	Used correctly, condoms are very safe. 80-90%<br>  <br>  They are pretty difficult to break (although this can, and does happen), but can easily slip off. <br>  <br>  They will last for however long ONE session takes, but should not be used more than once and only one should be used at a time.|`|HWRtz6ztaa	Condoms are 99% safe as long as they are used correctly. Condoms should NOT be used If they have been sitting around, for a while. I don't think they break easily, they do slip off (when not put on correct).<br>  IDK how long they last.|`|g9AAUkraaa	First of all, never, and I mean NEVER, put two condoms on at one time. The friction between the two will cause them to break. If pregnancy is your concern, you want to go to a pharmacy and buy condoms ( always get latex and I prefer Durex or Trojan brand) and some form of spermicidal lubricant. But remember if you do not know how to use them, you can always go to a clinic that specializes in testing for STD's. Not only will you get all the advice you need, but you will also get free condoms in most cases. When I was younger, I went to sex awareness classes to help me. I got into those classes through the clinic. Best of all, its all confidential.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Quality control standards for condoms are VERY high.  Used carefully and correctly, breakage is rare.  (Most condom failures are due to improper use -- storing them in a hot place, or using lubricants like vaseline, which can weaken the latex, or failure to leave space at the end for the ejaculate ... or just plain not using the condom the whole time.) <br>  <br>  All standard brands of condoms are safe. Be careful with 'novelty condoms' (fancy colors or flavors) which are not subject to the same standards.|`|AA10976444	Condoms ar 99.9% effective when used properly.  You are better to use 2 forms to be safe.  Get on the pill, and also use condoms.|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	Not very - my hubby and I have used one box of a dozen during a time when we needed to use that kind of BC, and two of them broke.  I don't call that a very good safety net myself.  We're not particularly 'athletic' sexually, either - it's not like we wore them out of anything, they just broke.  I think I've heard that condoms have about a 10% breakage rate, so I certainly would not trust my future to a condom.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Condoms - in FACTORY testing are 98 - 99% effective.  In actual usage - factoring in misuse, age, and other problems, that effectiveness rating goes down to about 90%.  Which sounds great, until you realize that 1 in every 10 will break, and with several million sperm on the loose, pregnancy is just a drop away.  Also, the two condoms that broke on us?  We had NO idea till it was all over.<br>  Want to really know how well they work?  Stay on the Pregnancy board for one day, open ALL the questions, and read how many condoms broke.  Then you can decide for yourself.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	When used properly they are 98-99% effective.<br>  <br>  Always make sure they are in date (there should be a use by on each individual condom wrapper.<br>  <br>  DON'T use more than one at a time as this will make them more likely to break.<br>  <br>  Durex, and Mates have always been good for us, never had a problem to date.<br>  <br>  (I got pregnant cos I was on the pill and it failed lol before you start thinking that lol)<br>  <br>  They will work for as long as you like as long as they are used for vaginal use. They are not meant for anal use but are still used and mostly they don;t break then either so don't panic about breakages.<br>  <br>  If you do experience a breakage, there is always the morning after pill as a backup method though this is not always effective either.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Condoms are safe for the most part. very rarely do they break if you get the right size. if you find that the condom fits to snugly then you might want to try a Magnum<br>  <br>  Also Do not put on 2 this will increase the chances that the condom will break, and will actually break both condoms|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	they are not 100% effective...<br>  <br>  2 methods of birthcontrol are better than one.<br>  <br>  so make sure when and if you have sex that you are on birthcontrol and whoever you have sex with uses a condom.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  putting on two condoms doesnt increase the effectiveness of the condom. in fact, it might end up ripping easier...
CL0Ee4D5aa	If the period was like your normal ones are, then I would say you aren't pregnant. I know you can have some spotting, but it is rare to bleed that much and be pregnant.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I agree with the first answer.  Yes it's possible.  It happened to me when I was pregnant with my first.|`|Q08p7jYGaa	My whole family went all the way through their pregnancies with their period|`|hORVMOHKaa	my sister had 2 periods and didnt even know she was pregnant until she was already 3 months! so yes you could have a period and still be pregnant<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  also her periods were normal when she had them during pregnancy!
YFPMcHCbaa	I really doubt it. She's probably feeling gas or constipation.
DNygQdmVaa	Bribe her thats what I had to do <br>  put a toy or cell phone up where she cant reach it and shell have to pull up to get it.|`|AA10504458	if you could let her spend some time with a girl a bit older than she is ,she might try to do it herself.|`|6ohUZammaa	Hi Not sure if your daughter stands ,but when my daughter was younger we use to stand up at the coffee table ,or whatver was low enough for her . After awhile she got the hang of it ,and started to climb up and do it on her own . Also we use to hold her hands ,and walk around with her ,letting her pick the pace so she got the feel of being on her feet. . Hope this helps :)
gswHFVOAaa	OMG ! Do your parents know ! email me at : tyler_payn@yahoo .com<br>  <br>  If they don't I have advice !|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Those definitely sound like pregnancy symptoms, actually almost my exact pregnancy symptoms, and since you did have unprotected sex, there is a very likely chance. You won't know for sure until you miss a period or get a positive pregnancy test. You can get the ones that detect the pregnancy hormone 5 days before your missed period or you can get the cheap brand and wait till the day of your missed period. I did both lol, because I was in total shock. Anyway, good luck and I hope that you are not. That is a lot for a 15 year old to handle! If you are good luck with your baby, if not thank God and be more careful next time... but I can tell you already know that :)|`|tsdDMCDCaa	congrats...|`|PZYOTy2Haa	Could be, but the only way to find out for sure is to pee on a stick :)<br>  <br>  I hope for your sake your not. No offense to teenage moms, but I think 15 is just too young to bring up a kid. I'm 16 & I had a pregancy scare the other month. It properly shook me up!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|SqExrSUGaa	I'm Also fifteen, and i'm pregnant.<br>  <br>  i have all those symptoms, but get a test to be sure.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|y4V47Dclaa	woah!<br>  are your parents major strict?<br>  take a test its the only way
2pxiK9waaa	Has he eaten anything new? It could be a food allergy. It could also be something different--I'd call the pediatrician and ask for some input. Better safe than sorry!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u need to take him to the doc to see if it is an allergy, or something that is harmless, or an indication of a health problem...please don't risk following YA  ppl's advice...|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I'm sure you have checked...but have you pressed a glass against the spots to check that they disappear?? Meningitis symptoms. Although it doesn't sound like it :)<br>  <br>  Funnily enough, my daughters eczema has just flared up. And they both started to get eczema when they were 10 months old. A visit to the docs in the morning would confirm it. Good Luck|`|6VR19YQWaa	If he sleeps okay....then he's not uncomfortable. Wait until morning to see how it is. It could be long gone. We don't always have a reason for rashes. If he gets any other symptoms....fever, itching, fussiness, call the doctor. Otherwise, wait a day or so and see what happens to it.|`|e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	Has he recently had a virus - my wee one always gets a rash after being ill.
vue9NOhYaa	YOu feed him on demand -- as much as he wants, as often as he wants.<br>  <br>  7 feeds is a bit on the low end for this age (2-3 hours would be more typical than 3-4 hours) , but if he's content and gaining weight and wetting plenty of diapers,  then trust him.|`|8WbfmK5daa	I had the same probably with my daughter who is a week old today.<br>  <br>  She was feeding only 6 times a day and I was told that was not enough it should be very least 8 times but ideally between 10-12 times a day.<br>  <br>  He should be taking about 24oz a day according to my lactation consultant. If your son is only taking 2oz 7 times a day that is only 14oz and is not really enough at all.<br>  <br>  You should try feeding him more often. Every 2 hrs or so.<br>  <br>  But his weight gain should be your guideline. If he is gaining and developing well he is getting enough.<br>  <br>  You can also tell by how many nappy changes both wet and dirty he is having whether he is recieving enough.|`|o23hIdOvaa	Doctors/nurses differ in their opinions. The nurses in the hospital told us a schedule of however many ounces every 2-4 hours (depending on breastfeeding or bottle). But then our doctor told us feed on demand -  a baby knows when they’re hungry. We decided to go with what our doctor said, and feed our baby on demand. She started off eating almost like clockwork, every 2 hours.|`|6VR19YQWaa	It sounds like enough. Newborns are fairly sleepy. If you can get him to take that much each feeding, you are doing okay.<br>  Average feeding times are 2-4 hours usually. He will soon take a bit more at each feeding.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	feed your baby when he wants fed...evry three to four hours is normal. if he wants more theres no harm in feeding him what he needs|`|n6XYYyoLaa	depends on the baby, though i think my dd was eating about every 2to 2.5 hrs when she first came home, but it wasn't long before it was 3/4 hrs...if baby seems still hungry after 2 oz and its been 3 or 4 hrs, i would offer them another ounce and see if they want it...
E7ViD8EWaa	I think for awhile I could. I would probably just sing and dance around for hours and hours and hours XD Or have a little chat with the voices in my head...do you get to take medication in solitary confinement? Just wondering.<br>  <br>  After a few months(not even that) I would probably go insane from loneliness and kill myself. I feel so sorry for people in solitary confinement...it must be horrible.<br>  <br>  =]|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	No I couldn't. I couldn't live without my family, and most importantly my daughter.|`|a2BBnAQ1aa	probly not cuz im such a social person. i love to be around people. but i dont think id kill myself cuz i love life to much. i mean id still get visitation right? like from brother and stuff. so i could deal with that. <br>  <br>  id amuse myself by singing. i love to sing. i like to write music and stuff so i'd do that. and if they let me have my guitar, id rock out as much as i could, lol.|`|AA11296427	I suppose i would find a way of getting myself out of that situation. I'm a good talker, LOL.<br>  <br>  But if i did have to be sent to prison, i would go crazy.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Can I have books and stuff? If so, I could survive for a while, but not for THAT long.<br>  <br>  But instead of going to jail, I would get Gil Grissom on the case, and it would all be good. LOL.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I would sing and make up imaginary friends.<br>  <br>  Actually no! I would sing so loudly and so badly that they have to move me for the sake of their ears <br>  <br>  I would rather not go to jail, <br>  }thanks tho
zSEJC6vZaa	I have the Potette Plus travel potty seat that fits on top of the toilet.  I still steady her with my hands, but I can rest her on top of it and not feel like she's going to fall into the toilet.  <br>  <br>  I like this because it's portable (it folds up into itself and you can also convert it to a little travel potty).<br>  <br>  I didn't learn about EC until my baby was almost six months old; I've been using this potty seat almost from the start and it works great.<br>  <br>  ** re: your question:<br>  The potette works two ways - you can pull the two flaps out horizontally and lay it flat on the toilet so the poops and pees go straight into your toilet (no mess! love it) or you can fold the flaps down so that they are vertical.  Then you just use a plastic grocery bag (I know, not as environmentally friendly - but you could probably use biodegradable plastic sacks).  I'm not sure how to describe it but I included the potette's website - it might have more information.  If you look at the picture, the sack handles fit around each of the potette flaps.|`|ZVCm3XAEaa	I have just bought a potty and a trainer seat from Mothercare but I have not used it as I feel my daughter is not ready yet - she is 16 months.

F7tyzrMzaa	I'm a sophomore, and trust me honey, it's great! You get so much more freedom, but lots more responsibility as well. It's tougher but it's worth it at the end. Like people say- the high school years are the best of your life. <br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember :: always be yourself. Don't be anyone else. Regardless of what's going on or what people are saying- don't give into peer pressure. I had a friend who did that and now she's 15 with a five month old son. <br>  <br>  The trick is to have a good relationship with your teachers. I do and it makes the world of difference, knowing there's an adult just round the corner who can help. I've really needed it this year and there's one in particular who's been such a rock. <br>  <br>  High school is also the time that the real drama starts. Remember to keep yourself focused on what you need to do to keep your grades up and to get where you want to in life. This is when grades really start to matter.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon, I hope you have a great time in high school.|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	Heh, I'm in high school now (Junior Year FTW) and all I can say is YES I was totally psyched for high school!<br>  I knew I was going to love it right away, and I did. It's by far the best school I've ever been too, mostly because of the freedom we're allowed.<br>  As for tips, well, just do your work and pay attention in class, if you do that, high school will just breeze by. And you probably shouldn't piss the teachers off, after all, they control your life when you're in the school. (tch, stupid teachers lol) XD<br>  Just have fun and be yourself and you'll have a great time.|`|peQGGFPYaa	High School is great i loved it. But take it from me spend more time on having fun with friends and doing things after school like extra curriculars then worrying about having a boyfriend. I got pregnant at the end on my freshman year and although i have a beautiful baby girl i wish i could have hung out with friends more and done things like plays rather then spending all my time with my boyfriend and then ultimately getting pregnant.<br>  Have fun!!!|`|dbf8Afhoaa	Well I'm already in highschool but here are some tips :)<br>  <br>  *RUMORS SPREAD LIKE WILD FIRES! Don't say anything you will regret later.<br>  *Do all of your homework! If you do 100% of your homework but do poorly on tests, you can still manage to get a pretty good grade :) <br>  *Don't let sleezy highschool guys ruin your academic career. They aren't worth it. <br>  *Understand that people DO change, you probably will too. <br>  *Keep all your assignments because a lot of teachers don't record things correctly.<br>  *Go to the dances! They're so much fun =)<br>  *Get involved! Join a sport, clubs, etc. <br>  *Be friendly to everyone =)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|BUOJJpaCaa	I loved high school. Prom and graduation were by far my favorite parts though.<br>  <br>  Homecomings are fun. You get to dress up and its not a super huge deal if you don't have boy because you just go with your friends!!!<br>  <br>  I would watch what you say and what you tell people. High schoolers are gossipy.<br>  <br>  Sports were pretty great too.<br>  <br>  I miss high school :(|`|4FhrvZ3Raa	you don't need tips its just school, like every other year at school, just more serious.|`|FhlmiI7daa	I thought high school was so much fun...my tip would be to focus on having fun with your friends instead of focusing on having a boyfriend and to get involved with a lot of school activities|`|DOWwk7Gfaa	I AM PHSYCHED!!!|`|NX4rewuWaa	okay, that girl needs to stay in middle school if she cant spell psyched*<br>  but yah, high school is really great with friends, you get caught up in fun experiences. <br>  some things that you do is get involved with weed and drinking, which you really shouldnt do.<br>  im in all honors classes and they can be stressful at times but manageable, junior year which im in is the most stressful, because thats the year you start looking at colleges. <br>  SCHOOL=STRESS.<br>  OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL=amazing time.|`|Qhyovyj8aa	I don't want to be a downer so I'll keep this short.

My advice<br>  <br>  -Keep up with all your school work because if you miss one thing you end up slacking and all your work piles up and you will get overwhelmed.<br>  -Don't let all the "drama" get the best of you because you will get too wrapped up in it.<br>  -Don't get pressured into things you don't want to do because you will regret them in the long run<br>  -Really pick who your REAL friends are and know that these are your 4 last years(you'll probably spend the most time with them)<br>  -Know that it is supposes to be your best 4 years, but also know that these are the 4 most important years in your life because they will determine what your future will be like-so take them seriously!|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	High school really is only cool for like the first few weeks. After that you're seriously just so sick of school and can't wait until the summer... XD <br>  <br>  Don't act like a freshman.

pzMupFBxaa	it is possible|`|Hu9yquP4aa	most women ovulate about 4 days after the period ends. Sperm can live that long in the body, so yes, you could in theory.|`|IVNM1O5naa	It is not AS likely, but it is still possible.|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	Yes. I got pregnant on the 2nd day of mine!|`|ctaDwSW4aa	NO. You can only get pregnant while ovulating and you do not ovulate while you have your period.|`|0ZLqL871aa	You can but its not common any time you have unprotected sex you can get pregnant.|`|zNSDHpV6aa	how NO|`|vue9NOhYaa	It would depend on your particular cycles. If  you have very short cycles (from the start of one period to the start of the next) and/or very long bleeds, it's very possible.  Otherwise -- very unlikely but still remotely possible.<br>  <br>  (You ovulate about 14 days before your NEXT period begins. Sperm can live in  your body for up to 5 days.  So, do the math.)|`|0rAgtGNgaa	yes

Good things it was deleted.<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	LMAO!! @ Soph's Mum-Mum-- EXACTLY!!<br>  <br>  I was going to say the Potty training one as well....My jaw dropped when I read that one. <br>  <br>  I know I have seen many on here, but I think that one tops them all at this point.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I don't remember most of the answers but one question that I just laughed at was "If I hump a pillow can I get pregnant?" Are people really that stupid, or just too bored??|`|f4HsyUfQaa	The most stupid one I got was, telling me what self-fish mother i am for giving my child formula over breast milk. Even though I clearly posted that I had a problem with depression, and it was not medically advised that I not breastfeed, because anti-depressants end up in breast milk. Yeah tell me about it. Some of these wise acres on here think they KNOW it all. Let me tell you no one knows it all. My motto is: Happy Mom=Happy Baby!<br>  <br>  Edit: I am the mom of a boy with autism. And I saw that stupid persons question. OML! She has NO clue what causes autism!! It's a neurological disorder. Im the proud mom of my little special needs guy. He was born perfect. That's the way I look at it. :)|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Ah, I was gonna say the autistm one - boy she was crazeeeee!<br>  I did once see someone say that girls couldn't get pregnant when on top because gravity pushes out all the (and I quote) 'gunky stuff'.<br>  I thought sex ed was improving nowadays???
AA11220327	at your 1st appointment, they will get all of your info, get to know you a bit, weigh you, test your urine (weight and urine are at every appointment) they will probably book your appoinment to have your blood work done. it is very unlikely that you will hear the heartbeat, if i remember you are only 7 weeks, it is difficult for the doppler to pick it up before 11 or 12 weeks, because the baby is usually hiding behind the pelvic bone at this time and the doppler cant hear through bone (direct quote from my own midwife) and that is really all that will happen at your 1st appoinment.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	It's been a while since I had a baby in the UK lol but if I remember my first appt, I was weighed, felt a bit on the tummy, asked a load of questions, offered advice on what to eat and what not to eat, urine checked and generally chatted about the next appointment. <br>  You will book your ultrasound probably and they will most likely listen to the baby at your next midwife appt, she may try this time though, depending on how far you are.<br>  <br>  Good luck....<br>  The UK is so much different than the US so forgive me if I got some wrong lol|`|DeXRWlR6aa	Depending how far along you are, you might hear the heartbeat. Mostly a meet & greet kinda thing, lol. You'll have to fill out papers for various things, you'll need to know family history. Any problems on your side of the fam or the father's fam like diabetes, high blood pressure, diseases, etc. You'll have an exam (like a pap & a breast) and talk briefly about pregnancy, how long you tried if you tried. <br>  Try to be comfortable and completely honest. Be up front about any questions, doubts, fears you have.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Ahhh how exciting!!<br>  <br>  Is it at a doctor's office or at home? I had my first midwife appointment at 9wk 2d at home. I had my bloods taken, urine sample taken, my medical history taken, blood pressure taken, umm.... was given information packs about healthy meal options in pregnancy etc. and she organised a date for my first scan. I don't have my notes anymore :( they took them at the hospital lol, but I think that's what happened for me. I didn't hear my daughter's heartbeat at a midwife appointment until my 20 week one (I forgot to go to my 16 week one LOL but if I had gone, I would've heard her heartbeat then). Good luck!!! xxx
mqHL4UcRaa	If the baby is in the right position for you or your doctor to see, then yeah you can see it. If the baby is curled up in a position where the genitals are not visible, then they are simply not visible. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to know, then tell the ultrasound technician and they will warn you not to look. Some ultrasound rooms have a TV in front of you so you dont have to turn your head to look at the computer. Just tell your ultrasound technician to turn it off when she is taking measurements in the genital area.<br>  <br>  Unless you know what your looking for, its very difficult to tell if its a boy or girl. Their parts look pretty similar under an ultrasound scan at 20 weeks. So like I said, tell your doctor/ultrasound technician you dont want to know, and they will conceal it.|`|azE51WGRaa	My son just flashed his parts right out at my scan! The doctor put that thing on my stomach and my son opened right up and said WHAM-O, here ya go (lol) =D Some children are more open about the private areas than others (I hope it isn't an indication of how he'll be when he gets older). My daughter on the other hand, was super shy and had to be bounced around a little so that we could see what she was. Good luck..and congrats =D|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	You probably won't really be able to tell even if it did try to flash you. As long as you tell the doc, they won't tell ya.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	If you let the tech. know they will be sure not to show you that area so you wont get flashed...lol|`|s1utniuvaa	My son was spreading them for the world to see... there was no hiding the fact that he was a boy!|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Even if they do, you will probably not be able to tell what it is. Just make sure you tell your doctor that you do not want to know.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Usually no, the average person can bearly tell there is a baby there unless it's a 3DR scan which is expensive and hospitals don't normally use them. <br>  <br>  I on the other had have had a lot of experience with ultrasound equipment so when I got my 22 week scan the tech didn't even have to tell me, I saw the scrotum immediately|`|qHAgbuHkaa	Just tell the technician that you do not want to know the sex and he/she can have you look away while they're checking all of the measurements and stuff and then they can have you look at the baby when they're only viewing the face. Or they can cover part of the screen where the privates are. It should be fine.|`|IVNM1O5naa	I personally can tell, but some people cannot read ultrasounds very well.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	YES!<br>  <br>  my son was in no way shy of showing us his parts lol :)<br>  and they were very obvious parts.<br>  <br>  then again the 4d ultrasounds are a little clearer
35a5021fa4ba3734cea65a15ca5784e3aa	HELL YES!! Why should the absent parent get away with not supporting their child?? Regardless of the terms which you and your husband parted on he has a responsibility to contribute towards his daughter!  I don't get these people and it's women as well, who think that they can just shirk their responsibilities.  If you stopped buying food for your daughter or clothes that would be considered as child abuse.  I ask, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE! Yeah I am going through a similar thing with my child's excuse of a father, and I received DEATH THREATS, and he even rang the social services on me saying my children lived in squalor and i was a bad parent!  Just to clarify I was advised by the ss to withdraw contact between him and my child as his actions were a form of domestic abuse. But he did all of that because he didn't want to pay towards bringing up his child.  Bear in mind thought my ex is totally unstable, (believe me he hides it well!) But the police were involved and all comms went through a solicitor.  Incidentally because he had to pay for a solicitor we only ever received one letter the **** HOLE!<br>  <br>  For the people who are saying oh you cant cut ties, and its not fair, believe me you have to have lived through the fear and mental strain before you can say you cant cut ties.  I tried for a long time to give my x a good amount of access but he just messed every chance i gave him.  In the end our child was suffering because of his behaviour and i withdrew contact because my child asked me too.  I believe you have to be honest with your child, i told my child that daddy had rang the social services and they can take children away to a safe place if they are in danger.  hich my child was not of course, but my child was stressed out by it all and even had a visit at school from the social services (which is good if there is a problem, a genuine problem, not a form of controll!) <br>  BUT, it is unfair for you to stop your child from seeing her dad if there is any reasonable way of contact to remain, ie a contact centre.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	If you don't need his money and want to cut all ties I wouldn't ask for it. I haven't had that problem though, which I am very glad for.|`|AA10494763	No matter what terms you leave on your child deserves a few things <br>  1.  to know the non custodial parent with that regular visitation. As long as he is not abuse to the child it does not matter what he did to you or you to him.  They ave the right to know and be with that other parent.  Don't hold your adult grudes agaisnt a child<br>  2.  the child deserves to be supported and the included finaces.  you are hurt and mad but you did not make that child alone. He needs to pay child support|`|AA10077992	If you are awarded child support - which you will if he's working - remember that when you go back to work, you are taxed on that amount ( unearned income) as well as your wages<br>  <br>  My kids' father paid an odd ￡20 here and there but never once saw them from 1969 until he died in 2004 ( he lived less than 3/4 of a mile away)<br>  As I always had to work, it was my responsibility to take him to court for the recovery of the money - which wasn't an option - I didn't have the money for the court case and I wouldn't have got the money anyway.<br>  Only twice did I get a tax rebate on the tax I'd  paid on the money that I didn't get.<br>  Back in those days - he went to prison for 2 weeks for every ￡1k he owed and then the debt was wiped out anyway !<br>  <br>  Just make sure that any agreed amount is paid straight out of his wages - not personally - you'll never get it !<br>  <br>  Even so, anything he pays , is deducted from your benefit - you don't get it as an extra amount, so, you might as well 'go for it'|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	Yes you need to ask for support.  Even though you may not need it, he is entitled to help you support her.  Whether books for school, clothes and food.  You need to have him face responsibility and pay to.  Sorry about the divorce, but if he was mentally and physically abusive that was a good move.  You and your child don't need that.  Sorry but you will never be completely rid of him because of your child, but at least he's not living with you and showing them abusive behavior.  Good luck to you and your child.|`|FcHplZtQaa	I'm just going to copy and paste a previous answer I gave to another Q<br>  <br>  it takes two people to make a baby and both of them should have equal rights and responsibilities for that child!<br>  <br>  I don't always get on with my kids father, however he's their dad and his relationship with them is nothing to do with how I get along with him!<br>  <br>  It's about putting the needs of the children before your own!<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the child support, of course he should pay, you should put the money in an account for Evie and at least that way she can get it when she's older!|`|sxecXFgraa	You have a child together so you can't cut all ties.  That would not be fair to your child.  Why would you not want him to help take care of your child?<br>  <br>  Edit:  For me, I feel a child deserves to know both parents regardless of what he/she has done.  Him lying about the cancer is pathetic and could mean he has mental issues but that's not a reason to keep him away from his child.  I'm not saying let him have the child for a weekend but at least supervised visits and he should be paying his share.|`|5F82CQ7Yaa	I agree w/ some of the stuff mentioned by other answers. The money is for the daughter, if you don't need it to raise her then put it in her college fund. And as for the abuse after fail attempts to get back together, if he's really bothersome then get a restraining order. I'm sure the abusiveness can't be good for the daughter and you. I guess you can cut all ties for now when the daughter is still under 18, but once she's an adult by law there is no stopping her if she wants to rekindle w/ her father just make sure that she knows the situation when she's older.|`|AA10730513	Sounds like he is similar to my ex. .. Although, with him - he tried to convince me that he was having like mini heart attacks. <br>  <br>  I didn't ask for child support at first. The way I feel is that if he helps with our daughter - it should be because he cares enough to do it. I don't want him having credit for being a good father when I'm the one forcing him to do it.<br>  <br>  While he was in jail, he told me he would set up child support as soon as he got out and got a job. I waited patiently, but it never happened. ... I finally filed for support last year through the Attorney General. There were some obsticals and we still haven't had a day in court. To tell you the truth - I just want to cut all ties too and am seriously considering dropping the request for support. <br>  <br>  He did help pay for about 25% of our daughter's 6th birthday party & present from both of us last year. He also gave me $20 a few weeks after that to put on the electric bill.|`|2bLEXHFEaa	if he is abusive and u can support yourself financially then cut the ties after all u are thinking of your child, u dont need him to hurt u or your child. but if u need the money then there is no harm in asking him then maybe u can sort out visitation rights while u are there to if he wants them i know abusive partners can be very clingy and possessive so id imagine he does. me and my ex didnt go through the child support or visitation and now i really wish i had!!|`|htbrtnWFaa	He owes you child support. He helped make the child so even if you don't want him around he is obligated by law to help support the kid.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I didn't ask for child support originally, I broke up with my ex while I was still pregnant and just didn't want anything form him,  But I was in College at the time and needed help paying to tuition so I applied from a service called SARS (They provide you with books, tuition, childcare, and gas money)  well they refused to help me if I was not willing to get Child Support or Welfare, so I had to ask, he was surprisingly more then willing to pay me Child support and everything worked out until this past year when I asked for more child support, I thought he was going to kill me for a second, thank god my husband is bigger and stronger then him. My Husband actually had to stand between us like a bouncer at a club. <br>  Exes get really weird about their money, for some reason they assume the money is going toward trips to the Salon and Victoria's Secret but the truth is, my ex makes $60k a year and pays $227 a month in child support, I'm only asking for $500<br>  <br>  good luck to you and don't feel like it's not within your rights to ask for childsupport.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Also, your child does not need him in her life if he is acting like that, The things abuse can do to children are truly sad, even if the child is not the one being abused.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	from the way it sounds, your child shouldn't be around him anyway, especially if he was abusive to you. just becuase he pays child support, doesn't mean he can see the child. child supprt and visitation do not go hand in hand and shouldn't go hand in hand. my son visits his father every other weekend. he is a good father to my son, and my son adores him. i havent seen a penny in 2 years. but, it would hurt my son more if i was to play the card "you don't pay, you can't see him"<br>  it is the same the other way around. he shouldn't have the right to see your child becuase he has the tendency to be abusive, and he may hurt your child. but that doesn't mean he doesn't have to pay-you should still go for child support and make it to where he only has supervised visitation or not at all.<br>  <br>  i should mention, i am all for kids seeing both parents. if at all possibile, a child should know his father, no matter how stupid he is. he will see him at the most 2 weekends a month, so if he is a liar or a cheat or whatever, it might burn your butt, but at least its better for the child-HOWEVER prior abuse is a totally different matter. he could turn on that baby anytime, or take off with him, becuase he sounds manipulative, telling you he had cancer??? he wants attention and will do anything to get it. that isn't a good enviroment for anyones child.|`|heDtLdz5aa	well you will never truely be able to cut all ties...your daughter is going to always be a part of both of you...all the way up until adulthood..when she gets married when she has a baby..ect... if you don't want the support don't take it..but if i were you i would..put it in her college fund<br>  <br>  EDIT: well with all that said then you need to do what is safe for you and your child...take the money if you can and still have no contact with him..|`|pnL5WTXMaa	it doesn't matter whether you want his money - it is owed to his child. you can't cut all ties because you have a child together. i know it sucks but try to be civil.<br>  <br>  i am not familiar with UK law, but even if you have a legal right, that doesn't necessarily make it right or the best decision. although, if he is threatening suicide you can (at least in the US) have him temporarily hospitalized. that would go on his record and when you finalize divorce agreements, his mental health would certainly come into play. <br>  <br>  perhaps youre right and it is the best thing for the child - and you.
NSqvbbEMaa	Heya, <br>  <br>  It is the males sperm that decides the sex of the baby, however, it is possible for a woman to only be able to carry a certain sex.<br>  I know someone who could also only carry girls every boy was miscarried. <br>  It can be that your body can reject the male hormone, so you just have girls. but there is still a chance its just a co-incidence and you could get a boy.<br>  <br>  Either way I hope they are healthy and you are happy :)|`|DeXRWlR6aa	It is the father's sperm that decides but I have heard of women not being able to carry boys. I'm not sure what was medically found, if anything or what the problem could possibly be but I have heard women say each time they were pregnant w/a boy, they miscarried. They just couldn't carry boys for some reason.<br>  Ask your doctor, they'd be the only one w/a clue.|`|781d71752d258090b69b654451d07ecfaa	It is true that the mans sperm decides what the child will be but I have heard that some woman cannot carry a specific gender. In the same way that sometimes a womans body may favor a certain type of sperm. I read a study about if a women eats plenty of sweet food in the morning leading up to conception that that does something to her body which makes it favourable to male sperm.|`|GUUgeptjaa	Do you know how many girls or boys are in the fathers family? Then I could give you a better guess, but since it has to do with the dad then its 50/50 based on the info I have now<br>  <br>  *I am going to go with possibly a boy...looking at the added info...|`|hORVMOHKaa	the gender has nothing to do with the mom it has to do with the sperm the dad send to the egg! its X and Y chromosomes<br>  <br>  doesn't anyone take sex ed anymore?|`|bql2RJzWaa	It's up to the male chromosome. Females are XX, Males are XY.|`|TrBoPj92aa	possibly wait and see you might get a nice suprise =)|`|BlA60kDVaa	Sounds like something dodgy in your drinking water!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep/12/gender.sciencenews" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/sep...</a><br>  <br>  Or another here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://engforum.pravda.ru/showthread.php?t=234967&page=2" rel="nofollow">http://engforum.pravda.ru/showthread.php...</a><br>  <br>  (NaturalNews) Canada's national newspaper, The Globe and Mail, reports something is happening to men and boys which concerns scientists and researchers: fewer boys are being born than girls. How far-reaching is this problem? In a study by Dr. Devra Davis of the University of Pittsburgh, the combined figures for U.S. and Japan is a "staggering tally of 262,000 'missing boys' from 1970 to about 2000 because of a decline in the sex ratio at birth."<br>  <br>  Scientists are also puzzled why there is a lopsided ratio of girls to boys being born in the Canada's Aamjiwnaang First Nation. Interestingly enough, this community is almost surrounded by petrochemical plants. In Canadian babies, hypospadiasis has increased by 60% since the mid-1970's. This is a disfiguring defect, where the urinary opening is on the underside of the penis rather than its normal anatomical position. Other countries are seeing an increase in this condition as well.<br>  <br>  From 1983 to 2005, young Canadian males in the 20 to 44 age bracket have seen a 54 per cent rise in testicular cancer. Testosterone levels in U.S. men have declined by nearly 20% over the past two decades. Both fertility and virility rates are down, including the shrinking size of male gonads.<br>  <br>  There's a definite parallel in the animal kingdom. Man-made chemical toxins frequently assault males of different species with fiercer effects. Amphibians such as male toads are being feminized.<br>  <br>  University of Florida zoologist, Dr. Theo Colborn, author of "Our Stolen Future" and president of the Colorado-based Endocrine Disruption Exchange, offered her expert opinion. She fears some chemicals are impeding normal brain development, with greater impact on males. As an example, she cites attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as two to four times greater in boys than girls. She also feels chemical exposures could explain why enrollment at U.S. and Canadian universities favors females, currently at 60 to 40 per cent.<br>  <br>  The environmental impacts of phthalates in plastic inhibit testosterone production and possibly may cause irregular genital development. Brominated flame-retardants may block the thyroid hormone critical to proper development of both the testes and the brain. University of Missouri professor, Dr. vom Saal, said, "This mishmash of synthetic hormones - leading to too much estrogen and too little testosterone and thyroid hormone - is making "a mess of sexual development in males." He conducted studies relative to sperm health comparing various geographic locations. A markedly lower sperm count in males from farming areas verses urban areas suggests pesticides are to blame.<br>  <br>  Of the world's 100,000 registered chemicals, many are endocrine disruptors, exhibiting toxic hormonal effects along with carcinogenicity. Even in mere parts per million, these chemicals can upset the intricate working of human hormones. Xenoestrogens are found in DDT and other organophosphate pesticides, PCB's, plastics, bisphenol A, DES, as well as mercury and uranium. They're in our food and the air we breathe. This continuing chemical assault from pesticide applications is taking a serious health toll. There is good reason to be pro-active in lessening these assaults as much as possible, and the effects upon men and boys is obviously a major one.|`|5DWJ0jZ9aa	No, it's definitely just a coincidence.  The father passes on his x or y which determines the sex.  It has nothing to do with family history or previous pregnancies.|`|251e336b15cf95e05c3dffbcf63eaee9aa	Possible, My mam was the same and me and my sis only have girls xx|`|QSodlfMraa	no the man sperm determine the sex of the baby.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	waw, thats soo wierd, but cool. <br>  <br>  hmmm u kight have a shock nd it might b a boy :P<br>  <br>  x|`|edzU8VJiaa	The sex of your baby is determined by the FATHER of the baby (the sperm) so has no connection with you or your female relations.  You are just as likely (in fact a little bit more) to be carrying a boy as a girl.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in knowing how/why, look up a simple genetics site on the Internet, or get a book from the library which explains about conception and chromosones.<br>  <br>  It might be a bit exciting to get a boy this time - just think of the fuss to be made of him from your side of the family....|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Genetically it has nothing to do with the women. <br>  <br>  The sex of a baby is determined solely by the male fertilizing the egg. <br>  The ratio of girl babies is slightly higher due to the selection process in nature. Women are needed to bare children, and it takes more women to populate then men to fertilize. <br>  <br>  Sorry to break up your theory, but its natural selection at its finest. All science peppered with coincidence.|`|50lIaC8zaa	Yeah it could be, i have heard before about people not being able to carry a certain sex baby. Its something to do with the different hormones, male foetus's let off different hormones to female ones. <br>  <br>  However it could just be coincidence.|`|IVNM1O5naa	Actually it is the father who decides the sex of the child, not you. You produce the X and the father of your child either makes the additional Y.... XY (boy) or the X.... XX (girl)
obN6p3Cgaa	I would keep the one they switched my baby with but i would still want to see my own child some day....|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I couldn't possibly answer that without being in that situation =/<br>  <br>  But, if I had to pick, right now I would probably keep the child I had brought up. But like I said, I couldn't imagine what I would *really* do and i'm so glad i'm not in that position.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	I think I would do the same thing as the women here did HOWEVER, I would hope that the other family would at least tell the child that they are not biologically related and that some kind of communication between us could be established since technically it would be my biological child they were raising. The child deserves to know their biological roots and heritage even if they weren't born to the other family by biology.   I would certainly want to do the same for them in return because you don't want to be wondering "what about" or "what if". It would also be good to have contact because what if a medical issue came up that wasn't biologically connected to the family and they needed to reach you for medical history or something later? Hopefully that will never happen, but what if... <br>     By keeping the children in the homes they went home to it will help those kids keep some normalacy and not have the bonding they've developed with the parents interrupted or cause them trauma that isn't necessary.<br>  <br>  ON THE OTHER HAND....<br>  I think I'd also be hiring an attorney and having the issue investigated at the hospital to find out how and why they were switched and to prosecute the person responsible. In today's world of so many safety precautions with babies in hospitals this is just not acceptable.  What were they trying to do or get away with anyway?!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	It would depend on my partner's feelings also, but I would want my child back, and stay in contact with the family so i could be apart of that child's life also.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I would like to keep them both but that most liekly wouldnt be an option.<br>  I would keep the baby i raised, but get to know my biological one.|`|hIzQyflqaa	id keep the one i had brought up and loved all those years!

0F8hauikaa	She should be doing that now. They always need some help in that area in after potty training for awhile but she should be able to do this herself by at least age five.

Some young children, even at your sister age, find it hard to clean themselves with normal toilet paper so just get her some kandoo wipes or normal baby wipes and that will make it so much easier for her. <br>  <br>  My son will be 4 the end of may and he tries very hard to clean himself but he still sometimes has a little left behind. He uses wipes still. If he pees he does it all on his own and when he poops he tries but I still go in after he has done his part in trying to wipe nd do a quick wipe to make sure.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	my sis is 7 and she doesnt knw how to do it either..she pees on herself..and dnt flush the toilet nor wipe her butt..and then she complain about her butt burning....<br>  <br>  umum..i just Dnt knw about her<br>  <br>  but they should start once they're able to go to school so around 4 &5|`|0ZPABvh8aa	I always thought, that was the whole point of having children, to have them do chores round the house and look after you when you are old. No point otherwise.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Within a year of toilet training they were able to take care of it by themselves.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	start at like 2-3. even if they just pile all their toys in a laundry basket.|`|OJL0RW4naa	My 4 year old tries to wipe his bum but he tends to make more of a mess tbh.|`|173kXTiCaa	they should be doing it before six all my boys did it at 4years old|`|1HnJXVSHaa	lmao.<br>  <br>  hire a housekeeper<br>  <br>  hah, just kidding. have your parents install some rules!!!!|`|AA10613765	My daughter is 7 she learned to clean her self when i potty trained her. I work in a 3 year old preschool and they clean them self for the most part.|`|jGZa2InLaa	my 4 year old brother does it by himself sometimes|`|SnQvsOPwaa	They love to be little helpers at two and three. That's when you start focusing their attention on helping clean up. Then you just keep it going.<br>   I don't remember then.
FtBqmFDEaa	There are kits you can buy to check when you are ovulating. Often your normal vaginal secretions gets slightly thicker like "egg white" during ovulation. Some women can tell from this alone.|`|2wdVqIc7aa	Start on the day you started your last period and count forward 13-16 days. Thats about when ovulation should occur. (I always estimate 2 weeks from when I last started.)
fgPaKE3raa	Probably Ariel i know a lot of Ariel boys it's actually an Hebrew boy's name until little mermaid came up lol.<br>  I know a boy named Chelsea as well and he hates it.|`|9y4mUvaFaa	um if u spell Stacy like that or Stacey i think boys can get away with it lol well the boy i know called Stacey can!!!! <br>  <br>  Alexis --- definately fine for a boy. esp. bcos u can just call him Alex <br>  <br>  the others r def not boys names for me.... maybe becos iv never met a boy with those names??|`|KyELCnl1aa	chelsea. my best friend is called chelsea and he never got beat up (he's 29) also chelsea is quite a manly name because in the UK there is a major football club called chelsea. so yeah, chelsea.<br>  I also have a friend called 'sasha' if you wanna consider it?|`|3g13ARkbaa	all of them would get him made fun of and get his butt kicked.  don't give your son a girl's name that is just so wrong in my opinion.  give him a name that could be a girl or boy name like alex, riley, erin/aaron, or bailey.  don't torcher the child with such a feminine name!|`|WCvciOQCaa	I would say Alexis or Michel. (I know guys with those names) Those I can see being used as unisex names. I would NEVER name my son any of the other names on your list. (Probably wouldn't name my son Michel or Alexis, either.)|`|8kfmqxXSaa	Areil|`|Hhd2TPL2aa	i think alexis their is a boy in my class with that name and nobody really seems to bother him about his name i think alexis is a guy /girl name|`|KD8vYoH6aa	Michel|`|4qKuEHASaa	Michel... unless it's pronounced Michelle.<br>  <br>  Jordan and Brett are nice too.<br>  <br>  Just out of curiosity... why do you want a girl's name. Your son?|`|uzHFbPlBaa	Kathlynn... So girlly|`|EbBpNaL4aa	Taylor<br>  Andrea<br>  Michelle|`|5HKpeVakaa	Stacy|`|Tev2I2SRaa	ariel|`|sYUUKa7yaa	Michel sounds sorta more like a boys name|`|cNYugr5raa	Michel i would think|`|FJbzvDPtaa	All its hard because those are gay names for boys . but i would pick between Kathlynn and Ariel|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Michel, as it is somewhat similar to Michael.|`|H5qJPekAaa	It is between Alexis and Michel since they could just call them Alex or Mike or Mikael|`|igvUbqkyaa	Michel - depending on how this is pronounced. Otherwise I guess Ariel but they are all awful.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	A boy named Staci? ouch. <br>  Proberly Staci or Alexis|`|CxRJwJsraa	I like:<br>  Ariel<br>  Ashley<br>  Shannon<br>  Kelly|`|UYfqzCoMaa	None. My ex boyfriends best friend was a guy names Kelly and I actually liked it.|`|AilIV0oPaa	When you say Ariel, it reminds me of The Little Mermaid. LOL<br>  Michel probably wouldnt get made fun of that much. But you would definitely get made fun of for any of theses names, just not as much for Michel|`|ildgJVJoaa	I think Michel spelled like that won't cause any problems. Staci, Chelsea, and Alexis most definitely will. I really like the name Ariel for a guy, but he might get made fun of for that one, too.|`|jZVeXOjnaa	Michel or ariel|`|PfIywLLyaa	Michel may not get their butt kicked, but the rest definitely would.|`|mMByiHaQaa	If you mean who's name is the girliest, it would be either Staci or Kathlynn|`|zAKFuGGiaa	I know boys named Ariel...<br>  <br>  Or Maybe Alexis because they can go by Alex|`|MxLmhHOgaa	alexis   - i know a boy that goes by this too|`|DNygQdmVaa	Michel.<br>  <br>  <br>  my name is kathlyn :]
PfIywLLyaa	They are safe. I asked my doctor the same question!|`|IVNM1O5naa	I used mine everyday about twice a day and my daughter is just fine. They would not sell them if they were not safe for your baby.|`|251e336b15cf95e05c3dffbcf63eaee9aa	No I dont think they will cause any harm but I wouldnt use on personally cause I would worry too much if I couldnt hear anything one day xx|`|ctaDwSW4aa	Its fine.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	its not emitting anything but sound frequency so it cannot hurt the baby.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	if u found ur baby's heart beat with one Good for you i`m 30w4d and i still cant find my baby's heart beat with it...but it will not hurt ur baby in any way.
BUOJJpaCaa	That's about how our classes went, with the different career paths.<br>  <br>  If you really love French, I say stick with the Immersion and just take Academic Geography. You said Academic prepares you for school to college/university.<br>  <br>  Talk it over with your guidance counselor. Maybe they can work something out.|`|DJpS9GDxaa	Honestly, I don't think people here can judge what classes are best for *you*...do you think it suits your capability? Will is be challenging? Answer these questions to yourself and make the decision.<br>  <br>  :)
MvMMIxjIaa	Why do you think world wide Pregnant women are advised not to eat pate,shell fish, blue cheese, raw eggs,deli meats????   Because its not safe!!!!! Listeria, salmonella may not affect yu but can cause miscarriage or still birth. Surely you dont have to eat these things for the sake of your child?  You say you dont drink or smoke you might as well as the others are just as dangerous. Liver Pate contains Vit A which the body cant excrete and can become poisonous, there are documented birth defected associated with all of these. Follow the rules its only for a short time.|`|Ul5NFGNkaa	Well they say no blue cheese as there is a very small chance of you contracting listeria which is very dangerous to an unborn baby, although youmay not really notice it.<br>  <br>  Pate is very high in vitamin A which in large amounts can also damage an unborn baby, but will do you no harm at all.<br>  <br>  I am pregnant and am eating shellfish, feta etc. I am still drinking caffinated drinks like coke (but not tea or coffee - didn't drink that anyway!!)|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	eating soft cheeses and seafood can cause listeria which is why it should be avoided, I drank coffee with my 3rd pregnancy and I do not recommend it at all unless it is decaf, my 3rd child is a little hypo now and it's the only thing I can think of that makes her different from my other 3.|`|UGHVDspjaa	eat what you like in moderation don't go mad|`|fqIE566Caa	I think it's just blue cheese I'd be most worried about because of Listeria as it can cause miscarriage rather than something to do with allergies. I'm not sure on the pate thing?<br>  I can't see the problem on a whole as long as it's moderation but I would look further into the Blue Cheese thing.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	All things in moderation. Just be careful. If you're eating just a little bit of blue cheese periodically, you'll be fine. Just done eat a huge chunk daily. I ate sushi every few weeks with my pregnancy, and my daughter was totally healthy. So, I'm sure you'll be fine.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	The problem with paté and bleu cheese is that they may contain bacteria called listeria. Listeria is usually not a problem with the general population, but pregnant women are susceptible to it. In fact, I read that 2/3 of the women who get it are pregnant. <br>  <br>  Most diseases don't cross the placental barrier, but listeria can, and it can infect your baby and cause it to abort.<br>  <br>  The chances of getting listeria-tainted food is slim in this country, but there is always a risk if you eat deli meat, hot dogs, paté, unpasteurized cheese, or undercooked meat. <br>  <br>  I love my baby and choose not to take that risk. Other moms choose to eat these foods, knowing that they are risky. <br>  <br>  Cooked prawns and 1 cup a coffee per day is fine, by the way.|`|peQGGFPYaa	hmm this is my third child as well! the first two times i ate whatever i wanted, and never thought of it i mean i was always careful of tuna but as for everything else like lunchmeats and blue cheese i never even thought about it and i had healthy babies. but for some reason this time i am freaking out about everything like i ate liver sausage earlier and freaked out so i asked and found out its bad for you. i didnt even think about blue cheese i love blue cheese dressing..... hmm i guess honestly it doesnt matter i had healthy children before. but now for some reason im nervous but i think i just need to relax.<br>  Everything is okay in moderation.
cAtWxJG1aa	he treats me like a totally equal partner, just as he did when i was the one working and he was the one in grad school.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	He's a bit more stressed by it than I am simply because I am the primary person in that role.  He's very thankful of my abilities with the kids :)  He treats me well with equal respect and appreciation.<br>  <br>  I'm very lucky to have such a man.<br>  <br>  He's wonderful with the kids but is a bit tougher than I am.  But he's the Dad so I guess that is about normal!|`|wZAeBisbaa	Well, I'm a little older than most of you, but still young enough to have had  "choices" when it came to women's roles. I have a career but have also stayed home with kids or worked part time for short periods.  Although my husband supported me wholeheartedly, I don't think he ever really understood how big of a job it is to take care of children and manage a household.  The "managing" part was especially beyond his view.  The scheduling of everyone and everything, the educational planning (especially when they were preparing for college), the financial planning and bill paying, and the social life (such as it was) all seemed to be below his radar.  <br>  <br>  Sure, he would participate in everything and help with everything, but he didn't realize that long before he went on that college visit with our daughter, I had set it up, downloaded the applications, and walked her through all the paperwork, contacted the people she was to meet with, and planned the trip itself.  To him it was a one day trip.  To me it was weeks in the making. I could tell similar stories about soccer tournaments, orthodontics, and parent teacher conferences. Most moms will know exactly what I mean when I say everything we did was kind of like that. <br>  <br>  To this day, I don't think he realizes how much of my time these kinds of things took.  When I would complain about balancing all that with parenting and my job, he could only see the fact that my job was more flexible than his. Because of that, he couldn't understand why I had a problem.  It took a lot of communication and a sense of humor to get through some of those times.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	My husband acts as though he thinks I am wonderful for doing what I do.  Don't ask me why; I don't particularly agree with him but he is so very thankful to know that I am taking care of our children.  He has told me many times that he is glad I am happy being a SAHM because it is important to him that our children are at home with a parent.<br>  He tends to have the desire to "provide" for us, and I don't mind at all him feeling that way;-)....sorta sexy if you ask me.|`|zQWNb6neaa	No, my husband is appreciative of my being a SAHM. Even more so since he had to do 'my job' while I was in the hospital for a week with our youngest. He knows how much stuff I do in one day. It was his desire, as much as it was mine, for me to stay home with our children during their early years. He also takes pride in being the 'provider' for our family- which I think is just adorable and sexy.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	no, he loves that I stay home and care for the children, him and the house.  It makes no sense to pay for daycare.  My kids are at an age where they need alot of attention and work with school, sports etc.  He prefers I stay home, and work at home as a muralist/artist. Although he cannot bear to part with most of my art.|`|QwPpLgX7aa	We just had our baby.  She is 6 weeks old and my fiance says he is resentful.  He says he feels like she doesn't have a bond with him because she is used to being with me all day.  He said he feels unappreciated because our daughter, Myka, doesn't understand how much he does for us and if she did he thinks she would be closer to him.  He gets mad because I can sooth her when she cries of wants attention.  He is a great daddy and I know when Myka gets older all she will want is him.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Omg, my hubby hated it....lol. You should have seen him by the end of week 1, an easy 10  more gray hairs in his beard alone, that's not counting the ones that suddenly appeared on top of his head. Anyway, by week 3 he found a better paying job than I had and I have been home since. He says it was no biggy, but man, i swear he aged at least 2 or 3 years those few weeks.|`|OJL0RW4naa	I was only at home until my baby was 6 months old. I wouldn't say he was resentful exactly but he certainly thought I had it easy.|`|U67DfN5naa	No, i am a stay at home mom for two years now and he understands how much work at home I really do have and appreciates all that I do.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I think that he thinks that since ima sahm the kids are my complete and full responsibility. he doesnt want to help with ANYTHING!<br>  He barley even holds or plays with his son.<br>  <br>  But I deal with it.
H0sPCJQPaa	remember that show the big comfy couch?<br>  Do a 10 second Tidy!!!<br>  <br>  Looks can be deceiving.<br>  Hide stuff in your closet, under the bed.<br>  Just make it look clean :)|`|5ba049abc44fd99ab0e13d585c2beddaaa	stuff everything under ur bed|`|CrZxYK5raa	shove everything under your  bed pull out your old homework and change the date on it.|`|8NrA3H0paa	say the computer broke down, and you lost all the work you had 'done'. <br>  <br>  no idea for the clearing problem : )|`|2BatkpPtaa	why didnt u get a ride or drive yourself?? you shouldnt be staying home for that reason!!|`|GUf19aZ4aa	well how about instead of spending time on Y!A get to work??
2irmTjQ3aa	Well if you can provide for a child by yourself.. You have a good paying job and education and can be there for the child emotionally and financially, then go for it!|`|RtIGiGrkaa	you answered your own question......your too young.|`|kKG3C103aa	We can't help you unless you give your age.<br>  <br>  Teen pregnancy is VERY common, but i wouldn't recomend it. Raising a child is hard work, stressful, and painful.<br>  Im not experienced or anything (im only 13!) But alot of people have told me this.<br>  <br>  Don't have a baby if your aged 0-17, its too young, you've still got your whole life ahead of you, so its better if you plan things out first, (E.g: Make sure u have a good education, a job, the baby has a home, lives in a safe area, and it has a dad). But for now, i'd say dont have a baby, it isnt fair on it if its raised like that.|`|r6NJrasBaa	i would wait till you get married,, idk how old you are but it sounds like your to young bc you even said it. dont you want a daddy for your baby? dont be selfish|`|Di7KqbVQaa	Just another teenager who hasn't worked a day in their lives and thinks it's ok to get pregnant while everyone else supports them.|`|19b7bd1dd32149738cfd8fca874ffda8aa	Don't do it, It's not fair to the kid. When Kids raise kids only bad things can happen. Don't be so selfish and learn some patience, which comes with maturity.|`|VYFdo6zmaa	I'm 15, I don't have a kid of my own.<br>  but I have a kid brother.<br>  and even taking care of him as a sister is almost to much for me to handle.<br>  I cannot even imagine parenting a child.<br>  Changing diapers, losing sleep, being a good influence, having no time for friends, society's disapproval, stress, money, then most likely depression. <br>  are all the downs you can look forward to.<br>  You are to yo;ung to handle it.<br>  Really you've said it yourself ....just wait.|`|QcerOMudaa	well if your in the age between 1-21 then you shouldnt get pregnant but if your older then that and have a husband and you know what to do with your life....then go for it;]|`|ctaDwSW4aa	Well, you didn't tell us how old you are so I am not quite sure how to respond. <br>  <br>  BUT - if you have to question it, the answers is YES. You are too young.
IuzaNq2Uaa	Don't you? Good luck with that then.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Yeah. Apparently you don't get grade three grammar either. Please go look up how to use apostrophes before you make an idiot of yourself again.<br>  <br>  Your kid will be like everyone else no matter what you call them. Giving them a stupid name doesn't make them any more unique. It just makes them a kid with a stupid name.|`|Axcy1DYlaa	Are you kidding me? We're naming our son Silas. It's different for sure.. you won't find another one in his class... but those names are just retarded. Grow up.|`|HOdblqIkaa	you know the definition of promiscuous refers to sexual behavior of a somone who either casually or regularly has sex with several partners. and obviously the devil is a sign of hell so if that is what you want to name your daughter then by all means go for it but its not the smartest idea. what kind of nicknames can you even have for it? missy is the only thing i can think of. and giant banana= large fruit. do you want to name your child after a fruit? theres nothing wrong with wanting to be CREATIVE but your names are pretty stupid.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	This question is just a time-waster.  If you were seriously considering having a child, you'd think of some reasonable names.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	there is nothing wrong with naming your kid something "different", but that is just ridiculous.<br>  <br>  "Giant Banana" sounds like a sexual reference. can you imagine some guy saying "Hi, my name is Giant Banana" or seeing that on a resume?<br>  <br>  And do you know what Promiscuous means? It's a word you call someone who sleeps around a lot! Would you want to name your daughter Sl*t? Thats basically what you're calling her!<br>  <br>  You have to really think about this, hon. You're kid will be TORTURED in school! the kids will make so much fun of him/her! Please, please please! think of your child!<br>  <br>  And think about when your child grows up. One day, he/she will be applying for a big Job, and can you imagine what the boss of some company will think when they are trying to decide whether or not to hire "Promiscuous Devil" or "Giant Banana?"<br>  <br>  Edit: I just hope, for your unborn child's sake that your mother or boyfriend or SOMEONE will be able to talk some sense into you, or your child will resent you your whole life. And you say "I'm not stupid, I know what Promiscuous means!" well, If you knew what it meant you wouldn't even consider it as a name. THINK girl! Think!<br>  <br>  Seriously, this is child abuse. you KNOW how much this kid will get teased, but you are going to put him/her through that to make YOU happy! Thats abuse!|`|WGfWyHQYaa	well, for one thing ur kid would come home every day from school in tears because the whole school teased them and the principal thinks they're retarded.<br>  if you home school him then when he goes out into the real world he's gonna have to make up a fake "normal" name so he won't have to hide behind people's legs all the time.<br>  if the government looks through data or takes a census they're gonna think that you're a cuckoo and they will arrest you and put you in an asylum. then they will take your Giant Banana Devil and put him in a community home and he will get a new name that people won't laugh at or think Giant Banana Promiscuous Devil is retarded just like his mom and dad. <br>  sorry to break the news to you. lol|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Wow you have thought about this alot. Think of how teased your child would be if you named them promiscous or giant. They would come home to you every day in tears because someone was mean to them. That's what's wrong with it.|`|SoUDkOejaa	What is wrong with regular names. Find something that sounds like an actual name. don't punish your child just because you don't like those names|`|ee08b687b5ca665f680a54a91f18d5deaa	Name him Bartholomew|`|OmJfYPptaa	LMFAO Go ahead I dont care what you name the poor thing.|`|S7ciZHDeaa	think of what your kid will think when they are older<br>  dont you think they will be embarrassed? <br>  people will laugh at them<br>  do you want a crying kid everyday?|`|87ujn0sqaa	Twilight much??|`|gswHFVOAaa	Just name the girl Cassie <br>  <br>  or Boy : Xavier|`|k3x48Xdaaa	That's just crazy. You can still name your kid something original like Carmen or Lila with out going overboard. I mean naming your kid Giant Banana is just cruel the kid would get teased at all day at school!
c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	Sometimes you have to stop playing nice. You need to look out for what is best for your child and you.<br>  <br>  File for child support. Keep a log of all the time the child spends with her grandparents instead of with her father. He will have to pay support based on his wages and how much time he actually spends with the child.<br>  <br>  Go through court because your ex is still controlling everything and you have no paper trail to back you up. Start the paperwork and good luck!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It is up to him what he does on his parenting time.  If he wants to leave his child with the grandparents, that is his choice and there is nothing you can do about it.  Child support guidelines depend on your state.  If you google "your state child support calculator" you can plug in the information and it will tell you how much he should be paying.<br>  <br>  Where i live, child support is 17% of the non-custodial parents income.|`|AA10976444	I would get a court ordered child support payment done.  They base it on a percentage of his income.  He has to produce his tax returns to the court.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	If she is not living with you 24/7 then the amount of child support will be decreased. <br>  <br>  It is based on his income. <br>  <br>  My sister's husband maked 40,000 and she has full custody of 2 kids and gets 840 a month. So that is roughly 100.00 a week per kid. He has to pay insurance for them. That is calculated into the support also. So if your ex makes 40,000 look at roughly 100.00 a week, but then you have to subtract out that you are not in Sole custody of the child. So if you do 50% of the week,  look at around 50.00 a week.|`|IhED5vaAaa	Child Support should be 20% of what the other makes|`|FhlmiI7daa	I would go to court so that he legally has to give you something.  They will base it on his income
E2e485WRaa	Pregnant women should not eat unpasteurized cheese due to the risk of getting listeria.  Listeria is dangerous to get during pregnancy.  It can kill the baby.  <br>  <br>  Read this about Listeria:  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/WOMENS/getthefacts/listeria.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/WOMENS/getthefacts/li...</a>  <br>  <br>  Read the labels on all cheese.  You can eat any cheese that is pasteurized. Other things can contain listeria as well and should be avoided.  See above link.<br>  <br>  Pregnant women also are advised to not eat raw eggs or raw egg yolks or any food containing raw eggs (hollandaise sauce, cesar salad dressing if made in a restaurant, pasta carbonara, etc.....).  This is do to the risk of salmonella.  <br>  <br>  Pregnant women also can not eat raw fish.  You also need to limit the amount of fish you eat due to mercury.

I went back to school 2 weeks after i had my daughter.|`|6VR19YQWaa	Well..you will miss out on some very special bonding time with your child..and you will miss out on rest that your body needs.<br>  However, I understand your situation and realize sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.  Either way, take it very easy....rest as much as you possibly can....spend as much time cuddling your baby as you can when you are not at school.  Get HELP...for that time. You will need it in order to get the amount of rest that you need. <br>  Then, when school is out, spend as much time as you can with your child so the two of you get that bonding  time.<br>  You will both be okay....it won't damage the baby or you..but it might make it harder to get healed and back to yourself again.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	depends on the school's guidelines. You may need a medical release to go back to school. Is this your first child?<br>  I remember my first child chances are you will need those 6 weeks to heal and get your child on a schedule. If you are putting your child in daycare many wont take the baby until at least 6 weeks.|`|xGedX2rIaa	nothing will happen to you. problem comes if you need to put the baby in daycare. Daycare only accept infants 6 weeks plus. You will need to find a relative or friend to baby sit. If you are breast feeding, you will have to express extra and take a pump to school with you to express every couple of hours.
UgZq1pXjaa	Because we diaper the kids from day one.  Now its time for potty training and we want to take away one of the security of diapers that thats all they know to use.  People don't like change, kids don't like dirty diapers but want to be changed into a clean diaper, but they want to stay in diapers as long as they can since they don't want change in their lives.|`|723QHuicaa	Because its easier to dirty themselves than recognise the sensation of needing to go, communicating to parent they need to go and holding it in till they get to a potty / toilet.<br>  <br>  Not all babys hate wet / dirty diapers. The only way I know my daughter has went is smelling it. she doesnt moan when she is dirty - so I have to do a bum sniff every so often.
j9RFYcKaaa	Technically, the first two weeks (how most doctors count it), you are not even pregnant yet. Conception occurs during ovulation (at about 2 weeks "pregnant"). The sperm travels to the fallopian tubes where your egg is located. The cells unite and travel down to your uterus where they continue to divide and implant into the uterine wall. By the end of the 4th week, your baby looks sort of like a tiny tadpole thing. At this point some women may not feel anything, others feel breast tenderness, fatigue or other symptoms. For more on what is going on inside, there is a great NOVA video, Life's Greatest Miracle (lame, I know, but informative).|`|HoonZJMgaa	www.babycenter.com
zNSDHpV6aa	all i can say is take a test|`|Npy1kswWaa	Maybe everyone is difftence|`|Er3imE5Yaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Is that the only symptom that you are getting?  I cant say if its a symptom because i dont honestly know.  All i can say is wait till you have mised your af and test from there.  Hope you get a BFP!!!|`|UVQrNF3daa	It sounds like the start of a panic attack to me.. doesnt really sound anything like pregnancy symptom!  but ya never know different things happen to different people!  Wait and see if you period starts and if not test!  Good Luck!
nZVmkZSBaa	You can't know without a test, or a visit to the doctor. I suggest not telling your parents that you think that you're pregnant before you're positive, just to prevent further trouble. I would however suggest that you tell them that you are sexually active, and you need to get on birth control. That is, if you aren't already pregnant. If you are, tell your parents right away -- it only gets harder with time. I had to tell my parents, and they took it better than I expected. I got pregnant at 14, I'm 15 now and 24 weeks pregnant. No, it isn't the ideal situation, but it is your fault. Make sure you tell your parents if you are, you need prenatal care. If you want to talk, message me. It may seem bad if you are, I thought it was too. But I love my daughter more than anything else in the world. Nothing else matters to me anymore. And you didn't give us much info.. Will the dad help out? Also, would you get an abortion? Without knowing that, all we can say is take a test. Are you even in a position to keep the baby?<br>  Good luck. -x-|`|vKEYa8aeaa	you just have to wait and test. you could test a few days before your period but it might not be as accurate. i got a positive 4 days before my missed period with a dollar store test and it was right.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Take a test.|`|oSMNx6L5aa	I had my son at 14, the only thing you can do is tell your parents, and call your local ob/gyn clinic to make an appointment, you'll begin prenatal care, and be seen once a month and it will increase to two-three times a month.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant the most important thing to do is get good prenatal care for you and your baby, if not it can lead to major problems. I'm always here if you need to talk, feel free to e-mail me<br>  <br>  chelsea.miracle@yahoo.com|`|sq9AtIRHaa	The best thing to do would be tell your mom. She can help you get started with everything and give you advice & help. My mom really helped me a lot when I found out I was pregnant, she may have been mad at first, but she was a lot of help. I was 14 when I found out I was pregnant. I had my baby boy when I was 15 and he is now a healthy 1 year old :D|`|F7tyzrMzaa	Yes, clearly you need to take a test. If that comes out positive, see a doctor immediately. Once it is completely confirmed, you have to tell your parents and the father. There's no getting around that. I'm sure they'll be angry and disappointed but they need to know to help you. And the father may be scared and run away- it's what boys tend to do. You need to understand there may be a chance you're in this alone.<br>  <br>  Then you need to think about your options. I could shove my own beliefs on you right now, but I won't. That's not what you're asking for. You can have an abortion (although, I wouldn't. Damn, I couldn't help it) keep the baby and look after it, or give it up for adoption.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you know, but there are open and closed adoptions. Closed are probably the one you know about. The mother signs over the rights and another family raise the child. Open adoption means you can see the child every now and then and the adoptive family will send you pictures and letters to keep you updated.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant and want to keep the baby, you need to think about if you can do it. No offence, but I doubt a 15 year old can take care of a child- I can't. You need to be financially stable and to not have to depend on your parents to help you. Seeing as you're still in high school, I'd think it'd be best for you to finish school and do what you want to in life. <br>  <br>  Having a child doesn't end your life, it makes it a different kind of life, but you need to realise if you can deal with that different kind of life. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|peQGGFPYaa	well once you find out your pregnant, tell your parents right away i was 15 when i first got pregnant and it was the best decision i could have made. of course they weren't happy but they were a solid support system and made my decision making alot easier. of course it not easy dropping something like that on your parents but its sooo worth it. trust me!|`|0ZLqL871aa	Dont think your pregnant because then you will start to want a baby and then you can start to think your having symptoms and your body will trick you. The best thing to do is try not to think about it and when you can take a test.|`|B4HtgUnKaa	have you had your period yet? if your period is coming soon then dont panic because most likely when you get stressed you will make your period delay more.|`|DT6EXkVzaa	All you can do is wait to take a test...|`|4FhrvZ3Raa	take a test!!
373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Hey huni.<br>  <br>  I am really sorry to hear what you're going through (BIG hug).<br>  <br>  I have had 4 miscarriages. 2 of which were chemical pregnancies so they didn't hurt. I've had one at 6 weeks, and one at 19 weeks.<br>  <br>  6 weeks - natural, contraction pains (about 50% the pain of labour - I did actually cry once through the pain, once I passed the baby and 'stuff' the pain stopped instantly.)<br>  <br>  19 weeks - I would have to stop what I was doing and wait for the pain to pass - at the time we didn't know I was miscarrying - although I sort of knew because I felt just the same as I did in labour with my son. An hour before I lost her, the Doctor had written me up for morphine - However I never got chance to take it.<br>  <br>  A miscarriage is very painful so please do not worry. You are going to be ok although I know right now it may not feel like it. If you want to talk I'm here to listen xx|`|BxrU8kUJaa	My miscarriage was at 5 wks so VERY early and it was pretty painful for the first 12-18 hrs.  I took a Vicodin to take the edge off before bed the night it started and was able to get by on Tylenol after that.  I'm sure my pain was relatively less because it was early and went very very quickly.  I'm so sorry you're going through this.<br>  <br>  FYI-I had my MC in July and was pregnant again by Halloween. ;0)|`|Gd9jdlrNaa	I had a miscarriage in Dec. 2007. I remember being in so much pain I just laid down and cried.  I had really bad cramps and was bleeding heavily.  By the next morning I passed the sac and the bleeding and cramping weren't as bad after that. The doctor checked me that morning and said I wouldn't need a D&C. I ended up pregnant seven months later and am due with a boy in six weeks everything has gone good with this pregnancy.  Good luck|`|oWAUb6vpaa	I'm sorry for your loss, luv. <br>  <br>  You'll be in pain for some time but remember that this will all be over with soon. <br>  Warm shower will help relax your muscles. <br>  Try your best to get as much sleep/rest as you can.  If the pain becomes unbearable, go to ER asap.*|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	Mine felt almost as bad as child birth contractions. It also lasted about 24-36 hours, getting less intense as it went. I hope this helps! Hang in there sweetie, it will be over soon! Good lucka nd stay strong.|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	I miscarried at 6 weeks & it was natural, meaning no cytotec or d&c. I didn't have much pain though, just some strong period cramps. I just gave birthto our 3rd child, 4 yrs after my m/c.|`|8eO12rl4aa	I had a natural miscarriage at 6 weeks in 2004.  I didn't feel a thing but had a big gush of bright red blood when I peed.  The next morning, I went to the ob and there was no heartbeat.  I had a D&C that afternoon.  Since then, I gave birth to a healthy daughter in 2006 and am due to give birth to a son any day now.  Best wishes to you.
cfdooGylaa	I bought a doppler when I was around 17 weeks and it said no gel was required. I could hear nothing when I put it to my stomach, however when I put coco butter or lotion it worked. The change was tremendous.  You can try doing that and see what happens. This is why these home dopplers are no good, causes too much anxiety. Good luck.|`|QSodlfMraa	them thing do not work, but if you worried go to the hospital.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Sweetie, those things are crap. LOL<br>  <br>  I never heard my babies heartbeat on a home one. <br>  Just relax, and chill. LOL|`|Ejit9dlsaa	I am 19 weeks and from 18 weeks I bought a Hi-Bebe brand which is used by midwifes and doctors.  I use this one with gel and have been able to picked up my baby's heartbeat.  <br>  <br>  Mind you, at 15 weeks, you are probably too early to be able to pick up heartbeat using the home versions.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	Have you had a heartbeat at the doctors office.I would not even try until a doctor goes over it with you.You very well don't have it in the right area.Don't worry and don't use the thing again until you see the doctor.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Try very low down but dont panic if you cant find it,babies are tiny at 15 weeks and can get in awkward positions where you cant hear them.|`|AA12062031	I wouldn't be too worried. The thing about the home doppler (from my experience) is that it is hard to find the heartbeat. I bought the bebe sounds doppler, and could never pick up my baby's heartbeat. But if you want to ease your mind, just go to the hospital and they can check for you. But at 15Wks, the baby heart beat should be somewhere in your lower pelvis area, and also, it all depends on how your baby is laying too. I wouldn't be worried|`|iCHliLj1aa	Hi<br>  I use a doppler, I use the angel sounds doppler. Mine wont work unless you use gel or moisturising cream as it helps amplify the sounds. I would not use oil as it is messy and yuck but Ive used sunscreen aloe vera gel and it works fine. I just brought off ebay the proper ultrasound gel. I find having a cold drink and trying 10 minutes after usually helps bubs start moving.<br>  Good Luck|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	No, and dont worry, those home dopplers do not always work. In fact, i have never seen one actually work and have tried them at a lot of baby showers!! I tried one on myself and it never worked either.|`|pq2q0upuaa	i wouldn't worry b/c i have one and i never herd his heart beat on it but if you feel it ain't right go to the dr asap!

Something about the canning process messes up some type of natural thing in the pineapple that causes contractions.

bf8lx9gxaa	I've never been pregnant, not yet at least. But it is very, very possible to get pregnant with the pullout method. As there is sperm that leaks out the whole time you're having sex. It only takes one sperm to get pregnant. The only way to not get pregnant is by taking birthcontrol, which it still leaves a tiny little chance of pregnancy or using condoms, as long as they don't break. The only for sure way to not get pregnant is abstinence. By not having sex, you don't have to worry about getting pregnant. But if someone is sexually active and doesn't want to get pregnant, they should take birth control pills/shot/patches and/or use condoms. I hope I could be of help to you. Let your little sister know there's still a great chance of getting pregnant with the pullout method.?|`|ffnne6O1aa	When used perfectly there is only a 6% chance of getting pregnant. This means 6 out of 100 women will get pregnant in a year of only using this method.<br>  However, it is probably a good idea to discourage your younger sister from doing this because most young people do not have the control to practice it perfectly. When it isn't perfectly practiced, there is an 80% chance of pregnancy. Give her condoms if she is having sex and tell her that any guy that really cares about her will use condoms if she insists on it.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Did you explain to her that Pre-c** comes out first and that sperm are in the pre-c and that the actually c** is mostly just extra fluid?? 40 to 600 million sperm come out in one deposit and it only take 1 to get pregnant.|`|gxGsqNPPaa	It's not nicknamed "The Mommy Method" for nothing...|`|8woXjCdraa	hey!

YehcUSkoaa	the brownish discharge sounds more like blood than pregnancy.  an increase in urination doesn't begin with pregnancy until the baby is big enough to lay on the bladder.  And at one month, you will only have a little peanut.  When I was on birth control, i usually felt dizzy.  I think it is a hormone thing.  <br>  <br>  If you are worried, your best bet is to consult a physician.  But i would say you are likely going to start your period soon.|`|do8pdlluaa	It would be too soon to know, but it does not sound like you are pregnant.

rHufcHwHaa	They only drew blood for my diabetes test at 28 weeks.  Before that, they did finger pricks to check for iron deficiency.  They wanted to draw blood for lots of tests during my first trimester, but I refused all of them, because really, knowing my baby had any kind of problem wasn't going to change anything for me.  I know I don't have AIDs, and it did seem like they were being awfully pushy.  I just stood my ground and kept saying no.|`|FGjanFY1aa	Yes, I've had my blood drawn on several occasions. They draw blood for many different reasons. hCG count, iron levels, glucose levels, genetics testing for baby, etc. It helps if you do, but it's totally up to you.|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	I had blood tests to check what my blood type was, so that if I needed a blood transfusion during labour they would know what blood to give me. It also tested if I was anaemic or not - which I was, so I needed iron tablets. It also tested me for HIV - and a FBC which basically just tests your general health or infection.<br>  <br>  I also had tests with my second to check my HCG was rising, as we thought I was miscarrying. (I wasn't at the time, but did go on to miscarry at 19 weeks)<br>  <br>  If you don't want them, don't have them. It's your choice, however at the end of the day it's for you and your babies health.<br>  <br>  I had a needle phobia before I had experienced pregnancy, Now it doesn't bother me in the slightest - after all I have been through I couldn't care less.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about them hun xxx|`|348LLs6Eaa	I had tons of them.

mVXBOI6Qaa	He's playing games just to make you mad and it's working.  In the state I live in, N.D., once the father signs the birth certificate, he has to get the test done on his own.  The child support office will NOT take care of any paternity issues.  It is a completely separate thing than say, custody and DNA testing.  All they have do is make sure you are getting monetary support from the father and if he signed the papers acknowledging he is the father than he will have to go out and pay for the test to get done out of his own pocket and then go from there.|`|E0SJx3Csaa	if he dosent show up for the paternity test then they will issue a court ordered one, it may take a minute to find him but they will . if he dosent show up to that one then they Will issue a warrant for arrest, once again it may take a minute for him to get caught but there are professionals to worry about that ! just sit back and relax, they WILL find him :)
xpstigPTaa	I would absolutely tell them hun! You will be just about 12 weeks anyways so it won't be a big deal. I am so happy that everything is going well for you!  Your family is going to be so happy!!!!!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	i would tell close family and close friends at 10 weeks for sure. <br>  they love you and will want to know.<br>  (dont worry if anything did go wrong they would understand, but i am sure you are fine given what your dr said).|`|cfdooGylaa	Once you see the heartbeat risk of miscarriage goes down dramatically. 11 weeks is close enough to the 12 week mark anyway. I'd say have your fun and tell people! Good luck and congrats!|`|XO4talxxaa	Hey Girly! I think it is a personal choice! But i know that i saw your pic at 10 weeks and your belly looked so cute, they might notice :) lol|`|AA11220327	we only told our parents and immediate family before 12 weeks, after that we started telling whoever we wanted|`|v0aKxF6iaa	I would tell them|`|RE6GBw0Baa	Hunni,<br>  <br>  i would have told the world by now, i mean obv, there is always a risk of misscarriage but it just seems so many people focus on that small chance.<br>  <br>  i lost a baby at 13weeks and 4days, and only a few people knew, and in a way i wiah i had enjoyed my pregnancy more and told people,<br>  <br>  at the end of the day hunni there are so many what ifs and waht not but enjoy your pregnancy and tell everyone whenever u want xxxx<br>  <br>  go for it hunni, the dr says ur baby is fine :D|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	ITs a personal choice really - if you are ready to tell then there is no specific time frame - just whenever you and hubby are ready.<br>  <br>  My hubby and i told our family when we found out - at 5weeks, knowing that if anything went wrong, they would be there fore support. Just about everyone we know found out within a week - which was only because someone leaked it. But that turned out to be okay cos i started to show at 6weeks and it became very obvious.<br>  <br>  Tell when you are ready<br>  <br>  Congrats|`|P7tue78Aaa	I think it's safe to tell. My doctor told me that once you hear the heartbeat that the chances of having a miscarriage go down to less than 5%. I waited until I was 12 weeks to tell the whole world but my husband told everyone at like 9 weeks. I think 11 weeks and 3 days is a good time to tell the rest of your family if you feel comfortable.|`|Gd9jdlrNaa	I would say that you would be safe to tell everyone you are pregnant.  If the doctor said everything looks good then go for it.  We waited till we were thirteen weeks before we told anyone and I was ready to tell everyone that would listen I was so excited.  Only six more weeks to go till my little boy is here.|`|EzuYExM4aa	It is up to you but I don't see why you wouldn't.  That is the perfect opportunity.<br>  <br>  I have heard that once you hear the heartbeat your chances of having a miscarriage are greatly reduced.  <br>  <br>  I couldn't wait. I told everyone when I was 6 weeks!<br>  <br>  :)|`|pq2q0upuaa	GO FOR IT! it's a very exciting time and you want to tell them before they find out by someone else, and since the baby's ok i would def tell them|`|HEdGGmkhaa	OH HECK YES!! I would be telling anyone who would listen lol<br>  You are almost out of the first trimester so go ahead if you feel good about it!<br>  <br>  Congrats :o)<br>  <br>  Send some of that baby dust my way!|`|Biim7idcaa	CONGRATS!!! i would tell them if i was you!! please send some baby dust my way. we have been trying baby # 1 for 5 months. i hope it happens soon!!|`|KlJHZRSiaa	I'm 11 weeks and 4 days right now, and I decided to wait another few weeks before telling people. All my signs are god too (phew!) but the statistics still say 12 weeks, so I'm waiting until 13 have passed, to be on the safe side. However, a big party is a great way to tell people gig news, and it'll save you on stamps later :)  I'd go ahead and tell people, if that was my situation!!! Congrats xoxox|`|dCjsVLmjaa	What a perfect time to tell them while everyone is together they say wait till the 12 week mark but your close enough. Anything can happen during pregnancy at any time as long as you are ok IF something were to happen that your family knows and supports you which you may need IF something were to happen,|`|7AYnWg3paa	NO....|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I have seen that one pic of you @ 10 weeks so im sure they will know something is up!  : )  You should be fine to tell people.  I think you are out of the danger zone..............they say that once your past the 12 week mark you only have a very small chance of having a m/c.  Good luck its so fun to share the news!  xoxo|`|a12cbnR4aa	I am pregnant with my first and I started telling people when i first found out, about 4 weeks. I was so excited that I couldn't keep a secret. Hopefully I wont regret it, but I think at 10 weeks you are ok to tell everyone. Congratulations and spread your fantastic news.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I'm bad!  I've already told everyone we are expecting again!  Haha.  I did keep it till my first prenatal appointment to see the baby and know everything was okay, but I decided to take a risk and tell everyone earlier this time.  =)|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I wouldn't. <br>  <br>  I did and then had a miscarriage, then didn't the next time and just before we did at 20 weeks had another one. <br>  <br>  I would wait|`|7iMZ91K7aa	Go ahead and tell everybody! Heck, I would of already!! As we speak, I am taking my third dosage of Clomid!! yay for me! Hopefully I will be able to share some news like that real soon!!!
SRzswqTeaa	Yes - it's done every day!  Many hospitals and doctors in the US are starting go ban VBACs (Vaginal birth after cesarean), because of a *very* small risk of uterine rupture..even though the chances of you having complications after an elective cesarean is higher!  The fact is, they can't be sued for an elective cesarean, so they won't touch a VBAC!  You can find a provider if you look here:  <a href="http://ican-online.org/" rel="nofollow">http://ican-online.org/</a><br>  other websites you might want to check out:<br>  <a href="http://www.childbirthconnection.org/article.asp?ck=10210" rel="nofollow">http://www.childbirthconnection.org/arti...</a><br>  <a href="http://vbac.com/" rel="nofollow">http://vbac.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://vbacfacts.com/vbac/" rel="nofollow">http://vbacfacts.com/vbac/</a><br>  <br>  I'm going to be putting together an online class for people who would like information and support for Vaginal Births After Cesarean.  Email if you are interested!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Yes it's called a VBAC.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornb...</a>
iMaTMWMxaa	We were told we could lose our baby from about 30 weeks. So I was desperate to book in and have a 4D scan. They are often not as clear as the ones they advertise, but obviously can be. Ours was ￡100, with a DVD. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I knew I'd regret it if I didn't have it done.<br>  <br>  My baby was fine by the way, and I watched it again a few weeks ago. Still makes me cry :)|`|ca9dEvSAaa	OH YES! I wouldn't trade those pictures for anything! I have them in her baby book, and one day she can see them. I also got a video. Now no matter how old she is I have pics from the very BEGINING! It's so exciting!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	It was worth the money to me. It was FUN.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	oh momma you better believe it!!! shoot me an email and I'll show you mine. It was an amazing experience!!|`|dd2vz570aa	Yes definitely get it done.  We were so pleased with our scan.  We had a package with two dates, one at 23 weeks and one at 30 weeks for ￡250 and worth every penny.  She was sucking her thumb, rolling round, yawning, etc.  We were even able to spot body parts that were each others.  Our baby has my ears, which are very small and she defiantly has my boyfriends nose.  One of her pics is the double of him when he was newborn.  She even had loads of hair at 30 weeks.  It was crazy at 23 weeks to feel her kicking and see what parts of her are moving that you can feel.  Absolutely amazing and well worth every penny.  Pick a good scanning place with a deal that if your baby is sleeping or being naughty you can go back for free.|`|251e336b15cf95e05c3dffbcf63eaee9aa	There ok, it all depends on how the baby is laid. If you carry alot of fluid then they work better. My sister and my friends were great and well worth the money but Mine wasnt so good as I wasnt carrying much water. Even if it doesnt turn out great it something to look forward to during the long pregnancy, thats what I found any way, get it booked= best time 27-29 weeks they say. good luck with your pregnancy you will be fine Im sure xx|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	YES! I loved it. We went twice. The second session was half the price. We could tell who she looked like, whos features she had, everything. I end up with about 145 pictures WAY more than what a normal doc gives you, a dvd of her moving in the uterus and she looked like a child. Not like the alien those 2d's make babies look like. I wouldn't trade it for anything. It something thats priceless. you can't go back and get a look once shes here. Can't really put a price on any pictures and 3-4D scans are amazing!|`|pq2q0upuaa	i had one done and the pic turned out beautiful, you could even tell my son had dimples just like his daddy, you also get to see them do different things like i seen my son scratch his self it was so cute so i would def. do one my pic on here is actually a 4d scan i had done|`|4e70613829a7b6d7f0627c5b421c5a49aa	no<br>   total rip|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Definitely!  I was jammy and didn't have to pay - long story short, I was paying for a private 2d gender scan, the clinic's 3/4d scanner was playing up and the doctor(?) wanted to check how it was working.  We obviously didn't get print outs, but the experience was amazing!  If I have another baby I'll definitely get a 4d scan.<br>  <br>  Congrats by the way :)|`|vGxipYJnaa	We didn't do it. They haven't been around all that long and I'd rather not have any unnecessary scans because we can't be fully sure of the side effects. Go for it if you want - but your little one will be with you in the flesh not too long after.
w3ob12X6aa	i feel the same way, i always want my daughter to look nice i always think of her before me and if i have to go without for her to have something nice then so be it. im the same way you can find really cute stuff on clearance.|`|HztriBPAaa	I agree to a point. My SIL dresses my niece in ugly sweats all the time and I hate it but then again mommy doesn't dress up at all either. Kids mess up their clothes all the time but that is why they invented laundry detergent, pretreaters, and tide pens! I think you should dress your kids in cute clothes (not necessarily expensive some of the cutest outfits my niece has are ones I bought at TJ Max and Marshalls) soon enough they won't let you pick out their clothes at all.|`|cu67LPb0aa	Yeah it does bother me. For me, it's quite the opposite. I buy my kids everything they need, especially clothing, shoes, accessories, etc., etc. I hardly every buy anything for myself anymore. My kids come first. I used to buy all the latest name brand stuff a couple times a month. I'll be lucky to buy some new jeans or shirts every 2-3 months.|`|4oqDhdYJaa	i hate this too.you are absolutley correct you see them alot the poor things. your right there is no ponit buying good clothes but that would be for playing or in garden wouldnt take my son to shopping mall like this. My pet hate is school uniforms you would be amazed how some kids go to school in raggy uniforms and wear them all week without being washed.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	It depends.  I don't think parents have to buy name brand clothes for their kids but they shouldn't dress them in rags either.  They could at least dress them decent and keep them adn their clothes clean.  I make sure my kids have what they need before I get what I need/want.|`|ReCh1tCtaa	i always feel bad for the kids when they are dressed like that but my parents didn't start buying me nice clothes until 5th grade.|`|FNTeLbIuaa	i agree. i hate it when it seems like parents are putting theirselves before their kids.|`|jxXbLZn7aa	My kids have the best i would dress in a garbage bag as long as my kids have the best i wouldn`t care what i wore|`|hKJIDdVqaa	well, my kids have beautiful expensive clothes, while I and my husband are the ones practically in rags.  We spend a fortune on Nike, under armour, old navy, blah blah blah.  It is rather annoying to see kids walking around like this just woke up off a street vent in NY City.  Play clothes I can understand them at home, but never public.|`|a8IRxC4raa	What do I think? <br>  <br>  I think it's a non-issue.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|OYy82bAYaa	I'm with you on this because if anything i perfer to see my kids nicely presented, i spend most of my money on their clothes and shoes. along with anything else they NEED.  i dont like to spend to much on myself as I think i'm being selfish... but thats just me.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Yea its a sign of abuse too|`|lTLaQ5i9aa	Yeah|`|XOtOMncwaa	I agree, I'm not saying they have to be name brand, but seriously if our child's clothes are falling apart then throw them away and get them new ones, which is hard for some people but if they can dress in the best of the best then it should be the same for their kids. I'll admit sometimes my son looks like he just rolled through a mud hole, but it's usually after he just got done at the park and I have to stop by the store really quick. Most of the time my son looks better then I do, if he needs shorts, and I do too, then he gets his first. I understand that some people cant afford new clothing for their kids, but they are usually dressed just as bad, but there nothing worse then seeing a mom on her cell with her fake nails and her new outfit and shoes while her kids standing next to her with holes all over their clothes. <br>  I just discovered Old Navy has kids clothes! I bought my son 2 polo shirts the other day for like $7 for BOTH! That store is awesome and they have the cutest clothes!
9hrJfhIIaa	I stopped taking my birth control on 9/18 after 11 years of being on it... on/around 11/9 we conceived. It doesn't take long sometimes.... it's just timing and ovulation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	It depends on what type of birth control you were on and how long you were taking it. <br>  You left out these important details. <br>  <br>  Sorry i couldn't be of better help, but the lack of info..<br>  <br>  Good luck, luv..|`|wWkfASTNaa	I would start charting your BBT(basal body temperature) and see when you ovulate and time sex around that. It worked first month for us. <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com</a> has a great course on charting. <br>  Or just start on CD 7 or so and have sex every other day for about two weeks or more. <br>  Also, sometimes, even when taking BC for such a short time, it may take at least a month for your cycles to regulate.

Fd4lITkvaa	Even if it's just a trickle you will have enough amniotic fluid to fill a good size pad an hour. I hear there is a difference in smell although I didn't notice one. Personally I felt like I was peeing myself for hours pretty much non-stop.
YFPMcHCbaa	Blood could be a thousand different things. Don't worry about the cat though, she will be able to take care of everything by herself. You can set up a box with padding in a dark place, like a closet or something; make sure she knows its there. She will give birth on her own, clean the babies and eat the placentas so you probably won't have anything to do.<br>  <br>  Might want to try reposting in the pets section, they may have more information. Try this link.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Leave her alone, cats can take care of birth on their own. If you bother her she will get mean. <br>  She will clean them when they are born, just sit back and watch the miracle of life.
lvLBBAqkaa	Lol. I am very familiar with castor oil. With my first, whether it was coincidence or not, it put me into labour. I was 39 weeks and 1 day, the first one ever in my family to go before my due date. However, I also mixed this with raspberry leaf tea, nipple stimulation, walking and sex on the same day.<br>  With my current pregnancy, I am 38 weeks and 2 days today, the doctor said he expected me to deliver before 38 weeks. So I got the castor oil out last week... did nothing, and again yesterday... nothing. I did the same routine I did the first time.<br>  I was strongly to believe that I induced myself the first time, but now I think she just came out because she was ready, and it was coincidence that I tried it that day.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to tell you not to try it though, if your midwife recommended it then why not? :D<br>  It really does taste foul so be warned. It's like drinking candle wax. The best way I found to drink it is mix it with 100% orange juice, as this absorbs some of the flavour and makes it less potent. Just mix 2-4 tablespoons. Don't overdo it or you will get diarrhoea and stomach cramps. My friend thought she would drink half a bottle and she was very sorry for herself.<br>  According to my doctor, the chance of castor oil putting you into labour is far greater than any other method you can try at home, but it is also more dangerous. It MAY cause dehydration to both you and your baby, and can also place stress on the baby, causing it to poo while still in the uterus, which can then become really dangerous if your baby swallows it... This rarely occurs but the risk is still there.<br>  There is also the risk that if you drink too much accidently and you do go into labour, you may get the runs while delivering your child, and it won't be pretty.<br>  I didn't have that with my first, but I do know of someone who did.<br>  <br>  No matter what you try though, and I know it is crap hearing it coz you don't want to, your baby will not come out until it is ready, and until your body is ready to deliver it. I have learnt that with this pregnancy, because I have tried EVERYTHING I can possibly think of for the past 2 weeks, and have no sign of my baby coming anytime soon.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I hope I have helped you a little, and all the best for your upcoming delivery.|`|JglwzEpiaa	From what I know about castor oil is that it easies your bowels easier not put you into labor. There are only two things that can be done to start labor 1. be induced 2. wait till it happens. I know you are so ready to have that beautiful baby but the longer you wait the healthier it will be. The last few weeks of pregnancy is when the lungs and a few other organs finish developing.<br>  <br>  The best of luck and congrats!!!|`|Yyqhbyoiaa	I used it with my first, I was over due by 5 days so I took 2 tablespoons with OJ followed by a slice of mud cake to hold it down. I didn't throw up, I did however go to the toilet a little like for 10 Min's but that was it and then the contractions started.<br>  I took it at 5pm started labour at 7:30pm and had her at 4:20pm the next day. She never once pooped inside me as all. <br>  <br>  I would rather have that done and go into labour on my own then be induced and maybe having to have the epidural.<br>  Go for it if you want.<br>  I will never take it again as I know the smell and taste now and I wouldbe throwing up.|`|40bfa85dc1438948fddb7122eee50ce1aa	it enduces your labor|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	I used it and went into labor that night. Most women will say that it cause the baby to have a bowel movement inutero, but the only evidence that they have of a baby doing that is when the woman is overdue, which means the baby would have had a bowel movement anyway. Just drink plenty of water to stay hydrated!|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	Honestly, I was that desperate as well, but let me tell you that my daughter's grandma delivers babies and has for 20 years. IF you are far enough along, chances are, it will work, but...you will be miserable. It is a laxative and will make you vomit profusely and your bowels will lose all control. Is that worth it to you? It might be to you, I just wantyed a more pleasant experience when I had my daughter. And I do know a couple women that tried it and were just sick all night. It works because it irritates your bowels, causing contractions, so if you are not "ready", it might not work. It's up to you, but I would not recommend it. And, anytime you force labor, you are risking complications. Baby will come when ready. If it's your first, they are usually late. Good Luck and Congrats!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Not recommended. It can cause contractions,but if your body is not ready for labor,it won't work. It's a natural laxative and it can also cause you to vomit. If it were to help your labor,you would be exhausted and dehydrated already.<br>  Honestly,I know it's hard and you want to hurry things along,but it's best to let your body go into labor when your baby is ready.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I knew a girl who took it.<br>  It just made her MISERABLE, she got realllly sick!<br>  & DIDNT go into labour.<br>  not worth it to me.
de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	1. Report your father if you havent already.<br>  2. why did you leave home? Your father should be in jail and you should be home with your mother!<br>  This decision is one you will have to live with, and thus only you can make the decision.

You can have everything checked out, and if there is nothing physically wrong with the baby, give him up for adoption. Abortion just seems cruel.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	I'm so sorry to hear about everything you've gone through. I suggest you find a crisis center to speak to someone about everything you're facing, and to learn your options regarding the pregnancy. If you're willing to stick out the pregnancy, I know there are many parents out there waiting to adopt a baby.|`|0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	In this question "Christan's and Catholics Help!!? that you asked you said that you have a father and mom that loves you dearly. Now you saying that your father abused you. So which one is it? Make up your damn mind about the truth and stop looking for attention.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	soooo sorry to hear  your dad need to be lock up in jail for the rest of his life. Abortion is wrong but in a case like that you can do it.......|`|4JqwBJTSaa	I really don't like saying it but I would say abort. It's a high chance the kid will have a defect or a bad life. Don't make it suffer.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	If you REALLY dont want to get an abortion(which is good). Look into giving the baby up for adoption.|`|YcLnaUo1aa	i hate to say it but yes or possible adoption.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	First, I'm sorry that this is happening to you. You need to report your father for what he's done to you. If you end up getting an abortion, see if they will keep a sample of the tissue so that you can prove it's a case of incest. He needs to face the emotional wreck he's created.<br>  <br>  As to your main question: personally, I wouldn't have the abortion because I tend to think of it the same way that you do. You keep saying that you don't want to kill your baby, and that's probably about how I'd feel in that situation. I wouldn't want to risk the guilt and always wondering "What if?"  <br>  <br>  An adoption would probably be the best idea right now.  If you really thought you could emotionally bond with the child, and wanted to keep it, there are ways of supporting yourself when you have a baby. This wasn't your fault, so don't let people start judging you for going on WIC or whatever else you need.  If you would feel emotionally distanced from it, then go the adoption route.<br>  <br>  As to genetic abnormalities, there's very little chance of your child ending up with serious problems unless there's a history of incest in your family.  There is one exception to this rule: if your dad's side of the family has a history of recessive linked genetic disorders (Huntington's, etc.) the baby would be at high risk. Talk to a doctor about your family history to find out more information on this.  (I know all of this because I took quite a few advanced molecular genetics courses in college.)  The baby would most likely be perfectly healthy. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure to make a decision relatively quickly.  The later you wait, the more like a baby the fetus is.  If you decide to abort, there's less guilt down the line if you know it wasn't very far in it's development.<br>  <br>  Just know that my heart goes out to you, whatever your choice. Abortion should be an option in your situation, just be sure to protect your emotions. (I.e. don't do something you'll regret later, abortion, adoption, or keeping it.)|`|nXxtBkguaa	Warning, this might really not be a good thing for you to read if your considering abortion, if you read this and still choose abortion it will probably hurt even more.<br>  <br>  During an abortion at twelve weeks, the baby will struggle to get away from the suction device, its heart rate speeds up, and while it is being dismembered, it opens its mouth as if to scream.  But some people would have you believe that the same baby that screams in pain, is not alive.  One dictionary defines life as: “the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms” a fetus is not dead, it can’t be, it has never died.  Nor is it inorganic, a look at a fetal development chart will show you that.  So what about an unborn baby is not alive? I can’t think of anything.<br>  During pregnancy the fetus develops at an alarming rate.  At nine weeks the baby starts to move and can feel pain, by week eleven almost all of the organs are functioning.  At week thirteen the baby begins to breathe and is comforted by playing with its fist.  By week fourteen the baby can suck its thumb, in just one week it will be able to perform different facial expressions such as squint, frown, grimace ect. At week sixteen the baby begins sucking, swallowing and hiccupping and by week eighteen it can cry without sound.  After nineteen weeks the baby sleeps and wakes like a newborn would and after twenty it begins to recognize familiar sounds and startles at loud noises.<br>  The methods by which these babies are murdered are not painless in the least; in fact they are completely horrific.  An eight week old baby is sucked out of its mothers womb, it is dismembered in the process.  At sixteen weeks a poison is injected through the mother’s abdomen that will poison the baby as well as burning off the baby’s outer layer of skin.  In this procedure, the mother still gives birth to a dead baby.  <br>  An eighteen week old baby will be pulled out of its mother’s womb piece by piece using forceps.  The teeth of the forceps tear and twist the bones and tissue of the unborn child to rip it limb-from-limb.  At six months a drug is given to the mother that induces violent contractions meant to kill or decapitate the baby.  In an abortion that takes place in the last three months of pregnancy a C-section is performed, the umbilical cord is cut before the baby is removed from the womb, suffocating the baby.  If the baby is not suffocated it is left in a corner to die from neglect or exposure.  <br>  Finally, the most horrific method: partial birth abortion.  Thankfully, this method is fairly rare, but does happen and therefore deserves a mention.  During a partial birth abortion the abortionist will force labor using forceps, delivering the entire baby except for the head.  The abortionist then shoves scissors up into the baby’s skull.  The scissors are opened to enlarge the skull so that a suction catheter can fit in.  The suction catheter is inserted and the baby’s brain is sucked out.  The skull collapses and the dead baby is delivered.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	You should talk to a doctor and the police.

An abortion is a legal medical procedure.|`|CdBxhRcVaa	uhhh<br>  i think you need to talk to a counciller or somehthing first of all...<br>  and it depends on the situiation|`|Hu9yquP4aa	How would you feel if your parents made the decision to abort you and it was botched and you lived? Damaged and armless or without the ability to walk. THEN how would you feel knowing you weren't wanted? <br>  You cant base life on What-if's and to worry about things that have not happened are insane. You don't want a baby, dont have unprotected sex. If you do get pregnant be adult enough to not use abortion as BC. There are other ways.<br>  <br>  Go google abortions and see how they rip babies out in pieces and throw them in biohazard bags. THEN you come here spouting your beliefs.|`|11b09bb2ce3a335fe5c99c70ade79ccdaa	First of all, I'd like to tell you that I am pro-choice.<br>  <br>  However, if you are purely talking about loving and abusing the child, then abortion really isn't an issue.  <br>  <br>  You can easily put the child up for adoption and someone else who would love and care for the child.  <br>  <br>  Again, I say this as someone who is pro-choice: I would rather be adopted into a loving family than to have been aborted.|`|ohsZhXRmaa	Abortion is a woman's choice. It is up to her alone to make the decision on whether or not it is wrong. I believe it is an option that should be available to all women at any time. If you are against abortion, don't get one. A woman has the right to choose what goes on inside her body. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would never get an abortion, but that doesn't mean that women shouldn't be able to.|`|pKE76Wifaa	It should be a womans choice to make on her own or with her husband,boyfriend lover whatever. I don't see anything wrong with it myself.The way the world is today I wouldn't wont to bring a child in this world just think the problems we are having now an what he or she is going to face. It's only going to get wores|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	most people live good lives when they adopted...that's not a reason to have an abortion and kill an Innocent child for the womans dumbness.....most parents don't abuse children because they don't want them the probably was abused when they were little or their head is messed up.|`|PlRYgRcoaa	It's a choice that should be available to all women.|`|MSMMdYPAaa	Its a horrible thing to think of. I'm against abortion, i can only hope that god realizes who these people are and doesn't bless them with children or maybe makes it possible for the parent to give it up at birth. In the end yes children get beaten and abused and killed almost everyday. It hurts too bad to think of it. Because they are helpless little angels that don't know what they did to deserve to get slapped or beat with a belt or even locked in there room for a couple of days. I'm not saying that abortion is OK! because in my mind it ISN'T. But i only hope that people who have anger issues don't take it out on there children.<br>  <br>  Additional- Its a horrible thought to think of all the people who cannot have children and the people that have been trying for years that have not been able to make a baby, to sit and think that people willingly go into a hospital to have there baby shredded and thrown away like its nothing, no conscience at all i cant imagine EVER doing that to something that GOD has chosen to bless me with whether i wanted it or not!  ( And I have wanted both of my babys, Im so excited to hold my lil girl when she comes in august)  And to all the 13 yrs old or younger for god sakes i hope that adoption is ur first choice NEVER murder!!! May god have the same mercy on you in heaven as you have with your children!!!|`|YUX0vy6haa	It all depends on the situation. Yes its sad and selfish, but in some cases its the best for the baby or the mother. I would rather never be born than grow up in a foster home or have tweaker parents. Some families dont support it because their religion well i say thats sick and twisted.....dont let anything stop you from fallowing your heart and doing what you know is right....nobody should live by religion to the point where you let your 14 yr old child have a baby just cus you dont believe in abortion.....ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i hate ppl|`|tht0DrHsaa	I think that if a person doesn't want to have a child then they shouldn't have sex period.  Or they should at least have enough common sense to use protection.  Any way that you look at it abortion is killing a human life.   With plan b and all the other forms of birth control that is available there is absolutely no reason for abortions.  Now With That said.  I DO NOT think that a young girl that has been raped should be forced to have a baby. In a perfect world she would go to the hospital and they would give her the morning after pill and there would be no problems, but for the little girls that are bing sexually abused and they don't and can't tell anyone then I can understand.  But regardless of situations abortions should all be illegal after a certain station. Like 12 weeks or so.  The facts are we can sit and debate over the abortion issue all day long and regardless of what you, me or anyone else thinks they are still legal and there are always going to be irresponsible people out there that would rather kill their child than face the consequences of their actions.|`|0Jv2cJRnaa	abortion is wrong. the baby is a child. not a choice. you cannot just choose to put a baby to death. thats wrong. Getting an abortion doesn't make you an un-mother, it just makes you the mother of a dead baby.. put the baby up for adoption. i dont think you want a dead child on your soul. thats just too sad. and ummm hun. ever heard of PROTECTION? as in CONDOMS? as in BIRTH CONTROL? best way to not have children is no sex. duh|`|Wk7fIw4Laa	My opinion is that if people don't want children, then they should either use protection, birth control, or just not have sex at all. It is YOUR responsibility to NOT get pregnant and nobody elses. :)|`|96HWpdkFaa	Adoption.<br>  I have people in my family who are adopted and in a very loving home and invorment.

I just want to know that can you feel baby's movement now?? <br>  This is our first baby and we were trying for more than one year. This is really a GOD's Gift. Actually on dec 2008  were planning to go to an infertility doctor and you know something it's like a GOD's miracle i became pregnant on oct and we came to know on nov :)<br>  <br>  Anyways.. Best of luck to everyone... Have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby,lol|`|dn2UCOkqaa	I am 17 weeks.

obN6p3Cgaa	Yes take a blood test Wish you Luck"""'''|`|FLOjzbKEaa	i already answered you question before.  TAKE A TEST TO SEE IF YOU ARE OR NOT.|`|S7jhThbmaa	Some of the signs of pregnancy are really sore/tender and swollen breasts, frequent urination, nausea, and cramping without a period.<br>  <br>  If you have any of these symptoms, I suggest you take a test asap. If it is negative, you might want to make an appointment to get blood work done or get a check up with your OBGYN to see what is causing you to miss your period.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8XjJzj7Naa	I already answered this as well. Anytime you have unprotected sex your risking a chance of pregnancy and STD's. Take a test, because were unsure of how long your cycles are to determine whether or not your ovulating which would result in pregnancy.|`|dqbEVI5maa	just take a test in about a week, take a blood test if your still not sure|`|VdnAH78Xaa	take a test and see|`|Q9hAQgB2aa	Pretty high, depending on when you were ovulating. I'm in the same boat actually. I had a period January 16th and nothing since then. Have you taken a preg. test? If not, you should soon. Anytime you have unprotected sex you have a chance of getting pregnant. You need to calculate when you were ovulating. If you don't already know, you can look it up online and calculate it. If you had sex within about a week of ovulation, there's a pretty good chance you might be pregnant. Take a test:) Good luck!|`|5HKpeVakaa	Take a test..... also be very careful having unprotected sex if you are pregnant the are sicknesses out there that can hurt your child. And if not  be careful because there are diseases out there that can cause you not to get pregnant when the time is right.|`|SrSRGRQWaa	Just take a test at least that way you'll stop worrying!<br>  <br>  Good luck either way!|`|zNSDHpV6aa	i dont think so but i could be wrong take a test and see what happen
cfdooGylaa	Yeah I think shes lying about it. You are right. Although there are different brands, the concept is still the same: pee on a stick. If she took 4 she would have already known how to do it. And if 4 tests showed up positive the next would show up positive too in most cases! Don't tell her dad though that you think she is lying. Let her deal with that on her own. Sometimes you see friends do things and get themselves into all this trouble. At times its best to just let them climb out of the deep hole that they dug themselves into. Good luck.|`|vGxipYJnaa	You're right that it all sounds suspicious. Since you've been friends so long I think you should just sit down privately when she's over at your house this weekend and ask her what's going on. Is it possible that she's faking a pregnancy to try to win back this ex boyfriend? <br>  <br>  Just be there for her and let her talk it out. If she wants to keep taking pregnancy tests for you, then fine. You don't need to use the "first pee of the day" unless you're in very early pregnancy (i.e. 2 days after your missed period). After that time, there is enough hormone present for any time of the day.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	First of all, No... it is NOT the most heartbreaking situation.  I can't stand when people think the most insignificant of events are heartbreaking... try burying your first and second born if you want to know real heartbreak.  <br>  Having said that, if your friend wants to make up a ruse in a hopeless attempt to keep a man...then let her.  It was right for you to try to get the truth from her but she doesn't want to let you in on her lie, so now it's time to let it go.  Expect her fictitious story to go on because she will eventually claim to have had a 'miscarriage' and 'lose the baby', which will be a despicable thing to lie about and bring nothing but bad karma on herself.  But she can't deliver a child when there is none, can she?|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Did she tell her ex she was pregnant?<br>  If she did then she is trying to trap him.<br>  If he thinks she is already pregnant, he may ejaculate in her many times. Therefore she may REALLY get pregnant. and no one will know she lied.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	wowie.. well you know her better than us. I would say from your explaination that she is NOT and pretending to be. Tell her that you will support her if she really is but that its not good to lie about these things cause shes only hurting herself and family by it. I am sure when she realizes shes not she will use the miscarriage excuse to get even more sympathy. I think she might be going through a hard time in her life. Suggest she gets help. Tell her dad privately you feel there is some mental problems there and that you think she might be desperate and do something foolish and get pregnant. Then leave it alone. IF you interfere to much you are going to be sorry. I wouldnt be friends with someone that lied to me about that, I would try to help them but I wouldnt stay friends.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Okay, it sounds like she is lying but to cover up her lie, she could tell everyone that she miscarried. Then she will even get more attention. She craves attention and these are ways to get it. At least she is not telling everyone that she is getting an abortion ( My ex best friend did that, there were a lot of umipressed people, and now we all hate her ). <br>  Just look her straight in her eyes and tell her, you know she's lying.<br>  <br>  What a moron!|`|pq2q0upuaa	i would say she's lying because it is very rare to have all thouse positive and all of a sudden have a neg. i wouldnt believe her til i went to the dr with her|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	If she is lying then you've got a screwed up friend and if she isn't lying then YOU are a screwed up friend.|`|7cad49a9fe3378a1b09289b9efb0492caa	Her dad will find out soon enough if she's not pregnant, I think you just should just stay out of it.|`|CpARO2Fhaa	I kind of think she is lying...
a12cbnR4aa	It depends, how many blue lines show up. If only one then not pregnant. If two appear then that means pregnant.|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	Well I guess it would depend on the test. Try reading the directions or calling the 800 number on the box.|`|KH6HAZdBaa	on the first response ones, one pink line means not pregnant, but you'd have to look on the back of the box to be sure.|`|yKS2UI87aa	It usually depends on how many lines not the color.

I think one line means okay and two lines means pregnant. Try reading the box for the answer. (:|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Depends on the brand. The color doesn't really mean much. It's usually if it's two lines instead of one. Or if it's a plus instead of a minus means you're pregnant.
nZVmkZSBaa	Think positive.<br>  <br>  It helps... :D<br>  <br>  =D
paHjJrrdaa	You can certainly tone up! The most recommended workout during pregnancy is yoga.  Find a place that does yoga for pregnant women. It's a great way to meet other moms to be and it makes delivery much more easier, which is why it is most recommended. I have a friend who is a yoga instruct er. She has 3 kids and does yoga 5 days a week.  She said none of her child labors lasted more than 6 hours! Her last less than 1 hour!  The docs told her it was because she worked out vital muscles during yoga that helps the baby move along! Wow! That's worth the effort!|`|o2wP7mTdaa	I'm sure if pre pregnancy you ate junk food and sat on the couch all day (not saying you did- just an example) and then find out your pregnant and start eating super healthy (not dieting to loose weight) and walking or light exercise- I'm sure it's fine and healthy even if you don't loose weight it will tone your muscles.
YFPMcHCbaa	Extremely low. I wouldn't worry.
YQrKQ5PAaa	Well, he might've thought you MEANT it was okay to kiss you like that. He didn't seem to know it was your first. Maybe talk about it with him? :)|`|WGAFP6mSaa	Well, it depends on if he did or did not know it was your first kiss.<br>  <br>  If he did know that it was your first kiss, that was a little too much. It would've been so much nicer if it was a peck. If he didn't know that it was your first kiss, he may have thought you know what you were doing so he just went with it.<br>  <br>  Either way, if you felt comfortable kissing him and you didn't feel it was too much, then it wasn't. I wish you the best for you and your boyfriend's relationship.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Did he know it was your first time? <br>  If he didn't he probably thought you knew what you were doing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj_Mp4XigXgNBCnI0CecIhjtxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309133207AAmwh1n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|8ClVIXjsaa	NO WAY.<br>  my boyfriend and i have been going out for a month last friday.<br>  and saturday he asked me if he could kiss me. and it was with tongue.<br>  and it was my first kiss too.<br>  <br>  so i think it is not weird.|`|drI1vsJdaa	Nah.

2ObqoJbKaa	Your fine hon, and your not pregnant. The pills work pretty well, if you take them correctly every day around the same time. have you been taking them right every day? If you have then you really don't have to worry about getting pregnant. The pill is pretty effective at preventing pregnancy. You should only worry about pregnancy if you have been missing some of your pills. but I think your fine and not pregnant, especially if he didn't cu m inside of you. good luck.
xgi07s60aa	Possible?<br>  Yes<br>  <br>  Probable?<br>  Nope.<br>  <br>  Unless if you had your whole hand covered in c**, then maybe.<br>  If you're that worried, search online and educate yourself. :)|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Depends on which finger your using lol|`|5SHPRfUgaa	No it is not possible|`|4qcXECiPaa	if you have *** or precum containing sperm on your fingers that even just touched the vagina then sure it can get her pregnant, the chances aren't very high but they are there|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Sperm dies when it hits the air.

zSEJC6vZaa	It's probably too soon.  The first time I had an ultrasound, they couldn't find a heartbeat either.  <br>  <br>  I know it's hard not to stress, but try to remember that you need to get plenty of rest and take good care of yourself right now.  <br>  <br>  Pamper yourself, take a yoga class, and don't get fixated on it.|`|5SHPRfUgaa	It could be that you are just to early along to see anything. Good luck hun!|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	How far along are you? Heartbeat is not necessarily visible until around week 5 or 6. My first pregnancy, I had no heartbeat at 6 weeks. They said it could be just not visible yet, or I could be miscarrying. That night, I had a miscarriage. My sister had no visible heartbeat at week 6, and her baby is 4 years old now! It's hard to tell sweetie. Please dont worry, that will only make it worse. Did they draw your blood? Your HCG and progesterine levels could tell you if something is wrong. Good luck!
Ex3XC0ayaa	The Chances are very high that you could be.It only take one time of unprotected sex...|`|kcq1QW6Daa	Way too many opinions.. Not enough fact..|`|AA11042261	I got pregnant one weekend after my period, so there is definitely a chance.
96HWpdkFaa	Talk to your daughter about safe sex...so if she does make that choice she will not get an STD and she can prevent herself from getting pregnant.|`|weu4Ip99aa	Yeah it's very high if she is sexually active.... sit her down and talk to her. I'm sure she knows a girl who is pregnant thats her age... (too many teenage pregnancies) and i'm also sure she knows what can happen if she has sex... but still, sit her down and let her ask questions if she needs to.
PZYOTy2Haa	Not necesseraly. As you said.. your periods are irregular. I'm guessing it may be a little early to test yet.. in a week or so you should be able to tell with a pee test.|`|AA12176873	u CAN take a Early preg test up to 4 days b4 ur missed period (i would say take it around March 11thISH) if it is neg then wait 2 more days and try again. then again. if u havent started ny March 20 i would schedule a test with a dr.<br>  preg test , test HGC or HCg whatever and that doubles every 2 days.<br>  <br>  also take it first thing in the morn... thats when the hgc is strongest in ur urine...<br>  <br>  GL and btw USE a CONDOM!
B5MDTdtPaa	she hurt herself? you can put some cream on the cut for wounds like sudacrem to help it heal quicker and you can give her tyleno/calpol for the pain|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	You can use Neosporin if it's not on her hands or somewhere she might be able to get it in her mouth.<br>  <br>  If you're nursing, breastmilk works well, also.
KOYC3XkJaa	Well your actual birthday is the day you are born.<br>  If you're asking why someone is considered 1 day old when they're born vs 9 months 1 day old, there are a few reasons. <br>  Firstly, gestation isn't exactly 9 months. That is just the average. Very few babies are born exactly 9 months after conception; most mothers also don't know the exact date their child was conceived, so they can't use time of conception to calculate age. <br>  Furthermore, in some religions and cultures, babies are not really considered to be human until they have taken their first breath, which is when the soul enters the body. So they would count from the day of birth because of that.<br>  And finally, in some cultures, ages *are* calculated from time of conception or at least a guess of it. I don't know if it holds true in modern times, but in the 1800s and early 1900s that's how age was calculated in China.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Because people don't know the exact day they concieved a baby.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Because you were born on your birthday, not 9 months from then.|`|yB5go5wbaa	because its your BIRTH day, not your conceived day.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Why would we?  <br>  <br>  Because we celebrate the day we were born.

I can see how people might think that with Gabrielle, which is another feminine form of Gabriel.  I can understand how some people might miss the fairly subtle difference in how those two spellings are pronounced (or how the extra L and E at the end of Gabrielle might be accidentally left off when someone is writing it out).  But Gabriella ends in an A, which makes a totally different sound regardless of what your native language is and there are no way any reasonable person would mix them up.<br>  <br>  My name is Gabrielle and the only confusion I've ever really had over it was whether it's pronounced "Gah-Bri-Elle" or "Gay-Bri-Elle."  I go with the pronunciation that has the hard A sound (the second one) since I go by the nickname Gabe.|`|zwJaIDFeaa	gabriella ... hmmm i <3 the name gabriella. i don't compare it to gabriel. i know a person named gabriella and a person named gabriel. haha. they are going out wit each other <3|`|dW9C6aswaa	I don't think they are to close to one another one is definitely boy and the other is definitely Girl!<br>  <br>  <br>  for a girl nickname would be Gabby and boy would be Gabe|`|dR2bqUixaa	I think your right.
ca9dEvSAaa	Hey I hate to burst your bubble! My baby measured 2 weeks ahead my whole pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Ultrasound due date- March 2<br>  LMP due date- March 13<br>  <br>  It's now March 9 and I'm still pregnant. I would go with LMP. Ultrasounds are an 'estimate' as babies grow at different rates.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	when i was at about 20 weeks i was measuring 30. now finally at 30 weeks and im measuring for my week.. all depends on how you grow, everyone is different..|`|F8KmTbqjaa	You could be or your baby could just be a bit bigger than "normal".  I always measured 2 weeks ahead from day 1.  I actually knew the exact date that I conceived since I was charting and had been trying for 15 months, so she was just big.  If you are further along than you thought that's ok.  Your baby will come when they are ready anyway!  Good Luck.|`|kT7GVOosaa	an ultrasound due date is always more accurate then a LMP due date.
HEXHdNKLaa	I am not sure, but i have that problem too. i have to constantly eat to keep up my wieght and if i dont eat or eat enough, the wieght drops off like crazy. i had trouble gaining wieght at the beginning of my pregnancy too. by 6 months i had only managed to gain 6 lbs. but once i got into about 6 1/2 months i started gaining MUCH more weight.so i guess i would just keep eating alot, and you should start gaining some weight in the upcoming months.<br>  i told my doctor i was concerned about not gaining weight, and he said that as long as the baby is growing, its not really a problem and that i would probably gain weight later in the pregnancy, and i did.|`|plI0WOrUaa	You clearly have a major metabolism issue.  If you were like this before pregnancy, it is bound to be worse now, being that pregnancy increases your metabolism!  I don't know, but I think that you need to have your metabolism or thyroid checked.  You need a doctor that will listen to you, and unfortunately you may have to pay out of pocket to ensure that you are able to properly provide for the baby.  I hope it all works out and that someone listens!!|`|zSEJC6vZaa	I would make a food diary for a week - write down everything you eat (what and how much and when) and bring it with you to your next appointment.  This way, you can show her exactly what you are eating.  <br>  <br>  She may be busy (most OBs are b/c there is a shortage of them), and she might be trying to do the "bad cop" thing with you...or she might just have really bad bedside manner.  Either way, she is concerned about your weight loss.  Regardless of whether you've always been like this or not, your body needs the extra calories right now.<br>  <br>  That's why it's really important that you make her aware of just how much you're eating.  She needs to know this information to give you the best care.<br>  <br>  *edit:<br>  If you show her your food diary (maybe also email it to her a couple of days before your next appointment) and she still doesn't change her manner, I'd suggest looking into a male OB.  I used to think that I'd be weirded out, but I actually like them better.  I think they are a little more careful and cautious than the female ones (total generalization, I know).  At least make an appointment and try it out.
bTlhBX3daa	You could schedule an appt. all the way up until you have the baby, though it would be preferable to be seen at about 8 weeks along when possible.|`|kT7GVOosaa	you can wait as long as you want but it isn't advised. you want to go sometime in your first trimester so that you can be sure of your due date and that you have no complications. plus there are certain blood tests that have to be done by certain weeks. if you wait you cant get these tests done. I would make an appointment as soon as possible.|`|yKS2UI87aa	You should not wait they need to test for things, prescribe prenatals, listen for the heartbeat etc.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	try to get seen as soon as possible.  Start taking your prenatal vitamins.|`|cfdooGylaa	Do you mean earliest? You can schedule one now but most probably won't take you until you are 8 - 12 weeks pregnant. As for latest, you can schedule an appt as late as you want, but why would you want to do that? Prenatal care is important. Good luck.
YGsssVb1aa	Robert - its the kind of name everyone likes|`|Y8ZmuWwgaa	I love the dashing sound of Rupert -- it makes me think of a young, good looking Englishman. But I'd be more likely to use Robert myself as it's a bit more classic and is truly a timeless boys' name. <br>  <br>  If I have to choose, I'll be bold and say Rupert. It's more exciting.|`|BGPaqU4gaa	I don't like either, but if I had to pick one, I'd pick Robert. You can shorten it to Rob. Whereas what can you shorten Rupert to? Rupe? Yuk.|`|aIjOfkM8aa	Rupert is unique|`|D0y3MwDcaa	Robert.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Robert|`|HztriBPAaa	Robert, I just prefer the way it sounds.|`|CxRJwJsraa	I really LOVE both!! I also like Robin.<br>  <br>  I guess when really forced to chose, I like Robert best.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Robert|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Robert.|`|igMh0iL3aa	Robert|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Robert, I think.  I love Bobby.  Rupert's cute, though.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Robert, the nickname Rob is cute :)
fS9lryRkaa	Well to be honest with you it is wierd (no offence) but like any name it would just take some time to get used to. Also, the school, friends, and everyone would have a hard time pronoucing the name. It's your choice and the meaning is nice. Hope this helps you any|`|8fEwbIgLaa	erm....not really to my tase...but then again it's your baby!<br>  at school teachers have trouble pronouncing my name - Mhairi (prononced Mah-ray) :P|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	It's nice|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	i wouldn't name my kid that but if you like then go for it.|`|aimzj38faa	This is hysterical. 'Zuri' is the name I was going to use for a character in a novel I'm working on, short for Zurinya.<br>  <br>  'Neveah' is extremely overused and is commonly associated with white-trash and lower class names, although despite that I do think it is pretty.<br>  <br>  Oh the whole, though, it is an extremely odd name, and odd names usually end up being cause for resentment, UNLESS it has ancestral signifigance- for example, are you guys actually from areas of the world where Swahili is spoken? If so, go for it. If not, you might want to think about at least giving her a more normal middle name so she can go by 'Ann' or 'Sarah' if she so chooses.|`|5dcZRW6naa	zuri is okay but i prefer suri which means red rose and princess in hebrew and please dont use neveah too amny people are starting to use it and frankly its heaven speelled backwards so WHAT?|`|aEGgO5Knaa	I think its beautiful! It doesnt sound made up and fairy-taley either..i think its perfect!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	uh, it's okay. Where did you find that neveah is 'the word'"? I've heard the heaven spelled backwards thing.
i9M0U9Meaa	im pretty big for 20 weeks but here is a pic of me at exactly 20 weeks just so you can have an idea, but remember every women's body is different!!!<br>  <a href="http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q99/lil_sammy1991/sam002.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q99/l...</a><br>  good luck and congrats!!|`|zSABr7praa	I'm short and petite and I was very obviously pregnant at 16 weeks, and getting questions from strangers at 20 weeks.  Everyone is different!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	You couldn't really tell it was a tiny bump, but everyone is different.
fHjSonssaa	When my son FIRST started teething he got this strange, horrible looking rash- and the DR said it was fine and said that it was probably from the excess saliva that he's producing- and then rubbing all over his face.  Plus it was summer. <br>  Now my son (almost 12 months) has Exzema, and we us California Baby Calendula Cream on it.  It helps a lot- his dad noticed it too.<br>  <br>  It's all natural and smells kinds good- and I've even used it a little here and there.  It's for those who have exzema or other skin sensitivities.  <br>  And it seems like an excellent thing to just have around anyhow.<br>  <br>  If the DR says that it's OK, I wouldn't worry (even though I know it's hard not to)- their skin is still sensitive at this age that anything and everything could give him a little rash.  It is good that you had the DR look at it though- thaey would know which rashes to look for that are not so good/normal.|`|17026d156e3d8ccd0b91156df378dbcfaa	My son had excema as a baby on his face, arms and legs I used vaseline...it worked, cleared up his face.|`|zDNRgpD1aa	I had that too. All the excema ointments that you can give him that will actually help have to be given by the doctor. I used triamcinolone acentonide for my excema and it cleared right up within a day or two.<br>  best of luck
AA11542929	i have a low lying placenta.. they said that they would keep an eye on it and they have. u can always have the chance of iit moving up .. it happens as ur stomach stretches.. make sure u go for routine ultrasounds... and i dont think u will go early.. but iif it doesnt move then u will be scheduled for a c section.. but if u get lucky it will move.. mine did a cm..|`|plI0WOrUaa	I have marginal placenta previa at 25weeks and have been ordered to be on modified bed rest to minimize the possible possibility of bleeding.  I can't believe that's all he told you!  It can be potentially dangerous to you and the baby.  I would get a second opinion to make sure that you should still be active.  You will be having a c-section for sure.  The baby can't get out the cervix if the placenta is in the way.|`|bGRexKPyaa	I was around 14 weeks with placenta previa. The middle of the placenta had lifted up(possibly from rough sex the night before)..<br>  <br>  Delivering early???Hmm. Idk but if its completly covered your getting a C-section. Alot safer than a reguar birth but its a pain in the ***.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I'm 20 weeks pregnant with #2 and was diagnosed with a partial previa at 12 weeks. I was lucky that my placenta moved up by my 18 week ultrasound. There is a chance that yours will as well even though its a complete. Since you're still only in the second trimester there is still time for it to move. If however it doesn't it means a definate c-section. Did your doc put you on pelvic rest ? (meaning no sex, douching, tampons etc) <br>  You may not necessarily deliver early, many mom's with previa's go to term. Just take it easy!
KQF5X9Vpaa	absolutely not! a baby should always be in a car seat while in a moving vehicle...and breastfeeding is a distraction from driving that can cause an accident and hurt both mom and baby<br>  <br>  Edit:  oh my she wasn't just breastfeeding she was on the cell phone 2...wow she doesn't need kids|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	Shut up!  That is all I can say! I am shocked someone would do this!|`|A7cZtZFyaa	No. It isn't safe.|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	NO WAY!!! I hope ur not doing that|`|5FhRoNVUaa	no u might crash|`|ojVl4Gowaa	No no no! Wow, she should have pulled off the road into a parking lot and then taken the baby out of the carrier to breastfeed.  Even a minor accident would have jolted the baby's skull into the steering wheel or forced her weight into the baby and pinned him/her. That's if there wasn't enough force to deploy an airbag!|`|LsAArkUyaa	Oh my...I watched the video and read the article. That woman doesn't have enough sense to safely raise children. <br>  <br>  <br>  When my 19yr old was a baby the wife of someone my stepfather works with accidentally killed their newborn grandchild. She was holding the baby in the back seat and had the shoulder belt across the baby as she was burping it. They were in a very minor accident and the grandmothers weight crushed the baby to death against the seat belt.<br>  <br>  Just imagine what a steering wheel or airbag would do to a baby or small child|`|6cN8aLnaaa	OMG!!! If my baby was that hungry and cry so hard that she had to be fed right then I would rather pull over and my other children be late for school than take the risk of hurting me and my family or anyone else. Now, when I am a passenger and my lil girl is hungry I will lean over her carseat to feed her. As uncomfortable as it may be, but I never take the risk of injuring my baby.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	Wow. Not only was that woman breastfeeding while driving she was also on her cell phone. She's obviously lacking all common sense. While I think it's awesome that she's breastfeeding (an extended breastfeeding, at that), she's an idiot for doing it while driving.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	That woman is an F'in tool! <br>  <br>  i mean seriously, driving, talking on her damn cell phone AND breastfeeding?! some people should be sterilized.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	What a silly woman.  And to get caught and then say she may breast feed her baby while driving in the future if she feels that is is necessary.  Being late isn't worth the risk that stupidity brings.|`|zhJOZhKEaa	Stupid... dangerous... and what is *really* frightening is there are places where it *was* legal not so very long ago... maybe places where it still is!  It was a recognized 'exception' to the required carseat use in some states... I *hope* that is no longer true!|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Are you serious? No. Your baby should be strapped in a safety seat while you are driving. If your child needs to feed you should pull over and park. Goodness.|`|gzQIstDFaa	i would say not. babies have to be in approved car seats and you need to be paying attention to the road. stupid people. that woman needs her kids taken away. especially since she wants to do it again!|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I can't get over the fact that she was breastfeeding AND talking on a cell phone. I can't even wrap my mind around that lol.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	of course not what the hell was that mother thinking? breast feeding AND talking on her cell phone? holy cripes sakes alive!|`|NBbsZLlbaa	if the baby bites, instant car accident?|`|BuCclvD6aa	NO THAT IS DUMB|`|ergk5yLiaa	S**t No|`|chUxLFidaa	Oh my GOD, no!!! She is ignorant and should be locked up.|`|Jk4jFHITaa	No. First of all that is so dangerous. If the airbag deployed, baby would be dead. Second, it would be really hard to steer, you wouldn't be able to have both hands on the wheel- it wouldn't be comfortable for either one of you. I know babies cry in the car sometimes, just pull over and hop in the backseat. If a cop saw you doing that or someone driving by did- you would get in a lot of trouble. Please don't do it. Everything about that is so wrong- just take the time to be a responsible parent and pull over.|`|SQf0M6wBaa	NO WAY! The reason being,I know of a mother who was nursing her infant while her husband was driving.They got into an accident and the baby died .This was related to the airbag. As adults,we are responsible to have our babies properly in their car seats.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	Umm, isn't that illegal what with the whole babies-must-be-in-car-seats law?<br>  <br>  About this woman, I can sort of understand wanting to multi-task if you have lots of kids... but I can never agree with a woman who refers to her baby as "it".|`|GiEinn85aa	Dangerous. Very dangerous for the baby and the mother. You never know when the baby wants to bite your nipple and you'll scream causing a car accident for losing concentration on looking ahead.|`|YQ16K3IRaa	no, its not okay, thats stupiddddddd and dangerous!!...  if your baby is really hungry you can always pull over somewhere and stop and feed the baby. That way your baby is safe!!|`|TJusfEnlaa	If a baby is in a car, it should be restrained in an appropriate car seat that meets current safety requirements!|`|pMtMsbBnaa	Breast feeding and talking on a cell phone??  How did she have any hands left for the steering wheel?  Idiot.  Like it couldn't wait 5 minutes.  This is why there are so many car accidents.|`|cZeAG3sLaa	HELL NO!<br>  It's illegal and dangerous!|`|zQWNb6neaa	Wow. I hope they bust her *** every time she puts her child's life in danger by doing this until she gets it through her thick head how horribly unsafe it is and stops. That is horrifyingly ignorant..|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yea that's pretty crazy- however, i don't think she should be locked up- imagine how her poor little children would feel about that- i think that would be pretty bad for the kids as well. she need to go to a class about safety|`|X6as2nOAaa	yes because she is not in a seatbelt.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	uh, shes gonna take what the police said into CONSIDERATION but she will probably do it again!?!?!?! She needs her kids taken away from her, shes a moron. Stupid people shouldnt breed. im sorry if i offend anyone but they make you take a test to drive a car and you have to be a certain age to join the army or vote but any idiot with a uterus can have a kid<br>  <br>  My boyfriends cousin breastfed and drove, and she didnt think there was anything wrong with it. I cant believe how stupid people are!!!!|`|A7SJT50Kaa	oh good gracious. i thought i had mental issues.<br>  <br>  i hope those kids get placed in proper care. she admitted that she would do it again "if needed"! WTF???<br>  <br>  for the record: i don't let my kids cry/go hungry...if i'm driving and they need to nurse, i PULL OVER and nurse them. i've never *ever* thought about having them unsecured while the car is in motion. good grief. those poor kids.<br>  <br>  ETA: what's going to happen when she goes to jail for 180 days? you think they'll bring dd in to be nursed? *sarcasm*|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Oh my God, that woman is deranged! Resting the baby's head on the steering wheel?! Breastfeeding, driving AND talking on a mobile phone...at the same time?!<br>  <br>  She's crazy and irresponsible!|`|qrGzsQWzaa	It is not a good idea.<br>  <br>  It is not safe or legal.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	that's so terrible!|`|w4zjmhxoaa	Oh, wow.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	It sounds like such a joke. Especially when she says she might do it again. She's not exactly the sharpest knife in the draw...<br>  <br>  Not only is it dangerous to have your baby out of the car seat(DUH) I can't imagine being able to concentrate on driving while I was nursing. And talking on a cell phone... ARGH...!|`|GqsLNUE8aa	No.<br>  <br>  My friend says she just throws her boob over her shoulder and into the back seat for the babe. I personally have a hard time doing it when the babe is in her seat and I'm belted.<br>  <br>  That mom is clearly crazy eh?! Like breastfeeding and driving isn't bad enough! She had to be on the cell phone too! LOL|`|u94HOVz7aa	HELL NO!  my cousin does this and it scares the crap out of me when she tells me about it.   i dont feel safe unless my children are buckled properly in their carseats while in the car.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No not at all. Too much distraction going on and extremely unsafe for everyone involved. It doesn't hurt to pull over at a rest stop or mall parking lot to nurse|`|dFmZhtpvaa	no it's distracting the mother from the watching the road.

I didnt do it to my son and wouldnt recomment to anyone. I cannot even imagine putting my son through something like that, and for what?? I live in US (not originally from here though) and yes, most people are for it here, although times are changing, i hope peoples minds will also...|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	Tell her not to do it. It's no longer recommended by medical authorities and it takes away sexual pleasure.<br>  <br>  The USA is the last western nation still doing this to around half of its baby boys but even there rates are falling and many insurance companies no longer cover it, because it is deemed a waste of money.  Sadly in the US it’s often still done horribly without anaesthetic based on the long-outdated belief that babies don’t feel pain.<br>  <br>  Since its introduction into the west as an anti-masturbation measure in the 19th century, circumcision proponents have trotted out endlessly changing justifications for the procedure, as earlier ones are disproved. Most of these proposed reasons have later been proved to be based on flawed studies but the myths continue. Even if the claims for benefit were accepted the level of any protection from disease is so low as to be easily outweighed by the risks involved in the surgery. A few babies even die each year from circumcision complications and some lose their penis from necrotic infection. More common complications of infant circumcision, like skin bridges or too much skin removed, do not show up until much later in life. So the statistics do not include them in the complication rate. (A penis with a skin bridge is much harder to clean and causes major sexual difficulties.) However even on these artificially lowered statistics all the major medical authorities in the world now say that these risks outweigh the dubious benefits of routine infant circumcision.<br>  <br>  Circumcision removes over half the skin of the penis (about 15 square inches or 40 square centimetres, in an adult) and it's not just simple skin. It's packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive. A recent study has shown real differences in fine touch sensitivity between circumcised and intact penises and that the most sensitive parts of the intact penis are those that would be removed by circumcision.<br>  <br>  Another very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.<br>  <br>  A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion of intact males. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream that speeds up the process. <br>  I myself am circumcised. I have hated it ever since as a 12 year old I saw a mate masturbating with a foreskin and realised a little of what I had lost.<br>  <br>  Many men resent being circumcised, some so much that they stretch to try and regain some of their lost foreskin's function. They can never recover all the complex anatomy and lost nerve endings though. Infant circumcision is a violation of a man's right to intact genitals and I will never forgive my parents and the medical profession for doing it to me.<br>  <br>  Because any baby boy born now will undoubtedly have intact friends, there is every chance that he will resent this unnecessary surgery,<br>  Geoff|`|EwmHsEoiaa	Unfortunately the only people that are in favour of it are the ones who know the least about it.  Once people study it they usually are against it.  <br>  <br>  She should watch this video, called "The circumcision decision"::<br>  <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-5395565256830319025&ei=si6cSZCZMYnojgKZmcCUDg&q=nocirc&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?doci...</a><br>  <br>  No medical organisation recommends it.  In the USA the average rate is down to 55% and lower than that on the West Coast:<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/USA.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/USA.html</a><br>  <br>  Worldwide only 25% of men get cut.  2/3 of these are Muslims. In Australia and Canada, the rate is down to 10%.  Britain France Germany Italy have rates near zero.   Some studies point to a mild health benefit.  But it really isn't sufficient to cut of a healthy body part that has a good function. The fact is that being intact causes no problems, so why do it? You can see the answers to the myths here:<br>  <a href="http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelling-myths-about-circumcision/" rel="nofollow">http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelli...</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin has a function.  It contains many specialized nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability to masturbate easily as there is no gliding effect.  Circumcised men often have to resort to artificial lubrication in masturbation and sex.  See here for the function of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans (head of the penis) dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  There are good reasons to believe that sex is better for the woman as well, if the man has his foreskin intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>   <br>  Care for an intact boy is easier.  Just a few things you should know:<br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth (they have to break this seal to perform the circumcision - this is excruciatingly painful - not that the pain is the worst part of circumcision ) <br>  You should never pull back the foreskin or try to clean under it.  It requires no care.<br>  The foreskin should be left to become retractable on it's own , it should not be forced.  The foreskin becomes retractable by itself.  this occurs any time up until the end of puberty, though the average age is 5-10 years.  Until then, nothing to do.  A lot of doctors are not familiar with this - don't let them retract it.<br>  Once it becomes retractable, there is little care - just wash it like any other body part.  It is not dirty - if it was then women would be a lot dirtier.  Most men worldwide (75-80%) are intact and have no problems.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  Circumcision carries a lot of risks:<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org/cac_complications.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision....</a><br>  There is also evidence that the pain and discomfort of circumcision disrupts the mother-son bond and also breast feeding.

Everytime some "doctor" has tried to argue the benefits of circumcision, it turns out that whatever "studies" they've done proving that circumcision "cures" something is false! This has been going on since it was first popularized in the western world to "cure" masturbation of all things! <br>  <br>  The decision for most parents in the US to circumcise their boy has more to do with what they DONT' know rather than what they do know. So basically, people make the decision out of ignorance. Here are some of the ridiculous arguments for circumcision: <br>  "It doesn't hurt them that much and they won't remember it later so it's better to have them done now, just in case". Not only is that completely false, but just in case WHAT? How many adult men in England or France ever NEED to get circumcised? <br>  <br>  "I've heard that boys that are uncircumcised are more likely to get infections down there". Uh....NO! Not if they maintain proper hygiene. The reason why some infant boys left intact have gotten infections is because their parents (and sometimes doctors) think that they need to forcibly retract their foreskin to clean under it, not knowing that a baby's foreskin is attached to the head and retracting it breaks the skin and usually causes an infection! <br>  <br>  "An uncircumcised penis is ugly or gross looking!". This is really the saddest argument anyone could make for performing a medically unnecessary, painful surgery on an unconsenting infant. Isn't it just possible that this perception of asthetics is only colored by what we are used to seeing. <br>  <br>  "We want him circumcised so he'll look like dad". WHY? So because his father was mutilated without his permission and doesn't remember it, we should inflict the same thing on the son? Other than selfish admiration, what benefit is that to the child? Is he really going to grow up staring at his dad's penis wondering why part of his wasn't cut off to match his father? I think not! My dad is circumcised and I didn't find that out until I was 13 or 14. I really didn't care either!<br>  <br>  There are no real medical benefits to circumcision and it's a very painful procedure. I simply wouldn't want to cause my baby horrible pain for no medical reason. I would also want him to be able to make that decision himself. I am not circumcised and very happy about that. Contrary to popular myth, it's actually very easy to keep clean, you are not more susceptible to infections and it's easier to masturbate with a foreskin that without one (which is why doctors started cutting it off to begin with). My suspicion is that my son would also be happy with it, and if not he could always choose to get circumcised. The only legitimate reason there is to get circumcised is if you have some kind of medical problem (which is astronomically rare) that requires it or if you convert to a religion that requires it. Other than that, leave it alone. <br>  <br>  If you want to know more about circumcision and why we even do it here in American (despite is being almost unheard of in Europe and other countries), take a look at these short documentaries. <br>  <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/watch/1017669/3828432">http://video.yahoo.com/watch/1017669/382...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-5395565256830319025&ei=si6cSZCZMYnojgKZmcCUDg&q=nocirc&hl=e" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?doci...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an actual video of a circumcision (warning: graphic)<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8212662920114237112" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <br>  The "Medicalization" of circumcision:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpB...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6UjduMTiU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6UjduMT...</a><br>  <br>  Opinion's of boys and women about circumcision:<br>  <a href="http://www.jackinworld.com/qow/q15.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jackinworld.com/qow/q15.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdZefUABUS0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdZefUABU...</a><br>  <br>  The other links have some basic information about the penis that most people don't know.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I didnt have my son done (because of relgious reason from husband)<br>  I was goin to but it has never got infected or even irritated & he has NEVER had diaper rash & if i have any orher sons i would not do it either|`|quNfHZULaa	Wow I didn't know all these people agreed with what I thought.

They all said enough I don't have to though.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Infant circumcision is infant sexual abuse, torture and should be illegal, as female circumcision of minors is.<br>  <br>  Genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless of the sex of the victim.<br>  <br>  Circumcision has adverse effects and complications that the doctors do not disclose and in fact suppress.<br>  <br>  Mutilation of the penis by circumcision damages the immune system, damages sexual sensitivity and has psychological effects that are never addressed.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|VmSKQ40Caa	Tell her to NOT get it done to her baby. Circumcision on a baby is wrong. I say this because you are cutting off a part of an innocent baby's unit without his permission. It's HIS unit so HE should decide what happens. NO ONE has the wright to take a part of a baby's body away from him without his permission. Why would males be born with foreskin if it was useless?? Make damn well sure that she does NOT get the baby circumcised!!!!|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA</a><br>  <br>  Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?<br>  Gomco Clamp- <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=..." rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  Plastibell- <a href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell...." rel="nofollow">http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell....</a>|`|4arnbpUCaa	I wouldn't have my son circumcised.<br>  <br>  In a developed country like the USA where hot water comes out of our taps and we have access to soap, there is simply no good reason to cut off a natural and important part of a baby's penis, especially seeing as he cannot consent to this permanent, cosmetic surgery.<br>  <br>  She should also check out Mothering.com's forums for more insight from other moms on this issue:<br>  <a href="http://www.mothering.com/discussions/forumdisplay.php?f=44" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothering.com/discussions/for...</a>|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Its a personal choice.

x97cBpuoaa	Well, I think personally you should keep the puppy. Sure it will be all about your son (by the way CONGRATS) but a puppy is something great for a kid to grow up with, the baby can play with the puppy, teach it tricks when the baby is older and the baby can help and watch you feed, brush and care for your pet.

ZJKmw2nlaa	I hope you don't take offense in me asking this, but were you a little overweight before you became pregnant? Because I've heard that's the 'healthy' weight gain for anyone overweight. I was overweight before I got pregnant and I've gained about 15 lbs so far and I'm also 29 weeks, and am also all belly. I'm also 5'4. As long as you're healthy and the baby's healthy and not gaining crazy amounts of weight and eating tons of junk food, I don't really think there's need for concern. My doctor has never expressed a concern with weight gain.|`|QYSsvqXyaa	I'm 5'6 and only 10 weeks. I started out at 152 and plan to gain at least 30 pounds! All the books say that is average. If your 5'9 & 155 I'd say 35 pounds for you?!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	im 30 weeks along and i've gained 70 lbs with my pregnancy.. everyone id different.. my doc says my weight gain was ok just due to the fact that i was under 100 lbs before i got preggo|`|1WBimx1laa	That dont even sound normal. People should gain more than that at least a little bit. I gained about 20 lbs by then and only gained 27 alltogether and I am 5'6"|`|nZVTHKNwaa	I gained 30 lbs after it was all said and done. However, I remember I, too, got the "weight gain" talk right around 28 weeks with my first. I don't think it is healthy to gain only 2-10 lbs for an entire pregnancy. In baby books it will tell you exactly how much everything involving your baby weighs (placenta, etc.) so I think more is better. You can always work it off after your baby comes. But my goodness, only 15 lbs. was the desired weight gain according to your doctor?! That sounds completely insane. Just keep doing what you are doing, but try to stick to mainly fruits and veggies so you don't go too overboard if you're really concerned.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	I am a day shy of being 32w and so far i have gained 26 pounds and im 5'1''.. my doctor told me that I am suppose to gain around 35-40 pounds for my whole pregnancy...If i were you then I would get a second opinion...that seems way too low to me..|`|5h8bYsKdaa	you can gain as much weight as you want. sure they tell you to gain 15-35 lbs but if you feel 15 isnt enough, gain more. your baby is gonna gain alot of weigh so you should gain weight|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I had gained maybe 2 pounds. I'm 32 weeks now and I've only gained 8.|`|AA11220327	it has been different for me every time, but i have never had a dr make me feel bad for what i had or hadnt gained. that is just so wrong in my opinion. with my oldest i had gained about 20lbs by that point, and with my 2nd, a little more, maybe 22. this time i am almost 21 weeks, and have only gained 8lbs, which by compairison is not that much, but all of these times, my drs have never commented on it at all.
2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	umm i had a narural and will again<br>  1) i feel it is better for baby thats jsut my thoughts<br>  2) i cant due to metal rods in back<br>  3) i have had 2 back operations i hate the thought of anyone touching or messing with my spine ever again . creepy<br>  honestly i have always planned a narural birth(s) i am so suborn and when i am told i cant do something i will lol <br>  good luck|`|Lzt1eIZFaa	I had an epidural with my first child, it took 14 hours altogether.  My second child didn't want to wait, while the midwife went out to get some pain relief for me, my baby decided he wanted to come out, so no time for pain relief, that took 20 minutes from the time I arrived in the hospital to having my baby in my arms.  My third and final child also didn't want to wait, I got as far as just getting a diamorphine injection and he was out!  That took 40 minutes.  <br>  <br>  If I had the choice at the time, I would probably have chosen the epidural every time, but in a funny way, I am glad I didn't.  It took no time to recover after a natural birth.  I had a lot of problems after the epidural.   I am actually still suffering from backache, 11 years after the epidural, which they do warn you about.<br>  <br>  It also takes longer to deliver with an epidural because you cannot feel anything.|`|EyKJ737daa	I guess it's each to their own sweetie because some do have higher pain thresholds or they just may be dead set keen on having a "natural" birth with no interventions or drugs.  Me, I say bring on the drugs!!  Mind you I did have 3 births with minimal drugs, but only because I know my pain threshold is high.  My first I had pethidine which took the edge off the pain just nicely so I was still able to feel when my body was ready to push and in the end it payed off because for a first birth, it was quick at only 5 hours.  I unfortunately developed an allergy to the pethidine and wasn't allowed to have it anymore so they gave me the gas, my God!! That I found for me was better than the pethidine and I could have it has often as I wanted!  Again it still paid off because my labours just got quicker so by my 3rd and final baby, she was born in 2hrs 48 mins, she was born in the last 8 mins so it really worked for me but like I said everyone is different and everyone has different things they can cope with.  If you want another epi sweetie, you go for it, it's your body and your labour so you do what pleases you, the midwives are there to assist you any way they can.  All the best and good luck.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	What about the IVs they have to stick in your hand during labor? That needle stays in you. <br>  <br>  I hate needles too but hate pain even more.I would rather have an epidural then have to go through that. My last was 10.3, try pushing that out, unmedicated.|`|cfdooGylaa	Women choose not to because even though its painful, its a natural occurrence. Its also a nice thing to be able to say "I went natural, no pain meds". I guess its like an "award" for some women lol....|`|DvWGTzLUaa	I didnt have an epidural because I didnt want a needle in my spine!! lol. It scared me more than the thought of having a baby without it! And honestly, yeah it was painful, but coulda been worse. And looking back I love that I felt it. Each to their own!<br>  <br>  Just to add I dont have an issue with needles, I just didnt want one in my spine. It makes me squemish, like the thought of a needle in the eye!|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I had 2 already and im thinking about getting it agaim. It takes tthe edge off the pain to me. But some women choose to sweeat and be in pain and it's because epidurals can contribute to future back pain. But u gonna have back pains regardless if u don't take care of urself.|`|mqIxvaHFaa	Everyone's different. I had the epidural. They say the second baby comes along faster than the first. But in may as long as  there is time. I will be getting it again. No one for pain. It is definately something i do not want to experience. If i don't make it on time. OMG!!!|`|VTtRNXMUaa	if it were me i wouldn't get an epidural because well i've heard dat as you get older you start to develop some problems but hey dats just me and well everyone has their own choice.|`|8wVj8odOaa	I've had 2 natural child births and *plan* to do so this time around... why? I absolutely HATE needles!!!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I had an epidural with my first and didn't have time for one with my second but I wanted one!!  Some people chose not to get one because they are afraid of needles, afraid of the side effects of the epidural, afraid of being paralysed, afraid that it will cause harm to the baby, and some people think that they won't be woman enough if they get one.  Some people have had one in the past and had a bad experience.  I'm with you on this one- why would you want that pain if it can be avoided?  And in my opinion, pushing a baby out of your vagina is still a natural birth, pain meds or not.  It is a c-section that is not a natural birth.
DvWGTzLUaa	My daughter was just over 9 months old! She was in no rush to move. Dont worry, your little one will get there when shes ready!|`|A1KwOUFCaa	My son started at 7 months, but every kid is different and she will start sooner or later. I wouldnt worry too much about it.|`|Hce0Y5Muaa	8 months|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Amber started at 6 months|`|NNIzSJ9Yaa	Yes you are, babies start walking when THEY are ready too.  My little sister is 12 months and she is just now "cruising"(holding on to things while trying to walk).  Just give her time and she will decided when to start. Enjoy it while you can lol,  Just because you other children started early doesnt always mean she will too.  You watch she'll start walking in no time and then you wont be able to catch her :)  Hope that helps you|`|cv0foxlTaa	My son was about 7 months old when he started doing the "G.I. Joe crawl."  He was about 8.5 months when he started crawling on all fours.<br>  <br>  I know of a few babies who never crawled at all.... just went right to walking.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	my son was 6 months 3 weeks<br>  <br>  perhaps shes not modivated to go yet because she has older siblings to bring her things and play with her?<br>  either way, she will do it if and when she's ready. some babies never crawl, just stand up one day and start walking.
5NBJUALFaa	Its a spider nest.. In a couple days it will break open and 10,000 baby spiders will come out and consume what is left of your penis.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Why are you posting this in the pregnancy section...|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	std! <br>  <br>  go see a doctor|`|ncUhlwevaa	ugh... im already naseous being pregnant.

bTlhBX3daa	It can't hurt to ask. But typically, your insurance will not cover any extra Ultrasounds unless they are needed to check on the welfare of the baby.|`|AA11220327	i dont know where you are, but where i live (canada) you are allowed to book your own extra ultrasounds at anytime, however, only the ones deemed necessary and ordered by your dr are covered by insurance. elective ones you have to pay for out of pocket. you will not have to wait long, the average time for that ultrasound is 18-20 weeks, ,unless it is difficult to get an appointment. just hang in there, ,3 or 4 more weeks is not that long.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	ive asked my doctor to send me for an ultrasound just because i wanted more picture lol. im not sure if you can find out the sex at 16 weeks, i wasnt able to find out until i was 19 weeks along.|`|gaiCNtEFaa	Doctors only do ultrasounds when they find them medically necessary.  You will probably have to pay.  They usually wait until the 20th week to do a full anatomy ultrasound.  This is routine and they will be able  to determine the sex better at this age.  I am 18 weeks and haven't had one yet.|`|nZVTHKNwaa	You can always request an ultrasound, just be willing to pay up for it. I think mine cost $75 if they are not routine ultrasounds.
yKS2UI87aa	While this is not a bad choice, it's actually really healthy you do need to eat more than this. Try a cup of yogurt in the morning or even a glass of milk and something small for lunch --anything to get the protein you need.|`|AA10673927	Yeah, that sounds alright to me.<br>  <br>  [:|`|KcwF3yhLaa	As long as that is not ALL you eat in a day.<br>  Congrats on being veggie!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	maybe add some more veg to your diet containing more iron and alco more calcium:) even if its a glass of milk!

BTuFtui3aa	No one who has been convicted of child abuse will be allowed to adopt children. This includes biological relatives like a grandchild. No child will be placed in a previously abusive home, and relatives are background checked before being given custody.<br>  <br>  Being fined indicates they were either found guilty, plead guilty, or plead no contest-- all of which would be on their record. So yes, that would count against them.<br>  <br>  Child abuse convictions prevent adoption in the future. It's an automatic disqualification... as it should be.|`|NbSGNyTMaa	I was adopted in 1988 (year I was born). <br>  <br>  Every month for a while my adoptive parents were paid a visit by child services to check the house and even the filter on the air conditioner to make sure that I was placed in a good home.<br>  <br>  If you've ever had negative conflict with a child I highly doubt you would be able to adopt.<br>  Seriously... they're checking air filters|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Why would the court allow someone to adopt a child when they had abused children and had them taken away??|`|6bMBwaosaa	definitely not! Courts and social work would never allow it|`|GWM5Wt49aa	Absolutely no way.|`|GniFr6mCaa	who are you?  .......     no way<br>  <br>  <br>                                \  <br>                                       -    (<br>                                /|`|lynmeenmaa	i bloody well hope not|`|jHZqOuVEaa	Not in my world.  Why?  Because if I ruled the world, abusers of children would be in jail so they would be automatically ineligible to adopt.<br>  <br>  Why are you in danger of losing your child to them?  You need to write a will that provides for guardianship of your child with responsible people.  Make sure that several people who you trust have copies of the will, especially the guardians.
cHROCt3Aaa	i'm 2 months pregnant and i've been talking to my 2 year old daughter about how there's a baby in my belly, and she's going to be a big sister. she screams NO! when you ask if she's ready to be a big sister, and just looked at me like i was crazy whenever i tried to talk to her about the baby... she even rolled her eyes. lol! today i got an ultrasound and i'd been telling her about it all day, when it was time to leave she was napping and i woke her up and asked her if she was ready to see the new baby... she jumped right out of bed and said yes! she watched the ultrasound and was AMAZED by the tiny baby.. her face was the cutest thing ever! she cried and cried when it was over. now she keeps asking 'can i see baby? can i see baby?' haha..<br>  <br>  also recently she lost her favorite babydoll, and it was a few days before i found a replacement (same one). when i put it in the buggy at the store she grabbed the doll and hugged it super hard and said 'i missed you much baby!!'|`|LwbwMFX9aa	my almost 4yr old daughter pipes up and says im a rock star, im  a rock star, and thrashes her head around , i could kill her father ( my hubby ) for letting her watch vh1 the other day,lol|`|66633d9122b3aa8042ed5b75071a98d0aa	My nine month old waves and says "momma!"

Of course, it's illegal to sell them. But I think it's considered acceptable to give them away and ask for a "rehoming fee." At least, that's the practice with all the other little animals. :)|`|tht0DrHsaa	On craigslist. Just list them as puppies and when people show up sit the kids in the box with them.  Put free to good home on it. Or even better go to walmart parking lot and put them in a box that says free to good home.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	Sad thing is.....  people actually do that! I don't know about on craigslist, but yeah, people actually do try to sell their own kids!!|`|AA10771316	Nope, I think it's illegal on craigslist and ebay. Black market is the best way to go. Hope you find it!|`|oOBEbOiSaa	You never no unless you try :)|`|hKJIDdVqaa	if not I have found a discreet ad on the grocery store bulletin board is a great way to ehm...sell them.  Or better yet you can put them in the basement like that movie "The People Under the Stairs".  Of course that movie did not end so well for the parents.
Ka52nbhNaa	Find another doctor!  We love our pediatrician as they actually encourage us to call anytime, have always been pleasant and professional when returning our calls . . . have even said to me "it is probably nothing, but let's bring him/her in today to be sure" . . . <br>  <br>  They should not be so dismissive and unsympathetic - there are better doctors out there!|`|Y9mew1mwaa	You should definitely try to find a different doc that you are comfortable with. It is part of a pediatricians job to help new mothers with the care of their new baby. If yours is making you feel uncomfortable about having concerns i would definitely start the search for a new one.|`|CgEQAgXhaa	Yes.  You should def have a pediatrician you are comfortable calling anytime.  Even if he thinks your just being paranoid, this doc is being paid good money to take your calls and answer any and all concerns you have about your child.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	yeah, if you don't feel comfortable with them now imagine when you baby gets older & has to go, he won't feel comfortable.  my dr is awesome, i can call whenever & they always call right back & never make me feel stupid for asking a question.  ask friends who they go to, thats what i did.|`|AA12033653	If I were you I would be finding another pediatrician!!  It is just like a doctor for yourself, if you don't like the way they treat you, then you would find a new Physician for yourself, so why should your baby be any different.  <br>  <br>  As you are finding a new doctor, talk to other parents in the waiting room to see about the potential new doctor's practices.  For example even if you have an appointment do you have to wait forever to be seen by the doctor, or even called to the exam room.  Or does the new potential doctor do the same thing your current doctor does with phone calls.  <br>  <br>  I interviewed several Pediatricians and the one I found will be great.  She has tons of experience, daily walk in hours, calls back within the hour, and she came highly recommended to me by other parents.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
VbkJ9Tucaa	I'm 20 & went off the pill to get prego and here I am, almost 10 weeks. Try whenever you are both ready. Don't let anyone tell you youre not ready when you are or you are ready when youre not. Go with your heart and your sense of logic. Only you and your husband can decide what is right for your family. Good luck =]|`|E6A8MKZwaa	Of course not!  You're completely developed and at your strongest, healthiest point.  Statistics show that people your age have healthier babies than women who wait until their 30s.  Definitely go for it!<br>  <br>  By the way, I got pregnant after I had just turned 21.  The pregnancy has been great and the baby is doing well.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Not if y'all are financially stable and mentally ready.|`|59SM8kFIaa	your married no have a baby if you want|`|2WGI6sxEaa	You're never too young to start. However, there are a few things you should know before going into it. <br>  Pregnancy can be a stressful time for a prospective mother. Liberal consumption of alcohol and pain relievers are often found to be quite effective.<br>  <br>  Also, contact sports are a great recreational way to reduce stress and have a great time doing it.<br>  <br>  Go for it.|`|IcNV9XG6aa	Not at all dear, if you are mentally and physically ready,then go for it. I am 24 and i am pregnant for 19 weeks. But it all depend on you and your husband . if you guys are ready for it then i think it's good. And in my opinion 22 is also a good age to think of a baby.|`|kAakLD5Baa	I don't think so but that's me. 16 is too young but that's a decision you and your husband should decide.|`|HWRk31Fjaa	Not if you're married and have stable living conditions|`|pq2q0upuaa	Absolutely not i would because your 22 and your married just make shure you have enough money to support him or her|`|FhHvYLaFaa	At 22, no. as long as you are in a stable relationship and financially ready your fine to start trying x|`|Wk7fIw4Laa	you're not too young. people are having babies at 14 today with a one night fling.

gieEWY1Qaa	DON"T LISTEN TO Chelss. <br>  <br>  I am 10 1/2 wks pregnant, during weeks 6 and 7 I started to spot then bleed, not heavy but I was bleeding. I rushed to my DR. he did an ultrasound and said my baby had a heartbeat and looked great. That some woman do bleed, in early pregnancy. I am 10 1/2 wks pregnant and my baby is still doing good. If she is filling a pad an hour with blood then she needs to go to the ER. Tell her that she should call her OB though to have him/her check the baby out. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, and please let us know. The baby and your mother will be in my prayers.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	She needs to see a doctor asap.|`|YuA7a08Maa	She needs to get to the doctor.  Some people do spot in a normal pregnancy, but for some people, it could mean miscarriage.  An ultrasound will tell the difference!  Good luck to her.|`|HJU0hi1haa	Shes having a miscarage.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	You probably were pregnant and had a miscarriage. At tat stage of development it's just a ball of forming tissues. You are going to be fine but if you start bleeding again seriously heavy or spike a fever you need to go to the ER immediately!|`|AA11828121	Spotting is okay, any ongoing bleeding when you're pregnant is not okay. The doc. would be best to tell you if you did or didn't. Some women do pass blood clots which is what it sounds like. A miscarriage is severely painful, the cramping is very much worse than period cramps (I know from experience). Call the ER, tell the nurse what happened and they will let you know if you should come in or not.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|plI0WOrUaa	I'm not sure, but you need to get to your doctor to make sure.   that will be the only way to find out what's going on.  Good luck, and i hope everything is fine|`|454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	Did you have a positive pregnancy test?

WWcaKZ7Qaa	It's up to you but false positives are extremely rare. Multiple false positives are pretty unheard of. You are pregnant, I'm sure. I'd be confident enough with those results to tell your mom. Congrats!|`|AA10015577	I'm sure you are pregnant.  False positives only occur when you take hormonal supplements and if you don't, I'm sure your probably pregnant.  You can get a blood test if you wish to assure yourself.  Most couples tend to wait until they are past the miscarriage stage to tell everyone the news.  Good luck and congrats!|`|7rIAd6gGaa	You're pregnant. Congrats!!! A second line only appears if there is hcg in your urine. Hcg is a hormone that is only produced during pregnancy. As long as you read it within the 10 minutes or so it says you have, you can't get a false positive. (After that, you could get what's called an evap line.) Congrats and good luck!!!|`|C8E3fe3xaa	It's very uncommon to get a false positive on a pregnancy test, but if you are really worried you might not be pregnant..just get the blood test done first.|`|WuVW9uCAaa	i think that pregnancy tests are accurate|`|roe07rI8aa	They are a clear sign that you are pregnant. false positives do not happen. However, not everyone stays pregnant which is why many people prefer to wait awhile before telling anyone. I would tell my mum whatever happened as I would want her support in the event that anything did go wrong early on. Fingers crossed, you'll be fine.<br>  So Many Congratulations to you on your happy news, look after yourself and good luck.|`|H20Qz1Tvaa	Congratulations, you're pregnant :)|`|66633d9122b3aa8042ed5b75071a98d0aa	Not likely.

Tell your mom and enjoy every minute of it.  NO matter how faint the line---the bun is in the oven.  Good luck!!  Baby dust to everyone!!|`|AA11018222	Positive is about 99% positive.  You're pretty safe in telling everyone, now.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Your pregnant hunnie!!!!!!!! Congratulations~|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	no, at home tests are really accurate.|`|u3sxwcPoaa	False positives are super super rare, especially more than one. If it was me, I'd get a blood test with my regular doctor to confirm and THEN I'd call my mom.|`|p8HOUxNVaa	false positives are practically impossible the hormones that the tests detect are only released when you are pregnant|`|Q0V8hD4gaa	It sounds like your pregnant. Its very rare that you can get a false positive on a pregnancy test... go ahead and give the news out. :)|`|FLOjzbKEaa	you are pregnant.  actually never heard that people had multiple positive HPT.  i think a false positive is very rare.<br>  <br>  So you are. to make sure 100% do a blood test and then tell your mom.
KlJHZRSiaa	Teach your significant other to do it for you. They'll make a fuss about it at first, but it won't get any easier from here on in. I remember my sister telling me she had two options; lean forward over the bump ... or breathe! She chose breathing and got her BF to cut the nails. Salons have nasty fumes, so I would avoid them unless you can find a beautican who will see you first thing in the morning before the nail polishes fumes are in the air. I'd have a waxing while yo;'re there, cause your bikini line is also going to be a victim of the bump when the summer arrives :)|`|YuA7a08Maa	haha....I'm 20 weeks with a decent sized bump, too.  I just cut my toenails last night and it was an adventure.  However, I just sat on the couch and pulled my feet to me instead of bending over.

eaf2a0aa822814e482e216c12b986a2aaa	your body is definitely getting ready but don't get your hopes up too high (like i did)... i was 2cm dialed for 3 weeks.  my weekly checkups were every wednesday.  after my 39 week appointment i went back the next day because i started having contractions and this being my first baby i didn't know what real labor felt like.. so i went to get checked at the doctor first (because my hospital was an hour away and i didn't want to drive down there just to get sent home for false labor) and it's a good thing i did that.  i was having contractions, but they were irregular and not progressing me at all... they just plain hurt.  they stayed this way, all day every day, anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes apart.  the following tuesday after dealing with the pain and no sleep for 6 days, the contractions and cramping pains felt different that morning, stronger when they came, and when i went to the bathroom there was bright red blood.  not a lot, but enough to scare me.  i didn't realize it was my mucous plug but it probably was.  i called my doc crying into the phone and said i couldn't wait until tomorrow, it just hurts too bad... i could not walk or talk through them anymore and they seemed more regular.  on his advice i went back to the doctors office, not the hospital, to get checked again.  after 30 minutes waiting in the waiting room for an available doctor, sitting on the heart monitor for another 30 minutes, them taking their time checking my blood pressure and stats, the OB came in to check me... and his face turned white.  i was 6cm dilated and he could feel my son's head very low!!  he told me to quickly get dressed and get to the hospital.. this was at about noon, and my son was born at 8:21pm.  <br>  the menstrual like cramps and back aches are very very normal, and doesn't necessarily mean you're going into labor soon... but it could.  everyone's different!  once your pains feel very very tight and extremely painful in your stomach and/or back, you can't walk or concentrate through them, and they're consistently coming at least every 10 minutes, you just gotta hang in there.  baby will come when he/she is ready, and it's totally worth the wait!!  congrats & good luck!|`|51jVOdq5aa	i was 2 week advanced from my expected due date. The cramping started around 10pm and i was trying to ignore it because i thought it was only a false labor. But then again, you will know its already true labor when the contractions get stronger and wont go away. I went to the hospital around 1 am and had the baby at 4 in the morning. My water didn't break when i had my contractions even when i was already 7cm dilated but even if when you experience stronger contractions atleast every 5 min ( i timed it) go to the hospital right away.|`|5IlaGPxUaa	I woke up with my water broken at 1:42am started having contractions half an hour after that. They strted at 2 minutes apart...

Go to <a href="http://www.pregnancy-info.net/QA/answers-1_cm_dilated/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancy-info.net/QA/answers...</a> and you will see a number of women claim to have been anywhere from 1-2 cm dialated and up to 80% effaced yet walked around for another 2-3 weeks.<br>  <br>  It's always normal to be excited and "done" with pregnancy when you reach your 9th month but statistically speaking you will go full term- unless of course this is your second or so child and previous pregnancies were early deliveries.<br>  <br>  Get walking as that has been proven to move things along faster as well as make your delivery so much easier.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	well...mine were all induced, and since i had inducement i couldn't honestly tell you what natrual contractions feel like, i've only had pitocin contractions which i hear are suppose to be worse, but like i said, i wouldn't know the difference.<br>  <br>  #1 due to group B strep and my needing antibiotics on board before delivery. my water was broken at the hospital after i was given pitocin. labor lasted 6 hrs, delivery 30 mins, no drugs. i was dilated to a 2 already before the inducement but felt nothing more than braxton-hicks.<br>  <br>  #2 due to gestational diabetes and a stomach flu i was induced. labor went well, they broke my water at the hospital after i was given pitocin. labor was 13 1/2 hrs delivery was a wicked 10 mins! she was coming fast! lol, no drugs. i was dilated to a 1 before inducement, felt discomfort in hips and pressure in pelvis before inducement, and i had horrible back labor plus i had a stomach flu and was puking all during labor, what fun.<br>  <br>  #3 due to gestational diabetes and group B strep-double whammy! i was induced. my water was broken in the hospital after i was given pitocin. labor was 12 hrs, delivery again was only a couple minutes, no drugs. i wasn't dilated at all before inducement. he was breech, and they did an external version before i was given pitocin the night before delivery, that was uncomfortable to say the least.<br>  <br>  my oldest son is my step-son so i got to have all the joys of raising him w/out all the pain of birthing him! LOL|`|eT2bIAyhaa	I didn't have any pains oir anything the night my waters broke.. Was fast asleep in bed and thought i wet myself lol....

I gave birth later that day, 4 weeks early. <br>  <br>  Now looking back, the day before my water broke I had all sorts of signs that I just figured was "normal" such as lower back pain, stomach pain (I thought I was just gassy) and waves of crampy like senstations (which were contractions)|`|8yTP3jO8aa	My water broke.  I had been having Braxton Hicks contractions, but was just 1-2 cm dilated and not effaced at all when my water broke.  I had started having contractions about every 5 minutes by the time I got to the hospital and they were checking to see if my water really had broken, but I was still just 2-3 cm dilated.  My doctor decided to put me on a pitocin drip to induce stronger contractions.  I checked into the hospital at about 10:30pm and gave birth at 4:03pm the next day.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	I lost my mucus plug on wednesday morning and had a few braxton hicks which i thought were real contractions... boy was i wrong! Anyways I saw the doctor that afternoon and he said all is good and I could deliver anywhere from 2 hours to 2 weeks... I was not thrilled to hear that... <br>  That Saturday morning, about 3:30 my water broke...<br>  After hours and hours my son was finally born at 4:26am Sunday December 9, 2007|`|EeGgovyCaa	Didn't have any. If I didnt' freak out and assume my water broke (actually peed my pants in my sleep *blushing*) then I could have waited a little longer. <br>  <br>  Since I was already in the hospital they decided to just induce me.
sEihaeLNaa	i used $1 test with my 2 pregnancys and they work great. I would by them by the dozen =-) you cant go wrong. GL|`|f7zLs18caa	My dollar store test was positive, and it was correct.  Sometimes NO pregnancy test can detect hormones right away, the best one is the First Response test. You can go somewhere and get a free pregnancy test that is more sensitive than at home tests.<br>  <br>  From what it sounds like, you're pregnant.  Good luck and rest up.  I feel like I'm in hibernation!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	A lot of people on her swear by the dollar store ones.

MSGixNibaa	What up with Thierry today? I've seen it on so many posts. Is it from a book or a movie or something?<br>  <br>  I respect you for giving him a name that is unique, yet still legit. However, as I said in another post, the name would be hard for an American child. It'll come out as "Theory" most of the time. It's a french name that doesn't sound right if the person saying it isn't french, you know what I mean? I've seen this name discussed on a site with many personal name advisers (who know a lot about names) and even for them it was a hard pronunciation to explain. In my sources is a link to an audio of the name. It's sounds more like tee-air-ee than your pronunciation.<br>  <br>  Adam is a gorgeous middle name, though. Adam hasn't seen much light these days and needs to be noticed again!|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I liked it more before i knew how to pronounce it correctly and I didn't like much before, lol.|`|AOkucu5haa	I don't like Thierry and Adam together.

281bc9a14a2a3c5832ce389a1258dda1aa	We were advised by our pediatrician to wait until he would climb out the bed but that never happened LOL he did however start trying to climb in. I guess he just could lay around until we came and got him out with no problem but when he was sleepy he could wait!!! He was 2 years old when he started trying to climb IN the bed that is when we changed his bed he has a convertible bed. We were just slow in general I guess because we didn't convert the toddler to a regular bed until last year and he was 4!!

So no worries!|`|3CG3rby0aa	I think that it varies with every woman as far as the hormones go because my boobs have not gotten very big with any of my pregnancies.  But I know alot of woman that there boobs got so big they bothered them through the whole pregnancy.  So big is not necessarily better.  It all boils down to the hormones in your body.  Just keep eating as well as you can and you and baby will be fine. :)|`|AA10771601	Mine didn't get bigger until the last month.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	just wait.. they'll get bigger near the end and right after delivery|`|ixOE0onnaa	you  eatin to much.|`|GUUgeptjaa	depends my first two, no size change until milk came in, this one im already up a cup size....and yes breastfeeding can cause your breast to sag, not always, I breastfed both of my kids and will this one and didn't lose mine until I lost weight|`|pjgMW6qaaa	Lol I can't believe this.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not everyones boobs grow.<br>  There's nothing wrong.

You may still have a ways to go before you will actually see much difference. Especially after delivery, when milk comes in, then that is when you see a REAL difference. Normally, I have NO boobs, but a few days after each delivery, I had humongous ones. I continued nursing for a while, and I still have more boob now after all these years than when I started out.If you still have major concerns, I would suggest speaking with some one at La Leche League or your doctor, or nurse practicioner. Don't ever be afraid to consult a professional over ANY health concern.|`|bRxWkpfBaa	sometimes it take a little longer, breasts get bigger during preganancy because they start to fill with milk for the baby, so it may not happen til even 7-8 months|`|JNEFGfofaa	Don't worry Hun It's Normal Don't be disappointed..!! :)|`|xC9SIZbGaa	I think you'll find it will be closer to the birth if at all when u notice any change :)|`|0nYsPzlPaa	lol! ur disappointed!!|`|h3Ll1qxhaa	your fine. its differnt for everyone
ca9dEvSAaa	When did you get the infection? <br>  December (26 weeks pregnant)<br>  <br>  How long until the infection went away?<br>  about 4 weeks, They had to change my meds twice.<br>  <br>  Were you on bed rest? How long?<br>  Yes- From 12/15 to 2/17<br>  <br>  Did you go into preterm labor?<br>  Yes, 3 times. My infection was really bad<br>  <br>  How did you deal with it?<br>  Depressed, and I was told I needed surgery after birth, but the latest ultrasound showed some improvement. They've drained quite a bit. Now I'm thinking perhaps no surgery.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Good luck and be careful!|`|4AZp8Quwaa	I'm 36wks now and got a kidney infection around my 27th wk of pregnancy. I went to the hospital and had to be admitted. I stayed overnight (they gave me fluids and antibiotic through iv) and got discharged the next afternoon. They sent me home with a perscription of oral antibiotics which I had to take 4 of a day for 2 weeks, and a perscription of oral antibiotics which I have to take 1 every night before bedtime up until I go into labor (just to prevent getting another infection). The infection was gone after the 2 weeks of taking the first round of meds, but I noticed that my symptoms disappeared within a few days. I only missed a couple days of work and didnt need any bed rest. I didn't go into preterm labor, and actually, the doc never told me there was a reason for concern. I was very uncomfortable during the first few days of infection, but it's now a thing of the past. I hate taking all the pills I have to remember every day, but atleast I don't have to worry about having anymore complications in the future. I think you should see a doctor though so that you can be put on antibiotics. Cranberry juice or any other home remedy is not going to get rid of the infection. Only a doc with a degree is going to be able to help you in this situation. Good luck.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I took medication to get it to go away because it's going to do more damage to let the kidney infection go than to get on medicine for it and clear it up within the week.
cfdooGylaa	You dont. You just relax, be positive, and hope for the best. Trust me, even when you see your u/s, you will find more things to worry yourself about lol.

You can buy her an outfit but she needs to start paying for stuff she wants herself. Like giver her choirs around the house for money. I'm a female and I cut the grass and earned 30 dollars for doing it. If I can do it so can she. This also teaches her how to take care of herself. If you keep providing everything and holding her hand till she is grown up she will never learn to take care of herself. My mom had me doing stuff around the house for money at the same age and I got a job at 16 and paid for stuff I wanted, like cloths, shoes, going to the movies, ect. The only thing she paid for were my necessities. Food, woman's toiletries, shampoo ect.|`|J3H3C5ksaa	Heyyy, I'm 13.<br>  <br>  I have 4 pairs of jeans, 2 jogging pants [like, sweats], 3 other [not sure what it's called...].

If you do laundry every 2 weeks then she needs 12-14 jeans and shirts)<br>  If she wears skirts eliminate 2-4 pairs of jeans and replace them with skirts and leggings (Leggings needed if she wants short skirts) <br>  <br>  As far as shoes go she needs 1 pair of gym/athletic runners, 2-3 pairs of sneakers (ie; converse, pumas), 1-3 pairs of boots, and 1-3 pairs of flats, sandals, flip-flops, etc.<br>  <br>  She only needs 1 or 2 good dresses. (including summer, and formal)   <br>  <br>  3-5  hoodies, sweaters, and sweatshirts is essential if she layers shirts or it gets cold where you live.  <br>  <br>  Get a majority of graphic t-shirts but mix in some plain shirts and tanks to layer it up.|`|0GzvVElqaa	shirts-as much as needed, i have soo many that i dnt wear so make sure she really wants them<br>  shoes- a pair of cool sneaks, some boots, and and extra (flats, clogs,ect) are mainly what u need or what every1 else has also<br>  skirts/dresses- in my opinion they arent needed, but maybe some skirts 4 a dance, and a nice dress or 2<br>  jeans- my specialty i <3 them. you really only need like 4or 5 pairs tho cuz u can rewear them in the same week if they r clean. i'd got with 2or3 pairs of skinny jeans, and the rest bootcut or regular.

Such as doing chores, getting good grades, etc.
TcgUE0WYaa	I think mild cramps are ok but if it turns into pain, then you should be checked out. I had a feeling like period pain, then it turned to a sharp stabbing pain on my left side, I am 6.5 weeks pregnant but my levels are so low. The gyn at the hospital are investigating me for an ectopic pregnancy. Sadly, my pregnancy isnt viable and I am so pleased I went to get checked out so that I can come to terms with it sooner. I really hope this is not the same for you but I cant help but be cautious! Best of luck xx|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yup it's normal. Your uterus is expanding and sometimes it's uncomfy. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That's normal. Both are totally normal.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	Mild cramps are very normal! If you have spotting or bleeding, call your doctor though, because that can (although not always) mean something more serious.<br>  <br>  The mild cramps is your uterus stretching to make room for baby :) I felt them from week 5 to week 7, and I still feel them occasionally. <br>  <br>  I haven't had sore breasts yet. I also don't have morning sickness.. just get tired more easily and have to constantly go pee. But they say every pregnancy is very different!|`|plI0WOrUaa	Yes its perfectly normal,don't worry.  It is your uterus growing and expanding for the expectation of a growing baby.  It feels similar to period cramps right??  Normal if it does not accompany any bleeding or severe cramps.  <br>  Not everyone's breasts will hurt during pregnancy.  Some peoples will hurt the whole time, others not at all.  If yours are only sore sometimes, that is what is normal for you.|`|VJnmHFR0aa	i found out that I was pregnant at five weeks, for the next two I had cramps at the end of the day when I was tired.  It was quite frightening, I used to lie on the bed, rubbing my tummy telling the baby how much I loved it.  My daughter turned a year last month.  Don't worry too much unless you bleed.<br>  <br>  Good luck hon!|`|piCMW7ZCaa	Yes, worry only if you start to bleed! Welcome to Pregnancy!|`|lJc9elfpaa	I'm 6 wks too and I have mild cramp- like pains. Feels like someone's poking me but not bad. I haven't been to OB yet (2 more wks!) but everyone I have talked to says this is normal. It's just everything shifting around, plus could be some bloating too (don't know about you but I am soooo bloated...). My breasts aches sometimes and then not at all. Plus I have virtually no morning sickess. Don't start stressing out yet!|`|5NBJUALFaa	your fine... its just the baby trying to punch its way out..
8kaDm2D8aa	i'm sorry, let me get this straight.  YOU have a 13 yr old & she didn't have sex & YOU are asking if she could be pregnant?  do YOU know how babies are conceived?<br>  <br>  EDIT: i read your other question, your an idiot.  your "doctor" said you can have twins or triplets depending on how hard your husband "did" you get a life|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sperm has to have gotten into her vagina for her to be pregnant. She's either lying to you about not having sex or she's just not understanding how sex works.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	without sex, no one can get pregnant *unless, they are virgin mary.<br>  unplanned , unprotected sex however is a different story.<br>  <br>  you're a parent?|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	You can not get pregnant if there was no sperm contact with the vagina. Yes you can get pregnant even if its unplanned. Also please remember that the "pull out" method is not always successful, there is premature ejaculate sometimes and you can get pregnant from that.|`|A2XYCdOYaa	With your vocab I should think you are not a parent but a sad 13 year old little girl bored and messing around (like)!|`|yKS2UI87aa	Doubt very highly she would be pregnant if she didn't have sex.|`|dNlCfhD2aa	YOU sound like you are 13....
1opNXHiLaa	Most cases of morning sickness start between the 4th and 6th week of pregnancy|`|0cUM1r3faa	Everyone is different. I started to get morning sickness around 5 1/2-6 weeks. I am 10 weeks now and it seems to be getting a little better. Some other signs that can happen early in pregnancy are sensitivity to smells, breast tenderness or swelling, fatigue, and just the thought of some types of food making you sick to your stomach. Even if it's something you loved eating before just the thought of it could make you sick to your stomach. Hope this helps :)|`|65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	Hi, I started feeling pukey around 5 weeks, it went away some but came back really strong at 10 weeks! I will be 13 weeks Wednesday and still dealing with it! Its not morning sickness for sure its all day sickness and it sucks!!!|`|ImOgCILSaa	i had a positive preg test at like 2-3 weeks after the event. in those few weeks every one was telling me i was preg because i was feeling sick every day and really hot. so it started really early for me i guess
30BC5dBVaa	Sounds pretty good. Definitely do take the HPT, it's the sure-fire way of knowing. Fingers crossed!<br>  <br>  You could be pregnant with a girl. You know what the old wives' tales say, all the extra preggo-pains & symptoms with them, draining you of your beauty for their own. Who knows, could be starting early!|`|FLOjzbKEaa	i think you are pregnant.  take a test.<br>  Gongratulations if you are!!!!!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	i think you're pregnant lol ..but then again indeed it could just be PMS symptoms. good luck though on the test and keep us updated!!!
t0mb150gaa	Ultrasounds are usually accurate for how far along you are give or take a few days. I don't think there is anything wrong..i have had the same experience with ultrasounds and discrepancy with my first day of last period. An ultrasound really just confirms how far along you are.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	its always off by a few days, dont worry|`|AA12148328	Ultrasounds don't determine the last period , they measure the baby and by those measurements they determine the gestational age of the baby . Also  the approximate date of birth  is determined by the measurements of the baby. <br>  I am not a Dr. but have attended many a ultrasound with my daughters , that's how I found out how they figure the dates.|`|bGRexKPyaa	The ultrasound goes by the baby. Not really your period. The due date the DOC gave you is accurate.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Ive asked a similar question to this.<br>  <br>  My period was 12 december. I make myself 12 weeks and 4 days but the scan said 13 weeks.
VKQzj4Pmaa	If he won't listen to you or your mother, then I guess he's not going to listen and that's the end of it.<br>  <br>  How do you approach him? Do you come across as attacking him or his son? If you are, he will only become defensive and not listen to you. Try to be casual about it. <br>  <br>  If talking doesn't work, why don't you talk to your mom? Maybe you and her can be in charge of making meals together. Make healthy, well-balanced meals. If you can't do it three times a day, then maybe you can aim to make at least one healthy meal for the family per day. It will encourage everyone to eat better, and give your step-brother a better chance at eating something besides fat and carbs.<br>  <br>  If you are home with your brother, you can make a healthy snack or a healthy meal. Ask him if he'd like some and encourage him to eat with you. Many kids do enjoy healthy foods, it's just a matter of someone caring enough to make sure they are eating it.<br>  <br>  I know it's not your responsibility to take care of your step-brother's nutritional needs, but it's good that you care about his health. Just do your best to encourage your brother directly. You are not his parent, so unfortunately there is not much you can do.|`|2IATHTXwaa	tell him he's a F U C K T A R D and need to feed his kid some good food|`|rXK7ziIDaa	if they are not listening to you maybe its your approach some people will listen if you make it fun after all he is only 12 <br>  order something you like and share it with him <br>  as for his step dad don't be too hard on him sit down and have a civilized conversation about it i think you are truly concerned but i believe maybe its the way you go about it that makes them ignore you <br>     (example you called your step dad a wuss)
858a0632fe3d77a7fe9bf558aaa8a346aa	I picture a person in their 30's, kinda shy, but very sweet.  Unfortunately, our parents over used the name and now it's common as Michael.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Nice name. Sweet girl. Pretty. -Long brown Hair. Destined to go to a Community College, -& then on to Nursing School. She'll marry- twice, & have a total of 3 kids. She'll retire as a Professional Nurse after 40+ years- & then move to Ft Myers, Florida - where she'll do Volunteer work at a Food Bank for the next 20. She'll leave this Life at age 97, surrounded by her 2 (surviving) children, 11 Grandchildren, & 3 Great- Grandchildren... All-in- all, she'll have a wonderful Life...  -Yup, -I'd DEFINATELY say that "Heather"- is the way to go !!!  :)|`|akIpddDSaa	bleh bleh BLAHHHHHH YUCK!<br>  have there been worse names?<br>  sorry for rudness but ive had A HORRIBLE past with that name!|`|qJ0zzHLZaa	i see a not so attractive girl and snobby. even tohugh i know a girl with that name who is so pretty and nice, but she just doesnt fit the name.|`|nyTVdVPqaa	I think its an old fashioned name. I think of someone who  likes to travel and is quiet and introverted.
qqiVKUBpaa	Yes, it's a very bad idea. Like the first answerer said it could trigger premature labor. I'm not sure that it would be a good idea immediately after either if you plan on breastfeeding. Colon cleansing is very dehydrating and dieting is generally a bad idea while breastfeeding. Be patient, the weight will drop off naturally in the next few months if you eat well and exercise. Also get a belly bandit, I swear that thing is really helping me.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	No, it is not safe.<br>  <br>  Diarrhea and Bowel cramps can sometimes lead to premature labour (Explains why so many impatient women try 'Castor oil', since it does the same thing)<br>  <br>  I would talk it over with a healthcare professional for all of the facts.|`|Iy4OhRlJaa	I don't think it's a good idea. Try to eat healthy and consult your doctor before going on a diet or exercise routine instead ok? Good luck with your baby :)
PDcnXgE6aa	Ok ...I think for first time u don't want to use condom, then take birth control pills 24hrs after sex..........and enjoy it|`|UYfqzCoMaa	YES!!! Not to mention any number of STD'S. Why are you planning on losing it on spring break?? How old are you and is it with someone that you love? Don't go sleeping around because then you'll have a reputation that you can't get rid of. Be careful and really think about it.|`|qW7aSBI2aa	Duh.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	I'm sorry to be mean when I say this but if you have to ask such a dumb @ss question then you need to stay your @ss home for spring break and read a couple of books or watch some movies or some sh!!!t like that!<br>  <br>  You're not ready!|`|5YN5Dge9aa	Well, if you have sex without protection when you're ovulating then there is a very high risk of getting pregnant.|`|kT7GVOosaa	go back to sex education then have sex.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	yes. and don't plan it for spring break, that's just cheesy.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Getting pregnant should be the least of your worries if you have sex without protection.<br>  <br>  Ever heard of HIV and other STDs that don't go away after spring break?<br>  <br>  But to answer your alarmingly naive question (if you have to ask, are you even old enough to have sex?), yes, you can get pregnant if you do not use protection during sexual intercourse.|`|AA0MuMt3aa	If you don't even know the basics then just don't do it.<br>  I must repeat myself:<br>  DO<br>  NOT<br>  HAVE<br>  SEX<br>  <br>  Ask yourself these:<br>  - Do you understand EVERYTHING to do with sex? Pregnancy, STI's, and moral aspects?<br>  - Do you realise how much of a pain it is and that you won't be feeling any pleasure?<br>  - Are you doing it with someone you love and trust completely and who you would sacrifice anything for?<br>  - Do you really want to be used by some desperate, overly-horny guy?<br>  <br>  Just don't do it until you're older. Losing your virginity is a huge deal. Don't do it if you're not ready.|`|1fjhg6j4aa	You can even get pregnant if you use protection.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	you can get pregnant anytime you have sex whether your using protection or not!!|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Sounds like you're saving yourself for the perfect guy, the guy you will love forever!  Good for you!<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is yes.|`|KmC0K59taa	Yes.  Make him wear a condom or to go Planned Parenthood and get on birth control pills.|`|DrnyKfXBaa	yes.<br>  but google more on this topic(:|`|VBlrL1puaa	You obviously arent ready for a mature decision and adult act if you have to ask that question; they teach that in 4th grade. YES you can get pregnant the first time without protection, also how dumb planning your sexual encounter, but not planning to be safe. Get smart for yourself and your potential partner.|`|qNpVIPdDaa	of course you can get pregnant i suggest if your thinking about having sex you go to an obs/gyn and think about getting on birth control you should have a combo of 2 types of birth control to be safe like a condom and the pill.....or a condom and a diaphram.......there are many options out there....but if parents are a problem then a condom is better than nothing|`|SlSayKllaa	please use protection...pleeease...no matter what.to think you have aids thats uncurable is scary. and plus dont be afraid.yes it hurts....it hurts before and after.but within that theres pleasure.any way getting pregnant isnt good...kids??? you dont want to have so avoid. if u want...have sex...just protect what u love ...YOU!!!|`|bdYDOAOHaa	Let's see about that. That is a big YES! If you are going to do that go on birth control or make him wear a condom. if you don't use any protection then yes you will probably get pregnant.|`|XvoW7DKmaa	yes maybe you can still be pregnant but make sure your not too young too have SEX but talk to your parents or look on the internet for help or even ask your best friend mostly ask someone you can trust!|`|eypaA3NZaa	the only way NOT to get pregnant is to use a condom<br>  AND you CAN get pregnant even if you use birth control pills because its been proved and researched, but its slight  probably a 8% chance|`|pq2q0upuaa	yeah if you are ready to have sex then please use protection it dnt matter if it's your first time or your fiftieth time make shure you take the right precautions|`|26tmsARFaa	Yes you can very eaisly jeez sex ed 101 all over again.<br>  <br>  Use protection or end up like Juno|`|GjGuy3bYaa	Yaaa that's a toughie good luck lol|`|qiNigYZCaa	the only safe sex is abstinence... soooo just dont be stupid

AA11065140	Totally normal.  If he's only three, then it really is still a new concept.  Also, at that age, it's very normal for kids to be so distracted by playing that they forget to pay attention.<br>  <br>  Just keep up with the tricks you used when he was potty training.  If it has been a while since he went, ask him if he needs to go.  Be sure to stop at the restroom before leaving the house, and again when you get where you're going.  And don't make it a big deal - generally, kids already feel bad about forgetting, so just let it slide when it happens.
Z1e3Cxjoaa	I love the digital ept because for one you don't have to look at lines and make sure to read it in a certain amount of time and i have always gotten an accurate answer.|`|nYjE5IXEaa	I would say First Response Digital. Its works really good and you don't have to worry about the lines. like if you get a line and a half. I[m not to sure of the price but if it is a big issue for you, you should go to your local Planned Parenthood and you can get a free test.|`|ncUhlwevaa	First Response. Detects the earliest pregnancy hormones.|`|98d8c3e3328b57d9fa0c7f9c021e8603aa	i used EPT i was 2weeks late and it worked...but i heard First Response was good also...|`|TbRQVDoIaa	I took a home pregnancy test from the dollar store yep $1, IT WAS POSITIVE AND I HADN'T EVEN MISSED MY PERIOD YET.  I went to the ER and I was pregnant.  So it really doesn't matter what brand you use if your prego it will show up.|`|laTJgnBxaa	First Response!|`|62vCoDPjaa	i used the walmart brand the first time..freaked when i saw that positive line, and bought one of the first response digital ones|`|JNoJWcFvaa	There are a lot of older ways to do the tests, but none that you would want to do in this day and age.<br>  <br>  A urine test is non-invasive and although the chemicals are on the pee-stick, they do not come in contact with the body and will not harm you or your baby.<br>  <br>  The dollar store has some pretty good tests from what I hear for only $1. Walmart has ones that are around $4.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/_rkut/hub/Home-Remedy-Pregnancy-Test" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/_rkut/hub/Home-Remed...</a>
9eVr7YL2aa	i suggest some pregnancy tests...<br>  <br>          -11 year old kid|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Slim. It's rare to ovulate during your period but it's possible.|`|aMN30gyXaa	Your egg drops the week BEFORE your period which means you dont have an INCREASED chance. go take the morning after pill from PLanned Parenthood (free if u have no health insurance) OR take a pregancy test. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|krPWpHf0aa	YES, YOU CAN BE PREGNANT, YOU CAN STILL GET THE MORNING AFTER PILL AT YOUR LOCAL DRUG STORE OR GO TO YOUR FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC WITH IN 72 HRS|`|nYjE5IXEaa	I would say that it is a SLIM chance that you are pregnant. You get your period because your egg was not fertilized and its flushing out of your body. So your ok.
vH2OF9z8aa	Libra (Sep 23 - Sep 23)<br>  Friday, March 13, 2009 <br>  Sometimes people who are extremely generous with you aren't doing it just out of the kindness of their heart. You've got to get a little bit more skeptical right now and accept the fact that sometimes folks have ulterior motives. Ask a few probing questions, if things seem too good to be true. Find out what the real deal probably is. As long as you know what is really going on, you are not going to get taken advantage of. Don't accept gifts without knowing what strings are attached. <br>  Your Lucky Numbers for this week are: 25, 24, 23, 52, 40, 15|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Her lucky number is 7.|`|QP46eVi4aa	i am no sure but i think my little girls is 4 cause she was born at 4:44 pm in room 444 and weighed 4 punds 4 onces and was 14 inches long|`|7fE27hcIaa	Wild guess cause i havent a clue what your talking about 27
TJusfEnlaa	Yeah definately. I flew on a 5 hour flight with my son when he was only 3 weeks old.|`|ecLVTXKUaa	Oh yes.  I'm sure everything would be fine.  My husband is in the military and my babies have all traveled by plane since they were 2 months old.<br>  You can either carry the baby with you or in a carseat on a separate seat.<br>  <br>  Babies at this stage sleep most of the way anyways.  Just be sure to have everything that would be needed in ur carry-on... for feedings and diaper changes and such.  <br>  *It is good for babies to use a pacifer throughout parts of the flight because it helps prevent their ears from possible uncomfortableness that even us adults have during flights (ear popping)<br>  *Bottle feedings also help prevent this since the baby is using the same motion of the jaw.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps... Take Care  :)|`|XQuprZxUaa	yes children can travel at that age. Just make sure that you are careful with traveling over seas with a newborn. But you should be good.
jPlVTXcdaa	Some ultrasound techs try to do it early...but it's really not possible to be sure till 20 weeks.  Up until then it's still a possibility of the genitals looking alike until they develop more.  I wouldn't go out buying girl items yet...good luck!|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	It's not weird at all. They were calling that my little man was a boy from 8 weeks, and I got plenty of sonograms throughout the pregnancy. Sometimes the docs are just on point! :-) Every doc I had could very easily tell from very early on what I was having (and I switched docs midway AND there were 2 different docs practicing in conjunction at the first place I was going before I made the switch)<br>  <br>  Congratulations! This whole process is very exciting<br>  <br>  EDIT: even though they called it, i did not buy anything until later on|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Its possible.<br>  <br>  God Bless x Some people like to find out early others wait.<br>  Everyone has different opinions.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Its' not too early per se. The sex organs are fully formed by 10 weeks so it's not impossible to see them. I had an ultrasound at 12 weeks and the tech said (not 100% of course) that he saw a penis. Before he said that I thought I had seen a penis...It's early for positive verfication. Usually they won't tell you yeah it's a girl or boy until at least 18 weeks.|`|lnp5yy3maa	Congrats on your baby girl! My doctor wouldn't tell us the gender b/c he said that before 20 weeks the fetal clitoris can actually look like a penis, so we're going to find out next week what we're having. But I "feel" like I'm having a boy, so I've been calling the baby "he". <br>  <br>  But I do know a woman who found out her baby's gender at 16 weeks, so it does happen.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	15 weeks is still early. The genitals aren't yet fully developed and it can be hard really differentiate the gender at that stage. I wouldn't go out and buy pink yet. Wait until 18 to 20 weeks and get another ultrasound done.|`|QSodlfMraa	i found out at 17 weeks its a girl <br>  congrats :)!|`|IlSALGKMaa	It's possible to tell, but I wouldn't be too sure if they say it's a girl. I would wait until your 20 week ultrasound before buying a bunch of pink, just to be certain. They couldn't tell at my 16 week appointment that it was a boy, and I went today at 20 weeks and he's VERY clearly a boy.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Thats SUPER early, I would get another one done again at about 20 weeks, cause I was told I was having a boy at 14 weeks..and again at 16 weeks. Well had one done at 18 weeks, and there was my GIRL! Had another done at 22 weeks and it still was a girl! But you could have been told right. So good Luck and congrats!|`|OU9xnW86aa	It will need to be confirmed later on in your pregnancy. It is not normal to find out so early because both boys and girls have female looking genitals that early on. You could still be having a girl.<br>  <br>  I didn't find out until I was 19 weeks.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	If you have an u/s schedule for that time, then I guess you're lucky. Or your baby is a week or two further developed, usually they say from week 16 onward they can tell....<br>  <br>  Mine is scheduled next Monday at 20 weeks (per insurance guidelines)|`|eV7rtxmuaa	yes i found out i was carrying my daughter at 13 weeks. At 40 weeks and 5 days my daughter was born. So even tho it was an early scan... they were still right. Congrats!|`|53QQ9KXEaa	People generally don't find out that early, but I've known of a couple people who have.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	its possible but you really should get it confirmed before you start buying girl stuff|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	my next apointment ill be almost 15 weeks so i hope ill be able to find out then too, congrats! =)|`|hyp3bvhHaa	I was told at my 13 week scan that i was having a boy, then everyone i told said there was no way they could tell that soon and implied i'd made it up.<br>  annoyingly when i went for my next two scans the legs were crossed so i was left guessing but they were right and i had a boy.<br>  form the research i did at the time i believe an experienced sonograper using good equipment can tell earlier than they'll often admit to but that the accuracy at this tage is obviously lower so don't pin your hopes on a igrl too much or paint the room pink just yet until your next scan confirms it|`|2fpKELiUaa	I'm fifteen weeks pregnant also. (Haven't found out the gender yet, though.) However, I have a friend who had her first at 18, and she was able to find out the gender at about 15 and a half weeks. It all depends on how lucky you get, I guess. <br>  <br>  But anyway, congratulations! Take care of yourself and your baby girl. :)|`|ZvkX9uNraa	Most people do not find out the sex that soon because they generally do an ultrasound at 12 weeks and then again at 18 or 20 to ensure that they will be able to tell the sex at that point. I have heard of people finding out the sex at 13 weeks, so 14 is not out of the ordinary. Welcome to the pink team, I am having a girl as well! Congrats!|`|hORVMOHKaa	i found out i was having a boy at 15 weeks and 3 days but its more common to find out that its a boy early. I'm alittle hesitant to buy stuff until my next ultrasound just to double check before i buy alot of boy stuff<br>  <br>  <br>  the ultrasound tech said she was 99% sure it was a boy|`|ca9dEvSAaa	It's possible, but don't spend alot of money on girl stuff yet. I was told the wrong gender at 15 weeks 3 days. (I'm not saying everyone will be told wrong, but it is possible)|`|plI0WOrUaa	I think its odd to see the gender that early.  Usually the genitalia aren't even fully formed at that time.  I guess if they told you though, they must have seen it.  But it is unusual for sure.|`|JvcJs8k9aa	i'd definitely have it reconfirmed in a few more weeks, just to be safe. 15 weeks is a little early. the girl parts could extend into boy parts..|`|6ri7AYC1aa	It's possible. My friend was about 3 and half months pregnant when she found out the gender of her baby. <br>  But I would wait a few months and have the doctor check again before buying clothes.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Im so jealous. lol Im 17 weeks and the doctors won't do the ultra sound to find out what Im having yet. They wanna wait until Im like 21 weeks. Im so impatient. lol. congradulations!|`|CKnHMYHnaa	I found out at 13 weeks and 3 days.  If people don't believe you then say "fine, you don't have to."|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	If your due on sept 6th then you are 14 weeks and 1 day today???|`|0rIrGZJZaa	No.. You found out at 6 months...|`|3rYEz5vSaa	my aunt couldnt find out till she was at least 4 months pregnant..<br>  i guesss its possible.<br>  good luck ;]|`|ETvV9aypaa	i guess its possible. but i suggest u see the doc again and ask wen ur bout 19 weeks just to make sure :D congrads
3754d2543eadec1d99af75a4dcded1baaa	i've been using the same kind of bottle for 2 months now. my daughter has 5 bottles so i clean them twice a day. i hand wash them but first i take the bottle and the nipple apart and i clean them one by one and i leave them to dry in the baby bottle rack that i have and when it's time to use them i put them back together. <br>  about the old bottle that you had i think you should throw it away. it's not worth risking your baby getting sick. you know if you leave milk in the bottle too long bacteria starts forming inside so it's always good to clean them asap. you can always go to the store and replace the one you're going to be trowing out.|`|vJEatJFPaa	I've been using those bottles from the beginning. You can either scrub them in hot soapy water (un-essembled) or throw them in the dish washer. Munchkin makes a dishwasher basket you can buy for the smaller parts. I've been using the dishwasher for mine.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I throw mine in the dish washer.  For the first three months, I would sterilize them every week or so.  Now I hand wash them every two weeks and throw them in the dish washer the rest of the time.  <br>  <br>  That's gross about the green though--you might want to throw that one away!!|`|quNfHZULaa	Well what I do is right after my baby is done with it I take it to the sink and rinse it out. That normally does it but then it will get like a milky film maybe every other time so then I will use some dish detergent and shake it up with hot water really well. Putting them on the top rack in the dish washer works the best but I don't do dishes everyday so this is what I do between times. It seems to help. If I were you I would just toss that other one. The thing is if you boil it really well or even use bleach on it, then it might be clean enough to use again, but it will still be stained. This has happened to me before. If it got moldy it will stain it where that stuff wont fix it. The problem with a stain is that if it happens again you will think it is just the stain and might not clean it well enough, therefore your baby could then get the mold. They aren't too extremely expensive so I like being better safe then sorry.
SjX72fPyaa	I used it to clean my piercings and I never got a reaction. Everyone's different though so you will only know if you try using it.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	What is Spectro Jel?
oXzHvsBpaa	My son rolling over for the first time. Well this was really the second. First time I didn't have the camera ready.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9ZO3InxcbI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9ZO3Inxc...</a>|`|w6DJj1a8aa	well my baby is 3 and she always tells me how much she loves me and says good morning mama and  kisses me and with my other baby he is 6 years old i love  how he tries to act to get to me but i know that he loves me and his sister sooo much even though he tries to act like he don't but yeahhhh i'm proud of both of them in different ways =)|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Normally my daughter drags along on her stomach but 2 weeks ago when she was 6 mths she got up on her knees and started creeping. She hasn't mastered it 100% & combines dragging & creeping to get her around the room. Today she turned 7 mths & for the 1st time she was able to pull herself up to the standing position in her play pen. She does this easily in her crib but could never get it done in her pen until today, yahh!!|`|XdSWfpe7aa	when he started responding and smiles all the time when he sees me.....it's a feeling i cant explain its like nirvana for me...my baby is 2 1/2 months old now and he weights 14.4lbs..hehehehe|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Mine was when she reached for me last month.  She's 7 1/2 months old and reaches for me all the time now!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Lately, my son has learned to clap and crawl and go from laying down to sitting up. It seems to have happened so fast!|`|qv9ESpOOaa	My baby started responding with coos and baby sounds before she turned 3 months.  And she learned how to look and smile for the camera before 4 months...
zSEJC6vZaa	My cup size didn't change either - I got a little swollen, but that's it.<br>  <br>  Don't worry.<br>  <br>  If you breastfeed, I PROMISE you will have lovely, full boobs.  It'll take a week or so for your milk to fully come in.|`|QSodlfMraa	my breast are the same size too so its not you alone :)|`|AA11795652	Every person is different.  If you breastfeed, they might get bigger.  I went from a D to an F with my 1st pregnancy and down to a DD.  And with my second, from a DD to an F and now a DDD even though I'm still breastfeeding.|`|4AZp8Quwaa	Guess everyone is different. I went from a 32A to a 36C, that's 2 cup sizes.
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	any time you have sex and he ejaculates inside you can be pregnant. Forget dates and all that. Yes brown spotting and little amount of spotting can be from pregnancy or implantation bleeding. Light cramping is normal also if you are freshly pregnant and can last through out the pregnancy. IF you do not have your regular flow yet, time to take a test and tell your boyfriend to get ready to take care of you and your baby.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Yes. You can still get cramps while pregnant.
BnWf3f39aa	If you have gone that many months without a cycle, you should definately call your OBGYN and get checked out.  After your ectopic pregnancy your body may not be ovulating regularly which would cause an absence of your period.  If the urine tests are continuously negative, it's unlikely that you're pregnant now, but if you continue to have unprotected it's possible for you to become pregnant if you do manage to ovulate.  <br>  <br>  Either way, you should still let your doctor know what's going on so that you can get whatever help you need.|`|3y0jPzgSaa	well if you had unprotected sex then there's always a chance!|`|rXtYSkpgaa	youll just have to wait and get the results back.<br>  but the blood test will be way more accurate and trustworthy than the urine tests.<br>  and you shouldnt worry about it.<br>  dont stress; thatll hold it up too.
cfdooGylaa	Most likely you'll be fine. Plan b has 87% rate of success if taken correctly though...|`|AA11220327	yes, nausea is one of the side effects on the plan b pill, it doesnt last long tho|`|J1stiMioaa	you should be fine, as long as you arent actually sick. if i remember correctly i felt a little sicky when i took it years ago|`|Plu6OVoGaa	You'll be fine and by fine I mean not pregnant. When I took it, I didn't feel any of the side effects though which was a little surprising.

Anything rhyming keeps me entertained. After reading books over and over again 100 times, I end up getting bored, unless they rhyme. Something about them, LOL!<br>  <br>  The Child Called It has been one I've been reading to myself. I really reccomend it!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, and I'm also a fan of Goodnight Moon. That's my all time favorite!|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	I love Dr. Seuss. <br>  I like The Popcorn Dragon. The Real Mother Goose Rhymes.  Peter Cottontail.

P544Sbmqaa	Well, its your sis's fault for lieing to you.  However, it was your own personal responsibility to make sure if you were allowed to or not allowed to.  Lesson for the future...   regardless of who tells you something like that, check with your parents, or depending on the situation your teacher, or in a few years your boss before doing anything like that.  Your mom just grounded you for a weekend to help you understand something along those lines.  A boss out in the real world would have fired you on the spot regardless of the reasons and without a care as to whose fault it was.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Well there isn't anything you can do really.<br>  You know whats right. And you now know next time to not believe your sister. Why don't you just go to the school functions..?|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Basically you have 2 choices. You can be right or you can be happy.|`|TycCeqtaaa	i think its your sisters fault but your parents see you as the "you should have checked first" kind of person|`|soFpywFcaa	well your sister is dead wrong its not your fault|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Regardless of what your parents were told, they are the ones that made the decision, and they have to deal with the results of that.  To me, it sounds like your parents are just mad at being deceived and are taking it out on you guys rather than being responsible for their own decisions.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, I totally would have encouraged you both to stay home and be productive at home rather than sitting in school doing nothing.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	If I were you I would think it is unfair because you were not aware of all the details. If I was one of your parents I would have grounded you anyway on the basis that you a) still ended up with a day off, b) if you had thought of it first you probably would have still gone through with it.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	If you're just going to watch films and not take any lessons then what's the point in going in, they sound like authoritarians who just want to give out orders even when there's no need for it. It was sister's fault for lying.|`|rXK7ziIDaa	this was mostly your sisters fault it was totally unfair that you got in trouble as it wasn't your idea to stay home... but i think that you should have confirmed this with your mom as well instead of just taking your sisters word
s4Ak6Z54aa	please dont let him bother you. i got headaches alot.  i had one everyday for a whole month. i used imitrex which is what i think you tried to type. i had to stop using it when i got pregnant.  every woman is diff when it comes to pregnancy.. and if you have had other health problems in the past that effect you now.. that just makes pregnancy twice as hard.. get hormonal if u want. explain to him why you are like this. tell him he just needs to get over it and deal with it. it will only last 9 months.|`|DTkAVdk4aa	When my aunt was pregnant her boyfriend was really mean like that, too, at first.  She said it was because they couldn’t get busy anymore (whatever that means).  She also said it was because they were both kids.  She was 22 and he was 25.  I think it is because men are just dumb like that and don’t appreciate anything.  They only care about their feelings and what they want and don’t care about what their girlfriends want or need.<br>  <br>  One day when my Aunt was really sick, she made her boyfriend a really nice dinner, waited on him hand and foot and didn’t complain at all.  He could see she was in pain, but he still let her do all the work!  She waited until he was as content as he could be then she asked him if they could talk for a minute and he said okay.  She didn’t scream or shout like she usually does, instead she just calmly said, “I know this whole pregnancy thing has really been hard on you and I’m going to start being there for you more.”  He started crying!  After that, he started helping out way more!  My aunt said she put some reverse ecology on him.  Whatever it was it worked!|`|3vWpUXsmaa	Some guys have difficulty sympathizing with us because they don't understand what is going on inside our bodies. I used to sit in the bathtub and cry for no reason at all and my husband would ask me why and I would tell him I didn't know why I was crying because I didn't know! So I found out about this book called "Pregnancy for dummies" and made him read it and he was able to understand more clearly why I was such a nut case!|`|98WKYtfwaa	To the first user Anna - Get a life, what's the purpose of you coming onto peoples questions and rudely answering them with something that's completely irrelevant? <br>  <br>  Does it matter if she's not married? Most women who have babies aren't these days, your source says " life " well i think you should definitely get into the real world instead of being stuck in the dark ages were people were so narrow minded and rude. Even if she was married, the guy doesn't have to be there for her, he could leave and divorce her, it really makes no difference. <br>  <br>  I can't stand snotty sour faced shallow minded people.|`|EFGKxSsVaa	Hm, your boyfriend seems like an asshole.<br>  I dont know what to tell you but you should probably yell some sense into him! Tell him everything your feeling, tell him that you don't think it's cool that he's treating you like this, he's not the pregnant one, you are. therefore he should get the stick out of his a$$ and be more supportive!|`|VFIF4zpAaa	You prob won't be able to talk to him about this problem without getting emotional. But, it's worth a try. Just wait for the right time and then confront him about it. maybe ask him why he isn't more sensitive about you being pregnant. Try that. Hope i helped a lil.<br>  <br>  ~Jesus is Love~|`|ojVl4Gowaa	Actually, older men should be more sensitive to a woman's feelings. They've lived long enough to the know better than to piss off a pregnant woman!<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about your health issues, and that would definitely make pregnancy super hard for you. When he brings up other women you have to tell him that you understand his point of view but not many women are in your unique position. They don't have frequent migraines that they can't take medication to relieve. It's hard to get someone to be more sensitive to your feelings, but as long as you explain the rationale behind why you need naps and breaks his man logic should kick in and say "Hey, she's different. She needs rest because of her health."|`|roe07rI8aa	He's behaving like a bit of a jerk to be honest. early pregnancy is VERY tiring for all women. The days of sailing through are still in front of you. They happen between about 16/18 weeks to about 29-32 weeks. The first trimester when no-one can tell is the hardest by a long shot and that's without the complication of serious migraine. you need to rest up and do your best to ignore your partner. straess is very bad for pregnancy and you need to try and rise above it. when baby is here, fingers crossed, reek your revenge by going off to a spa for an overnight stay with a girlfriend and leaving said partner to cope for a couple of days on his own. he won't know what's hit him!!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy, hope it all goes well.
pjgMW6qaaa	Why would you start showing?<br>  If you were pregnant the baby is not even like a cm ? <br>  <br>  Bloating yes maybe.<br>  Why don't you take a test?<br>  We don't know.<br>  <br>  Don't mean to sound rude but its as simple as taking a test or google pregnancy symptoms...|`|HM0cxcahaa	Maybe a little bloat but not full on showing to where someone would ask if you are pregnant|`|xNeIIVkYaa	Hi, you may be bloated due to not having your period and you could be late due to a little stress!  Take a test to be sure-if it is negative wait 2 weeks and take another-and do not worry about it in the mean time as this will keep you from starting your period:-)
KV590Y6Saa	If it was only two days later you don't need to take Plan B again, it's good for one cycle.  Try some other form of birth control.|`|AA10943329	buy better condoms, go on the Pill or do something. You cannot keep relying on Plan B|`|5rqVTOzmaa	You need to get on birth control. Plan B only works about 70% of the time.
QnJvJ67uaa	There is porn and there is porn....straight porn is healthy and normal for a teenager (boy OR girl) however the internet is host to every imaginable horror, I wouldn't;t want a young teenager of mine to be viewing stimulated rape or brutal anal sex.<br>  I think I would talk about it, explain that some porn is ok, but make sure he understands that it is not real life, its no more as real as a REAL sex life than a cartoon is.<br>  I would also wonder who's credit card he was using to access online porn to watch ;)|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I'd send his dad in. I assume his dad would just teach him how to safely surf porn. "There's so many sites out there that will attract all kinds of viruses and worms." I can just picture him saying that.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Don't assume He's stealing your cards and buying it like some people say. Trust me, because of my guy friends >_>, I know how to access porn for free. But I would talk to him about it and make sure it doesn't become an addiction.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Move the comp to a public room.  I dont think porn is the evil of all evils, so Im not gonna make a huge deal out of it.  However, I think porn gives an unrealistic expectation of what sex is to someone as young as a teenager, especially if they have never had a sexual relationship.  So, I think it should be limited and would make sure all the comps were in a public room like the living room or kitchen so that porn surfing would at least be limited.|`|hL4nWbzmaa	you can install NetDog Porn Filter : <a href="http://www.netdogsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdogsoft.com</a> on the computer, netdog blocks all porn quitely and automatically in the background when anyone's on the computer.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	he would stare at me with his mouth open i would stare at him with my mouth open  then after a few minutes i would say ..im going for a walk ..when i come back we will talk ....|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I would say "write the name of the site down so mommy and daddy can watch it later"<br>  <br>  Just kidding.  I would not know what to do.  It would be amusing to one degree and I would feel the need to explain everything.  I think I would make him feel awkward by trying to tell him that it is normal and he should not feel awkward- know what I mean?<br>  <br>  I do not want my son to be ashamed of his body, but I also do not want to pay a huge cable bill...|`|Txr7g5xmaa	As i see it its not a problem that he is watching porn.. Its normal and about 95% of all boys in the age of 14-17 is watching porn online.. <br>  Of course there is many different types of porn and if he is watching people being raped or anything like that you maybe want to talk things over with him.. Otherwise just leave him alone and try not to talk too much about it|`|LwbwMFX9aa	i would sit and talk with him. I would advise him it's normal to want to see sex and to masturbate BUT I would prefer him to look at magazines because YOU never know really if that girl  or guy is going to be underage and I dont want anyone coming to my house saying I have kiddie porn on my computer|`|rXK7ziIDaa	tell him its a bad thing to do and not to do it again and dont tell him too much about it as then he might get curious <br>  try to get someone block the websites that have porn <br>  or put the computer in a public area of the house|`|RhHv5pYwaa	Explain that those people do that as a way of living and that's not something he should watch at this point in his life. Also that being with a woman should be special and not displayed this way.|`|soFpywFcaa	act like i didnt see because that is perfectly healthy............at least he is not getting any girl pregnant|`|2IATHTXwaa	tell him it's bad and then leave the room|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	tell him not to and then leave..<br>  you cant do much.. all boys do it and you cant do anything..

I really don't think naming your child after a food is a good way to stay on her good side through the teenage years....Seriously|`|ZX2so3twaa	i think the apple part is dumb.<br>  i like grace though.|`|tlu9wlNAaa	not keen sweetie sorry xx|`|66tTuuIFaa	Why Apple over something equally silly like Mango, Papaya, or Grapefruit?<br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly there are some things that can be turned into nice names, like flowers for instance. Names like Rose and Violet work well.  But it's best to steer clear of anything you can eat. <br>  <br>  No names like Cookie, Apple, Cupcake etc.|`|Gy8eVhgNaa	Grace is great.  Drop the apple though.<br>  She will be made fun of for the rest of her life.  When she's trying to get a job employers won't take her seriously.  It may be cute now (though I disagree) but it definitely won't be cute when she's 40.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Horrid. Poor poor kid. She certainly would despise you for it, and change her name when she hit eighteen. Apple is a fruit, not a name. It is not cute. And Grace is filler. The hyphen is stupid and pointless.|`|AOkucu5haa	It may seem cute when she's young, but who can possibly take someone named Apple seriously?|`|pvjEOGtOaa	of course your kid will hate you for the name....its sweet as an apple not for names .|`|WPI0Z47saa	No. It may be "cute" for a little kid but how do you think that will look for them when they go on job interviews?|`|k8pFvtMLaa	I'm not too fond of it. Apple is a fruit. I just can't think of it as a name.|`|Jteqao3zaa	she's gonna hate you.  come on, how would you like to be named apple?  and grace is so over used right now, i'm kind of sick of hearing it.  give her a respectable and unique name that she can be proud to carry in life.|`|AA11413831	i am really not a fan of the 'naming my kids after fruit' thing.<br>  i also dont like the 'cramming two names into one' thing. <br>  <br>  maybe have apple be the middle name.<br>  i really like grace though. thats a really cute name :]|`|wDNegAOnaa	Grace is pretty, it's my middle name. Apple is not very good though... I'm sorry. I just don't think it's a good name. It'd be sorta like naming your kid Grapefruit or Orange.|`|T0NvgQTUaa	personally, i dont think kids should be named after fruit.<br>  but it does sound cute together.<br>  <br>  maybe anna grace.<br>  or alysha grace.<br>  or ariana grace.|`|57LFRfqCaa	Can you honestly say you would have chosen Apple for a name if Gwyneth P hadn't already done so?

Your child will thank you for a normal name.<br>  <br>  Now, on the flip side, if you decide to go ahead with this, then pat yourself on the back for having the mercy to at least give her a semi-normal middle name. Don't be surprised when as soon as she's able to understand that her name is weird, she starts going by Grace. God knows I would.|`|wFi2nxTkaa	Grace is pretty,but i wouldnt name my child after a fruit....sorry... but if you like that name i sure that you will be okay with it,besides it dont matter what people thinks.......|`|5dcZRW6naa	APPLE IS NOT A NAME ITS A FRUIT  my gosh people these days want to give their names the most stupid names and yes your next child could be banana-james and Broc-lee|`|DZJsQFGAaa	It's cute!!!!!!!<br>  If you use it, and someone likes it, they'll use it, and like 10 years later, it might be a popular name!|`|60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	Sounds like a fruit drink...APPLE-GRAPE....99% Fruit.<br>  <br>  Don't do it...your little boy will hate you forever.<br>  <br>  I hate you just for considering it.
eV5E9MhUaa	Yes. Go and get a blood test. If still no period, it could be the sign of something else that needs to be checked out by an ob.|`|p0prrzf2aa	yea there is a chance. go to the doc to see whats up with your period.|`|EgOiroovaa	Once u become sexually active ur body is constantly changing.<br>  I've gone up to 3 months without my period and the doctors says that's normal for some people. It can also be that your under a lot of stress.Just wait 2 or 3 more weeks if u don't get it by then take another test. Another way to find out if ur pregnant is to check if u get any symthoms....to get a list of the symthoms go 2 www.parent.com|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	yeah there is a chance but dont worry to much.. you need to wait a month.. when your next period is due then take a pregnancy test.<br>  you still have time to have an abortion then..|`|7t5Gkeqkaa	I'm in the same boat. I am several days late and taken several tests and all are negative. I'm HOPING there's still a chance I could be!! Good luck! Lots of baby dust!!|`|WuVW9uCAaa	yes i would take another one because to not have ur period that long is bad|`|GAh7g3Eaaa	If the test came out negative then you are definitely not pregnant.  The same thing happened to my daughter.  She thought she was pregnant when she missed her period about two or three weeks.  So she took a home pregnancy test twice and it came back negative, then she got tested at the doctors and that also came back negative.  Then she had to make an appointment to see her doctor, I think it was a gynecologist so they can check to see what was the problem.  And as it turned out, there was a problem and she was prescribed medication to get her period regulated again.  So you definitely need to go see your doctor so that they can check you out and figure out what is going on with you and fix the problem.  Best Wishes.

E2e485WRaa	I am so sorry you are going through this.  I am very sorry for the loss of your baby.  <br>  <br>  There is a support group on babycenter.com  for Termination for medical reasons:  <a href="http://community.babycenter.com/groups/a6325/termination_for_medical_reasons" rel="nofollow">http://community.babycenter.com/groups/a...</a>  I highly recommend you join the group.  It is only for women who have been through this type of tragedy.  The women on the board are very supportive and helpful.  There are many women on the site that did do something for their babies.  <br>  <br>  My last pregnancy, I made the heartbreaking decision to terminate for a chromosomally abnormality at 18w5d.  I did not do any type of service.  But that was just me.  I cried every day for six months after my baby girl's death.  It was a year before I felt like me again - a changed me but me.  I still think about my baby but I am no longer in pain like I was.  I will never forget her. <br>  <br>  You will also never forget your baby girl.  Honor her in the way you feel best.   <br>  <br>  I wish you strength and courage.  Hang in there.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	At 23 weeks you should have had a name picked out..ect..im sure, so yes I think you should give her a memorial service. She is a good age, not as if she was 10 weeks or something..|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	My condolences for you situation.<br>  I lost my baby in my seventh month of pregnancy and got out of the hospital one hour before her funeral.<br>  YES, have a funeral.  It will give you closure.<br>  Name her.  She is a child of God.<br>  I would like to pray for a miracle in your life, <br>  in accordance with the Father's will.<br>  Since I am not that familiar with triploidy, <br>  I cannot imagine what you are going through.<br>  But I do know the loss of a daughter.<br>  Give her a name, and share your loss with others.<br>  May God bless you in this tough time!|`|Lzt1eIZFaa	At 23 weeks, I would have a little service, why don't you plant a tree or a rose bush in your garden?  then you can always have somewhere to go to remember her.  It's entirely up to you and your Husband what you do.  Do what would bring comfort to both of you at this terrible time.<br>  <br>  Also '24 weeks pregnant with a boy' , she didn't ask you about your opinion of terminations, stop being so heartless.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Sorry for your loss, it's completely upto you what you do.
hWc65sEtaa	You don't say how old you are, but by the way you talk I would say your not going through the change.  Go to the dr and get a blood test done.  That will tell you for sure.|`|Pr3HhNB1aa	You are most likley pregnant but you also may be under stress witch is causing the randomness of you period <br>  <br>  <br>  U should really go get checked by a doctor
plI0WOrUaa	You need to get to your doctor first of all to find out how far along you are.  That's important.  Then, go to planned parenthood or something and they can help you with all of the options available to you.  Don't try anything wierd, you need a professional approach here.  Your doctor and p.parenthood can not tell anyone, even your parents.  so don't worry about that.  good luck|`|R9uniJHaaa	well their is a pill and medical procedure's..i feel sorry for you because you really need to think about the after effect which might be hard given your age and the situation.. i know your young but abortions can be dangerous.. though depending on where you live you can visit the nearest adolescent clinic you might need a parent or gaurdain with you but for the actual clinic..they will give you options adoption, abortion but i hope you consider it.. you have a baby growing inside you..a life a person.. that is the greatest blessing no matter how wit occured..i really hope you think about it..Given your age though you might have a reason for an abortion.. clinics usially if you say i have no medical coverage they will give you emergency insurance called P-CAP that should cover the abortion rather then paying for it|`|cnK4X2sZaa	im gonna refrain from saying anything brash. i had to say that, cause usually i would say more. all i will say is that b/c of your age, you will have to tell your parents. anyone who is willing to preform anything on a 15 year old child. w/o their parents consent is unqualified and ethically wrong. and the last thing i will say is use a ******* condom! i am so sick of kids wanting to play like adults and then when the consequences come in to play they are looking for a way out. at 15 you SHOULD NOT BE HAVING SEX!!!!!!! okay so i couldn't help it...it's just so aggravating. the ridiculousness of this topic.  no one will be able to stop you from having sex...but the least you can do is be responsible. use a condom. in saying all that it's shitty that your in this situation. mostly i feel bad for the other baby in this situation. <br>  talk to your parents|`|HEXHdNKLaa	are you serious? that baby is ALIVE. its its own person, and you have no right to take its life away. your parents will get over it. yeah they will be mad at first, all parents are, but so what! the farther along you get, they will start to get more excited. and you dont have to keep the baby but i promise you, if you abort the baby, you will regret it the rest of your life. not one woman have i met that had an abortion at ANY age feels she did the right thing, and if they could go back they would. you will regret it and you will feel like a miserable piece of trash and for the rest of your life you will think about that baby and what you did to it. that baby already has a heartbeat! and just because it doesnt look like a newborn right now, doesnt mean its just a bunch of tissue. that bunch of tissue is a human LIFE, growing.  what if we just went around murdering little toddlers because they dont look like us and arent as developed as us? its MURDER. and you should SERIOUSLY reconsider|`|tkqV2CI5aa	well that would be stupid, if you have your first abortion and it will come back on you, i know PLENTY of people it has. I had my first baby at 16, pregnant with her at 15 right before my 16th birthday. I know it would be hard but can you imagine losing that baby and killing a life? One of my friends was going to do the abortion pill and it is $500.00. You have to have a parent if your under 18!|`|XYBHM8aSaa	The only way to stop the pregnancy is to get an abortion.  Those pills are not available in the US.  The ones here must be taken within 24hrs of unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.|`|KQU5y20waa	the following link is the best info i could find....i hope you watch it all so that you fully understand...|`|MHQEckxxaa	you have to be less then 8 weeks to take the pill it cost around $525.00 ...... fyi your parents will know something is up bcuz it is really painfull|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Why are you having unprotected sex at 15? If you think you are mature enough to have sex, you should be mature enough to accept responsibility for your actions. Abortion is the easy way out and its killing a life. Its wrong on all levels. It will scar you physically & emotionally for the rest of your life. <br>  The right thing to do in your situation would be to have the baby & give it up for adoption.|`|hWc65sEtaa	You won't be able to get anything with out your parents being you are under age.  Those pills require a prescription from a dr and you being over 18.<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents, you need their help.|`|ncUhlwevaa	Contact your local planned parenthood. They will tell you everything you need to know. For future reference don't post abortion questions in the pregnancy section. You will get very hostile answers.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you might get some pretty mean answers on this but you might want to talk to a doctor.<br>  <br>  its up to you. <br>  <br>  please take this as a lesson and do not have sex again or use birthcontrol and condoms|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	go to a planned parenthood they will help you|`|HOdblqIkaa	go to a planned parenthood in your area. i dont know what the cost is but you have to be at least less than 8 weeks pregnant. since you are under 16 you have to have a parents consent to this. you have to have proof of who you are (picture ID with proof of age). it is like 90some% effective. it is 2 pills one taken at the clinic if you are suitable to take it (they go thru your medical history and have an ultrasound to determine the fetus is under 8 weeks) if you can then you take one pill there and the other at home no more than 72 hours later. the pregnancy is dispelled at home normally within 6 hours of taking the second pill. a few weeks later you will have to go back for a check up to make sure the entire pregnancy is terminated. <br>  its pretty much the only legal and safe method of terminating a pregnancy at an early stage. but again you are too young so you will have to tell your parents, one of them has to be with you when you get it done. <br>  you could always try a pregnancy center in your area and see if you can get help thru them.
XYBHM8aSaa	Yes, you could be pregnant. People cannot psychically tell you on YA.  Get a test and know for sure.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Its not very likely that you would get pregnant from that, but its definetly possible. I would recommend taking a pregnancy test since you are late. good luck.
hWc65sEtaa	When the time is right, you will go into labor.  If for some reason you stop, they will give you medicine to help labor continue.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	yes darling. you will be able to go into labour on your own. Bubs will decide. You are 34 weeks & body is already preparing.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|e9d0f4d0966c82677bc0633c373b3dbbaa	You are only 34 weeks pregnant, just be patient, it will happen.<br>  <br>  You need to be at least 36 weeks to guarantee that the babys lungs are fully developed.  Normal pregnancy is 40 weeks. <br>  <br>  As long as you are not way overdue you are fine.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are on the right path as far as dilation and cervical thinning.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry just yet - and let me just say, that when you do finally go into labor, you will wonder why you wanted it to happen at all  =)|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	I would not stress about this just yet, you are only 34 weeks, and have ore  than enough time for labour to progress.|`|XYBHM8aSaa	Not even your Dr. can tell you that for 100% sure.  You will just have to wait and see.|`|AA11348933	Yes, you'll be able to go into labor on your own.  Have you ever heard of someone who was eternally pregnant?  It is perfectly normal to have contractions throughout your pregnancy.  Your body is just practicing for the real thing.  <br>  <br>  But you shouldn't be going into labor just yet.  A few more weeks and your baby'll be ready to come out on his/her own.  Good luck.|`|gXmJvdMSaa	If you are having preterm contractions then you will more than likely go into labor on your own. 'it's good that the contractions stop because it is too early to have your baby yet. You aren't considered to term until you hit 38 weeks. There is a good possibility that you'll go into labor early since you are already having contractions but then again you may not. Don't worry, If there is a problem Your doc will probably want to induce you when the time comes. Try to relax and enjoy the rest of your pregnancy.

It has to be a serious quick rise in temp where it may be harmful but right now 50% is hormones and 50% is metabolism.

IkkYOehSaa	in my state (oregon) your child has to be 40 lbs and I think 35 inches in order to be in a booster seat. no matter how much of a pain it is it's worth it, and maybe you should buy an extra carseat to help with the transfer.<br>  also 5 point is at each shoulder, each hip and then between the legs. the 3 point is just at each shoulder and between the legs. I don't think they even sell 3 points anymore. And most are out of date now.<br>  <br>  EDIT: your daughter is in no way ready for a booster seat. My son is 5 and just moved to one. Not until she is at least 4 1/2. And the longer a child is in a 5 point the safer they are.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I have my 4 year old in a Britax youth seat that has a 5 point harness (the safest) and he can use it up to 80lbs!  It has a tether so in addition to the seatbelt holding the seat in the seat is also tethered to the vehicle in the rear storage area. Britax is the way to go for safety!  You need to look at each particular seat to determine her ability to use it based on height and weight.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	a 3 pt harness it just straps from the shoulder to between the legs. a 5 pt is shoulders to the sides and then between the legs. i cant imagine a 3 pt car seat would be very safe...<br>  <br>  i'm not sure about when they can use a booster seat, i think its about 40lbs but not sure... it will say on packaging info or online info for a booster seat. you could try the babies r us website|`|tQVBDx5Paa	They have to be 40 lbs for what your referring too....somwhere around 4 years old probably.  You can buy a high back booster seat equipped with a five point harness though for 22 lbs - 80 lbs.|`|quNfHZULaa	<a href="http://www.elitecarseats.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=car_seat_laws" rel="nofollow">http://www.elitecarseats.com/custserv/cu...</a><br>   Click on your state and it will give you more info.
7zMtmKJaaa	damn 1st trimester was horrible for me. I HAD MORNING SICKNESS ALL DAY EVERYDAY<br>  okay your pain in the back and muscles will probably still be there in the 2nd trimester.<br>  your tiredness wil go away :D<br>  and you will get cravings but be hungry as normal.<br>  <br>  what sucks is you still cramp like abitch.<br>  <br>  but 2nd trimester is wonderful, your tummy will sart growing :D|`|0d1b5fcc305ead0ef5c939b96424f4b2aa	It varies. My entire pregnancy was miserable. My first trimester I was sick all the time but it turned out to be because of my prenatal vitamins. Sometimes the added amount of iron in them increase feelings of sickness so maybe speak to your doctor about that. The second trimester was better but I didn't have increased appetite and the third was achy and miserable.|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	I know exactly how you feel. I'm about 5 wks and my back has been killing me. I am having period like cramps and morning sickness on and off. It's weird though because I've actually got a smile on my face when these symptoms hit. It just reaffirms that I'm pregnant and that makes me feel so happy. Just hang in there, you'll feel better soon. Just remember when you feel bad that there's a miracle inside of you. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you feel better soon.|`|65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	Mine started around 5-6 weeks too, but went away for awhile I thought I wa lucky! Not even!! I will be 13 weeks on Wednesday and it has been horrible! I have lost 5 pounds since my first prenatal appointment. I feel so sick at the thought of food, and its so hard to eat. I have found the Target brand Ensure drinks are pretty good, I drink 1-2 a day. I hope you feel better soon!!|`|g7wQij2Oaa	i started to feel better at around 17/18 weeks. no morning sickness? lucky you.<br>  <br>  :)|`|70kh6VSoaa	in your second trimester you SHOULD start to feel better i on the other hand well felt better for a while now that i am 36 weeks i feel like butt again good luck|`|35kVNi5oaa	I started to feel better around 3 months.|`|rBPi6N2daa	i felt better within a couple days of hitting my 2nd trimester. the 1st is the roughest.|`|Nl3gv2q1aa	I remember the first trimester.  I had really bad morning sickness and coudn't keep anything down for most of Sept. and all of Oct last year.  I started feeling better around 12 or 13 weeks, but the morning sickness didn't completely go away until the beginning on this year.  The 2nd trimester was a breeze, and now Im 2 weeks into my 3rd trimester and my back hurts, my body aches, and Im getting moody again.  But everyone's different, you may start to feel better sooner than later.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	Most moms feel a huge difference when the second trimester starts at week 13. For me and my 3 friends, when we hit week 13, it all changed overnight and we didn't even feel pregnant anymore. It was a little scary, but you need to enjoy it cuz it all comes back in the 3rd trimester around week 30 due to all the baby growth.|`|uAnw9LAQaa	Sorry sweetie there is no way to tell for sure..some say around 8 weeks you might start feeling better however with my first two children I felt fine the entire time but with this baby, the third, I was sick until two weeks ago when I hit 15 weeks! :( I hope it goes better for you. good luck|`|aSF6kUcWaa	Hi- I am 5 weeks pregnant!

Then a whole new set of symptoms started...|`|K2jT1z5jaa	On average all the first trimester symptoms ease up week 14. and arrive week 6. Everyone is different though. May ease up earlier or later in pregnancy or can continue throughout.<br>  <br>  cramping is normal - > Uterus expanding.<br>  <br>  God bless x|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Although I don't feel horrible per say, as I have had a very good pregnancy so far. I am 9 weeks. <br>  My entire body hurts. My skin feels very tender. I am hungry all the time. And have to pee every 3 seconds. I too have that cramping but this is my 3rd baby, so I know that its just my uterus changing and making way for my baby. <br>  <br>  Its hard to tell when you will. Every pregnancy is different. Really. It could be next week, next month or for your entire pregnancy. But mostly women feel better in their second trimester.<br>  I feel for you hunny, as my other 2 pregnancy's were brutal. I am thankful that this being my last, I have actually enjoyed the other end of the pregnant spectrum.|`|mygpnrK1aa	I never threw up from morning sickness, but I always felt sick. I had horrible headaches and was so tired all the time. At about week 11 or 12, I started feeling a bit better. By week 13 or 14, I had my energy back. I hope it gets better for you. Try keeping some saltine crackers beside your bed to eat before you even get out of bed in the morning. That always helped settle my stomach.|`|vbwnLB8Gaa	I am with you girl. I am due in october and am feeling worse than I ever have in my life. I hope the tiredness and everything else ends soon for both of us!!!

Or Marshal's has some cte stuff as well.
fHjSonssaa	Yes that can happen- it's how mine was on and off for a few days. It was never in large quantities- I really didn't even need to wear a panty liner, but I did just to be safe.<br>   It can be red, brown, pink....|`|tGgLhOIGaa	Yes its common, happens in alot of women!<br>  as long as it wasnt a big bleed then your fine! if your at all worried go and talk to your GP! They are the experts remember and they will be able to tell you anything you need to know!<br>  congrats btw <3
LDiBjNf5aa	Toiletries should include pads, definitely. As well as stuff for the shower, considering you could get quite sweaty. Don't forget a camera/plenty of extra batteries (don't want to be worrying about that!) and if you're bad with numbers, just a sheet with the numbers of family to let them know.<br>  <br>  Also...chapstick!!|`|AA10381258	You might find baby in need of a last minute diaper change so I'd pack some wipes and diapers just in case. I've heard babies have long fingernails at birth, so you'll either want some mittens to cover them up or bring your baby clippers as hospitals no longer stock these (liability issues). I agree with the ladies who mentioned that "toiletries" should include your own shower things and lots of panties because those hospital ones are awful.|`|yo9XNz61aa	comfy panties and pads for you....you really dont need the rec blankets for baby b/c the hospital will have them.... My daughter did really take a paci when she was first born b/c its hard for them to hold them in!  Id bring a couple of gowns oh and some baby mitts.  Also your own pillow for you.  Clothes for daddy if he will be staying and snacks for after you have the baby and extra change!|`|JglwzEpiaa	You might want to pack some panties, hair brush, make-up(if ya want), house shoes, blanket and extra pillow for you, burp rags for baby, baby clippers, and don't for get any insurance, photo id, car seat, and milk storage bags. That is all I can think of right now. I think they will give you a breast pump when your there. You don't have to pack any of this its just sugestions.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	I got the little travel size shampoo and body wash to take for me and my hubby. So we didnt have to pull our wet ones out of the shower and take them. Other than that maybe a book or something some reading it can get boring. Best Luck|`|OmJfYPptaa	They told me to bring Chap-stick.<br>  Slippers|`|JreuGwJYaa	hospital picture outfit for baby!|`|z4byzsGLaa	Bring your own tylenol! You might also want to bring slippers!  Don't forget your baby book, Camera!!  hope that helps!!|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	Good grief are you taking baby on a weekend outing?<br>  <br>  For baby you need: going home outfit, socks, blanket, car seat.<br>  <br>  The hospital will provide everything else for baby.|`|TLjNUJHLaa	Most hospitals require the baby to stay in the clothes they provide while the baby is there. So all you need is the going home outfit and a blanket. And the hospital will provide a pacifier and a hat. I know every women is different but when i had my baby my milk didn't come in till 3 days later.|`|V7Q7SbHfaa	I would bring your cell phone charger because your going to have a lot of calls while your there.  I also brought my own pj's because I felt more comfortable in my own clothes.  I also packed some regular under ware, they helped to keep the pads in place after birth.  The ones they give you make the pad slide around and it is very uncomfortable.  Good luck!!|`|8299447d689b3abb4ef3ef0613c537e3aa	You might want to take your pillow, and anything that's comforting to you - if you have a favorite blanket, or whatever makes you comfy...good luck!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	seems like you got everything covered... Good luck
ACyrJQHOaa	hi, i have the same pain when i sneeze or cough.It feels like a pulling sensation right on my lower left side though.My doctor says its my baby laying on something or doing something in there that he shouldn't be doing lol. I wouldn't worry about it to much.Little pains will come and go through out your whole pregnancy but if they are to much to handle or any blood, get checked out asap.Good luck and congrats.|`|OU9xnW86aa	It's probably round ligament (or it could be the baby kicking you). It doesn't sound like anything you need to worry about though...<br>  <br>  I'm 20w6d and I get odd pains/cramps here and there too.

jgP51MlRaa	There's nothing wrong with him still wanting to eat, just give him fruit, you can never have too much of that.<br>  <br>  Maj|`|AA10811784	If he is eating it, then he IS hungry. Try giving him larger portions at mealtime, with a drink afterwards. And the first answerer is right to an extent, make sure he stays busy throughout the day so that he's not constantly asking for snacks. He shouldn't need a lot of snacks between meals if he's eating a good portion at every meal.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Ask his pediatrician to check him for Type One diabetes.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	He's hungry, feed him - he's probably growing!   Babies and preschoolers have an excellent internal sensor telling them when they are full and when they need to be topped off - his sensor is saying he's hungry, so feed him.|`|fZw6ImUGaa	As long as you don't feed him unhealthy stuff, there is no problem. Give him a carrott, an apple etc. but no sweets, joghurts, pre fab snacks, etc. |`|VijDG2yaaa	Ask a docter. One child had a rare disease forcing him to eat constantly! You should definatly make sure its just because he's growing. |`|Lnom2fwwaa	I think this is normal. He is growing. Always give him healthy snacks like fruit, raisins, carrots, cucumber etc. Things like bananas and nuts will keep him full up for longer. Also if you give him junk food he is likely to get a sugar rush then a sugar low where he has no energy and this will therefore make him hungry again, plus he is less likely to ask for food when he is not hungry if you doon't give him his favourite things everytime.<br>  He also could be thirsty as this can be mistaken for hunger. Give him a bottle of water to take around with him, if he still claims he is hungry then try fresh fruit juice or milk as this may help to fill him up, if he's still hungry then go with the healthy snacks. Also try giving him jacket potatoes, baked beans, porridge, or wholegrain bread in main meals as these are slow release carbs and will keep him fuller for longer. It may also be boredom or attention seeking behavious but as long as you make sure he's always got something to do and remember he is a growing kid it will be fine.<br>  Good luck! and if you are still concerned then see a GP|`|DozD8lTGaa	aww it's ok. my little brother is the same (not over weight or anything), he eats a fair bit... it's not being hungry, it's wanting what he sees other people with... he will have 3 bags or crisps... but, doesn't eat the whole pack... opens them eats about 2 and moves onto something else. but, i said it to my Mum why does he do it and she said that children go through a fase where they want to eat things for the sake of it... then they go through a fase where they don't want to eat much... so, it's just a factor of childhood. they want whatever they see; just exploring really. nothing to be worried about... x<br>  <br>  but, if you want anymore help just message me and i will help you. i hope i have helped. xx|`|5c5946efed27cde334f89e03e46e319faa	probably bored.. or just asks because he knows you will say yes. If you say no and stick to it he will stop asking so much in the end.You could just give him fruit snacks when he is being really insistent as that will be healthy and if he says he doesn't want the fruit because its not sweeties then you know he is not hungry. |`|eb404eeb31991ebbde4c6984fdb245cdaa	Does he eat all his meals? If so give him a bigger portion, or maybe different types of food. Foods like pasta, rice etc are full of carbohydrates and will make him feel fuller.<br>  Some children are more active and need more food. And unless you are feeding him more and more junk food when he asks I don't see a problem with it. <br>  There are some days you couldn't fill my son, and others he the complete opposite.|`|3YLp0S1Yaa	I had this problem with my daughter but my health visitor told me it is just her way of getting attention as i had just had a new baby, its their way of letting you know they are still there, and any attention is good in their eyes at that age. but if you are really worried i would defo take him to the doctors, good luck|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	Maybe you should be looking at what you're feeding him at meal times. Everybody's different, you don't have to stick to guidelines, if he say's he's hungry he probably is. Try more filling foods/snacks like porridge and rusks.|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	Maybe he is hungry! Growing burns a lot of calories. If he wants to eat, I would feed him. You don't say if he has weight issues, but if that is becoming an issue, feed him fruit and carrot sticks, healthy stuff for snacks and limit sugar.|`|qMVL0rTJaa	Maybe you should visit your doctor, he could have worms or something. But i would keep feeding him in the mean time, he is young and needs food to grow!|`|AA11320678	it sounds like he is not occupied with other activities.
in7qi4oZaa	Go to the doctor and get a pregnancy test. This is the best solution  to find out for sure.|`|bd2affbfcb216a0067cbf336ceff00b3aa	go to the drug store and buy a test. they cost like 8.00. You will get your answer.
pIBOSkfsaa	HAHAH! ya right , sorry buddy but men just simple aren't build to with stand pain. When a woman get sick she sucks it up, rests for one day but still carries on with her daily duties, when a man gets a little cold he acts likes he's FRICKEN DIEING!! all week<br>  <br>  I would hate to see a man deal with a period on a regular basis let alone child birth!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Its interesting thought. But really weird as well.<br>  <br>  I think it should be a mommy thing only<br>  <br>  god bless x|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Yup. I told my b/f if he wants more then one kid then he has to find a way to carry it himself|`|53QQ9KXEaa	Oh my god, YES!!! Everyday lol I would be happy if my boyfriend knew what I am going through. It's not a cake walk, that's for sure. I'm super stoked for the prize at the end though :)|`|sjUNb9zXaa	No,men would die if they had to carry babies|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	i wish they could feel the morning sickness|`|AA10953561	Yes and no. In a way I'm so glad my honey doesn't have to carry the babies because he'd be so hard to live with! He gets a minor head ache or his back hurts and he has to lay down for a couple hours. Now imagine 9 months of different aches and pains. I couldn't handle listening to him! On the other hand though, it'd be nice for the men in my life to experience both the beautiful parts and the not so comfortable parts of pregnancy in order to better understand me and their wives. My brothers are prime examples. My oldest brother's wife was one of those really whiney, always complaining pregnant women. He told me not too long ago that I must not be bothered by anything during pregnancy because he's never heard me complain (trust me I do, just not all the time). My other brother's wife was the picture of motherhood during both of her pregnancies. I think I may have heard her complain a total of twice about pregnancy and the toll it takes on your body. So my other brother thinks I'm a wimp for laying down in the middle of the day and putting my feet up so that don't swell quite so bad. My father thinks it's strange that I lovingly caress my tummy when my baby girl moves around. Apparently he didn't get to see my mother doing much of this when she was pregnant because he was always working.<br>  <br>  So, yes, in a way I would love for men to experience this amazing miracle, but at the same time I don't think most men could handle pregnancy (I'm not saying all men, just the ones I know personally!)|`|YsvpLwy6aa	haha this sounds like a woman to me. there is so way this is a guy|`|eimyUi6qaa	your ******* crazyy|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i wish the same thing everyday! but just so my b/f can see/feel what i have to go through on a day to day basis.|`|ZpsbW8gHaa	wtf|`|nxHztcslaa	yes! i wish it daily.... my husband thinks its soo easy for us women haha.. would be nice to share xx
z0ro3VkJaa	Frankly, I think you would be better off looking at the correlation between pets starring in movies and pet purchases. Because I distinctly remember there being a massive increase in people buying dalmatians after 101 Dalmatians came out, only to realize they make for poor family pets and abandoning them.|`|wnBkuzpzaa	write something about how when people see a dog win a dog show, they don't always be responsible and research the breed, but assume it's right for them because it acts a certain way in the ring. find statistics about the breed that one a dog show (like the westminster just happened) and find the AKC ranking of the breed before, and after. Then write a paragraph comparing them.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	i dont know, but it seems like it would be MUCH MUCH MUCH easier to do a report on what influences people to buy different dogs.<br>  and then the dog show thing could be one example.<br>  another example could be how labs are very popular and they are often used as therapy dogs (giving them a good reputation)<br>  etc etc.

WdvLcYaVaa	Just give it some time hun. I'm sure it will take some time for your body to get back in sync after having your IUD out. I know it is really hard and the waiting sucks, but theres no need to get upset yet. Give it a few more months. You should try taking Mucine-x during your fertile period. I have read a lot of success stories with it. I tried it this month, but my af is not due till saturday so I don't know if it worked or not yet. Good luck and baby dust hun!|`|lTkYWiy5aa	It can take awhile for fertility to return to normal after using birth control.

f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	Hey, I'll be 22w on Saturday and when I went to the doctor on Thursday, she measured the top of my uterus about and inch above my belly button. I don't really feel him kicking in my ribs yet, but I can feel him in between my ribs, above my belly button. I'm sure depending on how tall you are, you could be feeling him there. I am 5'7. Good Luck and I can't wait to really feel the kicks either!!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	when i was around that week i could feel him kick up by my ribs, now being further along i defiantly know when hes kickin my ribs. i measured too big for the week i was at also, but now im finally measuring for the week im at.|`|AA10381258	Since all women carry differently, its possible that he is up there. He's more like just bouncing around in there at this point, since he has lots of room. Later on it does get a bit painful, especially when he just stretches out and pushes his feet into your ribs for a minute or two. That part sucks! That and getting kicked in the bladder!|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	It depends on the baby's positioning but it is possible that early for him to be that high up and having a party!!
AA10624857	Our 4th baby was conceived quite unexpectedly when I was reliably taking birth control pills for 11 years. I had not missed any pills. I hadn't taken any other medication that would have interfered with the pill's effectiveness. I hadn't even had any bouts of vomiting or diarrhea which can eliminate the pill from your body before it has a chance to get into your system. No mess ups for me. After 11 years, taking my pill at the same time every day was an ingrained part of my daily routine. On top of that I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was 17 weeks along. The hormones in the pill caused me to have what seemed like normal period-like bleeding. My doctor discovered the pregnancy at my yearly physical. Neither my doctor nor I could believe I was pregnant at first. When I asked her how this could possibly happen, she said all she could say was that I must be the "lucky" 1% that makes the pill 99% effective. Our older kids were 18, 15, and 12 when our little surprise was born. I was 38 and my husband was 39.  After our daughter was born, my husband had a vasectomy.|`|kDftsHXjaa	i got pregnant on the pill i missed probably 5 in the 2 years i was on it and  but 2 of them i missed in the month i got pregnant. so yes i got pregnant on the pill and i messed it up! haha|`|38541eb0be94f6566f88dbc36089d437aa	I got pregnant on the pill and I took it the same time every day and I did not miss a day.  It can happen.  My daughter is now 4 and even though she was a surprise we would not have it any other way.<br>  We now double up on the BC. I use the pill and we use a spermicide.|`|HYveAhbUaa	I got pregnant on the NuvaRing...I took 3 days worth of antibiotics for a kidney infection or strep or something.|`|HSa041M0aa	My mother did--three times!|`|AA11661793	yes, took it every day same time
ca9dEvSAaa	Wow, I'm not familar with any laws regarding that. That's a little sick. Even if she's 16; she's still the mommy.|`|2DsgflhOaa	Um well your friend is too young to know the full responsibilites of having a child. Her mom is trying to help to make sure the baby is brought up right. Her mom should probably take full custody of it until your friend is old enough, at least that way your friend could still have a chance of having a normal life and getting an education and good job to support her baby.|`|35kVNi5oaa	In PA the parent can't do that, her mom has no control over the baby.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	the childs parents are the ones that have full control over baby,<br>  Mum of parent has no right.<br>  The mother of the child needs to be with the baby and the father.<br>  God bless x
AA12033653	Yep, after your son is born you can try again for a girl LOL!!  <br>  <br>  Honestly No, for this pregnancy there is nothing you can do about it.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Um no and by the way, you determine the sex of the baby. Its your sperm that is the deciding factor. Sorry but blame it on the little guys.|`|AA10196172	Nice troll...<br>  <br>  Yes, you can wait 9 months and try again.<br>  Eventually you'll get what you want.<br>  One guy I worked with had 6 girls and then finally a son. (20 years ago!) He was so happy!<br>  OTOH, another guy I worked with, married a girl who already had a daughter. They had 2 daughters together, then on the third try - twin girls! They stopped after that. That was hilarious. I ran into him and his wife in a restaurant downtown with 5 girls, all under the age of 5, and all crying at the top of their lungs. I asked him if he was going to try for a girl and he said &&&& off!<br>  <br>  Be happy with what you got. Any child is a blessing...|`|ux6j2OIeaa	Don't you think you are being a bit selfish??  You should be happy that she is having a healthy baby.  I have 3 boys and they are GREAT!  If we decide to have another i won't mind what sex it is as long as its a healthy baby and i have a good pregnancy after 3 m/c last year.|`|35kVNi5oaa	Well, actually it's the sperm that decides the sex of the baby, so if there is anyone to blame here its you.<br>  have another baby, maybe that one would be a girl.|`|cnK4X2sZaa	thanks for the points!|`|VBlrL1puaa	Theres nothing you can do, considering you were the one who decided whether you were going to have a girl or a boy. Your body was the one that decided to donate an X or Y so you cant blame her, although you can hope the ultrasound tech was wrong, which she probably wasnt, and hope next time its a girl.|`|h1AIzD9baa	yes .. actually there is this new miracle gender changing drug they can give you.. if she gets is soon enough.. the babies little peepee will just fall off !!<br>  <br>  no.. are you a freaking idiot.. you cant change the sex of your baby!! what you get is what you get.. be thankful for that!!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	No it is what it is, and you need to be happy.<br>  <br>  It is about having a HEALTHY baby and not if it is a girl or boy.|`|pMgZnpc2aa	It's ok. You are going to live through it. You can't really do anything about it. Just get use to it. C*O*N*G*R*A*T*S*|`|qaoIdRSZaa	nope, excpet get used to it!!<br>  Congrats btw (:
yVassRjOaa	My husband and I have been ttc This mite help you out. I was pregnant and miscarried 10/2008. One thing I remember when I didnt know I was pg, was the mild period like cramps, so i thought i was gonna get AF. Nope i was pg. But now after our miscarriage we are ttc again, and we went on a lil vacay on my O dates and Im starting to feel the same cramps, so baby dust to both of us!!!|`|aa01690707f25106fb64b7b4af022300aa	yep|`|AiPzGvOeaa	Well from what I hear from other ladies that is exactly what early pregnancy cramping feels like. What cycle day are you on? Are you late for your period and just cramping but no bleeding? If that is the case I say that you need to get a test pronto. Good luck and babydust to you!
s8VgyzE2aa	Have you thought of using alternative methods rather than focusing on punishment and threats of punishment? <br>  <br>  When you focus on punishment it makes going to bed seem even worse than it is. <br>  <br>  Have you tried making going to bed fun? <br>  <br>  the first thing you need to do is sit down with her and involve her in the problem solving, this helps kids learn how to communicate and work through problems rather than them feeling like they have no control over anything. First state the problem "going to bed at night seems to be something she doesn't like and so lately is has not been fun for either of you" Now that you have stated the problem, ask her to help you come up with some ideas to make bedtime more pleasant for both of you. Get out a pen and paper and come up with ideas together. You might be surprised what she comes up with and you can write down your own suggestions as well. <br>  <br>  I would suggest things like making it more fun with a piggy back ride to bed each night. Or maybe doing a reward program where she earns a sticker for each night she gets right into bed and then at the end of the week if she earns at least 4 stickers she gets a reward. You could suggest that you will give her a 10 minute warning so she knows bedtime is coming and it's not just all of a sudden bed time. <br>  <br>  Then see what she suggests and go through the list together and decide what things you agree on and will try and then put the plan into action starting that night. <br>  <br>  This type of interaction teaches your child to work through problems together, communicate, and problem solve as well as learn that things they don't like can be made better with a little effort. This is a much better lesson than just spanking her and punishing her or threatening to punish her. Kids respond better when parents treat them this way.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|F6lZHRkVaa	You told her the rules, she disobeyed, and she was punished. Now she's sleeping just fine tonight. Keep up the good work.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	i will venture to say that that is reasonable ..<br>  <br>  but what about me ..i like to stay up very very late ..what would i get ..HAHA|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	it seemed to work, then let it be. it may take a few threats but it will eventually work its self out|`|DDFSITiYaa	I think you handled it ok.  But you might want to consider a reward system as an alternative.  I liked the poster's suggestion about stars and taking away a star.  That is similar to a lot of school systems and makes sense to a child that age. <br>  <br>   I would, however, ask your daughter what she would like to see as a 'system'.  See if you can sit down with her and work out a plan for the night.  It might be pretty mundane and seem pretty obvious to you but she might feel more empowered if you give her an opportunity to have some input.  Tell her that you don't like getting upset or spanking her but what does she think would work?  See if you can get to the 'bottom' of why she is acting out that way.  A lot of times kids act out in a totally unrelated area if there are problems or stress in their life otherwise.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	It's okey to spank. I have a little chart for each of my kids and it looks like this.<br>  <br>  Charlie * * * * * * <br>  Samantha * * * * * * * * <br>  Freddy * * * * * * * *<br>  Bernard * * ** ** * ** * * * * ** ** * *\<br>  Perigrin * * * * * * *  *<br>  Kali * * * <br>  <br>  The stars are how many nights they went to sleep with no problem. Once they get 20 stars they can go get any toy from Wal-mart with in a reasonable price. If they throw a huge fit then they get a star taken away.|`|kCbDkQzGaa	I think you're doing okay.  The reason spanking is seen as a negative is because of those parents who get carried away abuse.  Some parents spank their kids out of anger and that is wrong.  Like someone else mentioned, your daughter knew the rules and with disobedience comes a consequence.  It's called tough love.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	To prevent tantrums at bedtime you could make your daughter do "quiet" things just before bedtime, and also have certain rituals that she enjoys (reading or telling a story to her, saying goodnight to her doll or animals, etc.). Also make sure bedtime is at the same hour every day. <br>  But in the situation you describe a spanking was definitely in order! She not only disobeyed you but also threw things. If she were my daughter she would have gotten more than just three swats on her hiney! But I hope that the impression (figuratively speaking) still lasts and that reminding her of the spanking will do the trick in the future.|`|WMPqVYe1aa	Hi, seems to have worked, sometimes kids just know how to push the limits at bed time and get overtired.  (mind you my kids don't go to bed really early either)|`|G5Wnd1KDaa	Man I love problems like this.  What you can do will all be affected by how much time and effort you intend to put in yourself.  Spanking works if done consistently for consistent reasons.  To me, it sounds like this would have warranted a spanking in my house, although I would have handled it differently over time.  When we get to the point of spanking, we immediately begin to look for a long term solution as I don't really want to have to deal with a fit and spanking every night to get my kid to go to bed.  That said, here is what I would do if my kid pulled the same thing.<br>  <br>  First, I pretty much would have done what you did on night one when the spanking occurred. <br>  <br>  Secondly, you need a schedule that you follow come hell or high water.  If bedtime is 8:30, then it needs to be that every single night.  Kids work extremely well with routine.  Figure out bedtime and stick to it.  I would buy a LARGE round wall clock with some nifty, frilly, girl picture (Dora Clock?), or something to that effect for her room.  Use this as a way to teach time while you are at it.  Explain that 8:30 is bedtime (or the time you are choosing). <br>  <br>  Thirdly, someone mentioned a reward system, and while I think that is a good idea, stars might not be the way to go in this case.  You need something that you can do that night IMMEDIATELY after she gets in bed, nicely, on time.  Here is what I would do to that effect.  Go to a carpet store and get samples of lots of different colors of carpet.  Cut these into 3 inch squares.  These will be "warm fuzzies".  Buy a nice, little, soft bag that she can take to bed with her.  When she goes to bed nicely, put a "warm fuzzie" in the bag.  Goodnight kiss and you are outta there.  If she causes trouble, no warm fuzzie.  If she causes trouble after going to bed, take one away.... "cold prickly".  On Friday or Saturday night before bed, let her turn in her warm fuzzies for prizes of some sort....  Only you know what she likes and what your budget is.  She can use a couple or save them for the following week for something better.  If she sees something in the store she really wants, you can wheel and deal for a certain number of her fuzzies making her have to earn the item.<br>  <br>  Like I said, it all depends on what time you want to put into it, but this sort of thing works well with my kid, but consistency is the trick.  YOU can't be the one to forget the warm fuzzies at night or forget trade in time, etc.  So feel free to use this idea or a variation based on time that you have available. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|GMIsOYYCaa	If you ever watched Supernanny, bedtime tantrums is the #1 thing she deals with. I suggest you go on her website and look over how to deal with it. Her strategy is really effective and she deals with kids a lot worse than yours.<br>  <br>  But basically, you set an exact routine at bedtime that you make sure you follow every single night. I'd suggest giving her a relaxing bath and reading her a bed time story. And then you kiss and hug her and say it's time to go to bed, and turn off the lights in her room, and you have to shut her bedroom door.<br>  <br>  And then she'll complaining and freaking out. Don't go after her in her room to lecture her. When she comes after you (which she undoubtedly will) say "It's bedtime now" (that is ALL you say, nothing more) and take her by her hand, and put her back in her bed, and close the door. No dragging her or carrying her. If she comes out after you again, *don't say anything*. You already repeated your instructions once. Just take her by the hand and lead her back to the room. If you talk to her then she'll think it's a game, and by interacting with her, you are promoting her incorrect behavior (read: just like when you spank her, even though this isn't your intention, you are promoting her bad behavior because you are interacting with her when she is being bold!!!) Keep bringing her back to bed every time she gets up, but don't say anything. It might take you all night long, you may not get any sleep. But it sounds like your daughter is a quick learner and eventually she will learn what sleep time is all about.<br>  <br>  You can learn more about this on the web site below:|`|RxhBUkwSaa	It's a tough issue.  One thing you have to keep in mind about the spanking thing is that you're giving her the clear message that because you're bigger and hold all the power, you can hit her.  You've got other power, probably equally effective, that doesn't involve smacking your child... you just have to figure out what it is, and be willing to stand up to her and be consistant.<br>  <br>  For example, at 5 years old you and she can sit down and discuss the bedtime issue.  You can tell her that it hurts your stomach and heart to spank her, but it's clearly effective, and you'd like to figure out other ways to get through to her.  Then, tell her what you are going to take away when she back talks or doesn't follow bedtime rules.  Then - here's the big problem - follow through.  If you say no TV for two days, or no playdates all weekend, or no computer, you have to be willing to actually do those things.  We give our kids many, many privilages.  Make her earn them based on her behavior.<br>  <br>  In my house, electronics were the hot button.  So, we went into electronic deprivation as punishment.  Computer only for homework if necessary, no instant message, no cell, no TV, no games.  <br>  <br>  Find threats you don't mind carrying out.  Sometimes they don't even have to involve deprivation!  It could be, two hours of weeding the garden this weekend.  Or, whatever you think will work with your kid!  Be the parent, not the bully, and you'll feel much better.|`|oSvwWFEIaa	I have the same problem with my kids all the time .You just remind them that your the mommy and they are the child .and if  she doesn't listen then you will have to give a consequence(  telling them that<br>  i will take a favorite toy or their night light always works 4 me)And if she wants to throw a fit then say fine throw it in your room.But if you need to spank then spank just make sure that she gives you a good reason too! Also let her know after she calms down why she was spanked!|`|sB5dyaczaa	You were right in spanking her. Follow through with your threats though. She will soon learn. Maybe work up a system that each time she goes to be she gets a sticker or star and when she earns a certain amount of stars she gets to do something special. But she has to go to bed every nigh for a week (Monday to Sunday). When she doesn't take 3 (more or less) stars away. When she does put a star on. If she gets 10 or so stars then she can do a craft with you. Say she has 15 stars and wants to use 10. Take ONLY 10 stars and leave the 5. If she gets say 20 let watch a movie. Make up rewards for her to get.

azE51WGRaa	Ok, for one, not all women poo during labor (although it has been known to happen). Some women pee too, although that doesn't always happen either. I'd say one of the most icky things that happens during pregnancy is when you pass your mucus plug during the last of the 3rd trimester (although not all women do this either). If you do pass your mucus plug, it can be in one thick snotty clump with some brown discharge or it can be in little stringy snotty bits over the course of a few weeks (which is super gross). Sorry if tmi, but you asked. Also, the other icky thing can be if your water breaks because then you feel like you peed yourself. Of, sometimes if you cough, then you really will pee yourself (although not a lot usually). Pregnancy can be icky business but it's all worth it in the end.|`|3XMpcti5aa	One thing I was never told was that right after the baby pops out, during a vaginal birth, you still have to deliver the placenta. I was so busy reading about taking care of a newborn that I would just skim over the "labor and delivery" parts of the books I read. Anyways, once you push the baby out, you have to wait for the next contraction to push and deliver the placenta. Once that comes out, you'll feel such a relief of pressure! Oh, and NO ONE told me anything about the possibility of tearing!! I tore and had to get stitches. And since I did my delivery natural(no epidural) I felt the needle during my stitching. The doctor told me that she had given me a local anesthesia, but I still felt it. The stitching up was worse than the whole labor/delivery itself! I'm not trying to scare you here, but at least if you're aware of the possibilities, you won't be as shocked as I was. LOL!|`|JxPw8OaHaa	Don't worry about the small stuff, poo,peed it all happens.  I will tell you something that made me feel better when I was pregnant for my first son.. when you are pushing and everyone is saying "just one more good push, almost there..." It seems like forever before you make noticeable progress.  My friend said that it will burn like crazy when the baby's head comes out, then you know it is finally true one more push and that's it. Good luck.  For all the icky things of pregnancy and birth there are many more awesome things and then there is the first moment of looking into your child's face. Priceless!|`|GQZDcfUiaa	I didn't pee pee or poo poo during delivery. Most women are given an enema, prior to heavy labor. Nearer to the end of a pregnancy some women have problems with their bowel movements; they may be real loose, they may not be.<br>  When you and the baby come home you will need to bathe (your bottom) at least twice a day. Things can get a little rank quickly. <br>  Don't worry, it's all worth it.|`|uAnw9LAQaa	i never pooed during labor but i was induced both times and couldnt eat after a certain time...but one thing no one ever tells you is that when your water breaks you leak until the baby comes, and another thing you need to know is that the best way to push is like you are pooing and thats why so many women do but as long as thats how you are pushing the baby will come much faster.|`|plI0WOrUaa	The fact that you have gas all of the time.  And it stinks.  Sorry, but its true and new to me during pregnancy!!  YOu are sweaty, have a lot of nose mucous, lots of discharge, you can smell everything in the free world including everything disgusting.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	I never did that during labor, the problem with labor is every single one of them has a different problem and some have no problems at all. Why worry? \<br>   its the old adage, don't try to cross a bridge until you get to it.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	One usually gets an enema prior to giving birth. <br>  Many get hemorrhoids that have to either be surgically taken care of or tied off after giving birth.<br>  You can get gestational diabetes. High blood pressure. Post-natal depression.<br>  The episiotomy where they cut the perineum to make room for the baby to come out. (so be sure to ask about preparing that area prior to giving birth so perhaps you can avoid having that done.) Having one means stitches and the pain and healing time.<br>  Some gals just freak out, as they feel out of control, like their body and the pain has taken them over.<br>  <br>  So to make it easier (and more pleasant, if you can call it that) get a enema, avoid an episiotomy if at all possible, ask for an epidural to avoid the labor pains (a relaxed mom is a relaxed baby). And you have to give 'birth' to the placenta after the baby is delivered. Learn all you can, so when it begins it won't be so overwhelming. And your spouse or partner should treat you like a Queen during pregnancy and after giving birth.|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	Well theres the excess sweat. During labor you are probably gonna poo, pee and fart all over the doctors face but that comes along with the territory of pushin out a pumpkin, theres the someone that will touch your belly button and make you pee on yourself, theres the swelling hands and feet and face and fingers and legs, being able to smell rotten tomatoes at the grocery store, it may sound like hell, but the thing is, there is nothing that can compare to feelin it move around. It makes it all worth while.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Not everyone will get all of these, if fact some people avoid all of them!

Braxton hicks feel like a tight belt. That simple. Early labour contraction can be anything from lower back pain, pinching in your cervix and pains in the lower front of your tummy. I've also heard some women will get shooting pains down their legs and no pinching. Depends on how far along you are. If you're having trouble walking through the pain, go to the hospital to get checked or if your pains are really concerning you call your doctor, especially if your past 30 weeks!|`|8Og11giIaa	like a really strong intense period pain or cramp.

hWc65sEtaa	A line is a line.  Your pregnant.  But if you don't believe it, then go to the dr and get a blood test.  That will tell you 100%.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Congratulations!!!<br>  <br>  Yes pregnant!!<br>  <br>  Little bubs is growing ; ) already <br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|9hrJfhIIaa	You can't base a test result after the allotted time frame (ie 10 minutes) because then it's invalid. If you think you are, have blood work done. That's as black and white as it gets. <br>  <br>  Just remember, a faint line is a line. And false positives are rare.|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	Oh you are pregnant. Pregnant. PREGNANT YAY! You can't get a false positive. Go to the OB and start taking a prenatal vitamin!

This is one of the few ways to get a false positive.  You should buy yourself a digital test.  They are much easier to read and understand because it says right there "pregnant" or "not pregnant".  <br>  <br>  However you could be knocked up and if you are you need to get it confirmed by a doctor asap.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|azE51WGRaa	Positive test=Pregnancy<br>  You need to start getting care lined out for the baby and stop denying that you're pregnant. If you really can't believe it, go to your doctors to get a blood test to confirm it. You're gonna be a mom soon. Might as well accept it now then wait until you're in labor to do so.|`|7pYVDyfUaa	If I'm reading this right it sounds like you MAY be reading the test past when you should.  Let me explain:<br>  <br>  You said " I took another on friday i got a faint line and in the afternoon the line was pretty visible"  Are you saying you took a test on friday like in the morning and then in the afternoon read that same test stick and it showed a line? <br>  <br>  You cannot trust the results of a HPT after ten minutes.  At that point even a negative test CAN turn positive.<br>  <br>  www.peeonastick.com  Has some intersting HPT info.<br>  <br>  What I would do is this:  Buy another test tonight.  Take it first thing in the morning using your first morning urine, which will yield a higher amount of the hormone.  Follow the instrutions to the letter.  Only read the test after the stated time, and NOT after.<br>  <br>  Go by those results.  If it is STILL positive at that point then I would say with relative certainty that you are pregnant. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.
XSol0H6Uaa	Because food from the jar is pureed with nothing taken out, and juice is just that, fruit juice without the fiber, pure sugar, not very healthy for a baby.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	pureed fruit isn't going to be too sweet because the cooking took out alot of the sugars.  but juice has alot of natural sugars, if they have teeth it's really not good for them. babies aren't going to notice if you dilute it, it tastes better than water and is healthier than just juice.|`|dR4QN0gHaa	Babies older than six months old can only have 4 oz of juice per day and it is really sweet. Some babies are sensitive to juice and can get diarrhea.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Because of the sugars in juice.|`|rFtKFp03aa	I dilute because I think it is too sweet, too strong, and all the sugar!<br>  <br>  I do not give my babies juice but I do give my 3 year old nephew juice when I watch him - but only with his meals.. <br>  <br>  I do a little less than a quarter cup to two cups of juice.. he doesn't even know he is getting "flavored water"

Have you had sex any other time this year? <br>  Also, it's only a week after, so it might not show up. Are your period regular? <br>  You COULD be pregnant, but if the 28th is the only time you had sex, it's VERY unlikely. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aGbin67oaa	There's always a good chance of getting pregnant when you have sex.  I guess see how the doctor's appointment goes.  Try taking a test first thing in the morning and see if you get different results or wait a few weeks and then try again.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|987475b0db71996a7db0e2e10c1d960eaa	If you have sex then yes you could be pregnant.

a3GQF2cAaa	First time round it took me 3 months to conceive, tested a couple of days after my period was due and got my positive, only tested because I was never normally late (think i was 4 days late). Second time it took me 4 months and i tested the day after my period was due and got my positive, don't know why i tested really, just think i was impatient, unfortunately i miscarried and it took me another 2 years of trying for #3. found out I was pregnant the day my period was due (the line was very faint though) and I am now 25 weeks pregnant, never really had any symptoms with any of the pregnancies I just had that gut feeling with the latest one.<br>  <br>  By the way, stop testing every month, the more you relax the more likely it will happen....<br>  <br>  Also don't ttc just before your period, this is far too late, ovulation will occur 14 days before you come on so figure out when you are ovulating and ttc a couple of days before and after that date (and on that date too).<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope all goes well.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	For us : It was our first try<br>  <br>  Got our postive at 5 weeks.<br>   3 weeks was neg.<br>  <br>  Symptoms were only cramping.<br>  <br>  God bless x I do wish you al lthe best. Sounds like possible pregnant.|`|T48smu01aa	I tried for three months and got pregnant......I was three days late till I got a positive....it can take a healthy couple 20-25 % each month to conceive so just a couple of months is nothing some woman have been trying for years.....so just relax and give it time.<br>  Good luck and congrats!!!!|`|rFwGnZIJaa	The way I knew I was pregnant was a hot flash in the middle of Wal-Mart. I think I scared my hubby with all my ranting. lol. In early pregnancy, I just had really tender boobs and hot flashes. At 8 weeks, I was vomiting like it was the end of days and I noticed veins in my boobs and heaven forbid hair on my tummy. You are showing some signs that you are pregnant (sore boobs, more veins in your boobs). I wish you the best of luck and try not to get to discouraged.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Took me a couple of months to concieve. My period was 2 weeks late and i took the test and it came up positive. My period was late and my boobs were sore and getting bigger so too early to be having a big appetite or things like that normally nausea and sore boobs are the first symptoms thats why i took the test. I hope you get your positive pregnancy test. Good luck, all the best :) Itl happen when you dont try|`|f2JjoaxVaa	well with my first child it took me finishing the pill at the start of the month and finding out i was pregnant 5 weeks later i only had the late period and one day i almost fainted that was it. with my second (currently) i had sex every day of the month of september 08 and i told my friend that my breasts were sore not like normal and i had a annoying very light pain on my right side and so she told me i should test and i did and it was a BFP!!. everyone is completely different you may experience every symptom but most of the time you experience nothing at all.  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|vfq04nc1aa	Hi...<br>  Im 20 weeks pregnant with our first baby. I had been trying for about 8 months with my ex and nothing happened and then within a month of being with my finance we fell pregnant. We think its meant to be. I would advise you not to test so much because i know what the feeling is like to think you may be pregnant and then that negative comes along.<br>  When i eventually did fall pregnant with my fiance i did not even bother testing as we were not trying. I knew i had a few symptoms that could be pregnancy but i didn't want to get my hopes up. I eventually tested when my period had still not come after 8 weeks. And it was a positive. I couldnt believe it. I don't think your boobs would become so big so fast and i doubt they would become veiny so fast either. But all symptoms are different for each woman. Mine were that i was so tired, I went off foods that i normally like and i found myself waking up a lot at night to go to the bathroom. I also nealry fainted once and felt a little sick however i never got the morning sickness that most woman get.<br>  Try not to be too disapointed if its another negative and maybe just try and forget you are trying for a baby. When the time is right it will happen for you. Just try and relax and then before you know it you will have a little baby growing inside of you.<br>  Good Luck!!|`|lJc9elfpaa	It only took once! Well, obviously... We had sex 2 days in a row at the right time then went like 2 weeks without, so I am guessing we guessed correctly. Positive test the 2 days after I missed my period (don't use the ones with lines they are soooo irritating!). I knew I was pregnant because I missed it. No sickness, just some breast aches and fatigue.|`|HoonZJMgaa	my cycle seems to be every two years. i have had unprotected sex frequently but only get pregnant every eighteen months to two years except for this time, I am 5 months and my son is 9 months so this time it only took 4 months!

YOU WILL BE BLESSED WITH A LITTLE ONE OR MANY!|`|ihRpDGvnaa	I got pregnant our first time ttc. but i had to take 3 tests because first one didnt work and second one was broken!!! i knew i was pregnant a bit over a week after as i was always nauseated and my eating habits change bigger breasts plus a horrible strong sense of smell!! <br>  Good luck to you :)|`|qaoIdRSZaa	my hubby and i had the "it will hapen when its ment to" attitude, i longed to fall pregnant, he was a male (LOL) he did but he didnt (make sense?) hehe<br>  anyway, we accidently slipped up for the first time ( we use the pull out method>.<) and the one time we got carried away, was the time it happened. i know im very lucky to have that happen, it just shows me its ment to be!!<br>  with my symptoms, i didnt really have any, i just knew that i was, i know alot of people dont believe  that, maybe i just wanted it so bad i convinced myself i was. but i just knew, somewhere inside of me that i was pregnant. i tested 5 days before i was due for my period, i got a faint positve, so i went and got a blood test the next day, and 2 days later the blood test came back positive,<br>  Im still in the very early stages, and im very scared that something may go wrong :( but all i can do is look after my body and my baby, like a good Mum does :D<br>  <br>  *xX Baby dust to you sweetyXx*|`|xCXyCojGaa	We were actually lucky, I fell pregnant after one month of trying... The first time we started trying we thought that it was 14 days after the period but then with research I found out that it was 14 days from the 1st day of your period.. Which was successful for us. Keep in mind everyone ovulates at different times. My first sign was 4 days before my period, I just felt different, I know this sounds strange but it was actually my dog that triggered the thought of me being pregnant as he was always smelling my stomach area and noticed that my nieces were very clingy to me, which is un usual because they are always stuck like glue to their mother. I took my test be4 my period due date and it came out positive.. <br>  Good luck.. It'll happen, hang in there.
hKJIDdVqaa	I have 3 natural young children, an adopted child, and a step son.  It is nice to have so much laughter.  However they are expensive.  But you cannot beat the smile or hug of a child.  It is not really hard for us.  Sometimes my kids fight and argue.  Put usually they are all piled on each other in their "pig pile" stacked like logs.  It is so cute to watch them grow.|`|22221968cc6e48e97db5387607cd0f8faa	I have one brother with the same parents, a step brother, a half sister and two adopted sisters. My dad and stepmother were foster parents growing up, so we always had tons of kid in and out of the house. I remember one summer we had 8 (including me and my permanent siblings) kids. Luckly they both had good jobs, so no one suffered in the food / toys / vacation department. We always managed to go out to eat on Friday nights, bringing friends sometimes....and vacations every summer. I'm the oldest, and it was hard for me. I felt like a slave a lot of the time. My step mother made me her 'little helper', willingly or not. I took care of the younger kids and did lots of housework starting around 12 years old. It stunk. In addition, she didn't have time for frivolities like brushing 8 heads of hair every morning, so we all had short hair...which again, stunk. <br>  We had fun playing together outside, growing up together...but I think my brother felt neglected by my dad..considering he was his only birth son...so now they have a messed up relationship. and my sisters are sorta the same way...<br>  I guess you just have to go into it knowing it won't be easy, that it will be very stressful at times, and you're going to ahve to try hard to give every child equal love, and attention....|`|koXcq0l1aa	I don't have a lot of kids in fact I don't have any yet, but I will say first hand that being an only child is lonely...especially when there is strife in the family and there isn't someone beside you who understands.  I worry sometimes about how I will deal with my mother passing in years to come because I feel that she is the only thing I have because of my father's chosen absense.  That's why I want to have at least two children so that they will always have each other.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Watch the show 17 Kids and counting on TLC it's a great show and really shows a positive view on having alot of kids, now the family (The Duggars) have 18 kids but you can get some great tips on having just 6 or 7 .|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	I have 4 but one is grown and has a baby of her own.  The other 3 are 6, 9 & 10.  I just got back from JC Penney's, where everything is on sale, and got each of them a new pair of shoes and the boys each denim shorts and a shirt and my little 6 year old girl an outfit.  Oh, and I got a 6 pack of Nike socks.  The total was $279.18 and that was with stuff on sale and only 1 outfit each.  I love having 4 kids and my grandson is wonderful.  I just turned 40 and get to enjoy my little ones and my older one.  It is very, very expensive.  My ex wanted us to have 6 or 7.  When my youngest was two he left me for his skinny, no children, much younger secretary.  Didn't see it coming.  He doesn't pay hardly anything so I am not only mom and dad but pay for everything.  I signed the boys up for baseball.  It was $150.  Football camp is $75.  My daughters dance is $45 a month.  Her softball was $65.  I could go on, and on, and on.  Are they worth it, yes!!!!!  But just know that no matter how wonderful your relationship is with your husband, that you are financially able to take care of as many children as you decide to have.  Even the loving, baseball coach dads that's all about his wife and kids can change and then you are left to do it all.  I would do it all over again and maybe even one more but this is something everyone needs to think about.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I have six and honestly it's hard to keep track of time. I will be asking my seven year old son to help my twin girls who are in kindergarten matching the cat picture to the word cat while I take car of my toddlers and my six year old will be asked to help do the dishes. It's easier on me for watering the garden, dishes, and laundry wise. We never have a schedualed dinner it's Fred, you hungry? I'm hungry? Is any one else hungry? Maybe we should cook lunch then. You also with so many kids need to make sure you can spend time with each one. Somtimes I will be cooking and thanking, "I haven't played candyland with the twins for a while." or "I've played games with all my kids but Freddy." But it'd probably be easier for you since I am a single mother of six. You have a husband to help out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Congratz on your sweet baby angel.|`|NARQ5owBaa	I have 5 kids all 8 and under.

The only down falls of having lots of kids is, ya can never get a sitter, so ya never get any time alone or can never do anything without them. Sometimes i feel all i hear all day is crying and yelling. The messes never end.  It is pretty much just crazy. I feel i never have enough time for them individualy, which i feel bad about sometimes, especially when i am busy with the babies the older ones get the shaft. The biggest thing is that kids are soooooooooooooooo expensive. If you are up for all that, and have lots of money then go for it!!! I love all my kids and even though my life is chaos, I woudln't chnage it for the world.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	We have 5 kids, and we just welcome our niece into the home, i am also pregnant with HOPEFULLY my last child. lol. We have 2 boys, 4 girls. The family is very close connected, and the littler ones have great influences and the older ones have learned to be good examples. It's very hectic with all their schedules, and my husband goes on business trips a lot (im a stay at home mom with my 4 year olds) and thats when i feel like shooting myself...because the little ones need to do homework but i need to cook my oldest some food so he can get out the door to soccer practice...and then my 4 year olds start fighting and then my 14 year old is complaining about needing to go, and i want to pull my hair out..but at the end of the day...we are just a big family who loves eachother. My kids are very good about settling down together every once in awhlie without me having to enforce or plan family time, they just do it! They are VERY close, my 14 year old and 18 year old have a very good relationship (brother and sister) and my 18 year old is just so nice to his little 4 year old sisters, when he is SO much older than him. There is a lot laughter too, my kids got the trait from me...they laugh at everything! So yeah...there is tons of laughter! They are all very good well-rounded kids, with lots of siblings and lots of love.
vsuXCMqzaa	I had one at 12 weeks and the doctor thought it was a girl. The second sound was at 19 and 1/2 weeks and it was obvious it was a girl.

Good luck..|`|hORVMOHKaa	my first apt was at 15 weeks and 3 days and i asked the ultrasound tech how much longer i had to wait to find out and she said i can tell already. and then froze the screen and said WOW its defiantly a boy!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i421.photobucket.com/albums/pp295/haley_b_87/BABYMEJIAS_7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i421.photobucket.com/albums/pp295...</a>|`|7zMtmKJaaa	aww i'm 14 weeks I cant wait til i'm close to 20 wks.<br>  i have my next appointment next week on the 17th. ill be 15 weeks. hopefully they can tell. hopefully. its so exciting!!|`|yjhpBM11aa	I found out when I was 20 weeks and we could tell it was a boy!|`|JvcJs8k9aa	i found out when i was 19 weeks & it was a girl!
5UaVp256aa	There are no pregnant-specific methods, <a href="http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/" rel="nofollow">http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/</a> is a new approach on quitting. The site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking, and it's free.<br>  <br>  "It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you."|`|PDHCOrOSaa	HI.  I started smoking at a young age ( about 16 ) and when I was 23 I found out I was pregnant.  The minute I took that test I never smoked again.  My daughter is 14 months now and I'm still smoke free and plan to stay that way.<br>  <br>  I had try to quit a million times before but there was nothing motivating me enough I guess.  But when I found out I was pregnant I just looked at my belly and thought about my unborn baby.  I thought with her being so small how can I even take a puff....it's disgusting...she can't move, she can't get away from it...and I'd be allowing my daughter to inhale Poison....it was enough to keep me away from them.  PLUS I knew that smoking would increase SIDS and breathing problems and that scared me to death.<br>  <br>  I honestly think you can do it!!!!  I seriously smoked all the time before and now can't even stand to be near someone that smokes because I can smell it standing 20 feet away from them.<br>  <br>  Baby dust to you and congrats on being concerned with what's the very best for your baby to be...you sound like you'll be a good mom ( =|`|67zBvnNjaa	I was a smoker for 5 years but I gradually cut down smoking for some reason then I found out i was pregnant I just stopped all together it was sooo strange because I had tried quiting before soo many times!<br>  <br>  I guess my body just told me to stop lol!<br>  <br>  Hope you have success in quiting!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	We both smoke and have never had problems conceiving. Seriously. It took 6 weeks both times. There was nothing hard about conceiving at all for us. We had sex. <br>  I haven't quit but I have cut down a lot. I went from a pack a day, to 7. Its hard to just quit. And quitting smoking is harder to quit then cocaine or heroin. Its a proven fact. <br>  But if your serious about quitting, don't wait till you find out your pregnant. Do it now.|`|HkWTYhjDaa	i've had no problem quitting. I just think that smoking is not good for my baby, and how could i hurt my innocent baby. i quit smoking 2 days before i found i was pregnant, which is exactly 4 weeks. there were few symptoms that made me think i am pregnant so i only think about my baby's welfare.  <br>  Good luck!|`|1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|klTgOEcpaa	I stoped the day I found out  I'm happily 6w3days pregnant|`|LZk3z2ilaa	Honestly, I just took a second to think about one question.  "Do I want a cigarette or a baby, which is more important to me?" Well duh a baby.  We had been trying to get pregnant for 4 years and I wasn't willing to take any chances.  I wanted a healthy baby. I just flushed them down  the toilet, and stayed away from situations and places where I would be tempted.  Plus uh I don't need to be around smoke anyway.  Good Luck!|`|h1AIzD9baa	i had no problem quitting.. i actually stoped before i even knew for sure.. there was just no way i could willingly and knowingly continue smoking when i could possible be pregnant and harm my child.. . i think people that smoke while pregnant are selfish ..|`|9bPzzoIFaa	it was a struggle, it wasn't easy and cold turkey was what i did, my first step was not buying cigarettes, if you dont have any you cant smoke, but even that is hard every time you go to the store, its just a natural urge to ask for your brand at the check out...the next step is to talk to your smoking friends, explain to them you are having a really hard time and although you dont condem their smoking life style you would really like it if they wouldnt smoke around you because its harder for some reason when your exposed to it... its really a matter of will, but just because you want to do whats best for your baby as well as your own health doesnt mean its going to be any easier... infact when you get pregnant and your forced to quit its even harder because your doing it for someone else instead of yourself. my advice to you is to quit before you get pregnant for yourself, for your own health... it will make it easier to live up to that during your pregnancy... but dont expect the cravings to go away quickly its going to be a process and its going to take time.
Rzp30xIQaa	no, im always getting in fights, and not girly fights, fights for doing bad stuff like slashin tires and breaking stuff...fights are fine as long as their a fair fight, nothing but skin to skin, no weapons, so tell ur mom to stick it<br>  <br>  BTW...im not a good kid as im sure u can tell..<br>  Edit again...you probably think i sound weird but...me and my friends(mostly guys)...we dig<br>  BTW again i live on the poor side of town, with lots of gangs and stuff|`|KhjpmxGeaa	I have always end up fighting people who don't know who to shut their trap.I don't at all agree with your mom,Just tell them off and if they  hit you then through the down and fight them,Be sure you have others that are friends with you because people that you are probably fighting ' Talk the Talk but Don't Walk The Walk. ' It would make me mad if someone was picking on me.If your friends are not their then you will probably get beat up because others will jump in the fight,Always have friends to keep others out of the fight.And if they are talking behind your back then talk behind theirs or tell them what you think to their face.Your mother says it wrong,What's wrong is that they are picking on you when you have done nothing wrong.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	keep in mind these jerks might not play fair.  If you fight them and win they might come back later with more guys and beat the crap out of you on the way home or vandalize your house, or car, etc.<br>  Tell you mom everything that is happening.  Even if you are talking trash back to them when they put you down just so you don't seem weak.  Tell her and your teacher/counselor.  No one has to do anything if you don't want the too, but just so the adults can be aware of it.  High school is hard.  Figure out what is worth fighting for.  Sometimes if you can just make him feel really dumb in front of a crowd is better than any well placed punch.|`|wUWvO5r6aa	I am telling you from experience is not worth it fighting I know is annoying and you don't wanna be a rat for telling on him but fig ting is just going to get you kicked out and is not wort it. I so re-great being such a fi sty lillte ***** in school. You got to tell someone who will help you a consul er,principle or your parents because if resolve by fighting later on in life you are going to re great it.|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Violence in general is unnecessary.<br>  <br>  Just inform a teacher or a guidance counselor. Getting into a fight is only going to hurt you.|`|x7FjDcjzaa	pull down his shorts in gym class|`|2BDHKnHPaa	im about the same im 15 16 on oct 4 i do MMA (mixed marshall arts)<br>  my mum doesn't believe its bad to get into fights but my dad backs me  he say sometimes its good to release and usually they will stop baggin you id get into a fight with anyone if they insulting me my family or friend <br>  i don't like to but sometimes it needs to be done|`|G0anFvT8aa	Sure , there is always a better way to resolve things. I guess its not totally WRONG to fight as long as you have self control and know where to draw the line.|`|zhwR2XiBaa	You should beat him up now while you are still a minor!|`|9X4inaEpaa	i think its alright to fight if its has good reason|`|yv0N5w0baa	nope|`|fef9fzxYaa	ok..5'6 n ur only 15..ur talll! man when u get older ull prob be 5'10 or more..i have a bro who is 15 n he is taller than me n im 5'4 ..soo yea ur tall..it depends u know...do they hit u? first..? if they hit u than ur only defending urself..but if they just say something n u hit them..then no..u shoulddnt let that happen...ok he takes ur stuff...weell go ahead...beat the crap out of him...but just dont make this a habbit...u have to struggle in highschool somehow right? Too much fighting can be bad..so dont let that happen cuz u could have anger issues..but if ur only saving urself..go ahead..dont let those retarts pull u down..their just mad cuz they prob r insecure themselves n they pick on u..u ever watch the movie charlie bartlet..well yea that movie could help.<br>  <br>  n yea i know counseling n stuff ..it helps but u know they might make fun of u  for being wuss..i would feel that way...u should only fight when its the only chance to save urself..meaning ...its not worth it if u can ignore it without fighting..but if they really try to provoke u..n bug u like touch ..physically..than yea bcuz thats the only way to try to get out of it...n yea tell the principle...the coach?? bcuz..they could get kicked off the football team for being like that..
xuMQCWfTaa	The idea sounds gross. But actually doing it is so fun :]|`|A3zAXntxaa	I think it's fine, except in public. PDA is kind of annoying, especially when you're sucking someones face off.|`|awyNp31caa	not fun to watch....but definitely fun to do x) haha|`|mpq95NF9aa	I'm 27 and it's still pretty gross if you're not absolutely comfortable with the person. I never liked it that much when I was growing up, and I can't stand having to watch people do it. Ugh, get a room.<br>  <br>  But if you like someone and feel comfortable with them, then it's really nice and enjoyable. So it's a situational thing. Also, some people are just bad kissers. ven if you like someone if they're slobbering all over your face and shoving their tongue down you're throat it's disgusting. Experience helps.|`|PJ0aI0Dtaa	its amazingly fun (x<br>  but it is kind of disturbing to like<br>  totaly eat out the other person in public .<br>  so keep it pg .|`|SWsDa1iXaa	It's fun. :D|`|3dnWYznZaa	I enjoy it very much. =]<br>  but It really depends on a lot of things.

iUQdPswkaa	You need to tell your boss not that you our pregnant<br>  and he should put you onto light work he cant fire you<br>  as you have a right to start a family at anytime<br>  <br>  Hope this helps xx|`|tjLbXhtEaa	No... pregnant is not a disability!!!!<br>  Your boss will only have two options.. put you on light work or fire you. <br>  If he/she fires you, you will still be covered for insurance as it happened while you were insured under them.. If in fact you have insurance.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	It depends where you live. In Canada, you cannot go on STD unless you have a threatening condition (legal issues), not to mention work will pay you 20-30% less. However, most doctors can write you a note for "modified work duties" with restrictions and you can still get full pay. You shouldn't tell your employer you're pregnant until your about 12 weeks due to possibility of miscarriage etc. However, if you live in Canada, then you can start maternity leave as early as 12 weeks before your due date, but keep in mind you only get 1yr off and you'll have to return to work in 1yrs time from when you start mat leave.<br>  <br>  The weight lifting issue won't really matter until you reach your second trimester or so, I would think, but you should talk it all over with your doctor on your next visit.
g7wQij2Oaa	0.5%<br>  not much, but there's always a chance.<br>  <br>  :)|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Very small chance.<br>  <br>  The period can be delayed because of stress, Sounds to be because of the depression has possibly delayed it. <br>  Eating differently , Diet change, can all affect it.<br>  <br>  Get her to take a test to check. It could just be late a few days,<br>  <br>  God Bless x I recommend wait until tomorow. No period. Test 3 days after tomorow. & blood test to confirm|`|7pYVDyfUaa	No one can answer this for you.  For a number of reasons.  The first being we just couldn't.  There is no way to tell chances.<br>  <br>  Second of all the day you had sex isn't helpful without knowing when your girlfriend should have had or should have her next period.  To kind of get a rough estimate as to when she "should" be ovulating.<br>  <br>  That being said if you used the condom correctly the chances of pregnancy on "average" according to the package is like what two percent?  As in using a condom is 98 percent effective against pregnancy?  However I've heard that when you factor in human error they say that a condom is only like 86 percent effective.<br>  <br>  If you want to be sure for next time, perhaps see about her getting on the pill as a back up form of birth control.|`|i7vCTOnaaa	I don't know what it is going to take for you people to understand this... But YES, if you had sex, she CAN be pregnant. It doesn't matter if she is on birth control AND you used a condom... she can still be pregnant. nothing is 100% except abstinence or getting tubes tied/vasectomy... got it? yes she can be pregnant. go get checked. buy a test at walmart, duh?|`|fjSfBBDsaa	The chances are slim to none... but crazy **** happens all the time. i would wait for her next period to come and if doesnt then a pregnancy test is required.
coDO8KiXaa	Try another test in a couple of days.  My third child the line was very faint and I thought it was a dud but it turned out I was pregnant.  Good Luck.|`|K7XSAjOvaa	It is called a HPT and you could have your period while you are pregnant but some HPT's are messed up so just take another and see what it says.usually testing out of 5 tests if all but one is negative i'd say you are in the clear.They do have faulty tests out there.Good luck on your decision to conceive.|`|lB405hQKaa	Test again on thursday or friday.  It is possible that you are testing too early.  When is period supposed to start?|`|aa01690707f25106fb64b7b4af022300aa	probably just a dud|`|da0463b5125f03d85527fe970a64f901aa	False positives are a rarity, flase negatives happen all the time.<br>  <br>  Test again and make an appt with your Dr.<br>  <br>  Regards<br>  Betty|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Depending on your cycles and if you have missed your period now I would test in 2-4 days. If you have longer cycles wait a bit longer.<br>  <br>  Good luck
da0463b5125f03d85527fe970a64f901aa	Sex the day before you ovulated? That's almost perfect timing. Congrats to you it sounds like you have an impending arrival<br>  <br>  Regards<br>  Betty.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Sperm can live inside of you for 3 days, so if it was before ovulation, then yes its very possible.|`|tkqV2CI5aa	Well, if you have sex on your period or after and unprotected and he did it in you, that's the MOST best time to get pregnant and semen stays in you 3-5 days after sex. So i'm sure if your feeling the symptoms and you were ovulating, there might be a chance. just take a test before your next period or go to the doctor! GL.|`|0WFALNSvaa	yes but take the test to make sure
AiJeS6I1aa	If the baby had indeterminate sex organs or both sex organs, I would go with the DNA test... XX = girl, XY = boy.<br>  <br>  If the DNA test was inconclusive, this is harder:<br>  <br>  XXY = boy<br>  <br>  XXX = girl<br>  <br>  XYY = boy<br>  <br>  Basically, the presence of any Y would make me say boy.<br>  <br>  If things get muddier from there, like if the baby was outwardly girl, but the DNA had a Y component, then you might want to raise the baby as per the outward sex.  Kind of hard to add a penis.<br>  <br>  And, yes, I would get surgical intervention.  Life is hard enough for "normal" kids, let alone those that have to deal with some form of adversity.  Especially when it comes to gender.  There is a lot more support of disability these days, but gender can still be quite a taboo topic.<br>  <br>  Have fun... this is an interesting paper.  And be careful what you Google when researching this subject!  lol|`|weBvwrloaa	no, I would not have the child's sex "assigned" because you have no idea what the child could be. That is revealed in time. And you deciding could be the wrong choice and leave the child feeling like he/she is trapped int he wrong body and causing mental duress.  Providing out lets for the child to express themselves will allow for him or her to naturally fall into what sex they feel like they truly are and, i would think would be the best the for the child's welbeing.|`|GU3RauKOaa	A friend of mine told me about this a while back and I did some research on the matter.<br>  <br>  I would NOT have gender assignment surgery, its not my place to cosmetically change what my child was born with. If he/she needed surgery to function properly of course we would have it.<br>  <br>  Basically I would see which gender it is more like, if it has a micropenis it will be a male, I won't try to change it to female and vice versa. And that's what I would identify the child as. Of course when the child was older I would support whichever gender the child felt like they were.<br>  <br>  For those that read this question and don't know about intersex, here's a link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex</a><br>  <br>  Its more common than most people think and a LOT of baby's are forced to have surgery and grow up to have severe mental and emotional issues because of it.|`|WT56iKwZaa	I would not have my child go through surgery for cosmetic or gender asinment reasons. I don't think that would be my place to decide. If there were medicaly nesacary surgeries and procedures that needed done for the baby to be healthy that would be done. As a baby I would chooses the gender that the child most closly resembeled physicaly and choose a name that is gender non specific. As the child got older they would be the one to decide what gender they were most comfartable with. This is a hard enough situation to deal with on its own with out having he wrong gender asinged.<br>  <br>  In some cultures intersexed is a gender along with male and female.|`|U4pHV9rbaa	I think it should not be a parent's decision or doctors, whether the child should be surgically turned into either male or female. There have been cases when doctors assure the parents that the child is primarily one gender, based on brain readings, and then years later it turns out that they most associate themselves with the other gender.<br>  <br>  I think that the child should grow older to the point that it is able to make decisions on which gender it is for itself.

hNr3GFvlaa	Thank you for writing this and sharing your situation with all of us. I can imagine how sad and frustrating it may be for you to be physically punished by the people you love and trust. <br>  <br>  Spanking is abuse, as it involves inflicting pain without consent. <br>  <br>  Children are human beings as much as anybody else. You probably don't see your father spank your mother. And you don't spank your parents as a way to express your disagreement or displease with their behavior.<br>  <br>  Yes, spanking children is abuse. Unfortunately, it so popular and widespread, that it is no longer seen is abuse. Your parents may not be open in seeing it that way, and most likely that's because it was normal for them to be hit and smacked when *they* were children. They may love you and still use an abusive practice to communicate with you because they don't know better. <br>  <br>  Cognitive science has proven that spanking does not work as a teaching tool, so there's practically no excuse for the abuse.<br>  <br>  You may not be able to change how your parents treat you, but you may be able to end the cycle with you have your own children.<br>  <br>  You can read more here:<br>  <a href="http://www.alice-miller.com/flyers_en.php?page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.alice-miller.com/flyers_en.ph...</a><br>  <br>  and here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alice-miller.com/flyers_en.php?page=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.alice-miller.com/flyers_en.ph...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	thats a spanking dear.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	hitting in anyway is abuse ..you dont hit people. unless its self defense.

SEzIkGNiaa	To get babysitting jobs, start by handing out flyers to neighbours/people you know with children. If you don't know anyone with children, you could ask people if they know anyone that might need a sitter. You could also put up flyers on mail boxes, local church, grocery store, or music/gymnastics studio.<br>  * I wouldn't recommend putting them over the internet, since anyone can say they need a sitter and take your personal information *<br>  <br>  Here are my rates:<br>  <br>  5/per hour ~ 1-2 kids<br>  6.50 per hour ~ 3 kids<br>  8/per hour ~ 4 kids<br>  ect...<br>  <br>  No resume needed!

Then create business cards with your name and phone number on them and ask your parents to pass them out to adults with kids that they know.

AA12033653	I had the worst time after I got off of Depo.  It took me 9 months to get my period back, then it took another 6 months for my period to be regular again.  I was on Depo for 3 years, a total of 12 shots.  I also gained weight while I was on this, I would guess 5-10 pounds per shot.  <br>  <br>  Also, when I got off of depo my doctor was starting to pull her patients off of it because it was causing early onset osteoporosis for people that had been on Depo for an extended period of time.  Something about the shot preventing the body to convert vitamin d and calcium to bone marrow I think is what she told me.  So make sure that if you are TTC that you start taking vitamins ASAP.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|t0mb150gaa	i was on depo for almost 2 years...and never had any of the problems you had, it actually only caused weight loss..but everyone responds to it differently. However i was off of it for about 3 months and am currently 12 weeks pregnant,so you shouldn't have any problems once you stop taking it.|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|da0463b5125f03d85527fe970a64f901aa	I was also on Depo and it completely messed me up.<br>  <br>  I was off Depo for about a year when I got pregnant, miscarried at 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  6 months later I got pregnant again, miscarried at 13 weeks.<br>  <br>  I am pregnant again and honestly don't have high hopes.<br>  <br>  Depo is POISON and, if taken long enough 5 years or more, can leave you sterile.<br>  <br>  The longer you are off it the better. You cycle will get back to normal alone with all your hormones. But it will take time, could be years. It is indeed evil stuff.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you<br>  Betty|`|h5cFkP35aa	oh man i agree. i felt HORRIBLE on depo. same side effects. i would cry over anything. if you're wanting another baby, most likely you're going to have to wait for awhile. it can take up to a year or more to conceive. potent stuff, makes you wonder what they put in it...|`|HqpDo9BYaa	I started Depo in late April 2007, and got my last shot in September 2007.

I was off for over a year before I conceived which unfortunately ended in miscarraige but I would think that it won't take you so long as you were not on it even half as long as I was. I say just relax and maybe try charting.
eb9Mptu3aa	She could have had breakthrough bleeding (the period), but that far along, a home pregnancy test should give a pretty accurate result. I would retest just to be on the safe side, even though I believe it's unlikely that she's pregnant. She may just miss a period and have an odd cycle or two. It happens sometimes.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Wow!

hKJIDdVqaa	eww...she stayed over night? Why?  Eww I have a 10 year old, he does not even like girls, much less want to date one that old.  Yeah you should be concerned.

Especially at 10 years old, with a 15 year old! I'm not saying that you shouldn't trust your son but there comes a time when you should draw the line and this is it. You're giving him way too much freedom, in my opinion. If you are having doubts and concerns about your son then obviously you know what you're allowing isn't right. Think about it. :)|`|mBJDd2fFaa	That is not safe! Even if you do trust your son you shouldn't trust that girl. She is fifteen and could have things going through her mind your son doesnt at that age. <br>  My boyfriend was actually molested by an older girl when he was seven years old. She was about 13 at the time and she would get on top of him and basically rape him and he didnt understand what was going on. I think you should keep your son away from that girl. Or at least keep a close eye on them when they are together and your son is ten and shouldnt be up at one in the morning anyway.|`|okh3hL8taa	You found out your 10 year old son is DATING?  Don't you spend any time with your son?  And how can you have "mixed" feelings about the relationship?

quNfHZULaa	Yeah it is natural, your body is at the prime age for children. If you want one so bad, have one! Babies do grow up to be kids though, so they aren't all cute and cuddly forever, so make sure that isn't the reason you want one so bad. Kids can be really cute too though.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	bad idea|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i was born when my mom was 20<br>  i have wanted a child for years... like 4 ish and my son was born when i was 23.<br>  are you in a stable relationship? can you provide for a child? these are the things you should be worried about...|`|gNKW86ueaa	I got married and pregnant at 20- and I wouldn't have it any other way.<br>  <br>  It all depends on your maturity level, what kind of relationship you have with your SO, and where you are in your career. I have already graduated college with a nursing degree and have a job, and my husband has been employed with the government for over 7 years now.<br>  <br>  Really and truely, it is up to you. But just take some time to think about the fact that you're bringing a human being into this world and you want to give them the best chance possible, and the only way to ddo that is to make sure that you can provide for them, and that you're in the right place in your life. <br>  <br>  I definitely understand the baby itch- I've had it since I started nursing school in 2006-- But sometimes it's more important to make sure you're in the right place in your life first, if not for yourself, but for the sake of the precious life you're bringing into this world.<br>  <br>  Good luck, honey!|`|zHmZkMStaa	It's of course natural to want to have a baby - but is it sensible?

I'd like to have a puppy, too - but I don't have the $ for shots, vet bills, food, and whatever emergencies might crop up.

You also need to consider if you have a stable relationship, money and other things in place like somewhere to live. Babies are very exspensive!!!|`|er7NYdRdaa	It's totally natural. But I do have to say your reaction to your mom's answer is childish. You have to really think about whether or not you can care for the baby. Are you working? Are you in a steady relationship? Do you have your own apartment or house? Can you afford the extra $900+ a month it costs to have a baby? Daycare (I pay $700 a month),diapers, formula, wipes, Dr. visits....all of it really adds up fast. Yes they are cute and cuddly, but they are so much work!

ea25d9076fec2a98ef5108000f8e3290aa	All miscarriages, no matter how far along are devistating to the mother.<br>  You talk as if you had an abortion or something, you didnt!!!!<br>  Maybe it was for the best because if you would have fell in love with her from the start you would have been so much more torn apart inside than you were on that fateful day.<br>  My best friend went all the way to 40 weeks, had a C-section and the baby was surrounded by blood and her heart stopped beating the moment they took her from her mothers womb. The doctors still arent sure what exactly happened but they think she had a placenta tear a week before delievery, so the baby didn't make it. The saddest thing about it is that she expected a live birth and no complications... so she had the babys bedroom completely set up and already had two baby showers... only to come home and tear it all down and sell everything she had accumulated for the baby<br>  <br>  My friend also had this same problem, she already had a child and her marriage wasn't going so well all throughout her pregnancy. She thought that she had wished the child to die subconciously and that's what happened in the end. It wasn't true though. You can't WISH a baby to not be born or to be born with defects. Its not her fault just like its not YOUR fault what happened to your baby.<br>  <br>  I always told her that the most important people in our lives only stay for a moment, because that's all the time they need.<br>  <br>  Im very sorry for your loss and I hope you can move on to have a happier life.

It is completely normal to be in denial, or not want a pregnancy when it comes on the heals of the birth of a child.  Your hormones take much longer than that to get back to normal.  I have experienced this.  After years of secondary infertility my middle son was born, 12 weeks later I spontaneously got pregnant.  The majority of the pregnancy I was indenial that I was actually pregnant again, completely un-enthused and felt detached from the pregnancy till very far along, further than 23 weeks.<br>  <br>  What happened is in no way your fault.  You really need some grief counseling.  Try getting the book "On death and dying" by Betsy Kuebler Ross, it goes over the 7 stages of grief and may help you get out of this dysfunctional grieveing process.  Good luck|`|MLLCn4weaa	I think you should go to a counsellor.  You can go on a waiting list from your GP and it shouldn't cost much (if anything).<br>  <br>  It's no use me telling you it's not your fault as you know that although that's true, you still feel as if it is.  Nothing anyone on here can say will help.  The baby had a medical condition, it wasn't your fault.  Everyone knows you'd have loved that baby once she was born.  It was natural for you not to want another so soon.  Hope you get through it.  Some things like this can fester for tens of years or forever if you let them.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	oh huni,<br>  <br>  its nothing to do with what u thought or felt that that terrible thing happend. and somewhere above she knows this, it just wasnt her time yet xxxxxx<br>  <br>  please dont blame yourself. im so sorry hunni xxxxxxx maybe a counciller could help?|`|d89qNyb6aa	It wasn't your fault.<br>  I know you must hurt but things WILL get better I promise.<br>  <a href="http://www.hasanyonetoldyou.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hasanyonetoldyou.com/</a><br>  |`|74N9S09aaa	Stop dwelling on it!!!  Yes, I know it hurts!  That feeling (an emptiness and sorrow) will always be with you.  Do not let it take over your life.  Try to get pregnant again. Before you do, your mind has to be ready for a new sibling for your daughter.  Do some volunteer work at a daycare center or see if you can be a "rocker mom" at the local hospital's neonatal unit!  Ask God to forgive you about those thoughts that you are holding on to. Put the negativity behind you.  <br>  May God bless you and yours.  Good luck, dear!|`|ZVHtkTS9aa	Honey for your own and your daughters sake stop blaming yourself for something you had no control over. Unfortunately these things happen and it's not your fault.<br>  Theres alot of mothers who didnt want their baby when they were pregnant and had happy healthy babies and like you fell in love with their babies when they saw them.<br>  What happened to your baby DIDN'T happen because of the way you felt. its just one of those things.
AA11105522	well first of all your thoughts are defintily going in the right direction. family and friends play a big part in your life right now and it's great to have people you trust and believe in close to you that you can bounce things like this off of. i think you should keep the baby and if later in the pregnancy you feel like being a mom is too much for you, giving the baby up for an adoption is not a bad idea at all. good luck! and keep in mind that the decision you make will directly affect YOU! so put your thoughts, feelings and concerns first and make your decision.|`|a19c341dc9e1fb5f9ec013f9e593b60aaa	i'd say have your baby!! i know several ppl who came out just fine without their father. i believe your child will too espc with the support you say you have from your friends. the child's father will be the one missing out!! ask mature Godly women for advice. They helped me tremendously!!|`|ujDI9Fovaa	please give it up for adoption. it was meant to be born under God's authority but you certainly don't sound mature enough to look after a baby. It is waiting for loving parents. After it is born use birth control.|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	1. find out if you are actually pregnant - take a pregnancy test<br>  2. if you are - tell your parents. The sooner the better. No, they won't be happy, but it's much better if they find out now than when you're showing.<br>  3. Don't count on your friends to help take care of your baby. The baby is your responsibility and taking care of someone else's baby is going to get old fast when they have a chance to go to a party instead.<br>  4. Take the time to figure out what the costs would be and how you will provide for the baby. Then decide whether you want to keep the baby or give it up for adoption.<br>  Best wishes.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	If you're planning on having the baby regardless of whether you keep it or not, then you've got plenty of time to decide so you don't need to rush into a decision. As the pregnancy goes on, your mind might get clearer - you might feel a strong bond with the baby or you might decide you definitely aren't ready to be a parent. Either way, you've got a long time and it sounds like you've got good support from your friends to help talk through how you're feeling about the decision with so you'll know what to do eventually.
WrOvFyBgaa	darling, its your decision what you are going to do with your body, dont let him pressure you into doing something you will regret for the rest of your life.... believe me i was in the same situation the first time i got pregnant a year ago. i had the abortion and i regret it everyday.... <br>  life happens. if you werent meant to have it then you'd miscarry otherwise i wouldnt recommend you doing anything you'd hate yourself and him for. <br>  <br>  i'm 20 now and i'm pregnant again. i'm a junior in college now, but i'm taking a year off to have this child. and everyone is proud that i am owning up to my responsibilities rather than running from them. <br>  <br>  if you need someone to talk to about this feel free to email me hideme84913@yahoo.com<br>  i went through what you are going through and i can help|`|s1utniuvaa	He was man enough to have sex with you so he should be man enough to take care of that baby. If he wasn't ready to be a daddy he should keep it in his pants. Don't let a man pressure you into making a decision. If you don't want the abortion and you are against it don't have it. You can put the baby up for adoption or keep the baby and he should take a hike. Good luck hun!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	If you have it you will have a beautiful child that is your own. It will be difficult, but worth it. If you are with a "man" who does not want you to be happy no matter what choice it is you make, then I don't think he is worth it. A man should stand by you, it is your body, your decision. Heck, if your family is willing to help you don't need him anyway.|`|cFktUueyaa	First off, your b/f is an azz, even if you don't have the baby, dump him, he's a loser. Second, girls who make mistake at 16 (like my mom) have the common sense to do what's right for their child, and thank god my mom chose to keep me. There are worse things than being pregnant at 18...you're alive and well aren't ya. Don't let your boyfriend dictate what you are gonna do with your body. Do what you feel is right. Good luck hon!|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	I think you should have it. I'm not pro-life, I'm pro-choice, but clearly you've decided that YOU want the baby, and the only reason your CONSIDERING giving it up is because of him. You know you have the support of your parents. Even if you love him, it is not his choice, it's yours. I would actually be a little frightened about the "do everything in his power to make sure you don't have it" line.. My roommate told us that if he ever got a girl pregnant, he would BEAT it out of her LITERALLY with no hesitation... and he was 25... he hated condoms and slept with a different girl every other day, so I'm sure he'd gotten SOMEONE pregnant by then. <br>   You can raise the baby yourself, you know you want to keep it, you know you have the support, if he thinks his life is going to be ruined, thats his problem, not yours. Tell him to stay away from you and your baby if his basketball career is more important. He's likely scared of telling his mom he's not a virgin or something stupid like that. <br>  I think if you give it up, your really going to regret it. You even said your heart says to keep it. I bet that even if you scheduled an abortion, you'd bail out last minute. (just sayin').. <br>  Screw his life. if having a baby was such a big deal, he shouldn't have been having sex in the first place. Ask what his intentions are to "do whatever he can" and if it's anything like my old roommate, tell him to stay away from you. If you need to, lie and tell him you lost it or something and never want to see him again. <br>  <br>  You can do this on your own and I can tell you want to.... <br>  So tell your parents and start buying some tiny baby shoes in the store! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vl0HWTDJaa	If you're not 100% sure that you want an abortion then don't have one! If you regret it you could have a lifetime of guilt to deal with, especially when you go on to have children - you could look at them and think 'I killed your brother or sister'. I'm not saying that's it's wrong to have an abortion if that's what you really want, but you need to be totally sure because a lot of women feel like they've ruined their lives by having one they regret because their boyfriend or family pressured them.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	...you know the positives...and you know the negatives.<br>  <br>  please do what is best for you and your child. tell your parents|`|NNwEuC8paa	If you choose abortion  I can tell by what you said that you will regret it. Sure the first few years will be hard, and lots of money But like you said your parents will help you. Don't let him choose for you! You know you can take care of this baby and in your heart you know you want to keep him/her. Fallow your heart hun. Your gunna be a Mommy!!! congrats!|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	What a jerk.  Remind him he held three lives in his hands when he got while having unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  Okay - now that that has been said.......<br>  <br>  I was 16 when I had my daughter.  Sixteen!  Good lord I didn't know up from down back then - but me and her father stepped up to the plate and raised her the best we could.  It wasn't always easy - there were some bad times, some struggles, and many tears - but we did it.<br>  <br>  Today, she is a 21 year old college junior (where did that time go?).  She is an awesome kid with a good sense of herself and what she wants from life.<br>  <br>  As for her father and I - we both have college degrees (I have multiple degrees), and even though we are no longer together we are both doing very well in our respective lives.  <br>  <br>  While I do not recommend getting pregnant at 18 - it in no way means you will be a bad parent or that you will not be sucessful in life.  Things will just be more complicated.  Your boyfriend needs to man up and take responsibility for what he has done.  If he is threatening to hurt you to cause a miscarriage - get a restraining order.  It is not wrong for you to want to keep your child.|`|AA11784984	First of all you won't be ruining his life, he did that when he laid down with you unprotected. The choice is yours and if you don't believe in it don't do it. He sounds like someone that doesn't care about you or how you feel. He sould take a hike and you should find someone who is going to love both you and your baby.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	No, it's not wrong to want to have your baby.  You both knew the risks of having sex now you have to face what has happened.  There are many positive things about having a baby!!  They give you unconditional love, my daughter, who is now two and a half, makes me laugh every day!  I couldn't imagine my life without her!  You do what you feel in your heart!!  Good luck!!|`|wxbGmxbOaa	Ok, first off don't let anyone tell you that you are too young to be a good mother. Age does not define a person. People define themselves. I fully think you should keep the baby. If your bf doesn't like that then he's a punk. If he could lay down with you and do the deed to make that little miracle that is now growing inside of you then he should be MAN enough to take care of his responsibilities. If he's not then leave his a** because he's not worth your child's life. Also, you seem fully against abortion and if that's the case, you are going to live with depression and guilt the rest of your life, if you go against your own personal beliefs for someone elses. There are also other options at play here. If your not financially stable and you don't believe you can raise this child and give him or her a good life. Then there is always adoption. That may also be a hard thing for you to do, but it's much better to give your child a good life with a nice couple who will love him or her and give him or her a good home. Then to just abort your unborn child and not even give them a chance to live.<br>  <br>  I also wanted to tell you that I was 18 when I found out I was pregnant. I turned 19 in December and my baby girl is due May 16th. Now my bf wasn't a jerk about this unplanned pregnancy and him and I are still together and are going to take care of our daughter as a family. Which yes makes things a lot easier. But even if he weren't in the picture and if he did the same thing your bf did I would have picked my child's live over anyone's inconsiderate a**. Trust me the first time you see your child on ultra-sound you are going to be so excited and if you already weren't you are going to be completely in love with the little life growing inside of you. You can make it as a single mother and as you said your family will help you out along the way. So it's not as if you'd be completely alone through all of this. I wish you Good Luck and I really hope you decide to keep your baby. And if your bf doesn't come around to the idea of being a father he isn't worth a damn anyway, so get rid of him.|`|zATQaiwIaa	If you have sex there is a possibility of pregnancy!  Thats what it all boils down to.  I have a couple thoughts here:<br>  1. If you do give in to the pressure and have the abortion you will regret it for the rest of your life by the feelings you are having already just thinking about it.<br>  <br>  2. What type of man says he "make sure " you dont have the baby if you do decide to keep it - either way you need to get rid of this loser.<br>  <br>  3.  Granted money will be tight! - But many still find a way to continue their education.<br>  <br>  Do what is in your heart bc you are the one that will live with the decision - and seriously get rid of the A$$hole!|`|CpiLHcTlaa	okay he sounds slightly scary and honestly even if you chose to have an abortion i wouldn;t stay with him... its up to you i had a baby at 17 and honestly.. i love him to bits and im glad every day that i didn't get rid of him. even though i had to go through getting cheated on and lied to and i can never fully get rid of the guy who hurt me... I'll gladly deal with him and i don't regret it because that's where my baby came from. honestly... if you don't believe in it.. don't do it... I'm pro-choice but i believe it it feels wrong to do it... then you keep the baby. trust yourself...|`|JdyRdLwVaa	Don't let anyone tell you you're ruining your life.If you want the baby you have the right to keep it.I know it'll be hard I had my first baby at 16 and now I'm 20weeks pregnant with my 2nd baby.your boyfriend is a jerk if he tells you to have an abortion or that he will stop you from having the baby if you decide to keep it.You are the one who has to carry it for nine months its your choice.Tell his dumb a** to grow up and be a man.|`|VFUdAtrHaa	The positive? <br>  <br>  1.) You created a beautiful life<br>  <br>  2.) Its a human<br>  <br>  3.) Being a mother is the most amazing feeling and greatest job in this world.<br>  <br>  Now i was 15 when i had my son and im 18 now and im 32 weeks pregnant with my lil girl . Its hard sometimes but i would never ever never get rid of my kids. No child is a mistake. Your child was sent to you for a reason. Make the best out of it! Good luck!|`|c5AJGcYcaa	I honestly believe this is something you have to decide for yourself. No one can tell you what to do in this situation. <br>  <br>  He was "mature" enough to have sex with you and risk this, therefore he should be mature enough to deal with the circumstances.<br>  <br>  Im pro-choice and whatever you decide to do, just remember it's your life and your body! <br>  <br>  The only one who can judge you is God on judgement day, and he does not have a Y!Answers account.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|iW9GBrg6aa	you shouldn't listen to him. If you want to keep the baby, keep it. Don't let him force you not to have the baby. he should man up about it instead of turning it down. You're young but you can do this. Don't give up this child, it's just wrong. If you have to give it up, give it up for adoption.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	I think that if you listen to him and have an abortion, being so strongly against it will tear you up inside.  Honestly if abortion isnt the answer for you, maybe adoption?  They have open adoptions.<br>  I knw when i had my little one i was not even close to ready... i had just graduated college, and looking for a job to help pay for grad school. I am against abortions and couldnt bring myself to allowing that to be an option. It turned out for the best, but i am in no way where i planned on being. Sometimes life throws you a detour, and just becuase you have a baby doesnt mean you wont be able to finish school, it just means you'll be taking a different road to get there.|`|cJklyTraaa	first i think u should speak to ur parents.<br>  yes they may be upset and angry but im sure ur right they will help.<br>  i am a single parent im not gonna lie sometimes it is hard but i wouldnt change it for the world.<br>  you get so much happiness from a child.<br>  really the desision is urs<br>  really talk to ur mum or do u have an aunt or sister that u could talk to for advice?<br>  really talk to ur mum<br>  hope everything works out for u|`|peQGGFPYaa	this is your body only you know what to do with it. if your heart and beliefs tell you to keep it then you should Or if you could do it maybe give it up for adoption. if you are worried about what he will do get a restraining order. just always remember that this is your body and not his, and if you were to get an abortion against what you honestly in your heart want then you could be severely depressed afterwards. follow your heart hun it will all work out in the end the way it is supposed to.|`|shKh9mnUaa	PLEASE DON'T ABORT YOUR BABY!!!! Even if you don 't want to keep it you can put it up for adoption because then you won't be killing an innocent life.|`|ec926f1f376353e334871dac09156d63aa	Please keep the baby and lose the guy (he's a loser for wanting to kill your baby).|`|8624d8f3c13640e544dfac9ee3736a3faa	If he is not willing to support you in your decision, or even to listen to what you have to say on the matter, then take him out of the equation.  If you feel that you really want to keep the baby, being a single parent isn't easy, but many young women succeed in being a single parent everyday.  If you decide that you are not prepared to raise a child, abortion isn't the only choice.  You could also consider adoption.  There are many childless families that would be grateful for the opportunity to be parents.  Many adoption agencies allow the mother to have a very active role in choosing the right family for their baby.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, no matter what he says, you have to do what feels right for you.  This is your child and no one should pressure you into any decision other than your own.|`|987475b0db71996a7db0e2e10c1d960eaa	If he didn't want to have a baby or have a chance of having a baby then he shouldn't be having sex with you. You are carrying the baby and it's against your beliefs to have an abortion! You can care for it without him! Wouldn't that just make you feel bad the next time you get pregnant knowing that you destroyed a life without even giving it a chance at all? He may get over it, but if you tell him you're going to keep it watch out because he sounds like he could get abusive with you. Tell your parents. Tell them that you want to be responsible and keep it and that you'll need their help and support. He ruined his own life by having sex with you and now he can suffer or enjoy the consequences of having a child.|`|9ARNK0Bzaa	Firstly, i think you both need to sit and have a proper conversation abou it. You were both mature enough to create a life, so you should both me mature enough to sort it out, without arguing.<br>  <br>  Personally, i think you are too young for a child. It's one hell of a responsibility for two teenagers to raise a child, especially as neither of you are in full time employment as you are at college.  You should think about concentrating on finishing college and getting some good money from a few years in full time work, before you start planning a family.<br>  <br>  I think you should tell your parents. They will be able to help either way. At the end of the day, it's a joint decision as the baby is as much yours, as it is him.<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out -x-x-|`|AA10381258	Oh honey, I feel for you. He sounds like an absolute jerk. Of course you should have the baby. He made a choice one night in bed, and now he has a choice to man up and accept responsibility, or be a deadbeat and run away. There are always ways to make more money and support a child, and since you already have strong beliefs about it, you know you don't want to kill a sweet innocent baby. You are the one who would have to live with it. The saying goes, "You'll never regret having a child, but you may regret not having more". Good luck.|`|AA11105522	follow YOUR heart, mind, body and soul. Once you decide on what you want to do, then tell him and tell him to make a decision to stay or leave. it sounds like you have a pretty good support system (family) so screw him. Keep in mind that you are taking an innocent life into your own hands. if he doesnt want to be bothered fine, but this decision utimately relys on you. you may end up regretting this decision and you never  know how that will affect you mentally, this decision by itself is a hard one and please keep in mind that either direction you decide to go, it is your body being affected and your life being aftected directly and you will have to live with the decision not him|`|K1HGtB3maa	Your life will be REALLY hard if you become a mother at 18.  Especially since I'm guessing your relationship with this guy won't last since he's pressuring you to do something based simply upon his convenience.  <br>  <br>  It's not wrong for you to want to keep the baby, that's nature.  You're built to reproduce and then take care of the offspring to ensure the survival of the species.  However, the rational question to ask is if you can provide a good life for the baby now and in the future.  If you can manage to make it work, especially if you can keep going to college (very important!) so you can give him a better life after you graduate, power to you.  Get child support set up so he is forced to help you.<br>  <br>  Conversely, think about adoption.  There are people out there who are financially and emotionally ready to have a baby who may be able to provide a better life to the child than you can.  <br>  <br>  Finally, I am NOT one of those morons that's against abortion at all costs, I think in many cases it's the most rational choice.  Don't think about the positives for you if you keep the baby, think about the quality of life you may or may not be able to provide.  You may come to the eventual conclusion that you just can't do it, and you should get an abortion, or that you can do the pregnancy but can't provide a good life for the child in which case you should do adoption, or you may figure out a way to take care of the child and keep it and love it forever.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that just about every parent out there feels totally financially unprepared to have a baby, if nobody had babies until they felt like they had enough money in the bank the birth rate would plummet.  My wife and I are soon to have our first baby (we planned it), and I sure as hell don't feel fiscally sound enough to do it, but we'll make it work.  Money isn't everything, but you do need enough of it to ensure you won't be living out of your car with the baby.|`|NzQH7dQ1aa	One thing most abortion doctors won't tell you is the emotional trauma mothers go through. Because you stated its against everything you believe i think you will go through the rest of your life regretting it if you decide to abort. I really hope you don't, i don't think you would ever forgive yourself.  There are other options, such as adoption. Or you can keep your baby, which wouldn't be easy, but probably worthwhile for you if that's what you feel is the best course for you and your child.  Your b/f sounds like a jerk, and you sound like you would be better off without him. The positives are that you will have a gorgeous little baby, and a little partner for life! At the end of the day its up to, please don't abort, and please find a man who will treat you right.|`|syGNA9QZaa	do whatever you feel like doing in your heart. if he really loves you he wouldnt pressure you into doing something you dont want to do. if you want to keep your baby do it because you love the baby and know God does everything for a reason. but if you dont want it let the abortion be your choice and not anyone elses. good luck|`|aGbin67oaa	First you got to dig deep within you.  Are you ready to raise this child on your own if you have to?  You should not plan on depending on mom and dad, but if they choose to help you that's good for them (and you and your baby).  <br>  <br>  Truly your bf had sex with you, if he did not want to have children he should have kept it in his pants.  So you don't hold three lives in your hands- you hold two.  Yours and the baby's.  <br>  <br>  I miscarried my first child- it was early on, but still it was a loss.  I don't go through a day without thinking about what might have been.  Thankfully I now have two beautiful children that I adore.  You can't take back an abortion and needless to say- those that have had one seem to regret it and have trouble coping with their decision.<br>  <br>  Talk it out with your parents.  Even if you can't keep it- adoption is always an option.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kx9fluo1aa	hey, i think u shud go with ur heart and what you want.. you are the one who is going to have to live with it either way, i mean if u do have an abortion ur goin to be thinking 'what if'' and if ur going to be doin it againt ur believe its goin to make it worse anyway. you may be thinking about if ur doin the right thing rite up until labour but once u have your own little person holding onto you showing u how much they need you there, all that will disappear..<br>  to me it sounds like ur boyfriend isnt really worth it if he cant sit down n talk about it with u and respect ur choice too if he new how u felt about it he should help u do it shouldnt be up to him. sure it might be hard but when isnt it? everyone gets by. just make sure u know in urslef that ur making the right decison before making any because u dont want to regret which everyone u make.

I had a baby at 19 and still go to school full time. We live a great life together, with or without her father! If this is what you want, then you're gunna make it. If you get the abortion and it goes against everything you believe in, you're gunna be in a much worse situation than now. If your boyfriend wants to be a jerk, forget about him. You don't need him. I was just facing a situation like yours a couple weeks ago. I found out I was pregnant again, and my boyfriend and I had just split up. He wanted me to get an abortion, but it went against everything I believe in also. I made the decision to keep the baby. You can do it!|`|4NV68H6Oaa	I really feel for you because you are in an extremely difficult situation. Firstly your boyfriend is so insensitive to ask this of you. I can understand how he feels since he is in college and wants to finish his education, however this is in no way the fault of the innocent life you both created. If two people are going to make the decision to have unprotected sex then they should expect to deal with the consesquences that come with it. You are prepared to but he is not which says alot about him.<br>  <br>  If you choose to have an abortion yes you can continue with your education and relationship (is he really worth being with judging by his reaction? BUT you will have to go through the pain and heartbreak for the rest of your life, the fact that you had to ask on here shows you want this baby deep down so really think about what is more important.<br>  <br>  If you decide to keep this baby you face loosing your boyfriend and raising this child alone with little money, but you will be supported by your family as you say and hopefully your friends, you will get the joy of going for your scans and seeing your little baby's tiny features on the screen. I'm pregnant and 18 as well, it was planned so my boyfriends standing by me but I understand how worried you will be finacially as I've recently lost my job, but our families are there for us and at the end of the day if you've got that support that's the most important thing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|CKadCmnZaa	i think u just answered your own question and it seems to me that u would like to have this baby. yes it is expensive and can change ur lives, but if ur bf wants u to have an abortion, i would consider it. it will change ur lives but money shu=ouldnt be a sole reason why u should get rid. i had an abortion once as i was off to uni and my bf also agreed not to keep it. i dont regret it but i live with it everday.

Even if you don't want to keep it, there are tons of people who want kids and can't have them. adoption is always an option. by the way, no it's not wrong for you to want to keep your child... it's wrong for him to say that you should kill it|`|TfEGCx6eaa	You should do what is best for you. If you don't believe in abortion...the don't have one. It is a very hard decision to make. I am married with 2 step children and 2 children of my own. However...the second one almost did not happen. I got pregnant last March, I was terrified. I did not feel that we needed another baby. I was also over-weight and my parents did not think that I was ready to have another baby. No one seemed to have any faith in me. Sadly, I thought about having an abortion, but I knew that it would be a decision that would haunt me for the rest of my life. She was born on November 19th, 2 days before my birthday. And she turned out to be my blessing. I have since lost 50 lbs, which I would not have done if I had not got pregnant. The way that I see it...the right choice is what you want! I don't think that your parents would be upset for long...and as for that boyfriend, he only seems to be worried about himself and not how the situation is affecting you. I hope that everything works out for you.
AA11764194	Yes you can..<br>  <br>  During my last pregnancy after I came to know I am pregnant all of sudden i started to having period like symptoms.. I started bleeding rather heavily with blood clots and all which is very unusual for me.. I thought I am having miscarriage..<br>  <br>  Bleeding was heavy for 4 days on 4th day something made me take pregnancy test again.. again it came as positive<br>  <br>  next day I rushed to my Gyno.. she did the ultra sound n could not find anything as it was too early but took blood for more test.. by the time I got back home got a call from her saying you are still pregnant.. mind you I was still bleeding<br>  <br>  later I came to know I am carrying Twins.. still don't know what made all that heavy  bleeding.. I lost those twin angels at 16th week due to Doc's mistake<br>  <br>  So keep your faith, my prayers are with you.. goo luck
AA11955565	Hi!,<br>  <br>  My 5.5 month old baby girl ahs settled into this routine.<br>  <br>  5-6 oz  at 7am, heinz creamy oat porridge at 8am then naps for an hour.<br>  <br>  2oz-3oz at 11am ( this is the feed that has reduced since increasing solids!)<br>  <br>  fruit puree with yogurt at 12midday<br>  <br>  naps<br>  <br>  6oz at 2.30pm<br>  <br>  nap at some point<br>  <br>  5pm veg puree..tonight she had homemade lek swt potato and pee puree followed by fromage frais<br>  <br>  6.30pm 6-8oz<br>  <br>  bed<br>  <br>  11pm- 4 0z..though Iam trying to wean her off it slowly<br>  <br>  she has dropped night feeds<br>  <br>  she is in a fairly good routine, I use anabelle karmel food bks and gina food weaning book and adapted them to my own baby!<br>  <br>  I will be starting protein inthe nxt week and then lunch and tea will be savoury with maybe a fruit puree desert at tea time|`|GognIJnBaa	My son is 5 months old too.  He drinks 8-9 ounces of formula in the night, 4 ounces when he wakes up with cereal (two ounces formula mixed w/ cereal to a medium-thick consistency), 3 bottles of about 6-8 ounces during the day, then in the evening he has 3 ounces formula with cereal (again to a medium-thick consistency).  So, he's looking at 33 to 39 ounces of formula a day and then cereal.  I haven't started the veggies or fruits yet, but will be in a few weeks here.  I'm guessing then he'll be taking in a bit less formula and eating more foods.
OT6vCUU1aa	Awww momma I know what your saying... I am 11wks & 4days. I havent gotten sick recently but the headaches are horrible and the nausea when it decides to creep up on me. I eat apple slices to help with my nausea and 2 tylenols with some rest helps with the headaches. There isnt much left besides grin and bare it. Good luck with everything!|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Every pregnancy is different.  Some women don't get it at all, and some get it at weird times during their pregnancy.  Good luck.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	its different for every women. sorry!|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I asked a similar question about a week ago. I thought I was lucky and escaped all horrible pregnancy symptoms like nausea, headaches and breast-tenderness. At 18 weeks they hit with a vengeance! I was sick all day long, I had headaches that were disabling and just recently my breasts started to hurt! Great...just when I thought I had gotten past the point where this stuff occurs. No trimester is safe as far as I am concerned. My OB prescribed me Zofran to take as needed as my nausea was making me miserable and I wasn't eating much due to the nausea. Tylenol doesn't help my headaches so I have to suffer through them, even though my OB said she could prescribe me something that was safe to take during pregnancy, I refused. I am really hoping this crap stops soon. I am 21 weeks. Hope you start feeling better!|`|AA11220327	the first rule of pregnancy is there are no "supposed to's" (quoted from "what to expect when your expecting") with myy oldest i had horrible morning/noon/night sickness the whole pregnancy. with my 2nd, only about the 1st 5 months. and with this one, i have only been sick a handful of times. Any or all of these are normal. it may get better at any time, but it may not get better at all. just keep remembering that its not forever, and the end justifies the means|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	I know a woman who felt fine the entire first trimester, and was throwing up the entire second trimester. Every woman is different. I'm in my second trimester, and I've never felt sick [[knocks on wood]]. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qo79EUHKaa	Well you have to understand that every female's body is different. For example some people don't experience morning sickness at all!! My mom had 4 kids and said that she only had sickness about once or twice through out all of her pregnancies...lucky huh? Well as for me I am currently 6 and a half months pregnant and my morning sickness lasted up to my 4 months of being pregnant....and I had it BAD! I also had trouble brushing my teeth...it was something about the toothpaste that made me sick...but I got over it! I'm pretty sure you will pretty soon and I wish you the best....but after your morning sickness prepare for really bad heartburn...it sucks!|`|211c888ebc2dc4af0e368207777268ddaa	my nausea stayed terrible till 4 months, then it lightened up significantly but was still there the rest of the pregnancy. Since you are also getting bad headaches now, I'd bring it up with your doc. Meanwhile, make sure you are getting enough water and this isn't a sign of dehydration.|`|ooNfqGxzaa	I'm also on my 2nd trimester (12 weeks) and I puked yesterday. What I'm trying to say is that every pregnancy is different. They say that it is supposed to get better because, for alot of people it does. I wouldn't worry about it.|`|EDiJe38Taa	No, it gets better AT the second trimester. i.e. 13-14 weeks you will feel better. Mine peaked around 10-11 weeks. I'm sure in a few weeks you will feel better!|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Its diff for everybody but i was the same way. i got sick day or nite rite up until she popped out. lol. good luck darlin
tzRyeX62aa	I had this same question for my doctor, and she said no because there is an aspirin-like substance in the patch, but it is not aspirin, and it hasn't been tested to be safe for pregnant women.  She said the medicine will get into your bloodstream, so she wouldn't recommend it.  I guess do what you want and need to do, but I decided against it, I don't know it would be worth it.  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	My doctor said ok to the therma care wrap, but no to the icy hot ones.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	Absolutely!  Do it as often as you need to :)
QLopvWKDaa	Unfortunately- if the employer has fewer than 50 employee, it might be completely legal, unless your company has a policy stating that they have a FMLA (Family Medical Leave) plan or leave of absence policy. Get your Employee Handbook!<br>  <br>  However, a good place to start is with the Department of Labor. Go to their website and contact them.  They will be able to tell you if you have a decent chance of winning a claim.<br>  <br>  Under the new Economic Recovery Plan- if your company has 20 or more employees, it will have to be responsible for 65% of your COBRA (to continue your insurance) payment for 9 months and you will most likely get unemployment.  <br>  <br>  You rest up and don't worry- use your downtime to research your options- Good luck!|`|peQGGFPYaa	It is illegal to fire someone due to health complications. Do not turn in a letter of resignation because then you won't have a case. Call them back and get a lawyer.|`|LJdJytzraa	that is against the law, tell them you are not resigning and that is a form of dicrimination, your lawyer will be in contact with them and you will see them in court. big law suite baby let them fire you, you will get so paid more then then the nickles and dimes there paying you. if i were you i'd tell your doctor, them saying things like that can cause you more stress and complications with your pregnacy. just try and stay calm let an attorney handle this matter|`|d6ZUd9H9aa	did you tell them that you are pregnant? I would most defiantly check with a lawyer before you turn your letter in.<br>  <br>  I am almost sure that it is against the law to fire some one for health reasons.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|FhlmiI7daa	It is illegal to fire you for health reasons..i would tell them that I was getting a lawyer|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Tell them that your not handing in a resignation letter and that your lawyer will be contacting them. They will recant that statement. They cant do that.
WsUSAgLmaa	Yes so much pain around the belly button..it just weird feeling and if I touch my belly button...kicked...lol<br>  <br>  I think it just normal....the baby is centered now...so you may be gettin an elbow or sumthin!!|`|yZkf3zFeaa	I had the same problem yesterday. Just to the (my) right. I thought I was crazy.<br>  <br>  Not every ones belly button pops out.....thank god. Outies always freaked me out as a child, so it would be awkward as an adult to have one.
698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	I started peeing at night at 5weeks. I had early symptoms. No matter when I drink something I have to get up at least once at night to pee. I never had that problem before pg|`|wuZqDVzvaa	Im 20 weeks and ive peeing constantly since i was about 14 weeks i thought this was unusual, being that you start to urinate a lot during <br>  your 7th month due to the pressure of the  the baby on your bladder. So i asked my doc today at my doctor appointment he said it was normal as long as there was no pain. Just make sure you drink any liquids 1-2 hours before bed to avoid having to get up at night.|`|vomMV5hzaa	7-8 weeks. and thru the first trimester. <br>  second trimester was great, i never had to pee. <br>  month8 and 9 I would get up 4and 5 times in one night to pee. I used to get so mad when I had to pee for the 5th time in the night|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	15 weeks along it started. I've always been really good at not noticing it until it's bad enough to make me want to get up.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	I was fine until the baby turned head down at 21 weeks, its really annoying too cos I feel like Im busting but when I go there is no more than a dribble.|`|fpyRo8Noaa	12-15 weeks... it'll get worse as the baby gets bigger. sometimes i feel like i live in the bathroom, lol|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	Five weeks-current (almost 10 weeks) <br>  I get up at least twice in the middle of the night. :)|`|jkDawQVNaa	about 18-20 weeks now im 7months and its increased|`|75zggy81aa	4 or 5 weeks with both my pregnancies- so much money spent on tp, it only gets worse|`|1YHih8wyaa	you wont start using the bathroom as much until your baby gets bigger. one reason you could start using the restroom a lot could be because you do get thirstier and so you drink more fluids but besides that you dont start to frequent the bathroom until 20 weeks or so when the baby starts getting bigger.|`|ggETPqedaa	The very beginning actually, it was one of my symptoms. Along with eating all the time and sleeping. Though at about 5-6 months, I swear he sat on my bladder and bounced up and down, to make me go even more.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Actually, I was for a week or so before I found out I was pregnant and then it went back normal, also depends on how much you drink before you go to sleep. It will be back at about 28 weeks. I'm almost 30 weeks now and can't remember the last time I slept through the night.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i was bout 4 weeks and it lasted until the end of my 1st trimester. then, bc she was laying so low, she kept kicking me in the bladder (started at 19 weeks again) lol and that didn't stop until she moved up a lot, around 24 weeks.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	That didn't start for me this time until I hit 6 1/2 months.  I guess I am just really lucky.  Now I feel like I need to constantly!|`|uuHPneEcaa	i started peeing a lot more before i was pregnant. and i've been peeing every day since then.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I started peeing alot right away, but the last week has been really bad!  I'm 25 weeks but my baby moved head down about a week ago and now I pee about every 20 minutes!!|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Actually, I am 35 weeks pregnant and I am still not having to pee more than normal.|`|cSm1zod4aa	5 weeks.. didn't find out Im pregnant until 6 weeks... it explained a lot..lol|`|AA10458750	I peed all the time in my first trimester and now I'm going into the third and it is startign up again!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i started to pee more now then before 29 weeks!<br>  <br>  but i started seeing the pee come more often at about 6 weeks|`|wTeJulT5aa	before I knew I was pregnant.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	about 5-6 weeks|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	from about 5 weeks
3nv8MXs4aa	I think maybe just hormones. My husband calls maybe once if not at all so I think your quite lucky he calls everyday. Also at least he did txt you to tell you why he hadn't called trust me girl a lot of my girlfriends don't even get that. It sounds to me you have a loving husband who cares enough to call and check on you. Bit of advice just don't call him at work I made this mistake at first and it in return had reverse effect he was upset with me and became distant. He felt i was not understanding that he wished he could be home with me and our baby but had to work and by calling him  all the time it only frustrated him. So don't do that. I think you guys will be just fine now if he goes to work and doesn't call or txt you at all throughout the entirety of the day then i would be a lil irritated.|`|8jlOGOAeaa	My husband is currently deployed, but when he is home, he works and I stay home with our daughter.<br>  <br>  We usually talk about 2 times a day. He would call around lunch time and then he would always call when he started for home to see if he needed to stop anywhere.<br>  Right now, we IM each other about twice a day, but he's coming home for good on March 28th!|`|Iqifd3SGaa	Most of the time I don't talk to him at all during the day... He is a carpenter so he barely gets any time to actually talk to me, even during lunch or his break. But he doesn't keep his phone on him at work in fear of breaking it so that is another reason we don't talk during work hours, sometimes he calls me on the way home though. <br>  <br>  During my last month of pregnancy though he kept his phone on him and we talked for a couple minutes a day about.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	When he's working normally, we talk off and on throughout the day.  It depends on what he's doing.  Some days I don't talk to him at all, like when he goes to the range or is conducting training.  And other days we talk several times.<br>  <br>  Right now he's bout 500 miles away at a school for the next 7 weeks.  And I've talked to him about 3 times today so far.|`|FhlmiI7daa	my husband tries to check in once...he teaches at a university and he tries to call from his office but sometimes students come to see him and he doesn't have time to call...I usually get kinda upset if he doesn't call though.|`|1o820L3Daa	There are some days where he calls, and others he texts. And on some days I wait till he gets home. Its no biggy is he doesnt call. Dont stress so much.|`|qAkLi8oQaa	I talk to my fiance while he is at lunch and thats it...I would say its your hormones i doubt he was doing anything for you to get upset over...|`|GUUgeptjaa	I have been at home for a while now and my hubby and I see each other when he leaves for work and then sometimes he calls if he needs something or I call if I need something, and he always calls when he is coming home.  Other than that he is way to busy to chat and I accept that......<br>  <br>  Sometimes they get busy and at least he texted you, my dh doesn't tell me he is going to lunch at all,lol|`|EcVEID1Waa	You must be really young or have not been together long. It is no big deal. He is at work.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	My Significant other is a computer tech so he's always logged online and we talk on Yahoo throughout the day. We don't talk 100% of the day but we talk enough. <br>  I think it's just your hormones. You feel left out right now and it's normal. What does he do? The only reason I get to talk to my boyfriend is because he's in a computer lab fixing computers. If he were a construction worker then I wouldn't get to talk to him at all and I'd try not to get pissy when he goes out to lunch with his friends (because I know I would) but he's gotta have a release too. At least it's only the 1 hour a day and then he comes home to you :)   <br>  Congrats on the pregnancy :)   I hate not working. I want to go back to work so bad but no one will hire me pregnant now. I'm 22 weeks.|`|QSodlfMraa	i go to school and he work but he always call me whenever he has the time to call, but maybe your hormones are going wild and maybe he really should have call you before lunch.|`|DYJOpfvraa	I'm a SAHM  and 25 weeks pregnant and my husband works. We don't speak unless he has a question for me or I have a question for him. We usually don't talk at all until he gets home then we spend quality time talking in the evenings.|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	He maybe calls once a day to check in if hes not too busy.  I occasionally call him if I need him to pick up something on the way home.  I figure when hes at work, hes working and its not really the time to chat.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	I know how you feel lol I was signed off work for 3 weeks at the start of my pregnancy and he used to call me every day at lunch time.<br>  <br>  Don't panic. It's just hormones.|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	My husband almost never calls me from work unless he wants to remind me to do something.  I may call him if I need him to do something, or have a question, but I try to keep it short. I suppose it would be lovely if he called me just to check in on me, but he doesn't.  It doesn't bother me much.  He often calls on his way home to see if I need anything, which is wonderful.<br>  Look.  Men are simple.  If you want them to do things, tell them so.  Say, "I would like you to call and check and see how I am, and if there is anything I need, and tell me you love me at least once a day."  I realize you think it's more meaningful if he thinks of it himself, but he won't, and if that's what you want, then ask for it.
eXcXhSmIaa	i had spd during my pregnancy, im nearing the end now and luckly its not to bad. i was referred to physio and was given exercises, offered tuba grip to put round bump and if it became really painful they offered me a brace to lift the weight of the bump, which i belive works. i had pains turning in bed, gettin out the car and walking for any amount of time.<br>  exercise and the tuba grip did it for me, but maybe ask midwife for a support belt and they will measure u up for one.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i had thi swhen i was pregnant. its when you pelvic bone over stretches and the bones grind together causing the pain. i really feel for you i had it pretty bad:( getting out of bed and stairs was the worst pain id ever felt! it felt like someone taking a sledgehammer to my pelvic area eveytime my hips moved. <br>  <br>  advice that hepled me<br>  you can get a belly band to keep things in and tight it helps the pain when walking etc<br>  <br>  take bbay steps...this isnt so dramatic on your hips and pelvic area so less pain<br>  <br>  getting in and out of car and out of bed...pull your knees up and keep them tight together and swivel your whole body round to get out so your not twisting anything and it wont be as painful.<br>  <br>  the best part....back massage and hip massage keeps things from getting stiff! its works wonders:)<br>  <br>  hope this helps
2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	I suck at seeing things on ultrasound.  I still look at my daughter's and have no idea how they figured out that she was a girl.

pXSKSS3daa	It's her startle reflex. All babies are born with this and generally lose it around 6 months. However, my son is 11 months old and sometimes still jumps in his sleep.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, it's not harming her.|`|85vDqn6naa	Luv the name, lol my daughter is an Olivia too!! I still jump at night some times, it is very normal!|`|g9ScMmFFaa	it is one of the reflexes that babies are born with.  like her arms kind of flail?  that is normal.  they usually start to out grow that one around 6 months i think.  the doctors check reflexes like that at wellness check ups, so you can ask about it.  i am not positive, but i think it is called the moro reflex.
uuHPneEcaa	the baby could be on ur speractic nerve which is causing that pain. or u could have pulled something.. u need to be careful. well if ur that far along then maybe u did pull something.. Tomorrow at ur doctor's appointment be sure to let them know|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I am 27 weeks pregnant and I have had hip pain since I got pregnant... weird I know. I ,of course, had other symptoms but that has been one of them. My doctor said that it was perfectly fine. I will be honest it only gets worse when your body starts producing reflexin, which is a hormone that makes your hips more limber to deliver a baby. Anyway, I am a dancer and I have always been very limber, but every time I sit down in spread eagle or something, it feels as if I have been working out for an hour lol. I just take tylenol and walk for a little bit, that tends to help... Good luck!|`|AA11220327	with my son i had horrible siatic nerve pain in my hip and leg the whole pregnancy, it was just due to his position, so it very well could be that, or any number of things,  deffinitly talk to your dr about it
BsDv3k5iaa	Yes!  You don't need to spend every waking minute with him!  You want him to learn how to be independent!  I know it's hard at first!  As long as you are taking proper care of him you are doing great!  Reading books to him is a great way to interact with him, also just have a conversation with him.  Even though it will only be one sided, you will help him a great deal with his language development!!  If you feel better keep him in the same room as you while you get the work done that you need to do!|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Of course it is! If he's happy to play alone for a bit it's fine! So long as he's not like that all day and you do interact with him then you're a good mum, although I'd say the fact that you even ask this question proves that you're a good mum! <br>  <br>  Congratulations! =) x|`|heDtLdz5aa	yes that is perfectly fine... i made the mistake of constantly entertaining my son ( although i don't truely feel  it was a mistake per say) but it took him a long time to learn how to entertain himself..so i think what you are doing is a good thing|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Of course it is ok to let him lay and play alone. He also needs to learn how to entertain himself as well as having interaction with you.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Yes its perfectly fine to leave him play for a while, I wouldnt leave the room with him laying on a blanket thou as babies can move a lot and although hes too small to roll its better to be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  When he is awake take some time and talk to him, and while he is playing give him toys that will stimulate him and exercise his senses. I agree you shouldnt be spending every waking minute with him as it wouldnt be good for him, relax you sound like you are doing a great job.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Put him in a play pin and get your chores done.  As long as he has toys to play with - he will be fine.|`|MV4QN2maaa	Talk to him a lot or sing or read. Let him hear your voice and if some words make him laugh say them a lot.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, bc of the risk of flat head, i would  put him in a swing or bouncy with a 'noggin nest' by boppy, or carry the blanket from room to room with you and let him get tsome tummy time while you work.....also would highly recommend a baby bjorn carrier with back support, i have back probs and i can carry my dd for hours if i watch my posture, she's nine mos now and does and always has slept in it when she was tired so i guess she must be pretty comfy.....<br>  your baby is way too young to let him cry it out and LEARN anything like that...and a playpen is probably not such a good idea as i doubt he has mastered sitting himself up and such or has the dexterity to play with toys enough to entertain himself for any length of time.....you could try a sling, but that didn't work for me....gl|`|DDIBEvUTaa	at that age babies mostly just want to feel safe & secure.  They actually need a few minutes of alone time so they can process what they have taken in & learned throughout the day.  : )<br>  if he is able to see what you are doing, it's good to narrate so he can learn by watching you
Coc593Ikaa	All women should do them, not just those anticipating a vaginal delivery.<br>  <br>  At the very least, they are useful for sex. Trust me, you learn to do them well, and your husband will thank you for it!<br>  <br>  "Women will see increased vaginal strength and control and men should see increased ejaculation strength and increased sexual stamina. Both genders will see greatly increased pleasure during intercourse and more intense, longer lasting orgasms."<br>  <br>  "A fitter, well-toned pelvic floor will almost certainly increase sexual pleasure for you and your partner and it can dramatically improve your sexual confidence. The physiological reasons for the improvement go far beyond the increased tactile sensations resulting from a tighter vagina.<br>  Kegel exercises create an increase in pelvic vascularity which means more blood flow and more veins in the pelvic region. This will increase your awareness of the clitoral and vaginal sensations that lead to orgasm. Any stronger muscle will contract more powerfully than would a flabby muscle, and hence the likelihood of stronger orgasms is much higher with stronger PC muscles."|`|sYsfI856aa	I didn't do Kegel's even with my first pregnancy and had a vaginal birth with no problems. Kegel's are still good to do if you feel like they will help with any sort of bladder incontinence you may have currently, but otherwise if you are getting a C-section, don't wear yourself out :D|`|zEK0yY3Eaa	I don't see the point in doing Kegels if you know you're having a C-section since they're supposed to strengthen your pelvic floor for a vaginal birth. Personally, I think they're a load of hooey anyway to make you feel like you're doing something to make your delivery easier. I've yet to see any valid scientific studies proving that they actually work. Can't hurt anything to do them though, I suppose. I didn't do them with my first and my son was born vaginally with no problems.|`|kY6BXne8aa	NO, Kegels are to strengthen your uterus and vaginal muscles to make you stretch better and not "tear" durring natural childbirth. So you don't have to worry about it with a C-section.|`|kaXCvCxpaa	Kegel exercises are good for all women weather having a baby or not.

q1YDp1y3aa	This should help for your circumcision questions- generally they ask if you want it done. Some doctors do it in the first 24 hours, other before discharge. Some hospitals won't permit circumcisions any longer and those babies are done at the doctors office in the first few weeks. And, of course, Jews circumcise in a special ceremony on the 8th day. <br>  <br>  As for how they do it, here's some info on circumcision in general, including videos of the two most common procedures-<br>  <br>  The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA</a><br>  <br>  Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?<br>  Gomco Clamp- <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=..." rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  Plastibell- <a href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell...." rel="nofollow">http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell....</a>|`|zwJbUbWMaa	how old were you with your first child ? 27<br>  <br>  Premature birth questions:<br>  how many months premature where you ? 0<br>  how much did your baby weigh ? 7lbs 3 oz<br>  how long were you in hospital ? 3 nights (one to induce)<br>  how long was the baby in hospital for? 2 nights<br>  what was wrong with the baby ? nothing, they thought he may have had a loose hip but it was nothing.<br>  what kind of needles did you have in you ? like IV etc.. ?

703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	It's not like you have to sleep on the left side ALL the time, it's just the most optimal position.  Here's a detailed answer on it:  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/404_whats-the-best-sleep-position-during-pregnancy_7608.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/404_whats-the-...</a><br>  <br>  It basically improves blood flow to the placenta.  I don't sleep on my left side all the time, though.  Sometimes I prefer the right side.  Of course, you shouldn't sleep on your belly (it would be pretty uncomfortable) and your back isn't a good idea either once you're in your second trimester or so, because it compresses your vena cava.  It also puts a ton of weight in a very awkward spot and that can get so uncomfortable after a while--particularly when your belly's big near the end.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	Everyone has their own concept on what side a pregnant woman should sleep on or not. What ever side you feel most comfortable on, either it may be the right side, left side or even sleeping on your back and being propped up w/ pillows is fine. through out the night i find myself sleeping mostly on my left side, other nights on my right, the position I feel most uncomfortable in is on my back while being propped up w/ pillows behind my head.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Yes, my doctor said that the baby and you get the best blood flow by sleeping on the left side. (sorry not more detailed)<br>  <br>  I sleep on my sides now, because my back hurts to sleep on, and the belly is impossible now. lol|`|cen8SIssaa	INFO RECIEVED FROM:<a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_newborn/pregnancy/sleep_during_pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_n...</a><br>  <br>  Some doctors specifically recommend that pregnant women sleep on the left side. Because your liver is on the right side of your abdomen, lying on your left side helps keep the uterus off that large organ. Sleeping on the left side also improves circulation to the heart and allows for the best blood flow to the fetus, uterus, and kidneys. Ask what your doctor recommends — in most cases, lying on either side should do the trick and help take some pressure off your back.<br>  <br>  But don't drive yourself crazy worrying that you might roll over onto your back during the night. Shifting positions is a natural part of sleeping that you can't control. Most likely, during the third trimester of your pregnancy, your body won't shift into the back-sleeping position anyway because it will be too uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  If you do shift onto your back and the baby's weight presses on your inferior vena cava, the discomfort will probably wake you up. See what your doctor recommends about this; he or she may suggest that you use a pillow to keep yourself propped up on one side.<br>  <br>  I TEND TO SLEEP ON EITHER SIDE AND NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM, BUT I HAVE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES ITS BEST TO SLEEP ON YOUR LEFT SIDE AND EVEN MORE SO TOWARDS THE 2ND AND 3RD TRIMESTERS.|`|FA1pt86Caa	I'm not sure but i THINK it's something to due with your bladder and everything... it's on your right so maybe they don't want the baby laying on it and i do know that sometimes laying on your side takes off some pressure (when you get farther along) and can help with the baby laying on a nerve. I lay on my side all the time but i don't think it really matter which side....|`|ytmE7BY1aa	It's just because of the blood flow/ circulation, and you will see once you get farther along that it is MUCH easier to breath by laying on your side. Either your left or your right side is okay. I don't know why people say your left specifically. But my doctor has always said left or right. Good luck!|`|9VRAj0iJaa	never heard of this...but i would go along with whatever you doctor advises..if he hasn't said anything about what side you should sleep on, don't worry about it.  i can't recall what side i slept on with my first child, but i know right now i'm all over the place! lol.|`|67b1LBBCaa	i got told because the main artery is on your right side and sleeping this way help the circulation and oxygen not get blocked off by the weight of your abdo and therefore starve your baby of oxygen|`|FgAPXhVRaa	You are supposed to sleep on your left side because that is the side your heart is on. It has to work less and the blood flow is better to get the placenta and baby than if you are lying on your left side versus right or back or stomach. That is why you should sleep on your side.|`|buoqtZeFaa	My doctor has been telling me to sleep only on my left for about a month.  It started when I was telling her I was having some cramping.  I also read that is is better blood flow to the baby on the left.  She has put me on restrictions not to clean or anything she tells me to just stay on that side when I get off work.  Also my blood pressure got really high (well high for me cause its always super low) and now at my appoinemtnes they will only test on my left side which brings it back down to 112/63. (which is still a tad high for me)
do8pdlluaa	I would say 7th month is when you really start feeling it. That is when the baby has a lot more strength, and has also developed bones/muscles.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1178393/family_history_can_be_a_guide_to_your.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|GR2bvgklaa	i am 21 weeks and my baby kicks lumps out of me i love the feeling i see my belly like a rumbling movement when it kicks <br>  <br>  so yes its normal dont worrie|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I'm 24 weeks now and sometimes I notice that the kicks are stronger than others and I've seen my stomach jump a few times.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	My big big ones were at 7+ months.

Once it said girl, once it said boy, another time it said girl, another it said boy...etc etc...No it doesn't work, It's a needle attached to a string...|`|RE63EDGJaa	We did that at work one night because 3 of the girls ( including me) were pregnant.

AA11220327	they dont ever go away. they are a womans battle scars of pregnancy for life. they do get lighter in colour eventually, but they dont ever go away. be proud of them, they were put there by your beautiful baby. mine have never bothered me, they are there to show that i have given birth to great, happy, healthy kids.

AiJeS6I1aa	It may be on the extreme end, but a breastfed baby can go up to nearly 3 weeks without a bowel movement and still be normal.  Now, I have never experienced this... my baby pooped every time I fed her!  lol<br>  But, I know a mom whose breastfed baby pooped only once a week.  If the baby's tummy is nice and soft, and she isn't in pain, then not having a poop is ok so far.<br>  <br>  As for the weight gain, this concerns me.  A newborn baby gains about 6 oz per week, so no weight gain is not normal!!!  That, coupled with the lack of poops makes me think that this baby is not getting enough milk.<br>  <br>  Is the baby having at least 6 very wet diapers in a 24 hour period?  If yes, then I wouldn't worry as much, but I would see a doctor this week.  If no, then I would see a doctor today or tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Is the baby having alert periods during the day (ie. staying awake for about an hour a couple times during the day?  If she isn't, this is an indication that her body is trying to conserve energy because she isn't getting enough food.<br>  <br>  I would bet that the baby's latch is not the best.  If you improve the latch, the baby will get more milk, and it will all work out.  Please check out the following links to the Dr. Jack Newman site, and have your sister (?sister-in law) look at this too... especially the videos on proper latch and what efficient drinking looks like.  Dr. Newman is a Toronto-based Pediatrician who specializes in breastfeeding difficulty.  He has very informative articles and videos that show what effective nursing looks like.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjacknewman.com/help/Is%20My%20Baby%20Getting%20Enough%20Milk.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjacknewman.com/help/Is%20My...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjacknewman.com/help/Breast-compression.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjacknewman.com/help/Breast-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjacknewman.com/video-clips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjacknewman.com/video-clips....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Also, please support your sister/in-law in her breastfeeding.

Get another opinion.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	def get a 2nd opinion, something doesn't sound right, although i know bfed babies can go a long time between bowel movements, i thought that was a litttle older than 3 weeks.....i would feel better safe than sorry....ask your gp for a different referral and see if they can get you an appt sooner than you could if you callled....gl|`|MR9iBgafaa	Very worrying that she's not passing stools in 2 weeks.  I would DEMAND to see a child doctor at the hospital.|`|mldo1vxYaa	I would see another doctor asap, i am not trying to frighten you but two weeks is a long time for anyone to go without passing stools, 2 weeks in a 3 week old baby is two thirds of its life whatever way you look at it.<br>  <br>  Did she go much in the first week? Even if she was going every day I would still be worried, if she only went once or twice I would be also very worried. Its better to get her checked incase theres a problem with her bowel.<br>  <br>  She will be having a lot of pain if she is not seen to and its not good for a baby so young to be suffering like that, she really needs to be seen.|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	2 weeks with no bowel movement could be a sign of something more serious. Find another dr right away and get another opinion. A newborns life is nothing to gamble with. We knew someone whose baby's intestines became detached and he was unable to have a bowel movement and needed emergency surgery to save his life.|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	My HV told me that it was fine for a breastfed baby to not pass a stool for 3 weeks.

FQ4nhSiRaa	No you dont have to tell anyone what you got with the money they gave you - if you want to thats fine but I didnt. I just wrote something along the lines of "thank you for your kind gift - we greatly appreciate it". Personally, if they were just onesies or clothes I would just keep them. It is ok to exchange I guess but I just wouldnt. It is fine to exchange the gift you got 2 of but I wouldnt write that on the card. Just thank her for her thoughtful gift. But some gifts may be handy to get 2 of- we got 2 of the little bouncer seats and we left one at my moms house which worked great since he spends one day a week there.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Yes, it would be polite to tell people what you bought with their gift card. Surely you have bought things on your own. Or just say diapers. "Thanks so much for the Target gift card, I put it towards a huge case of diapers."<br>  <br>  You can exchange stuff. Onesies are no big deal. If someone got you something big or a nice outfit it would be nice to send a pic of baby wearing/using it in a few months, but if you need to exchange its fine.<br>  <br>  And there is no need to say you exchanged stuff. Just say thanks for the bouncer.|`|utfoP7GWaa	I wouldn't go into specific's. I would do a general thankyou on all the cards. something like: Thankyou for the wonderful gift. It is much appreciated, wanted, and will come in handy when our baby arrives. Sincerely (or love)|`|V8GrFx0jaa	You don't need to be absolutely truthful. If you got something you don't like or a duplicate, just thank the person for the item. You don't have to tell them that you exchanged the item for something you like or don't already have. If you got a gift card, it would be nice to mention an item or two that you purchased with it, but just thanking the person for the "generous gift" is also enough.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I'm just glad to hear that some people still send thank you cards!|`|zATQaiwIaa	Gift card or money - say thank you and that really appreciate it and have plans for using it for "diapers" - you dont need to say when.<br>  <br>  the bouncer - just say thank you and that your sure if will be a great help when your arm needs a break - there is no need for them to know you returned it|`|Hf5doDxsaa	It's always nice to tell them what you got with the gift card.  But if you haven't gotten anything yet just be honest.  You could say what your thinking about getting, or that your saving it up.  And, if I gave a gift card to someone I would be happy to know that I was helping out with diapers, or everyday costs.  Things can really get expensive and maybe that's why they gave you a gift card instead of picking out a gift.  Maybe you could say something like..."John and I would just like to say thank you so much for the generous gift card you gave us at our baby shower.  It's really going to help out with all those pricey diapers.  We can't wait to see you again soon!  with love... "<br>  <br>  And, I think it's perfectly okay to exchange the onzies you got, I would just be kind of discreet about it if you can.  Usually if you tell the store it was a gift they'll let you just exchange it.<br>  <br>  About the bouncer - I think you should still thank your grandmother for for it.  She doesn't have to know you took hers back, maybe you took the other person's bouncer back.  She might have taken awhile to pick that out and you don't want to risk hurting her feelings.<br>  <br>  I know it's all stressful, you'll get through it eventually though.  Good luck!|`|38902e2ce5f8ef4d27715901e6c92e15aa	As for the money and the gift cards just simply state thank you for your generous gift. <br>  <br>  and the onsies.... when will that person ever see them, and if they do what are the chances that they are wearing the ones that they bought, they will never know. Go ahead.
azE51WGRaa	When you get pregnant, your uterus pushes everything (organs and such) to your back and up to make room for the growing baby. So it could be that your baby is getting bigger and your insides are starting to get squished, resulting in more pain. It could also be that your baby is laying on something and that's resulting in the pain. Back pain is a common complaint during pregnancy, so it's perfectly normal. Try a warm bath, heating pad, or ice pack on the spot that hurts. Also try taking some tylenol combined with one of the methods I listed above and that should help relieve some of the pain. Congrats on the baby!|`|1o820L3Daa	I had this for about a week last week. But on the left side. And yes it does hurt doesnt it? Im not sure what causes it. I think its sciatica. Im going t my doctors today and Ill be asking about it. Hope it goes away soon for you.|`|PfIywLLyaa	This could be your sciatic nerve acting up. Mine has been since early on in my pregnancy, and unfortunately it gets worse as the baby gets heavier and shifts. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|tnllPS8oaa	Some warm will Relax the mussels.|`|2wdVqIc7aa	Could be sciatic nerve pain. But I will say, as the baby gets bigger you will notice discomfort from how he is positioned. Such as he is pushing on things that don't like to be pushed on. That could be what it is. Try getting on your hand and knees and arching your back up and then down to stretch it out. This always felt really good to me when I was pregnant. just be sure to go slow and stop if you feel straining or anything.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	my back is so painful but my back is messed up . i have a a48% curve. with rods .

S7jhThbmaa	Some of the signs of pregnancy are really sore/tender and swollen breasts, frequent urination, nausea, and cramping without a period.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you have some of these symptoms.  I suggest you wait 2 more days and take another test. If it is negative and you still have not started your period, make an appointment to get blood work done or get a check up with your OBGYN.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	it may take time for the hormones to show. Get a good digital test and take it again in a day or 2. <br>  <br>  Or get bloodwork.
1thzSbS8aa	You get pregnant in your uterus, not in your digestive tract.

2pxiK9waaa	I'd sand it and stain it. I wouldn't paint it dark brown--it'll look horrible painted. If you wanted to paint it a color (white, yellow, pink, red, green, blue, black, etc), then you wouldn't have to sand it all the way down, just roughen it up. If you stain it, you need to sand it all the way down and it'll take several coats of stain because you want it dark. You'll also have to put a protective varnish on it. You may be better off just buying a new crib to save yourself the hassle.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	Borrow a book about refinishing and painting  furniture. Most furniture needs to be sanded down and then painted. Check a book for further details as this is a time consuming process. Also, you need to take safety precautions when sanding and painting.<br>  <br>  Finally, you should use child-safe paint. Check with the paint or hardware store for advice on what's best to use for safely painting furniture.|`|GognIJnBaa	You don't need to get to the 'naked wood' - you just need to get the surface roughed up.  Other than that, not sure what type of paint or anything.  Maybe check the HGTV website or post this in a different category.|`|AA11537580	give it a light sanding then stain it<br>  do not paint it!!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	first you can buy an electric sander to help sand it down, and i think you need to sand it to the wood; personally i think a dark stain would be a whole lot better looking than paint....i would just make sure everything you use, stain, maybe a shiny overcoat is non-toxic and give it plenty of time to air out with the windows open if at all possible or put it in the garage for a little while....good luck...if u plan on doing a whole set of nursery furniture, god help you, bc it will be a LOT of work! best wishes :0)|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Was it brand new 3 years ago? If so you don't need to sand it down. Paint and stain has been safe for babies for decades. The only time you need to get rid of all the old paint is if it's an old family crib and might have been painted with lead paint.
GLMYTgqiaa	i would wait a week and take another test, call your doctor or see how long that symptom keeps going. its just one sign.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Frequent urination is a sign of other things as well.  You should probably see a doctor.
ZbnxGIsnaa	That's normal!  That also means your baby is very healthy!  =)  I was deathly ill with Thomas and I'm not really sick this round.  That could change, but we'll see!!!  As long as the baby is fine.  I don't mind missing the whole morning sickness part!  Haha.<br>  <br>  Just make sure to keep liquids down as hard as that is, and stay cool, and eat crackers.  It probably does have something to do with the hcg.  I mean the whole reason why you have morning sickness is down to the hormones in your body.  So, that would make sense!  Take care!!!  =)|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Sounds normal.<br>  <br>  When I was going through the worst of my morning sickness, I would feel pretty good one day and then the next day I would be miserable.  It was an every other day thing for me.<br>  <br>  No worries!|`|TLjNUJHLaa	It is totally normal but make sure you stay hydrated. When I was pregnant I tried to drink a bottle of water every hour. All I can really say is get use to it.
bw4TMX59aa	Mine did..My body was expelling it and it turned sideways and was cutting into my cervix.I had it for 10 months and it gave my nothing but problems the whole time. I bleed for the entire 10 months and it never let up. It sucked. My doctor removed it cause I was in so much pain.I did not like it and will not get it after my next baby is born|`|Y9mew1mwaa	Mine never moved or got dislodged. But i did have it removed after 5 months of none stop bleeding and cramping. I was told that i would have some spotting and bleeding between periods, but i bled every day for 5 months and got sick of it. In my case it prevented pregnancy by making me abstinent!!
VbkJ9Tucaa	The pill won't kill the baby. It will cause birth defects if it is taken too long during pregnancy but it won't kill the baby. Considering that she just gave birth and just started the pill, I'd say that is where the unusual bleeding is coming from. Her body has to get back on track!|`|PeNTl6KOaa	i dont think the pill can kill a baby<br>  <br>  xx
aGbin67oaa	Go to Gerber's website.  They lay out when to give your baby stage 2 and then stage 3 foods.  I think from memory stage 2 is for babies that can sit on their own (or maybe crawl) and stage three are for those walkers.  Truly check out their website.  It provides a great guideline and also has sample menus for each stage.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|29I3YjjPaa	Whatever age you think appropriate my son was on stage 2 by 7 months. They ONLY difference between stage 1 and stage 2 is the portion size, and now they can be reused and refrigerated. The big difference is stage 2 to stage 3 due to the texture and the actual chunks of food.|`|CFFuFof1aa	There is not much difference, Stage 2 is a little bit thicker, they have larger quantities and more variety of foods. I had my daughter on stage 2 at about 6 months.|`|B2Gki86uaa	There's no difference - jars are just bigger.|`|8YrBbgXXaa	Stage 2 is just a little thicker and the jars are bigger. Stage 2 also offers a bigger variety of foods. I switched when my son was about 7 months old. He already had 4 teeth. Your baby will let you know if the food is too thick.|`|vue9NOhYaa	When baby is eating enough to make it cost effective.<br>  <br>  The main difference is the size of the jar and the fact that all stage 1 foods are 'single' foods, and many stage 2's are mixtures.  (You'll want to read the lables, because some stage 2 foods contiain fillers and starches ... not very healthy or cost effective.)|`|fHjSonssaa	For the most part, there isn't a difference- the jars/containers are just bigger.  I use Gerber, as well as a few other kinds,<br>  <br>  There is also more variety when you get to 2nd foods.<br>  When you get to THIRD foods, there are some that have a few chunks in it to help teach baby to chew.<br>  But the substance of first and second foods are the same.<br>  <br>  When I realized thiuis, I switched to 2nds right away because you can save what baby doesn't eat, so it's a bit more cost effective.
ZusC87WBaa	With 3 of my boys, I could see the penis during their 20 week ultrasounds.  With my other 2 boys, it was policy at the time not to reveal the gender.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	It could be a girl with her hands between her legs. They generally don't give a 100% because they can't guarantee it. I would go to one of those 3D ultra sound places and pay a little extra and get some really good pictures of the genitals so you know for sure. Maybe the tech was having a bad day and didn't care to put you at ease. My sister's tech did that, wouldn't even let her try to reposition the baby to find out what it was for sure. She got a high % that it was a boy and it's a boy.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	They are more likely to get a "girl" ultra sound wrong than a "boy" one.<br>  <br>  Usually girl parts on an ultrasound look like a "hamburger" at least that's what the tech i saw called it.|`|zATQaiwIaa	One - a tech will never say that they are 100% sure bc of legalities.<br>  <br>  Two - a little girls gentile area can be swollen, and things look different.  I made sure to have the tech scroll around to see his "thing"...seeing something that looks like "balls" really tells you nothing.<br>  <br>  do some research on how to read a baby gender ultrasound.  At 20 weeks, if its a girl you will usually see 3 lines in the genital area; a boy you should notice something protruding...obviously.|`|a12d3603b55de6ab7417697949d7b46faa	We got very lucky at our 20 week ultrasound our lil man had no shame in his game showing off his family jewels! I did a lot of research before going into our ultrasound, this is my first baby. So I could know hte different between girl ultrasounds and boy ultrasounds. Girls as they say looks like a hamburger and boys like a turtle or you can clearly see something hanging in the middle if they cooperate I should say. We all had no doubt what we were seeing, it wasn't hte umbilical cord either. I am posting up our ultrasound picture of our lil man showing off the goods so you can see a very clear picture of a boy LOL Best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k8/sarahkay1_2006/l_cf6790c69d8e49c691bc22937473ca9d.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k8/sar...</a>|`|sYsfI856aa	My first was a boy, and it sounds to me what you are explaining is like what we saw on our boys ultrasound. The doctor will never give a 100% boy/girl analysis unless you have gender checked through amnio test.  Sounds to me like you have a little boy in there!<br>  <br>  Try going to google and googling baby boy ultrasounds and see if what you see there looks familiar, look up girls too to see the difference, that's what I did even though I could clearly see this one isn't a boy like my son LOL. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	My ultrasound tech said that a boy's parts look kind of like a little turtle on the scan.  I could see what he was talking about when he pointed it out to me.<br>  <br>  Since you're pretty sure your baby's a boy, you can go ahead and buy boy stuff, but don't cut the tags off and keep the receipts just in case.  You'll most likely get a 100% answer on the sex at your next u/s.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BJuHbQXfaa	When I had my US the doctor gave me the same remark. My husband was so happy of course. We saw the little circle as well in the genital area, girls definitely do not have that. We ended having a boy in February. So congratulations Dad and Mon you are having a boy. Good Luck to you.|`|LL2dgYMUaa	well it sounds likely its a boy but little girls can get quite swollen in the genital area before and just after the birth due to hormones so wouldn't like to say for sure which is probably the reason the doctor said they was not sure.|`|zPPYGv7Daa	I have 3 boys and we always saw a penis.  But if they say 70% than I would count on a boy.  Also, infants do have swollen genitals so that very well could be a boy.  Good Luck- Boys are fun!|`|pq2q0upuaa	if it looked like this it's defiantly a boy..                                                                                               <a href="http://s614.photobucket.com/albums/tt225/codizmama/" rel="nofollow">http://s614.photobucket.com/albums/tt225...</a>|`|EDiJe38Taa	could be anything. maybe the cord is bunched up right there, maybe there is a little hand or fist in the way. my aunt was told she was having a boy and she had a girl. so you never know.|`|vg1i8HATaa	I had multiple ultrasounds and they were sure it was a girl, but wouldnt tell me for certain...100% anything.  they were afraid I'd go buy stuff and blame them if they were wrong for any reason.  They just dont want the liability|`|zk1FSXcIaa	I had a boy and what you are describing is the very same as what my son looked like.  <br>  <br>  However, your doctor can never be 100% sure.  What if what they are seeing up through your child's legs is the umbilical cord?  That has happened to people before.  Sometimes the ultrasound picture isn't clear enough, especially at only 20 weeks (they made me wait until 22 by the way).  You can ask your doctor to do another ultrasound at 28ish weeks to be double sure.  They also do those great 4-D ultrasounds now, but they aren't considered medically necessary so you have to pay for them yourself.  It's a wonderful Mother's Day gift though so you could ask your family about having that done if it's something you're interested in.
E2e485WRaa	Implantation bleeding occurs in less than 30% of pregnancies.  <br>  <br>  There is no way at all on Monday you would have pregnancy symptoms from having sex on Saturday.  The egg would be fertilized on the day you ovulated (the day of conception). It takes the fertilized egg around a week and up to 10 days to implant into the uterus. Once the egg is implanted then your body starts releasing pregnancy hormones HCG. Prior to implantation you are not pregnant. Prior to implantation your body does not even know that you conceived.<br>  It takes a while for the HCG to build in your system. Your body's reaction to HCG is what causes pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  Home pregnancy test look for HCG to conclude pregnancy. You must have enough HCG in your urine to register a positive. There is no point in taking home pregnancy tests prior to when your period should be arriving. It is a waste of money and sanity because there is always the possibility you could be pregnant and it is not registering because you don't have enough HCG in your system yet. When you do take a home pregnancy test, use your first morning's urine. It contains the highest level of HCG.<br>  <br>  Most women do not experience pregnancy symptoms until they are six weeks pregnant. Some feel it as early as four weeks pregnant - but that would still be at least 28 days into your cycle. And this only pertains to women who ovulate before cycle day 16.<br>  <br>  If you do not want to become pregnant, you have to use protection each time your boyfriend inserts his penis into your vagina.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Very few women have implantation bleeding.  I never had it and don't know anyone that has.  It usually occurs 5-10 days after sex or around the same time your period is due.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	You're right; it is WAY too soon for any signs or symptoms of pregnancy.  No, not every woman experiences implantation bleeding.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	10 days after fertilization. <br>  <br>  Not everyone gets implantation bleeding.<br>  I never did. <br>  4 pregnancies.|`|Coc593Ikaa	It takes about 5-12 days to happen. And the majority of women do not get implantation bleeding. So not getting any doesn't mean anything!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	No it does not always happen.<br>  <br>  so you can be pregnant without having implantation bleeding.|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	I never had implantation bleeding and I have been pregnant three times.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Implantation spotting only effects about 30% of women, it is completely normal to not have it, and you could still be pregnant if you didn't get it.  But if you just had sex on Saturday, you would not feel symptoms yet.  The day you ovulate is the day conception will occur, so that may not have even happened yet....since sperm can live inside you for up to 7 days, you could ovulate tomorrow and get pregnant then.  And then it takes another 6-12 days past ovulation to implant, and that is when you will feel symptoms.  So if your period is late then take a test.  I wouldn't worry now, its too early.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|2ObqoJbKaa	No, implantation doesn't happen for all women who are pregnant. Actually the majority of women don't get implantation bleeding. I think the percentage is some where under 50%. So you could definetly still be pregnant if you don't get this.If you do get it, it would probably happen about a week or two before your expected period. I would just wait to see if you get your next period and if you don't, then take a test. good luck.|`|6nn7f41Faa	Not necessarily. I've had 4 pregnancies, only one occured with implantation bleeding. It happened 3 days before I expected my period. Implantation occurs 7-10 days post ovulation, and if implantation bleeding occurs, it happens a few days before or the day of your expected period. It is commonly mistaken for a light period. It will be brown or light pink in appearance, rarely red.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I lost that pregnancy, but have 2 beautiful babies from my two successful pregnancies.<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding does not happen to every woman or in every pregnancy.|`|hORVMOHKaa	nope i didnt have any implantation bleeding at all, and im pregnant! so yes you could be pregnant wait until you miss a period then take the test with the first morning urine (it has highest HCG levels)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|NCcpjBL5aa	I have never had implantation bleeding, as far as i was aware it's actually quite rare.

It was funny.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	In general nothing happens.<br>  <br>  Some women have leakage from the extra holes, its possible a few end up with a duct that's not connected to a hole because of scar tissue but that duct will either stop making milk or more likely as has been shown by moms who have had breast surgery and had all the ducts cut the ducts will "recannalize" over time and come out a different place.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVJunJul99p64.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVJun...</a><br>  Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaton, Roman Centurions and some Victorian society women have a striking connection with many mothers of today. The tie that binds them is body piercing: each has pierced a navel or a nipple.<br>  <br>  Body piercing has enjoyed a resurgence over the past 20 years. People young and old are piercing their eyebrows, noses, navels, lips, tongues, genitals, hands and nipples. Leaders working with breastfeeding women are seeing more mothers with pierced nipples. Phone log entries reflect this trend as calls from women curious about the effect of nipple piercing on breastfeeding continue to increase.<br>  <br>  Is there breastfeeding after nipple piercing? The BREASTFEEDING ANSWER BOOK asserts that there is no evidence to show nipple piercing has any effect on a woman's ability to breastfeed. Self-proclaimed "Hip Mama" Arid Gore agrees. In her book, The Hip Mama Survival Guide, Gore offers suggestions for pierced breastfeeding mothers. "Remove nipple rings and seek advice from a reputable organization like La Leche League for help and support with breastfeeding."<br>  <br>  Mita Saldana, a professional body piercer with the Chicago-based studio, Body Basics, says she's pierced many nipples and has never had a complaint about problems with breastfeeding. Many of Saldana's clients are also friends. This affords her a unique vantage point from which to observe these women from the moment of a piercing, through the healing process, to life with a pierced nipple. One of Saldana's clients, a piercer herself, had her nipples pierced and went on to breastfeed. "She had no problems." said Saldana. Most nipples are pierced horizontally though some clients prefer a vertical piercing. Horizontal piercing seems better suited for breastfeeding according to Elisabeth Speller, an Australian lactation consultant.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding has been around since the dawn of time: body modification also has a long history. Some of the body piercing dates back to 1400 BC. Throughout history women and men have pierced their nipples for religious or spiritual reasons, beautification, decoration, protection, social rank or status. Today, according to many sources, nipple piercing seems to have two primary functions, beautification and sexual stimulation. "The piercing of the nipple is sensual, attractive and often encourages the nipple to become larger, more pronounced and more sensitive," according to Gauntlet, Inc. a professiona<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeedingbasics.com/html/ask/pierced.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeedingbasics.com/html/...</a><br>   There is no evidence that pierced nipples will affect your ability to breastfeed. Your breasts will still produce adequate milk for your baby, and unless your body rejected the piercing right after you had it done, there is no reason to anticipate any additional problems with infection. Horizontal piercings are more common than vertical, and seem to be more compatible with nursing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/newborn/nbreastfeed/0,,3x0z,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/newborn/nb...</a><br>   Nipple rings may increase nipple sensitivity. This, along with scarring could theoretically cause some discomfort that is not normally present for the nursing mom. There have also been reports of leaking of milk from the pierced area.<br>  <br>  For a woman who continues to wear a nipple ring, it would be wise to remove prior to nursing her baby. If the nipple ring is not removed prior to breastfeeding, choking could occur<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bfar.org/prepare.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bfar.org/prepare.php</a><br>    The amount of milk you will have then will be dependent on the number of connected ducts and state of the nerves that affect lactation.  The glands connected to the ducts that were severed during the surgery will produce milk initially, but because the milk cannot get out, they will gradually stop making milk and will atrophy over the first two weeks.  You will probably experience the some engorgement as a result, in addition to the normal fullness when the milk comes in around the fourth day.  After the engorgement stage is over and the glands have atrophied, your milk production will be dependent on the glands connected to the intact ducts.  If they cannot produce enough milk initially, there is much that can be done produce more.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	I work on a maternity ward... they have to take the piercing out or it would become very painfull when the breasts get engorged. It is also a choking hazard for the baby. As for people who have had piercings and just have a scar..it doesnt seem to impair breastfeeding too much. There are hundreds of milk duct openings.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	I also had milk coming out of both the normal opening and the piercing holes.|`|u4FIwBNWaa	My was normal, He actually preferred that nipple I think because the scar tissue made it bigger then the one that wasnt pierced.  Milk comes out just fine.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would say other than removing the rings while feeding, so there are no choking hazards, most should be able to breastfeed...i can't imagine that much scar tissue with the way they are done unless they have been really infected or pierced multiple times.....my stepmom had a nipple piercing and she bfed my sis just fine...|`|DDIBEvUTaa	it comes out the holes and the regular way.

sYsfI856aa	Your uterus doesn't come up from behind the pelvic bone til usually around 12 weeks, so any "showing" is probably just bloating or weight gain. You'll notice weight gain around your hips, thighs, breasts, face, stomach, etc.. long before you actually start to show. Most women don't start showing in their first pregnancy until 18 weeks or more. I know some girls who didn't show until 25 weeks and they were tiny girls.<br>  <br>  But for the fun of things, if you can suck your belly in, it's just bloating, if you can't get rid of the bump by sucking in ((besides the normal flab some of us have anyways) then it's the baby showing! It's fun and exciting when you begin to show, but then you also start getting the "looks" (is she or isn't she) then when you get bigger it's the random hands that touch your stomach. <br>  <br>  So rule of thumb, if it's before 16-20 weeks, it's most likely just bloating and weight gain if it's a first time pregnancy. 2nd or 3rd..etc.. You can show as early as 12 weeks!|`|A1S5KNUkaa	I'm pregnant with number 3 and I started showing (noticeably) at 10 weeks.  I knew I was showing because I know my own body but bloating will generally subside whereas when you're showing it won't.|`|cFktUueyaa	Womenshealthcaretopics.com has taught me that some women, esp women who had had children before, will start to show as early as 6 weeks. if this is your first pregnancy, then most likely it's bloating, but if this isn't , then you are prob showing. It all depends. No one knows your body like you, so go with what ya know!|`|EDiJe38Taa	you generally don't show until after the first trimester. i didn't show until month 5. so if you are 8 weeks pregnant and think you are showing, you are probably just bloated.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	i started to show at about 2 months.. everyone is different.. you could be bloated or you could be  showing.. depends. ask you doc|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	You won't show right away, but when you do show, your stomach is typically harder feeling than soft.
CpiLHcTlaa	oh god i would give anything to have had that option. i had a c-section.<br>  <br>  longer recovery and very painful coughing or laughing hurt so much i would cry for the first week. <br>  it can get infected which mine did and now i get skin infections all the time. <br>  you may have no choice but to have another one<br>  its harder to take care of your baby right after. <br>  breast feeding give you contractions and with c-sections it hurts a lot.<br>  your stuck in the hospital for 3-5 days after. <br>  i had and i know a lot of women have a feeling of not being fulfilled or "failing" somehow because they didn't push they're babies out.<br>  <br>  honestly... just have it vaginally. it sounds scary but honesty... you'll feel better about it. i wish i could go back and insist on having my son normally. they pushed and scared me with things threw things around like 30 hour labor. still may need a c-section. he's to big. induction may not work for you.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Well, it's not your choice.  Dr's most often won't do a C-section unless it's medically necessary.  Insurance and/or state won't cover it unless it's necessary, also.<br>  Longer healing time, high risk of complications such as infection, you don't get to hold your baby right away, more pain, higher risk of complication with subsequent pregnancies, not to mention the scar you get.  <br>  My son is 5 and a half months and I still have both pain and numbness at the site of my incision.<br>  Sorry, but I am crossing my fingers for you to have a vaginal delivery.|`|ksoMldqYaa	Why not?  C-sections are major surgery and there is a greater risk of harm to you, it takes longer to recover and is very painful while healing.  I used to think I wanted a c-section as well, but after researching it I hope I don't need one!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	longer recover time. <br>  Complications with surgery<br>  bleeding related death<br>  infection <br>  etc.<br>  <br>  LOL it's cute how you think you can decide. You do vaginally unless the obgyn says you cant. <br>  <br>  Cute though.|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	Why would you not want to deliver you baby vaginally? Kind of odd...lol @ kelley, Thats EXACTLY what I was thinking...selfish much?<br>  <br>  Extra risks associated with cesarean section: Current research suggests that cesarean section has the following disadvantages in comparison with vaginal birth: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Physical problems in mothers: Compared with vaginal birth, cesarean section increases a woman's risk for a number of physical problems. These range from less common but potentially life-threatening problems, including hemorrhage (severe bleeding), blood clots, and bowel obstruction, to much more common concerns such as longer-lasting and more severe pain and infection. Even after recovery from surgery, scarring and adhesion tissue increase risk for ongoing pelvic pain and for twisted bowel. <br>  Hospitalization of mothers: If a woman has a cesarean, she is more likely to stay in the hospital longer and is at greater risk of being re-hospitalized. <br>  Emotional well-being of mothers: A woman who has a cesarean section may be at greater risk for poorer overall mental health and some emotional problems. She is also more likely to rate her birth experience poorer than a woman who has had a vaginal birth. <br>  Early contact with, feelings toward babies: A woman who has a cesarean usually has less early contact with her baby and is more likely to have initial negative feelings about her baby. <br>  Breastfeeding: Recovery from surgery poses challenges for getting breastfeeding under way, and a baby who was born by cesarean is less likely to be breastfed and get the benefits of breastfeeding. <br>  Health of babies: Babies born by cesarean are more likely to: <br>  be cut during the surgery (usually minor) <br>  have breathing difficulties around the time of birth <br>  experience asthma in childhood and in adulthood. <br>  Future reproductive problems for mothers: A cesarean section in this pregnancy puts a woman at risk for future reproductive problems in comparison with a woman who has a vaginal birth. These problems may involve serious complications and medical emergencies. The likelihood of experiencing some of these conditions goes up sharply as the number of previous cesareans increases. These problems include: <br>  ectopic pregnancy: pregnancies that develop outside her uterus or within the scar <br>  reduced fertility, due to either less ability to become pregnant again or less desire to do so <br>  placenta previa: the placenta attaches near or over the opening to her cervix <br>  placenta accreta: the placenta grows through the lining of the uterus and into or through the muscle of the uterus <br>  placental abruption: the placenta detaches from the uterus before the baby is born <br>  rupture of the uterus: the uterine scar gives way during pregnancy or labor. <br>  Concerns about babies in future pregnancies: A cesarean section in this pregnancy can affect the babies of future pregnancies. Studies have found that they are more likely to: <br>  be born too early (preterm) <br>  weigh less than they should (low birthweight) <br>  have a physical abnormality or injury to their brain or spinal cord <br>  die before or shortly after the birth <br>  Planned cesarean compared with unplanned cesarean: A planned cesarean offers some advantages over an unplanned cesarean (a cesarean that occurs after labor is under way). For example, there may be fewer surgical injuries and fewer infections. The emotional impact of a cesarean that is planned in advance appears to be similar to or somewhat worse than a vaginal birth. By contrast, unplanned cesareans can take a greater emotional toll. <br>  Planned cesarean compared with vaginal birth: A planned cesarean still involves the risks associated with major surgery. And both planned and unplanned cesareans result in a uterine scar and internal scarring (adhesions). This means women with planned and unplanned cesareans face similar risks in future pregnancies and for problems related to scarring and adhesions at any time <br>  Extra risks associated with vaginal birth: In a few areas, mothers or babies with vaginal birth have poorer outcomes in comparison with cesarean birth. <br>  <br>  <br>  Perineal pain: While a woman with a cesarean birth is more likely to experience more intense and longer-lasting pain overall, a woman with a vaginal birth is more likely to experience pain in the vaginal area in the weeks and months after birth. <br>  Incontinence: A woman with a vaginal birth is more likely to leak urine (urinary incontinence) and to leak gas or, more rarely, feces (bowel incontinence). Pregnancy itself and other factors such as the woman's weight play a role in these problems. Few women experience troubling symptoms beyond the recovery period in the weeks and months after birth. <br>  Nerve injury in babies: In comparison with a baby born by cesarean section, a baby who is born vaginally is more likely to have a nerve injury that affects the shoulder, arm or hand.|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	There are many disadvantages. First of all, it is an amazing experience! Also, it is a surgery, it takes a long time to heal. You are not supposed to use your stomach muscles AT ALL for several weeks. You are not even supposed to drive a car afterward! Also, if you ever decide you want to give birth naturally after that, a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) is very dangerous. In fact, most doctors won't even do it. Yes, it is quicker, and easier, but deffinately not worth it. Some women have to have one, but you shouldnt wish for it. Any type of surgery puts a lot of strain on your body. It is natural to do it that way. Why would you not want to? Unless you have a previous C Section- you cant just choose either! Just think it through, but there is a reason our bodies were made the way they are! Good luck!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	For mom:<br>  <br>  Infection: Infection can occur at the incision site, in the uterus and in other pelvic organs such as the bladder. <br>  <br>  Hemorrhage or increased blood loss: There is more blood loss in a cesarean delivery than with a vaginal delivery. This can lead to anemia or a blood transfusion (1 to 6 women per 100 require a blood transfusion1). <br>  <br>  Injury to organs: Possible injury to organs such as the bowel or bladder (2 per 1002). <br>  <br>  Adhesions: Scar tissue may form inside the pelvic region causing blockage and pain. This can also lead to future pregnancy complication such as placenta previa or placental abruption3. <br>  <br>  Extended hospital stay: After a cesarean, the normal time in the hospital is 3-5 days after giving birth if there are no complications. <br>  <br>  Extended recovery time: The amount of time needed for recovery after a cesarean can extend from weeks to months, having an impact on bonding time with your baby (1 in 14 report incisional pain six months or more after surgery4).<br>   <br>  Reactions to medications: There can be a negative reaction to the anesthesia given during a cesarean or reaction to pain medication given after the procedure.<br>   <br>  Risk of additional surgeries: Such as hysterectomy, bladder repair or another cesarean. <br>  <br>  Maternal mortality: The maternal mortality rate for a cesarean is greater than with a vaginal birth. <br>  <br>  Emotional reactions: Women who have a cesarean report feeling negatively about their birth experience and may have trouble with initial bonding with their baby5. <br>  <br>  For baby:<br>  <br>  Premature birth: If gestational age was not calculated correctly, a baby delivered by cesarean could be delivered too early and be low birth weight6. <br>  <br>  Breathing problems: When delivered by cesarean, a baby is more likely to have breathing and respiratory difficulties. Some studies show an increased need for assistance with breathing and immediate care after a cesarean than with a vaginal delivery7. <br>  <br>  Low APGAR scores: Low APGAR scores can be the result of anesthesia, fetal distress before the delivery or lack of stimulation during delivery (vaginal birth provides natural stimulation to the baby while in the birth canal). Babies born by cesarean are 50% more likely to have lower APGAR scores than those born vaginally8. <br>  <br>  Fetal injury: Very rarely, the baby may be nicked or cut during the incision (1 to 2 babies per 100 will be cut during the surgery9). <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/cesareanrisks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornb...</a>|`|ggETPqedaa	I had a c-section, I had migraines after wards.

I had contractions all day for a couple hours about every 5 to 10 mins apart and then they would go away for a couple hours.  <br>  The next day I went back to hospital they had me walk for two hours and I was dilated to 5 and 80%.

It really does work, but I will tell you now walking will make ur contractions way more painful but just keep walking and it will happen  GOOD LUCK|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	go to the er...even if they send you back...you never know!!!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	How far along are you?? You are probably just having braxton hicks contractions. Your "real" contractions dont just stop. Give more info.|`|QTfTVWmZaa	I had a similar thing happen to me about a week ago. I went to the doctor had a sweep and all night I was having contractions 8-10 minutes apart. I called L&D and they said it wasn't labor...yet. Mine also stopped. I am now being induced tomorrow, so Good Luck to you maybe they will start again soon and maybe not. If they do you could try walking to make things move along a little faster :]]|`|2wdVqIc7aa	Ok, first of all, how far along are you? What do you mean by a show? You could be having Braxton-Hicks contractions which hurt (like pressure) a little and are very natural. I know everyone says this, but you will know when its for real. Those pains are PAINS, not just tightening. Listen to your body. If in doubt go to the hospital, the worst they will do is send you home and tell you to come back in a few hours.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You're probably getting closer to real labor, but when the contractions have stopped and you don't think your water has broken, going to the hospital will just get you sent home.<br>  <br>  Relax, your baby is probably coming soon.
33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Yeah that would push me over the edge too, even if I wasn't pregnant.  Don't beat yourself up over feeling this way!  <br>  <br>  Is there any way they could stay with other family members for awhile?  How long are they planning on staying?  The last thing you need to deal with is house guests and a newborn!<br>  <br>  Maybe tell your hubby you need a break and you need your house back.  Ugh I don't blame you for being so irritated by this!|`|QSodlfMraa	you just want some time with your husband and that is understandable and they should understand where you are coming from and give you guys some space for yourself,  ask your hubby to suggest them going out and give you 2 some time to yourself.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	YOU ARE NOT SELFISH the thought of having others live with me would make me sick<br>  tell your hubby they have a month to leave and tell her how you feel about the attetion<br>  my sil loves attention 2 <br>  i just tol dmy hubby no more lol|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	No, I don't think you are being selfish. I know that its hard to live with someone and you want that alone time. If they are going to be there longer, maybe try to calmly explain what you are feeling, and that it has nothing to do with them being there, you just want a little time to yourself, so if they can leave the house for a few hours or if you and your hubby can get out and just be alone and relax, it does a world of good.|`|8zvGi6yNaa	I think its normal...when I was about 6 months pregnant...my bf's sister came to stay with her 2 young daughters....at first I dealt with the situation but after a while I was irritated and jealous and would go sit in the back yard to ne alone...In my opinion(I am no professional)but i think the way you are feeling is normal and probably intensified by the pregnancy!<br>  Try talking to your hubby about it...it cant hurt to tell him how your feeling....and just find a happy place(which your hole home should be)where you can go to be alone for a little while....In my opinion we all need a little me time!<br>  Oh and Congratulations on the baby....I wish you and your hubby well!|`|WsUSAgLmaa	OMG....I am so with you right now Im 32 weeks and others peoples kids drive me crazy including my 3 yr old who just keeps testing me right now!!! Talk to your husband and see if there is anything you guys can work out so maybe the go stay sumwhere else some nights or on weekends...so you can have your time!! R u having a girl? Cause I am and I have been so evil just wanting to be alone and not bothered with people or kids!!!|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Yes, I would consider this normal. Why are they staying with you for so long? Is there anywhere else they can go? Maybe you should talk with them and let them know you need more time to yourself and with your hubby. At least that's what I would do. Just leaving and fuming by yourself and not voicing your opinion to the people who can change it does nothing, and you're stuck with the same situation.|`|wE44NUPuaa	well it is normal really yes you do want to be with your husband before the baby comes so try to send them out for a little on a family vacation or  treat them to a nice dinner for a couple of hours|`|LAyigK5Aaa	That's perfectly fine! It's normal to want to be alone with the hubby right before another whiny child comes into the pic! :) lol. If ur hubby's brother and sis-in-law have a kid then they should understand too. Mention something u deserve it! Good luck! :)|`|2wdVqIc7aa	First of all, the way your feeling is perfectly normal. And they are your feelings and your entitled to feel them. Tell your husband and maybe the 2 of you can go get a hotel room to get some privacy. Another things is that even though its rushing you a little bit an annoying 2 year old is something you will have to put up with soon. And its really not better when its your own...they annoy you just as much. You need to talk to your husband and then get some alone time. You will be ok, the hormones settle down I promise. :)|`|5DWJ0jZ9aa	I completely understand how you're feeling.  I am 9 months now, but I did go through alot of times where anything that took my husband's attention besides myself or the baby made me feel really neglected.  What you're feeling is very normal.  My suggestion would be to have a talk with your hubby and explain the way that you're feeling, and let him know what he can do to help you... maybe there can be certain times arranged when you and him can have some time alone, and the in-laws can have outings to give you some time by yourself?  Bottom line is that you need to be happy for the baby.  <br>  Good luck with everything!|`|7UfuqGmcaa	Actually, I think you are so right.  I would be ticked off if I were in your situation.<br>  <br>  You are not being over sensitive, you are sane that's all.<br>  <br>  Talk to your husband and explain your point of view to him, tell him how you long to be alone with him before the arrival of your baby, and how the little one is annoying the hell out of you.<br>  <br>  Try to work out an alternative solution with your husband regarding the housing situation you are currently facing with your husband's brother.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZZztSumhaa	I am right with you now! Im a little over five months also and i have four other kids that are just driving me off the edge! My 13 year old son Kyle, my 11 year old daughter Blake, my 9 year old daughter Fallon and my 6 year old son Andrew are driving me NUTS! I know how hard it is to say somthing because you love them so much but heres what i did. I sat my kids down and explained to them all that this pregnancy is not going well for me and i dont feel good at all and when they were in my tummy i gave them all love and attention and now this baby needs its love and attention. Surprisingly they took to it very well. I think thats what you should do with your husbands family.<br>  Best of luck!|`|azE51WGRaa	I absolutely agree that you need this time to be with your husband before the baby comes. It doesn't have to be every waking second but some time would be nice. It's YOUR house! I understand you don't want to be rude but there's a fine line between being gracious and being taken advantage of and I think your hubby's brother and his family have crossed it. Tell them that you want some alone time with your hubby! Stand up for yourself! Have them go visit friends or other family members so that you and your husband can have some time alone. If this is somehow undo-able, then arrange for you and your husband to go on a date or do something special that involves just the two of you. I hope your situation gets better. (Also one word of advice: I know that 2 year old is driving you nuts but just remember that one day you're baby will be that 2 year old that's driving you nuts) =D|`|7CGyyjiCaa	I think your feelings are very natural, however your visitors must have received an invitation to visit, perhaps before your pregnancy.  While your husband must enjoy having his brother and family visiting, I think you must find a quiet moment to tell your hubby exactly what you are feeling, explain to him that it is probably your hormones making your feelings so strong.  Ask him if he can see any way of giving you some time as just an expectant married couple as this will be the only time you can have this, any future pregnancies you will already be a family, there will never be just the two of you again for quite a number of years.<br>  Ask him to talk to his brother about the change in circumstances and ask him if he remembers the special moments he and his wife had when expecting their little girl.<br>  If there is no way your visitors can move on, perhaps they can go on outings which give you regular twosome time and quiet time will be more and more important as your pregnancy advances.<br>  <br>  Just read your additional details - same advice but go directly to your sister-in-law.|`|OCBY1AEUaa	Its perfectly understandable, After your baby is born your not going to have the same type of alone time ever again. Why did your husbands brother's family come over for 6 months? did they have some sort of emergency?? i dont understand that but either way i would suggest talking to your husband and tell him that you love his brother's family but you would really appreciate having alone time with him so yall two can bond and just enjoy eachothers company. Tell him that this is really improtant to you and see if he can talk to his brother and have them let yall have your alone time as a couple. <br>  Hopefully this helps!
b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	I am assuming that you have taken her to the doctor.  The medication the doc prescribed takes a day or two to work.|`|85vDqn6naa	Dr. visit, antibiotics i believe, it is basically a yeast infection in the mouth, poor baby hope she feels better soon|`|OmJfYPptaa	My 2 month old did to. They gave her a antibiotic called niastation and in a day or 2 she was better. Poor little baby! Hope she gets better.
WsUSAgLmaa	I tested it at about 4 weeks with a condom but I couldnt do it.....I was scared....but i also didnt have stitches or anything so...wat im basically saying is wait til your comfy or til your checkup and then have sex...<br>  BTW....when i finally did a 6 weeks it was great!! Like startin all over again...LOL|`|Pu7DgwWmaa	YOU HAVE TO WAIT THREE MOTHS BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT CAN OPEN. UR STITCHES ARE SENSIBLE RIGHT NOW SO I RECOMMEND U TO WAIT. GOOD LUCK N CONGRATULATIONS 4 THE BABY|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	you are the only one who can tell if your ready or not.. dont do it if your not comfortable yet... just stick to the oral for now|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	At 6 weeks you are probably healed up pretty well.  I would take it easy.  Let him know that you will tell him if you need to stop.  You will be afraid until you actually do it again.
1wQeH0hdaa	Well sooner than later you will have to put her in the cot...If you have'nt got the room then you have'nt got the room so your choices are limited anyway..|`|MR9iBgafaa	You shouldn't sleep with her on your chest.  Although the chance of cot death is now lower as she's older, she really needs to sleep in her own moses basket or cot.  It tends to be more common amongst breastfeeders to sleep with babies (I used to) but they still need to be put into their own bed, and best to do it now than later.<br>  <br>  My baby's 5 months on Wed and sleeps in her own cot in her own room since 3.5 months.  My sister made the mistake of sleeping with her baby (and she wasn't even a breastfeeder) and the child's now 3 and still in my sister's bed.|`|e0d08c2181048633322f70afd6634965aa	Co-sleeping is very dangerous. Its not very good, you could crush you child! There is no guarentee you won't move during the night.<br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question I would break her into the crib gently. Lie her in it during the day for a few hours then try during the night. Make sure and wrap her up warm so she is as warm as she is with you during the night time.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Yes. If you don't now, then she'll grow up sleeping in your bed. 5 months, really? You can always make room for a crib. Put it against the wall.|`|deIzFnV8aa	It might be a good idea now.  Then when you move, she will have something familiar to sleep in; otherwise it will be two transitions at once, which will make it even harder than it may already be.<br>  <br>  If you don't have room for a crib, you could consider a travel crib type of thing. They are often quite small and can also be easily up away during the day for more room (where does she nap during the day, though?).  The main problem is having baby so low down can abe hard on the back with all the in and out you do, but some nicer ones are really just like mini cribs that raise and lower.<br>  <br>  If you do choose to move your baby to a crib now, the No Cry Sleep Solution has some good ideas on how to make baby feel comfortable there.  Putting a rolled blanket that smells of you next to baby can be very comforting to a baby who is used to having a warm parent next to them. If she sleeps well hearing your heartbeat, you might consider buying a white noise CD of that type to play while she sleeps.
2irmTjQ3aa	I never had any symptoms at all, I felt totally normal. The only way I found out I was pregnant was because I missed my period and my hpt was positive, so not having symptoms is a normal sign. The blood test will tell you for sure.<br>  Good Luck!
tMeN2fm0aa	OH YAH!!! Its your mucus plug!!! Congrads!!! You should call your midwife just to let them know that you have passed it, but also know that from this point it could be anywhere from a couple hours to a month before you go into labor (thats what my dr told me when I called after I passed mine.)  Though I went into a labor 12 hours after passing mine.  CONGRADS MAMA!!!!! Here comes your beautiful baby!!!!  <br>  <br>  Oh and Im sure you know, but just in case, the mucus plug is the plug that holds all the water in the ambiotic sack.  Once the Mucus plug is gone, the next step would be your water breaking... again CONGRADS!|`|LUbW8kTBaa	It's probably your mucus plug.  I had the same thing last Friday (I'm 36 weeks) and my doctor told me that it might be part of it, but probably not the whole thing (it wasn't bloody or anything).  I haven't had anymore discharge since Friday.  He also told me that your body is continually producing more so it's nothing to be concerned about.  He didn't even check to see if I had dilated or anything.  He said unless it's extremely bloody or has a really strong odor not to worry about it.  However, it does mean that labor is really going to be happening soon so make sure your bags are packed!  Best of luck to you and your baby!|`|azE51WGRaa	I have the same thing (I'm 37 weeks). My dr. said it was the rest of my mucus plug! I guess there can be some left over even if you pass a big clump of it. As long as it doesn't have a smelly odor (which would be sign of infection) and your water hasn't broken, you're fine. :)|`|zBAKaae8aa	sounds like mucus plug, i had the same thing.  the time is close, rest and keep a close eye on things so you get to the hospital in time.  could still be a couple days.  i lost mine about 48 hrs before both my kids were born.|`|vkuUB6lbaa	It's probably your mucus plug.   I would let your midwife know just so that she has a little bit of a gauge as to where you're at. Usually that means a baby is coming soon.  Congrats and good luck!|`|damLcZnfaa	I would not be overly concerned unless your discharge is fluid like and requires you to change your undergarments. That could signal a slow leak of amniotic fluid. As for the "snotty" discharge it is perfectly normal all throughout pregnancy and does increase in the 3 trimester. Some women experience little to none and some experience quite a bit. Just look for any tint to it which could indicate your mucus plug coming loose. You are so close to the end. Congratulations and good luck with everything...<br>  <br>  Also...I lost my mucus plug 3 weeks before I went into labor...so it could reform...Your mucus plug will be thick, firm, and tinted with blood or have a dark brown spot on it...|`|c355cddf3e75691416ab5582659d03e7aa	You're probably starting to lose your mucus plug. If you're not bleeding heavily and not having severe, abnormal pain you should be fine. Consult pregnancy books or WebMD if you're still concerned, or go ahead and call your midwife to ease your mind.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|PfIywLLyaa	Call your midwife. Could be the show.
T9SHuVVnaa	Well the big question I'm thinking is will you keep the baby?  Thats entirely up to you if you do or not but if you do decide to keep the baby then everyone will find out anyway.<br>  <br>  I dont think you should confront them, it could be seen as harrassment or bullying.  I think you should just leave it, perhaps nothing will come of it!  And I'm sure you know what its like at school and rumours, the next week they will move onto another topic.<br>  <br>  But just to be on the safe side its probably best to change your login ID so they cant know its you next time!  Good luck!|`|YZ7HOZ3raa	I would not worry about the students, if you do confront them it may seem like you do not have any authority over them. Also, people are going to find out sooner or later that you are pregnant. So just tell them yourself. I can imagine that you are pretty stressed out from finding at that you are pregnant and being a first year teacher. But you are an adult and I would just confront everything head on:) best of luck!|`|4RXrYac9aa	Let them spread it!<br>  Your the teacher they are the students. If someone confronts you saying " I've heard you pregnant?" Then Simply reply " Yes i've heard that too and I'm trying to get to the bottom of it" You are not denying or admitting anything.<br>  You have a contract so falling pregnant will not effect a thing.<br>  Enjoy your pregnancy and stop worrying its not good you know.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Jodie xxx|`|4gjPQFBDaa	Don't worry honey! Kids can be so cruel sometimes! Just chill out and if the rumours come around just deny them for now. It doesn't matter when you get pregnant - so what if it's in your first year of teaching! It's your life and your body! Just be happy about it and enjoy being pregnant! It's none of their business yet - and isn't until you leave for maternity leave! Be happy! <br>  <br>  Good Luck Sweetheart xoxox|`|saDFosWUaa	Don't worry about these students spreading it! There are many rumours around school and not many people will even believe them! Just ignore it, if you are pregnant people will find out and theres nothing you can do about it. Congratulations by the way. Everybody loves someone who's pregnant!|`|XSVw2Fpbaa	Let it happen. Kids will be kids. Your reputation will be no worse for wear. They're going to find out regardless of what you do; there's that whole... blowing up like the Hindenburg thing that you've got to cope with. Oh, and if your situation is of sufficiently unfortunate timing, you'll be out on maternity leave instead of playing the new mom game during summer break. <br>  <br>  I'd say just roll with the punches. There isn't a lot you can do to prevent them from finding out.|`|m6GveN68aa	you are a teacher and use improper grammar?  i hope my children never have you as a teacher.  no wonder why kids leave school dumber than when they entered.<br>  <br>  anyway, you are a teacher.  who cares what your students think?  and who on earth would they tell?  <br>  <br>  and why would your students know your yahoo username?  you need to separate yourself from your students a bit.  it's a bit scary.|`|hORVMOHKaa	kids will be kids let them spread it! your a grown women who cares what some teenagers think! Noone will think badly of you because your pregnant. Pregnancy is a beautiful thing!|`|sYUUKa7yaa	have a talk with them or there parents and say its not nice to make up lies or say ya i am pregnant but its none of your bees wax|`|U6YQAWbQaa	Grow Up, do your homework and get off YA|`|ctaDwSW4aa	First of all, change your screen name if you want to be anonymous. <br>  Genius!|`|w5oh9NDfaa	Wow first year teaching and you haven't got out of the high school drama yet!

You don't sound like a grown up to me.. For one thing,students aren't going to care whether you get pregnant your first or third year of teaching. Two a rumor that you might be pregnant? Any adult knows that they should speak to these students and ask them not to say anything,and explain that you're not telling people right now.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	So you ask another question about being pregnant?<br>  <br>  You an adult, if you are in a committed relationship then why shouldn't you be allowed to have children. Why should you be penalized for wanting a child?|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Do not confront anyone.  The problem may be that your FULL NAME is listed under your avatar Do you realize this? You need to pick an ANONYMOUS name and change that.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	You are hardly going to be able to hide it for long are you! They will all find out soon enough, just let them get on with it, surely its no big deal.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	a little to late for that, huh?  you need to grow up here and act like the adult you are!|`|ojNHRsj7aa	WOW<br>  <br>  i thought this was coming from a teen and was afraid of being called a slut by her peers. and afraid of their parents reaction.<br>  <br>  your a teacher dammit. <br>  the students arent going to be saying " HAHA LOOK AT HER!

I also think that you could act a bit more fun, like others your age.....<br>  You wont ruin your reputation by getting pregnant as a teacher and a adult you will be fine, you are more likely to be judged if you are a teen at school and are pregnant.<br>  The problem you have is that you try to cover yourself up and that just makes it more obvious to everyone as others have worked it out and come to us to ask.<br>  If you want to have good conformation I would suggest you use Clearblue Pregnancy Testing kit with conception indicater. <br>  By the way if you are pregnant CONGRATULATIONS, its a wonderful feeling!!!!<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  <br>  Dont worry you secret is safe with me<br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|anmbQv0Saa	Hey Miss!!!<br>  <br>  It's me again!!! Yay!! By the way we are not who you think we are, you will probably never find out who we actually are!

Duhhh!!!<br>  <br>  Okay miss judging by your previous question you do not know that you are definitely pregnant so therefore why are you being so concious and covering yourself up all the time?? There is no need to do this yet and it just draws attention to your belly area, if you didn't pull that blazer jacket thing down all the time then everyone would just think that you had put on a few pounds and be none the wiser.<br>  <br>  Anyway who cares what other teachers think I mean quite a few teachers have recently been on maternity leave.<br>  <br>  So miss your secret is safe with us for now.<br>  <br>  xxxx|`|jkDawQVNaa	don't worry about them , your child will be here and you won't hide him/her would you  be proud of it! plus what happens when your belly gets big? then what? don't worry about those kids the only reputation you should care about is making sure these kids learn there daily lesson and that your unborn child is well nourished thought out the pregnancy don't stress over school kids there job is to make teachers go crazy don't let them scare you just go about your day the same as you would before all of this! Good luck && congrats
1fjhg6j4aa	Go to a specialty lingerie shop and have a bra professionally fitted.  They will help you find one with enough support to help your back.  I had the same problem when I was pregnant.  I was 5'2" tall and 118 pounds with the same bra size as you while pregnant.|`|Dgx1S84daa	Make sure your bra is super-supportive.  Get yourself fitted and get a good (usually more pricy) bra.  If you have done that: ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  There are pain meds you can take while pregnant, but your doctor is more qualified than I to tell you which ones would be more beneficial.  Also, you could have someone give you a massage.  Just remember to lie on your side.  Also, lying on a heating pad or one of those rice bags (you can find them on Etsy or Ebay) that you can heat in the microwave for an hour or so at different times each day can help.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, once you hit your third trimester, your hormones will balance out a bit and your breasts will drop down in size.  The first two trimesters are particularly rough as far as your body changing in wild and crazy ways.  Feel better soon.|`|QUtrCPcoaa	Im sure you already know that it is perfectly normal that your breast are quite large, its a sign that your mammary glands are enlarging and getting ready for breast feeding. <br>  <br>  As far as your back pain, avoid taking any pain killer medications, because it can potentially cause harm to your baby. Avoid slouching, and practice good posture. Try to wear heals, MILD walk to help strengthen your muscle helps (but nothing intense).  Proper rest and not leaning into your stomach can also help. and of course a back massage can never hurt ;) <br>  <br>  But if your back pains are extremely bad i advise you go talk to your  doctor because it can be cause by something else. Sometimes back pains can actually be cause by UTI, which is quite common in pregnant  women.<br>  <br>  i hope it helps =)|`|778d4ea8e4fd14d8ffe5d9e08e94db51aa	Honestly, that is a lot to grow in 16 weeks!  With the knots, get a massage from your partner, or seek a spa that does prenatal massages (THEY'RE GREAT!)  Also finding a good bra should help.  I recommend Motherhood Maternity.  They are decently priced and have great bra's for mommy's and mommy-to-be's!  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|hpTstbRraa	i didn't realize there was a size E dang i feel seriously sorry for you thats to skinny for boobs that large..|`|oeat6boAaa	I would make someone give you back rubs!  but that is only temporary try your doctor :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|id2FPhpAaa	can i see the pictures to give you a better diagnostic|`|9CbMqw9haa	first u need to make sure u have correct fitting bra it makes da world of difference x|`|QDQIvBveaa	wow!<br>  wow!<br>  thats huge (the boobs)<br>  but its ok<br>  you might want to get checked out or something|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	rock on big breasts with pregnancy!  with my first child i did the same thing.  i would put on a regular bra fit to me via victoria's secret or just trial and error at walmart.  then, i put on a sports bra over it to support all of it.  alot of work but it helped with all the change in the weight up front.|`|xwZV9jgPaa	hot showers, just let the water run off the front of you. and even tho it isn't pleasant you may have to release some of the built up milk, but just know the more you try to get rid of the more it will keep producing. Maybe buy a back brace, they make ones for pregnant women that wraps around your lower back and shoulders and crosses around under you belly so it help support the weight.|`|JWNzoksmaa	i would suggest you go get prenatal spa massages...if that's just financially undo-able....i would suggest warm baths and a heating pad...and convince your hubby to give you a back massage.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you have insurance..go to the chiropractor.|`|eTBfsjCUaa	Your doctor should be able to give you something light for the pain....the same thing happened to my cousins gf and she got something.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	Honey, I am naturally a 36H and mine have gotten even bigger!!!
FgAPXhVRaa	I am a pregnant nanny! Lol! I work VERY long hours 5 days a week! Only one child though, 16 month old boy. I have been with him since he was 2 months old. I told my employers that I was pregnant when I was in the clear of a miscarriage. They were shocked, but when I told them my only choice was to keep it and they were welcome to do what they felt they needed to do, they kept me on. I plan to work till 2 weeks before my due date. I will say that the only real trouble that I have had is going to doctor's appointments. Both parents work ALL the time and have a hard time accommodating me. If your employers  agree make sure that they are willing to let you take the time off for the appointments because the stress of arguing about the times and such is not worth the job! Trust me. They finally are getting a little better BUT I am 7 months. If they are willing to work with you then keep the job. If I had the help of someone else I would have probably quit but my boyfriend, who is now my ex really, walked out on me and my little girl when I told him I was pregnant. Anyway, I would keep you on. It has not affected my job performance, except that I am a little slower now lol... and I waddle a little bit. Other than that, it's the same. Good luck and hope that if you are having a baby, which btw CONGRATS, they keep you on!!!|`|AA11220327	i would not have a problem with it, i think i would be glad to know that the woman that cares for my children wants children of her own. they cant legally fire you because you dont share their religious beliefs.|`|Xcyaju2vaa	You seem like a very intelligent woman. I would say that you may be over thinking the whole issue right now tho. I understand planning ahead and all that...however, I would suggest that you pull back a little...breathe deeply and take things more  slowly. Things do happen for a reason-you are right. So just live 24 hrs at a time and keep saying to yourself.."everything will work out and it is OK". Good luck to you!|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	I am also a nanny to 2 children.  I am married, and 25 weeks pregnant.  The family I work for is just panicked about finding someone to take care of the kids for the summer.  I have actually gone to interview prospective caregivers with their mom.  Firing me never entered their mind.  If that is what they are going to do, then fine.  You will be able to find something else.  Good luck.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i personally wouldnt care but i think you should confirm if you are even pregnant to begin with before you start worrying about all these questions.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	You're an adult if you want to start a family that is fine. An employer should not discriminate with that. Now the brining your baby to work with you may be the issue this is something that you and the family would have to discuss. I wouldn't care as long as my kids were still  being well taken care of.|`|xGedX2rIaa	i wouldnt fire you, i think its fine for you to be pregnant. Plus they cant fire you because you are pregnant, its illegal.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	I would not fire you. Maybe if you were still in high school or under 18 then yes I would, but you are 22 and in a relationship, they have no good reason to fire you.<br>  Good Luck!
LTTips1vaa	The amount of pain with an episiotomy depends upon how much it tore.  I had to two natural tears with my labor.  The first was classified as a 3rd degree which means it went into the muscle.  Well into the muscle means that every time you move your going to feel it more.  The second tear was a 2nd degree at that was a walk in a park.  Time of healing will vary with severity and just on individual healing process.  <br>  <br>  Couple tips are to do a sitz bath.  Make sure you do the warm water pericare wash after urinating.  The urine will make it burn!!  After rinsing spray with Dermaplast spray (it numbs the area and cools it off!!_)Also as silly as this sounds squeeze you but cheeks together when sitting down.  This will tighten the muscle around the stitches and results in the skin not being pulled around the stitches because the muscle is contracted!  I swear that was a life saver!|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	I always thought an episiotomy was better, but I found out that it is not. Your body, if necessary, will naturally "tear". When it happens naturally, it recovers quicker. I tore when I had my daughter, after LOADS AND LOADS of research, childbirth class, talks with my doctor and the fact the my baby's grandma delivers babies, I told them not to do an episiotomy unless medically necessary. Does a tear hurt less afterwards?, Not really. Either way it will hurt for a while afterwards, but a natural tear will heal much quicker.|`|j9RFYcKaaa	Talk to your doctor. I told mine that I didn't want an episiotomy unless it was absolutely necessary (like in a vacuum assisted delivery). I was told that most doctors don't even do that anymore. I tore a tiny bit (three stitches) on the inside and it healed a lot better than friends of mine that had the procedure routinely done. I was really scared of it too. I am pregnant again and I am going to tell my doctor the same thing. Maybe you will be lucky and just have a small natural tear. I believe it is best if the episiotomy can be avoided.|`|AA11709911	I have had 2 children and I can tell you my BIGGEST fear with the first one was the episiotomy.  But, I lived through it and it really isn't that big of a deal.|`|OmJfYPptaa	It hurt and it was hard to walk but i am fine now.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I never had an episiotomy but I had natural tearing. While it is a little painful it does not cause permanent damage. You just have to be careful when going to the bathroom.<br>  Sitz baths helped me a lot in recovery.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Mine didn't., but it hurt while the stitches healed. Took a few days. No more than 6.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Assuming you just delivered: <br>  You should be just fine. : ) <br>  Think about it: you just pushed out this big ole baby through a small space and also had to be cut to finish the work. Of course, you're going to be sore or hurting for some time. It'll begin to heal over time - maybe a week or so of being sore.. <br>  <br>  No there shouldn't be any problems or long term damage. It's just a suture that dissolves and will heal as any other cut. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	It depends.I never really had any problems and I had two.Hopefully the doctor does a good job and you don't tear.|`|230NbPVUaa	Yes do some research on pernium massages this will help, and use Tucks and a antiseptic spray afterwards,. good luck|`|pfNnuD5saa	Mine was a little sore, like chaffing. Healed very quick. Use tucks pads.
Fei8s7vdaa	I used it a few times...it is meant to be more of a backup when used with another method...however...it ended up giving me a BAD yeast infection, so I said goodbye to it.  If you have a vagina built like iron, maybe you can handle it better, but it was pretty nasty.    Didn't become pregnant though.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Yes, I tired it and it made my husbands penis hurt, he had sharp pain after he peed for 2 weeks we went to the doctor as soon as he had the odd pain and she told us it was from our Vaginal Contraceptive Foam <br>  We stopped using it. She also informed us that it was not as accurate as it claimed to be|`|AA11220327	we used it for about a year and never got pregnant with it. it worked for us, but it may not work for everyone.|`|IW3jmnKbaa	Just use Cool Whip, nothing can live in it, and it tastes better too.|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	Well I haven't used it but Foam,pills and condoms aren't Fort Knox so its possible with each.
WxQFe0GYaa	My boy is going to be 9 months in a week.  He is formula fed.  He has bottles for breakfast, lunch, dinner and right before bed.  With his breakfast, lunch, and dinner bottles, he has solid food.  <br>  <br>  For breakfast, he'll have a fruit, like banana or pear or apple, sometimes with rice cereal or some sweet potato.  Or he'll have egg yolks.<br>  <br>  For lunch, today he had chicken and pastina (the little star shaped pasta.)  Other foods he has are turkey, carrots, peas, green beans, corn, etc. etc.  <br>  <br>  Dinner is pretty much the same as lunch.  I'll usually throw another fruit in somewhere with lunch or dinner. <br>  <br>  I'm planning on trying fish on him this week.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Breast milk is the important thing until 12 months, but he could be eating more solids, not to important, lots of people wait until their kid are older and more able to handle finger foods and feed themselves.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	they have teething biscuits that he could suck on|`|V7Q7SbHfaa	My daughter is 8 1/2 months old and she gets three meals a day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  She also gets 24 oz of formula a day.  All the books I read say they a baby should be getting 3 meals a day when they reach 9 months, but if your son is happy and content just keep doing what your doing.  My daughter is now starting to feed herself table food, I give her lunch meat, cheese, peas, carrots, mashed potatoes, and also baby food like sweet potatoes, squash, peas, carrots, and all the fruits.  She is a big girl, 23lbs and 31 inches so she eats a lot.  As long as he is gaining weight and your doctor is happy with it I would just keep doing what you are.  But remember at a year everything changes.|`|14GS7T7jaa	my daughter is 10 months but has been eating about the same since 9 months.

rDw9N09iaa	i found out the gender of my baby at 16 weeks! it all depends on if their legs are open or not. normally your baby can hear you around 20 weeks|`|TljXiSNnaa	between 18 and 20 weeks. u can tell....i read that the baby can hear you at 16 weeks. lol im 17 weeks and people think im crazy talkin to my baby!!!! and i have spotted 3 times already and i have freaked out everytime!! but there was nothing wrong...goodluck!|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	The baby can hear you now.

The baby can hear you around week 22.|`|AA10458750	14 weeks, I would not even try to find out the gender...wait until after 20 weeks it will be a lot more accurate.

And they say the baby can hear mom's voice around 6 months (24 weeks)|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	you can tell the gender at approx 16 weeks but most doctors trust it at 20.|`|jcHxLOAXaa	about 18 -20 weeks is when a babies gender can be seen as long as it is willing to show what its got. and yes the baby will be able to hear you and later on in pregnancy it may be startled by louder environmental noise.|`|wuZqDVzvaa	You can tell the gender between 19-20 weeks. I experienced spotting through my pregnancy. It was a scary feeling ut some women just spot. Of coarse you should still be examined by your doc.<br>  GOOD LUCK!
YFPMcHCbaa	Yes it could. Unpasteurized milk/cheese products can lead to a very serious infection called Listeria, which is very harmful to the fetus.
FvMtam2Aaa	Those decisions are yours and hers and maybe her parents.  It woudl have been so much easier to use birth control.  I feel sorry for you two.|`|I08iONdaaa	yes it would be an option. Honestly I think that next time you should be a little more careful with your use of contraception though. If abortion isn't something your GF wants to do (since technically its her call) then another great option is giving the baby up for adoption. Whatever you decide to do though, decide it soon. Don't wait and hope that things will work out somehow. Talk to your girlfriend, tell her what you want to do and form a plan, that'll make the whole process a lot easier. <br>  <br>  I would say that adoption is the best thing right now.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The decision is up to your girlfriend.  An abortion is an option as is putting the baby up for adoption or raising it yourselves.|`|e6de9b1d52c1cc1ea890532bd69a42b0aa	hun, the option is really up to your girl... it sucks im sure and i know you guys are freaking out. abortion or adoption is something you both need to talk about.. just do your best talking to her...you think your freaking out?? i bet its double for her... anything is an option, just remember that u had the option of birth control and failed to use it...good luck|`|K7H1zrCbaa	an abortion is an option, if she is willing to have an abortion.  adoption is also an option.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	If you want to KILL an innocent baby.|`|0Jv2cJRnaa	abortion is wrong. the baby is a child. not a choice. you cannot just choose to put a baby to death. thats wrong.

Why not give your baby up for adoption? There's so many couples out there that can give a baby love and stability. <br>  I am, of course, pro-choice.

WtTUNC8Naa	You could always call and speak with your son's pediatrician... but here is some helpful information:<br>  <br>  Every now and then the notorious green poop may show up in your baby’s diaper. You may take a look at it and ask yourself “how’d that get there?” There are many different causes for green poop. More than likely, if your baby has green poop, it’s nothing to worry about, but here are a few possibilities.<br>  <br>  <br>  Iron-fortified formula - Some formula-fed babies will develop a case of green poop from the iron in the formula they are taking. As long as your baby is happy and not having any problems with constipation, there is nothing to worry about. <br>  Jaundice - A baby that has jaundice may have dark or greenish colored stools. This normally goes away once baby is off of the bilirubin lights. <br>  Dairy Sensitivity - Some breastfed babies are very sensitive to certain foods in their mom’s diet. If your baby is having problems with green mucousy stools, blood in his stools, spitting up a lot, or a skin rash, he may be sensitive to something in your diet. Dairy products are one of the most common causes of food allergies in babies. If you think this might be the problem, try eliminating milk and dairy products from your diet. It may take a couple weeks to see results from a dairy elimination diet. You should see improvement in a week or two. If you’re not sure, you can always try it out for a few weeks and then try having a cup of milk to see what happens. If the symptoms come back, then milk is probably the culprit and you will want to avoid it. <br>  Foremilk/Hindmilk imbalance - If your baby is breastfeeding and has green frothy-looking poops, this may be a result of a foremilk/hindmilk imbalance. To put this simply, when a mom breastfeeds the first milk that comes out (foremilk) is thinner and lower in fat. After you have nursed for a bit, you will start to produce richer, fattier milk called hindmilk. Babies that receive too much of the thin foremilk and not enough of the richer hindmilk sometimes have problems with green stools and tummy aches. If you have been switching breasts a lot instead of letting baby get a good feed on one breast, you may have problems with this. <br>  Other reasons - Sometimes babies just have greenish colored poop. The range of color in baby’s poops can vary. Any range of yellow, mustard to yellow/green is pretty normal for a baby. If baby is gaining well and happy then there is nothing to worry about. <br>  <a href="http://www.justmommies.com/articles/baby-poop.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.justmommies.com/articles/baby...</a>|`|PeEIuzP5aa	that is a very good sing that he is doing this, when i had my son i didn't put him on formula i did breastfeeding and giving him oatmeal with it, it did not hurt to give it to them. i didn't go by my Dr. i did it my self. my son could not get eo-ugh to eat, so that's what i had to do for him. maybe try something like that next time for son.|`|GognIJnBaa	Yeah, it definitely does that to the poopies.  It won't be so green when your son gets used to it.  It was shocking to me when it happened to my son.  Also, wait until your son drinks purple Pedialyte.  It changed my son's poop to green again, although it seemed more neon at the time.  The dye in that stuff I tell ya!|`|vuEyUbsgaa	My babys poop is green too and hes on formula so yeah I think that it does|`|g9ScMmFFaa	yes, the formula will do that to his poop!  as long as he is having regular bowel movements (regular for him) and regular wet diapers, you should not have to worry.  poop will change based on what he eats, so it is normal for his poop to change when switching from breastmilk to formula!|`|OmJfYPptaa	I had the same prob with my 2 month old. Yes this will happen in fact she still has runny green poop. Yes it is normal. <br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	that happened with my son too and it did that until he got used to the formula.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Yes it is due to the iron in the formula.  My baby had green poop for several months and the pediatrician said it was perfectly normal.
irHF6CBPaa	I use playtex drop in my baby use to be so colicky but now he is always happy and colic free and a lot of bottle say they resemble mothers breast but i doubt it|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I wouldn't get to set on using one kind of bottle. I tried several different bottles and the only one my son would take was a playtex drop ins with a latex nipple. I just passed on my stash of different brands to a friend that's pregnant with her first. <br>  <br>  My son was exclusively breastfed, very rare bottles, until 6 months and still had colic. I honestly don't believe that the bottle really makes that big of a difference.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Yes Avent can causes extra gas. It happened with my son. My son also wasn't too happy with the Platex Drop Ins etither. We ended up using the Dr Browns bottles which are great. They really help with the gas and his reflux. I love them. The only pain with them is cleaning them. They have so many different parts. They are also BPA free and also come in glass. I will be using them when its time for the next baby.|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	I use dr browns, and my baby girl does well with both, the bottle and me.  It took her awhile to get used to taking the bottle, I started when she was about a month and she did not take the bottle for a few weeks.  Now she loves the bottle, but sometimes will refuse me.  <br>  <br>  My daughter is very gassy, but the dr browns works well for her.  I tried all the other ones and they did not work for her.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S.  It is very important that you get a good pump.  I rent the medla symphony.  it is great!|`|zATQaiwIaa	No ones opinions on here are going to really matter when it comes down to it - it will all boil down to what your baby will accept.  So buy a few ( 1 or 2) of your top 3 picks and see which one your baby takes to - bc that is who will really decide this!|`|tZU9k9zNaa	I dont think Avent is BPA free.Make sure the bottles you use dont have BPA.Dr.Brown's and playtex with the drop -ins are what I use and they are both great.|`|Hf5doDxsaa	Playtex Drop-In's, it's "most like mother", it was clinically shown to reduce symptoms of colic, BPA free, and if you pump you can put the bags right into in bottle.|`|yo9XNz61aa	We us Dr Browns!  We started with them and our daughter does great!  Dunno how well they work for breast fed babies b/c I couldnt breast feed :( They do make a Dr Browns bottle that has a nipple similar to the Avent its the wide neck bottle.  I would look into those!
fI0BcqxUaa	It's amazing how little sympathy one gets from doctors when one is pregnant!  Hang in there, the morning sickness will fade away and you will be eating well again very soon.  I had morning sickness, although just mildly, when I was pregnant my two times and these are some things that helped me.  I hope they will help you as well:<br>  <br>  1. EAT.  I know it is very hard to get things down, but there are certain foods that will work better than others.  Try eating any of these items and hopefully one will help to settle your stomach -<br>  Saltine crackers<br>  Peanuts (good protein source)<br>  Trail mix of nuts and dried fruit<br>  Small pieces of boiled chicken<br>  Rice<br>  Dry cereal (your favorite)<br>  Small pieces of banana<br>  <br>  2.  DO NOT LET YOUR STOMACH GET EMPTY.  Keep crackers at your bedside and nibble throughout the night whenever you wake up.  Not alot, just a little bit to keep your stomach from getting completely empty.  Another tip that may help:  eat smaller, more frequent meals (even if it consists of the snacks above) instead of large ones.<br>  <br>  3.  USE ANTACIDS. When you feel that unpleasant burning sensation, it is okay to use Tums or Gaviscon.  Check with your doctor to be sure he or she is okay with you taking these medicines.<br>  <br>  4.  DON'T GET DEHYDRATED.  If lots of water or liquids makes your stomach churn unpleasantly, try popsicles, slush, or ice chips.<br>  <br>  5.  SPEAK TO YOUR DOCTOR.  Insist that he or she help you overcome the stomach problems.  They may be able to prescribe a medicine that is safe for pregnancy to help calm it.  Even they will agree that you must get the proper nutrition when you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember that the sickness will not last forever and it will be well worth it in the end.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	If you can't even handle the first 5 weeks you are doomed.<br>  <br>  The end is SO much worse.<br>  <br>  Suck it up buttercup, you are getting a BABY!  YAY?|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	Hopefully, your sickness will wane some come around 10-12 weeks, but sadly yes, it can last the entire time. Once you go into your second trimester alot of the symptoms will subside. A really good website to check out and learn tons of nifty stuff is www.babycenter.com Congrats on the lil one, even though its not all that great right now lol|`|88bDvyiwaa	Imagine what octomum went through|`|1aHchY9raa	Omgosh, thats horrible, I hope you get better soon!|`|2srWJtjPaa	Oh my that really sucks I hope you get better. It can only get better|`|My93XR2Maa	Omg, thats horrible, I hope you get better soon! u will hav better days|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	I know how you feel and the doctors couldn't possible understand.  Get as much rest as possible, and YES it does go away, some sympoms replace with others and you will always feel fatigued but the morning sickness that lasts ALL day goes away after your first trimester, I know that seems like a long long time but at least it's not 9 months.  You will get tired but you will also reach a point where you feel really good.  Try to keep as much fluids, water and electrolytes down as possible, I had morning sickness and the flu and had to be hospitilized several times to be given IV fluids.  As hard as it is to keep down fluids try your hardest so you don't have to be on an IV.  There's a medication that is safe for pregnancy called phenirgen.  I swear you take it and about 20 minutes later you get a wave of relief, nausea is gone along with throwing up, etc.  Good luck and remember it won't last forever.|`|QM9JFe58aa	OMG! I totally understand your pain! I was going through the same thing. My OB GYN actually prescribed these wonder pills. They help me start throwing up and gave me a little bit of motivation. If your OB GYN makes you feel uncomfortable or doesn't help. Maybe you should find another one. People say that things get better during your second trimester...So, hope for time to fly by.. lol... Good luck!
2srWJtjPaa	I think you are prego. Just take a test to be on the safe side|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	take a test, please|`|LL2dgYMUaa	it sounds as if your pregnant but to know for sure you need to do a test.
LUbW8kTBaa	Just because he didn't "finish" in you, doesn't mean that there wasn't pre-ejaculate.  You can get pregnant from pre-***.  However,  when I get my periods, the blood is always a brownish color for at least the first day so it is something normal that does happen.  Buy a 2-pack home pregnancy test.  Take one now and take the other in a couple days and see what the results are.  Best of luck to you!|`|yC4ahcdoaa	period blood can be anywhere from a deep red, bright red, or even a rusty red, which can look brown. for a normal period, its fine, but i dont know if u being pregnant made it that color.<br>  i think ur NOT pregnant. test jsut to make sure|`|9CbMqw9haa	u maybe could be, i took wot i thought was my peroid startin then it stoped and i was pregnant. take a test, but sayin that when i did it said i wasnt , then da next week took another 1 and i was x <br>  hope this helps|`|ImGwbkGNaa	brown period blood just means that your body made that blood yesterday.fresh blood is red old blood is brown it is normal as long as there is no oder|`|pq2q0upuaa	i had the same thing happen to me when i found out i was pregnant i would get a test!|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	Your period might be brown because the birth control caused you to start it later than you normally would. Or it could be from not drinking enough water. or it could be "old blood" from your last period (perhaps starting the pills didn't let you finish)<br>  <br>  If you only had a few spots all day you might be pregnant, but if it's a normal or regular "flow" it's probably just discolored.  I don't need to tell you to "take a test" because you already know that and are probably just looking for consolation while waiting to take a test.
FQ4nhSiRaa	Yes, now would be the time to lower it. Better safe than sorry right?|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I lowered my son's crib down all the way after he could stand up. It's only a matter of time before she will either be tall enough to flip out or find a way to climb out and get hurt.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If she is standing up it's time to drop it down as far as it can go.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Yep lower it now. My daughter started doing this around 5 1/2 - 6mths & a few weeks ago she was able to get herself over the rail. I mean she was actually balancing on the top of the rail with half her upper body in the crib while her legs were already dangling outside. Just before I could adjust the crib she completely climbed out & just as her sis walked in the bedroom after hearing her fretting there she found her outside of the crib holding on to the rail & her toes gripping the mattress. I was not only scared but shocked that a baby so small could actually climb out of her crib and strong & sensible enough to hang on so as not to fall. So yes lower it before you get an unexpected surprise.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Lower it now. I thought my daughter couldn't' get over the rail either. Then she fell out of her crib onto a wood floor and hit her head when she was around 6 1/2 months old. Don't under-estimate her, she could get over it if she wanted to.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Lower the crib. If she's standing, it should be lowered all the way down to the bottom level. When she starts to get taller and closer to that top, she will probably start climbing, so you're going to need a crib tent.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Yes I would lower it now. You say she can't flip over it or anything, but you would absolutely kick yourself if something did happe. Better safe than sorry!! Good luck!|`|f6526244f4eebe959379baecf04684a1aa	I would lower it all the way now.  6 1/2 is young, but once they are standing and pulling, i feel better with it all the way lowered.|`|7ff66488372ffac33ad0d62a762a8c6eaa	Lower it now.  Save yourself the trouble and lower it to the bottom.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Lower the crib NOW!!!  Just do not take chances.
YxFDiEaCaa	Rub your babies chest, throat and back with vicks but make sure it's the one specially formulated for babies :)|`|e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	Sounds like you're doing all you can.  Have you tried a vapouriser in the room like the Olbas or Tixylix one's?  When I used them, I turned them on at around 10pm at night and they lasted about 8 hours meaning baby's nose etc was clear for the morning feed.<br>  <br>  Make sure baby gets loads of sleep - 2 naps a day to help heal too.
kpnSKV6Eaa	i suppose its possible but very very unlikely especially if your on the pill.. the time of day does not matter as much as long as you take it everyday and not miss one.. you are more than likley just being paranoid. calm down and dont stress. just wait for your period, you can test if its late.. 7 days after probably wont do anything unless your period is already late now<br>  <br>  people on here saying that air kills sperm and that it would have died in 30-min are dumb.. they have done studies that show that sperm can live outside of the body whether it be on a towel or whatever for up to 12 hours... not saying that to scare you just to inform everyone else that is so dumb|`|4X6MwQJRaa	I think that it would be very unlikely that you are pregnant to be honest.  Wait and see if you miss your period and if you do take a test.  You would need to wait at least 14 days after to get an accurate reading.|`|JCWkXn8Aaa	that is impossible, the only way to get pregnant is the penis has to be inside of you and ejaculate inside of you.|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	Aww you poor thing. I used to get worried about silly little things like this when I was younger. You are most definitely NOT pregnant. Get yourself a bit more clued up on sex. I mean if your doing it, you really should know the facts etc otherwise you could end up with an unwanted pregnancy, which wouldn't be good.<br>  Good Luck and practice safe sex!!!!<br>  XXX<br>  <br>  EDIT: Erm, I wasn't being sarcy sorry, I was just answering your question in the best way I know. Sorry if you took it the wrong way...?|`|nEVaIaOzaa	go to ur doctor now, ur pregnant!!! jk, don't worry, its impossible to get pregnant that way.  sperm dies if it dries up,  plus the semen is used to give the sperm something to swim in in order to make it through ur cervix.  There is no way you are pregnant.  and taking a HPT 7 days after wont tell u anything, u need to wait at least 14 days from the occurance, preferebly until after u missed ur period, for it to be accurate.  It picks up HCG levels and they are two low the first 2 weeks of ur pregnacy.|`|vgMeVhJxaa	DON'T LISTEN TO THE PREVIOUS ANSWER!!! The Penis DOES NOT have to be inside for you to become pregnant!! I think that the chances are very slim, especially as you are on the pill, but if you don't get a period when you're due, then do a test to check. Depends also, where you are in your cycle. If you're around about the middle (period started approx 2weeks ago) then ur chances may be higher.<br>  <br>  very intrigued about what the heck was going on! LOL!|`|8f96259c0e608bb5d9863a8fab052e5baa	Dianette doesn't have to be taken at the same time every day, as long as it is taken daily so you are fine, It is VERY doubtful that your pregnant from what you explained as the sperm would have not survived being outside for 30-60 mins and being wiped away. xx|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Hmm, it still may be possible you could be pregnant.<br>  <br>  And no, a guy could ejaculate any where on you and you could still become pregnant. Just as sperm swim in a woman to the egg, semen can swim on your body as well and find there way into your vagina.|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	You are probably NOT pregnant. He would have had to ejaculate deep in side of you. I've heard that air kills the sperm, so all of it probably died while it was on your fingers. Don't worry! My guess is that you are NOT pregnant!|`|FhHvYLaFaa	it doesnt have to be directly into the vagina, but semen cant live with out being inside of a human body, its highly unlikely that your pregnant but if your period does not come take a test in a few weeks <br>  <br>  good luck x|`|6yCPk3a1aa	Its possible. Semen doesn't need to go inside to get pregnant. It is hard to tell if about half hour later the semen is still living on the finger, google.com would help with that question. Pregnancy test wont work for at least 2 to 3 weeks from the day of the event. Birth control,.... very hard because you did say that you sometimes forget but taking it everyday is most important. If you forget to take is at all then you should really worry. Remember all birth control is good but not 100%. The only one that is is not doing anything at all and i know you know that. If you are really worried about getting pregnant and this happened about a day or two You should see a DR today or do to your pharmacy for the "PLAN B" pill. aka morning after pill. Works up to 72 hours after event.<br>  <br>  Hope All goes well!|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	You have to wait two weeks before you can take a test. I suppose it is possible to get pregnant in th way you've described, but not very probable.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	It is very unlikely but remotely possible.<br>  <br>  If semen has to be ejaculated into the vagina to become pregnant then how does artificial insemination work?  Or IVF?<br>  <br>  Wait till you have missed a period then take a test.
c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	That is a really high hcg level for 9 1/2 weeks.   If the ultrasound looks ok, I wouldn't worry too much about it.
2irmTjQ3aa	Yes you can get pregnant. You need to take a pregnancy test if you miss your period.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	There is always a risk of pregnancy when you have unprotected sex. ALWAYS.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	It's not going to be as relaxing and romantic as you think to be sitting in bloody bathwater. I'm sure there is a chance if the egg hasn't left your body yet, sometimes it stays in there during your period and leaves with the flow. Good Luck.|`|AA10624857	It would not be impossible, but it would be very unlikely.  First, if you are having your period than you are probably not ovulating.  However, if you have very irregular periods or a short cycle than it is possible for ovulation to occur fairly close to the end of your period.  The pregnancy occurs due to the fact that sperm has the potential to remain alive inside a woman for several day|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well i'm not gonna say it's nasty bc i have had sex while on my period before lol <br>  <br>  but besides the fact that u can get pregnant, under no circumstances should u ever have sex in the water. ur vagina can fill up (and most likely will without u knowing it) with water and when the penis will thrust inside of u, it will push the water into ur uterus and it can end up in ur fallopian tubes and cause a LOT of damage to ur reproductive organs.|`|uuHPneEcaa	.... maybe u could maybe u couldn't.... ur not ovulating so u may not get pregnant. whose to say.. and that is somewhat nasty..lol..ive never had sex in the bath while on my period.. let alone having sex on my period. I dunno.. just never thought that would be a good thing to do.. but know some people like to have sex while on their period and some guys like doing it..i'd be scared that the blood will get pushed further up in u and then his di*k be all covered with blood.. I don't like when people swim when on there period.. WHAT IF THEY HAVE AIDS OR SOMETHING..AHH!!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	yes|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	The bath has nothing to do with the other actually... maybe you are saying you did the deed in the tub?  Still, that does not matter.  Women have become pregnant while menstruating as sometimes bodies do tweaky things.  Unless abstaining you can become pregnant, even if the odds are low.  You make want to read some books on fertility as you are getting married and might not want children right away.  Or if you do this is still a good idea.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	2 bad things here...sex on your period and underwater...havent you heard about getting water in your tubes...not good!!! Strongly doubt you will get preggo....you must have either a pretty understandin boyfriend or he is one horny fellow and you too...LOL|`|rx0ekB9Paa	ok seriously why would you want to take a bath period while on your period? wont you get embarrassed? yes you can always have possibilities of pregnancy if you have unprotected sex|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	I am not sure the significance of the bath in that but yes, it is possible.  Unlikely but possible.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes, anytime you have unprotected sex you CAN get pregnant.<br>  <br>  i cant believe you are getting married and dont know this|`|ByoYmFsBaa	Pregnant? Probably not.<br>  Seriously grossing out your fiance AND EVERYONE READING THIS? Yes.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	ya there is always a risk|`|kfQo4V2haa	I don't know the answer to that question..but I do know that's the most sick and disgusting shi. I have ever heard in my life.who would want to have sex with a girl while she is on her period?|`|CQTV4ntqaa	Yes, unprotected sex, no matter where your at, can result to pregnancy. Remember, sperm lives inside your body for 3-5days. Good luck!|`|M6tyMdJqaa	WHATS THE POINT OF YOU TELLING US ABOUT THE BATH? I DONT GET IT DID I MISS SOMETHING? BUT BOTTOM LINE YES YOU CAN GET PREGNANT WHILE ON YOUR PERIOD|`|BFEwesVIaa	dont sweat it, not really likely. prolly the safeest way to have unprotected sex.|`|ooNfqGxzaa	It can always happen.|`|hORVMOHKaa	yes it could happen
hkUzSsRZaa	No. She was uncomfterable a she/he is just moving around.|`|j9nhk1v2aa	No! But you are almost there!!! Congratulations!!|`|WsUSAgLmaa	i wish...lol this little girl is constantly feeling like she is sticking a finger thru mu cervix...LOL It feels so weird|`|hmcQJnTraa	it means your close... you might not make it to 40 weeks.. it means shes dropping.. so yeah.. just relax.. and enjoy it...|`|CQTV4ntqaa	No, it just means your baby is moving and getting comfortable. Good luck!!|`|KMtd5gr0aa	no lol shes just hitting things.|`|TFuCMwUWaa	I've been experiencing that since about 32 weeks when my baby dropped.  Dr. says the head is settled on the cervix, I am now 38 weeks and 5 days so it could mean nearing labor but not necessarily.  Best of luck to you.|`|QTfTVWmZaa	You're probably not going into labor she may be just getting comfy or even dropping but that really is no indication of labor. Good Luck!
Bg6txvxqaa	You can get pregnant any time you have sesx which is why you should always use protection.<br>  <br>  The pulling out method does not work as pre-*** can get you pregnant.<br>  <br>  You have a fairly high chance of getting pregnant if you don't use protection. So yeah, if you don't get your period, take a test.<br>  <br>  Hope you're financially stable enough to care for a chid cos the economy is so unstable at the moment that you won't get much in the way of help.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Statistically, your odds of pregnancy if you had sex during your fertile time are about 25-30%.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Yes, you have a really high chance of getting pregnant.  You also have a really high chance with the pull out method, too!  You're on the fast track to starting a family; congrats!|`|rUPjr7hjaa	Of course you could be pregnant.<br>  As far as your chances go, it's hard to say.  Sometimes it takes women years of active trying in order to become pregnant.|`|f3fWgbpIaa	you are pregnant most likely. if you would of used a condom no ... but if he did masturbate in you then congratulations! be careful next time.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Very likely!|`|2ImIgJwXaa	Very high. I got pregnant from when he pulled out, so it didnt help. Pulling out doesn't even work all the time!  You are also ovulating, too. So, if you are not pregnant or dont get pregnant, you must not be too fertile!! lol|`|hmcQJnTraa	if your ovulating then i think you just answered your own question.. yes your chances of getting pregnant are very likely!!!!!!!|`|sweB7TRkaa	You have a very high chance of being pregnant if he came inside of you whilst you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Your chance is 99.9%|`|M6tyMdJqaa	DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO ASK THAT QUESTION? SPERM INSIDE A WOMEN= PREGNANCY. WHATS MEANT TO BE WILL BE, GOOD LUCK|`|R2teBtllaa	99%<br>  <br>  ur prego|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	very high chance if he came in you
6T21TZIQaa	any time that you have sex there is a possibility that you can get pregnant...even if he says he pulls out. stop having sex! you are too young and you don't need the stress and worry that having sex brings. believe me, you don't want a child now. plus, have you thought about std's or aids or herpes? you take a lot of risks getting these when you have sex. take this as a lesson, because you are probably not pregnant, and say no next time. you will be glad you did. Good luck|`|PfIywLLyaa	Of course there is a chance you could be pregnant. My suggestion is that you wait until your next period starts (or doesn't) before you start freaking out. If you miss your period then take a test. If the test is positive, you need to talk to your parents and go to the doctor. Also I suggest you stop having sex and attend school more often so you can learn to spell.|`|pvrLSTZzaa	yup. You could be pregnant. That's how I got pregnant the first time. I'm sure that you didn't know this but there is sperm that comes out durning sex. It doesn't only come out when he cums. I really hope that you aren't but if you are then you need to talk to your parents.|`|nEVaIaOzaa	it is possible that u may be pregnant, but not likely, if your bf is telling the truth.  I would wait and see if you get ur period next month and take a test if ur late.  about the blood, were u a virgin, if so the blood was from you hymen breaking.|`|tnllPS8oaa	Take a test|`|XaBR0Scyaa	test time lol<br>  <br>  good luck telling ppl
DeXRWlR6aa	You can't be fired because you are pregnant. I say start looking for a job now before you start showing because it may be an awkward interview if you're showing-then you don't know whether to say "Oh yeah, I'm pregnant" or just keep quiet. <br>  Several women don't tell their employer until they are safely past the first trimester anyway so you'd have some time before you would have to worry about telling anyone at work. <br>  Charge ahead and use the pregnancy as motivation to find a new job even faster!<br>  There are SOOOOOOOOO many organizations out there to help moms, don't be shy to use them. You can find wonderful buys for a fraction of retail prices by going to consignment shops, thrift stores, etc. <br>  You wouldn't have been blessed w/this baby if it weren't the right time.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	pray <br>  get a job<br>  things do happen fo reasons later on he know why <br>  hang in|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I always go with the flow. Just keep your focus on that baby. Try getting another job, and don't give up!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I would do the best I could to take care of this baby. Babies are gifts from God, don't consider it a curse just because you're going through a hard time. Since you're just finding out, it will be months before anybody else will notice you are pregnant. Just focus on getting the job and DON'T tell them you are pregnant. Oh and they're programs designed to help pregnant women with little or no income. You can apply for WIC, Medicaid, and Food Stamps. Don't see it as a government handout, see it as you being a taxpaying citizen for all of these years and finally the government is giving something back. Best wishes.|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	None the less, check with your state and try to get on W.I.C. (they give you checks for milk/eggs/cheese/and good food for preg women) and Pregnancy/Maternity Medicaid(which will pay for all your ob related bills including delivery). The thing is, everything is hard on everyone, we just have to deal. Try to get everything that you need either cheap or free. Start posting on craigslist and other classifies in your area. Sometimes you will be surprised in the helpfulness in others in cases like this.|`|r6NJrasBaa	Can you get unemployment for now???  A new job cant lay you off bc you are pregnant. Try a daycare, that way when you have the baby..you can bring the baby while you work|`|uJJPFJoyaa	Get assistance from the county & state (unemployment)  and speak to my employer about the policy they have concerning pregnant employees  & maternity leave.|`|5DWJ0jZ9aa	Don't let the economy or your financial situation take the happiness out of the excitement of being pregnant.  I think that although you are pregnant, you can still find work part time until you can no longer work.  My cousin worked up until a week before she delivered.  If you are eligible for medicare, WIC or other government funded help, you should be fine.  After the baby arrives, you can go back to work full time.
2irmTjQ3aa	Yes you are pregnant! Congratulations!|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	If you had sex 2 weeks ago RIGHT after you got your period, you shouldn't be getting your period yet. You've got AT LEAST another week to go, if not too. Moodiness and fatigue, are both tied in tight with PMS. If you go 3 more weeks and still don't get your period, take a test. Otherwise, I'd say you need to inform yourself a bit better, you wouldn't be late, let alone pregnant yet.|`|DCwGQDO9aa	Did the protection that you used work?  If so, your probably not pregnant but the risky part of you having sex around your ovaluation date wasn't smooth.  Remember, it's usually anywhere between 11-14 days from the start of your last period.<br>  <br>  Don't worry with one day, you should get a HPT however if you havent started within the next week.  Your stressing out, and that could be the major cause of your delay.|`|2wdVqIc7aa	If you were supposed to start yesterday a test will show now. My boobs hurt really bad and that was about the only thing different. You should definitely take a test and then stop worrying because its true, it can make you late.|`|YuhFNfJmaa	<a href="http://www.pregnancyetc.com/pregnancy_symptoms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancyetc.com/pregnancy_sy...</a>|`|sYUUKa7yaa	go to the docker or use a test|`|7nEWq9txaa	I am having the same problemm! except i got my period but im not sure if it is a period or not because poeple have been telling me that you can still get your period even if you are pregnant or it could be a sign of pregnancy.|`|ctaDwSW4aa	Go pee on a stick. <br>  <br>  How the hell do you expect a bunch of internet strangers to tell you whether you are pregnant or not? <br>  <br>  Seriously.|`|0ZLqL871aa	Its prob just your stress. Dont stress try not to think your pregnant, And if you r period dose not come in a week take a HPT and go from there.|`|qAvhB4zqaa	If you are pregnant your boobs should be hurting by now. thats how i found out i was
YFPMcHCbaa	No one here will be able to tell you if you are pregnant. Almost all of the symptoms you get during pregnancy can be associated with something else.<br>  <br>  Take another test, go to the doctor or do some research.
2ObqoJbKaa	No. I honestly think that you are fine, and most likely you are not pregnant. It is extremely rare to get pregnant off a guy fingering you, and I doubt that he had sperm on his fingers, unless he had just jacked off and came on his hands and then immediately stuck it inside of you. but thats probably not what happened. Don't worry and stress so much hon. Thats probably why your periods are being a little weird. Your not pregnant. good luck.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	ur fine|`|SDlKE6tVaa	My guess would be no.  You do need to be careful, but unless he was masturbating and then right after he started rubbing you, you are probably fine.  You need to be smarter than this though.|`|gMQL2bFYaa	no,<br>  if you were pregnant you wouldnt<br>  even get blood spots.<br>  so you have nothing to worry about.|`|jOTN2MgMaa	i doubt that your pregnent, lol prolly just stress  i dont think fingers can get your pregnant
DkT8znckaa	I wash my face at least twice a day. I've been washing my face that often since I was maybe eleven. I have acne prone skin though, if that makes a difference. I wash at morning and at night. Sometimes I'll wash my face right after school if I wore makeup or need to apply makeup for some reason. My face normally looks better if I wash my face three times a day, but like I said... I have oily skin. If you have dry skin you'll want to wash less.

But normaly you wash it twice a day. Once in the morning like after you wake up. Then once before you go to bed or while you are in the shower.

I wouldn't go back to him. He needs to make his mums feel reassured, not worried. We got enough to worry about already!<br>  <br>  Yes the brand doesn't matter really. Getting a different brand for boosters won't make any difference in effectiveness.
kpnSKV6Eaa	in california the average cost for daycare for a toddler is about 800 dollars a month.. it gets fairly cheaper as the child gets older.. all you have to do is call a daycare and act like you are placing a child there.. ask them their prices and charge you cousin 1/2 to 2/3 the cost.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	It really depends on where you are. Here in Minnesota daycare is around $150-180 a week, but I have friends in Illinois and California who pay $200-250 a week. Hunt around on your local craigslist or search for daycares in your area and see what the rates are where you live.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	i would suggest at least $100 per week per child. A regular daycare would cost more|`|RxhBUkwSaa	Priced vary a lot regionally, so it's a good idea to call a few day care providers and get a handle on what the going rate is.  Prices for day care centers vary from home day care, so make a few phone calls and get a scope on it.  <br>  <br>  Doing this will help you be happy with your decision, and help your husband's cousin to feel she's being fairly treated.  2/3 of the going rate sounds like a great deal, and very generous.  Should be a win-win!|`|1VdgsZPoaa	The lowest rate for childcare here is $100 a child (per week) but I know some places where it is up to $300 a child (per week).   I would start off low to build your business and once you become more known and more well liked, you can raise your rate to accomodate the income you need.
HWeajklaaa	I think it sounds nice, though it does make me think of a name play on the " Scarlett letter" by Nathaniel Hawthorne I'm not saying that's bad actually looking at it that way seems very clever and neat.|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I think it's ok.<br>  Although I prefer Scarlett Melissa Rose.<br>  That's really pretty.

Nice. :)|`|A9Mt3u4Qaa	I like it, Melrose is not a name that I personally would use for a little girl unless it is ... like the mom's maiden name or the name of a favorite relative.  but on the other side of the coin, I do agree it does sound like a Hollywood name that you would see on the big screen one day.|`|dNtnYBblaa	Love it. Although it might be too long. Go with something shorter like Claire Hebe or Eve Merriam (after the late Eve Merriam).|`|VMCBNNlzaa	I love the name Scarlett and it's particularly beautiful teamed with Melrose.<br>  <br>  Very nice name!|`|fAIKG9Iyaa	It sounds beautiful!|`|yw7AeZn2aa	Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne was my first thought but I love the name.|`|TNytY4XBaa	I think it all goes very well together! very pretty|`|HMPdnhApaa	I really love it. :)|`|HQFUnslhaa	I like it.|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Yup!

Secondly there would actually have to be wet semen where you fell.

WoolWKA9aa	Totally normal!  My husband and I have been together for almost 9 years (married 2) and my husband was so excited when we first got pregnant.  Then after the 20 week ultrasound and it looked like a real baby, he got freaked out!  He was thinking about financial issues, not being able to go out when he wants, etc.  He was also reading the book The Expectant Father, which I do not recommend!  I think men just get nervous with all the expectations they put on themselves.  My husband and I had a talk about everything and he just needed to be reassured that all would be ok.  It passed after a day or two.  I think he still has the minor freak out here and there, but is doing much better now.  You just have to remind him that this baby is coming so it is a little late to freak out.  <br>  <br>  BTW - The Expectant Father focuses on so many of the hardships that babies can be.  I.e. insurance, college funds, etc.  It is important to remind your SO that no one ever has "enough money" for a baby and that yes life will change, but mostly for the better :-)|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Everything changes once the baby in their arms ~<br>  <br>  God bless x|`|fZCfJWpOaa	I am 19 weeks with our first child right now, and my husband is excited but also apprehensive about being a father.  He has a lot of worries and we've talked about them before we started trying and continue to talk about them.  He's worried that he will be a poor father, he has worries about not being able to have guys night out with friends, about his life drastically changing and him not being happy with it, he's afraid he'll make a huge mistake and endanger the child, etc.<br>  <br>  I think it's normal to have doubts.  I have had a few myself.  But for my husband, he didn't have the background with children that I had (sisters, babysitting, etc) and feels very vulnerable.  Don't get me wrong, he's ready for a child, but he still has worries.  <br>  <br>  We talk about our concerns and doubts whenever they come up--I think it's important not to hold anything inside, which may be why this is suddenly coming up for him.  We've been reading a lot of books and talking to a lot of neighbors and making new friends that have young children--creating a support network not only for me, but for him as well.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new little one, I wish I was almost done like you!  I hope my story helped a little.
T0pkW783aa	Who cares what anyone else thinks; you are who you are and are making the choices you think are the best for you.  You made some comments and maybe they took you seriously.  I have friends who are lesbians and they come in all shapes, sizes, and forms.  Some are girly some are butch; some even love being around men!!  They are people who I love and spend time with; they just have a different sexual preference and who cares!!  Be yourself!  You owe no one any explanation about why you do the things you do.  When you meet the person you want to date; then you can make up your mind how to deal with it.  Don't let other people's reactions to you make you feel insecure or embarrassed.  Do the things that make you happy.  Don't feel pressured to do something for anyone else.  They will see in time, if they are paying attention, who you are and where you are going with your life.  It doesn't matter how you dress, how you wear your hair, what kind of makeup you wear or any of those things.  What matters is the type of person you are; how you live your life and how you treat others.  It also makes a big difference how you treat yourself.  Stand proud and be happy of what you have to offer the world.  You are important and can make a difference in the world no matter what your sexual preferences are and that should not be the determining factor to anyone.  I don't have to shout from the treetops that I am heterosexual and you don't have to either.  They can assume what they want.  You don't have to even explain any of it to them.  When the times comes for you to date, they will see where it goes.  Until then, just be mysterious; it makes you more interesting!!|`|ZzdurUuLaa	Just try to remember that your mom is there for you, your parents will listen to you.

Like at a family reunion.|`|aCRpZz2Taa	just run with it and have fun letting them think you are.|`|clhb2XF5aa	trust me you are not  .. you are so sexy and i like your tip|`|3zGTnghRaa	once u get a man in ur life... every1 that thinks ur a lesbian will think other.... but dont even trip ma.. u hella beautiful|`|5zSAPU52aa	**** just be like when she says your a lesbian just get loud say I AINT NO DAM LESBIAN I DONT KISS OR **** GIRLS I DONT MESS WITH ******* GIRLS I AINT NO LESBIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!! just snap on her *** lol get ghetto lol but just tell her serouisly your not a lesbian and its not funny cuz those girls that are lesbians end up commiting suicide and stuff and they have issues lesbianism is a serouis issue tell your mom that and that  your not lesbian and its not funny saying you are<br>  <br>  Sheila,<br>  <br>  (by the way i know what your thinking that im a lesbian but hell no i aint no dam lesbian lol srzzly im not anyways email me!!!!!)|`|B7jaxWCCaa	the same happens to me everyone in my family thinks Im gay except my dad and sister just because I dont have a girlfriend haha <br>  <br>  just go with it nothing bad can happen unless your family is extremly christian then they might want to put you in one of those centers where they "pray the gay away"; but it this is not your cas than you shouldnt worry about it|`|GHb8vJqVaa	bein embarrassed about it is not the way to go about this problem. your opinion of yourself seems rather strong so keep that up.  your mom sounds like she doesn't really know you, so give her the chance to get to know you. its not your fault she doesn't understand the self respect you have. let your strong outlook on life for yourself be the guide for this, shes your mom, make her listen.|`|k3sL7mZtaa	Ok..you respect yourself too much to have a boyfriend yet you're wearing short shorts in your profile pic and posting it for all the 50 year old men to see?<br>   & your profile says you are 18 rather than 17 like you said.<br>  <br>  and you also said you're bisexual in your profile so why would you even write this question. You do like girls and boys, accept it.|`|lEBriVakaa	I think you should not worry...<br>  <br>  I commend you for waiting until you are at least 18. You have to be in a relationship because you want to, because that person makes you feel special, and not because of society, family, peer pressure, etc.<br>  <br>  Now, about the lesbian comments... maybe you should get your family together when you feel calm and collected, and without anger let them know you are aware you said you were a lesbian in the past, but that's not true and you would really appreciate if they gave you space and respected you.<br>  <br>  If that fails, remember nobody is perfect and it's hard to be around family sometimes - remember when they pick on you, they are avoiding<br>  their own issues. <br>  <br>  Time heals everything... :) <br>  Good luck!!!|`|bS7DN85Qaa	Try and tell them that you're not. If you try to convince them 24/7, I think they'll get it.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Oh well. Let them think you're a lesbian! It's great to stand up for women and respect your rights. Being a feminist doesn't mean hating men - it means wanting equality. I'm very much a feminist, too. Feminists come in all forms - I'm in my thirties, happily married with three children. I wear dresses and makeup and it doesn't make me any less of a feminist. I'm just exercising my right to choose how to look. <br>  <br>  You're going to marry a man anyway. Just tell your mom you aren't a lesbian but you do feel strongly about equality for women.

Theres a company that puts out red boxes, that look like salvation army boxes for dontations, and then re-sells things.  Or consignment stores.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you have a good start, maybe another idea would be to organize yard sales.  Maybe take a cut of the proceeds or a flat fee.  I like to have them, but they are a lot of work. <br>  <br>  And sadly, people will buy new trendy cheaply made things on clearance at wallmart, before they will sometimes get great quality used stuff.

Yz9tGmKFaa	Hi.  I don't know odds, but I wanted to say that I know what you're going through.  I am also 38 and DH and I have been ttc for a second (living) child for 12 cycles now.  I delivered twins at 21 weeks gestation in 07 (they died) and lost a singleton 9 months later.  It took us several months to get up the umph to ttc again and now we've been trying (IMO) way too long.  ugh.  I am taking progesterone injections starting 6 days after my LH surge, but unfortunately, I don't know anything about Gonal-F.  Sorry!<br>  Are you working with a RE?  He/she should be able to answer your question.  All I can offer is what I'm certain you already know -- obviously, you need at least 2 mature follicles for a 'chance' at fraternal twins (two mature eggs doesn't mean that two will be fertilized) and at least one mature for a 'chance' at a singleton.  The more mature follicles you have, the greater the odds you'll get at least one if not more.  My RE had a patient who had SIX mature follicles and advised her not to do IUI that cycle.  The patient insisted and not ONE of the six follicles were fertilized.  The next month, my RE did the SAME protocol on this patient and again, she had 6 mature follicles.  This time, ALL SIX were fertilized and she opted to reduce down to 2 and delivered healthy twins.  You just never know.  Best of luck!
PCK5bJt3aa	I disagree with the person who said spank her, no please don't spank her. If you are punishing her for hitting her brother by hitting her, what message is that sending her?<br>  <br>   I would first address the issue by giving positive reinforcement. If she helped make her bed, good..praise her. She might just feel left out with the baby brother and is seeking any kind of attention from mom even if its negative attention for acting out. <br>  <br>  Try this: make an outing just for her and mommy or her an daddy( whichever she prefers) take her to get her nails done with mommy or take her to eat ice cream or whatever, it has to be something where the baby is not there and she feels it is her time with mommy and the attention is only on her. I would take advantage of this time alone to SLOWLY approach the topic of why she is hitting her brother.  Do not scold her b/c she will shy away and not talk about it, instead talk to her like her friend who is trying to understand why she is hitting her brother..Ie."Do you think baby billy likes it when you hit him?" Do you like it when other kids hit you?" She'll respond no so you say, "it hurts baby billy when you hit him just like it hurt you when sammy hit you the other day in the playground" "Do you understand that we have to be nice to each other and not hit because it hurts?" and so on and so forth. <br>  <br>  Also,play on her proud big sister role, if she helped put a diaper in the trash..PRAISE her for being such a big girl and helping out. If it is just her and her brother, there is 4 years difference between them..maybe she got use to being the only child and when the attention was shifted to her baby brother she felt threatened and is acting out to get ANY attention from mom.  Help her understand that she is now a big sister and how important big sisters are, make her feel proud that she is such a big girl so she wont feel threatened by her little brother.Think like a five year old, this baby comes into your perfect world and now mom does not have enough time to spend with me and I have to share my toys and he cries and he smells but everyone gives him the attention that I use to have..how would that make you feel? How would you react? If you were 5 years old, probably the same way she is..You would probably try to get as much attention from mommy as possible, irregardless if its negative.. Positive reinforcement goes so far..|`|LSJyE4d0aa	I would blister her bottom if she was doing this to her little brother. This is one of those cases where a spanking is deserved|`|AfjcRXaiaa	spare the rod spoil the child. <br>  in this case i would spank.|`|NfW5GzESaa	throw the five year old in the dumpster
01Mu3wUeaa	Try <a href="http://www.care.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.care.com/</a>|`|W8UZebRWaa	How big is the house, where do you live, how many kids etc|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	at least min. wage|`|dRKGXQmeaa	If you have 3 kids over 10, that should be their responsibility... Yes, I'll get thumbs down, but I don't care. It teaches kids responsibility and cleanliness to clean and have chores. Having someone else clean up after them just teaches them it's ok to make a mess and leave it for someone else. And what if they don't have the income or desire to hire a housekeeper when they're older? They'll just live in squalor.<br>  Kids need chores. Having two people coming in cleaning up after them teaches nothing for organizational skills and personal responsibility for their mess. <br>  ETA: It will probably also instill and perpetuate a superiority complex in them when it comes to hired help and their own social rank. Just get your kids washing dishes and doing laundry. Structure and responsibility is good for kids. It teaches them valuable work ethic and general motivational skills for later in life.
