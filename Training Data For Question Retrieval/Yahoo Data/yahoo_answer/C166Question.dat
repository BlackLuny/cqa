20090223125352AAVzt5X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Chemical pregnancy versus early miscarriage-is there a difference?	My LMP was jan 9th.  I took a couple pregnancy tests, starting before missing a period, and saw faint positives.  I felt pregnant and had swollen breasts and a little nausea for the first week or so after conception would have happened.  Then, for the last week and a half, my symptoms weren't as strong.  I took 2 more tests and the lines were even fainter than they had been originally, and so I had a blood test which came back negative with levels <2.  I just started my period (2 weeks late) and it is incredibly heavy and uncomfortable.  Does this sound like a chemical pregnancy or a miscarriage-or is there no difference?  Should I expect to bleed for a long time and pass anything?  Right now it has just been more clotted than normal.      Sorry if TMI!!

20090223133638AAHTPNU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do I deal with my misbehaving 6-year old?	My 6 year old boy has been having a problem listening and behaving in class...... I have done everything to this kid to try and straighten him up. I've taken his things away, any privlege he has, grounded him to his room, spanked his butt and not only is he getting in trouble most days he's also been lying about it quite frequently. I don't know about most of you all but my momma used to make us eat soap when we lied. Now days that's just plain child abuse as far as most people are concerned. I have no idea what else to do to him. I need some creative ideas as to some kind of punishment that I haven't yet thought of. I've even made him sit and write the "I will behave in school" sentences. The bad behavior just keeps continuing. The only thing left I can think of to do is to go sit in his class one day and watch him but he isn't going to act up with me there and I run half of a small business so sometimes it's a little hard to be able to take a whole day completely not reachable and I have a 4 year old daughter at home as well. Any ideas?

I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years now, we BARELY have sex, I'm on the pill for my PMS, but yet - I'm a week and a half late on period. So I already took a pregnancy test; those first response ones that say either "Yes" or "No" just so there's no confusion on if the lines too faded or what not, and both came out "Yes".       I'm scared, this is the first time I really ever thought I'd been. The last time we'd had intercourse in a WHILE was Valentine's Day and that was with protection. I'm really, really scared. And to top it all off, and you're all going to hate me for this, but I'm only 15.      & I feel like I have the flu and such. Is that normal? No puking yet, but, still feel it. No period. Please, please help. :/
20090223134640AANbmtd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do you deal with constant crying for two hours from a 1yr old who needs a nap?	My youngest is 17months, and for the past three to four weeks she has been getting difficult to lay down.  Some days it takes about an hour to lay her down and others it lasts two hours.  I check on her, change her diaper, & make sure she has what she needs, but the screaming and crying sounds like she is hurting herself, but in reality she is just carrying on.  I am six months pregnant, and her molars are coming in, and dad is in and out for work ALOT, So I am maybe wondering if that is the issue, or she just is fighting her sleep more often than none.

My 3-yr-old son is Autistic, but the doctor is pushing me to potty train.  Obviously he won't potty train the same way my 5-yr-old did, but I have no idea where to begin.  Musical potty chairs only frighten him, and regular ones only confuse him.  I am frustrated just at the idea of how rough this is going to be, but I don't want that to reflect in how I go about training him.  It's not his fault he has Autism Spectrum Disorder, and I certainly don't wanna take it out on him.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

20090223140401AAnmCNI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How Would You React To Your Child Doing Drugs?	I'm sixteen, nearly seventeen years old and I smoked weed for the first time when I was thirteen. I didn't smoke it heavily until I was fourteen, and even then, I rarely did it for more than two weeks consecutively (not without breaks in between, of course. :D) But lately I've been smoking it on a regular basis, and the other day, I decided to do shrooms. Of all drugs, they aren't all that serious, but tell me, how would you feel if you discovered your child doing drugs? How would you react? In fact, I know some people from elementary school who used to snort lines of coke in the washrooms. How would you react if you actually caught your child doing drugs?

I've read so many reviews yet can't seem to decide on one.  Just wanted to check and see what this forum advises.  Obviously, cost is an issue and I would like to keep it down... but wouldn't want to sacrifice safety and construction for it.  Thanks!

20090223144631AAXf81j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	LMP vs Ultrasound?? 10 easy points!!! Need as many opinions as u have!?	I was on birth control about 4 years. My lmp was on August 28th. I was on the pill, so it lasted a normal 4 days then I started the new pack on that Sunday. Well on the 3rd day of taking them I started bleeding super super heavy. No pain or anything. Just a ton of blood. And this lasted 4 days. Non stop heavy bleeding. Well after the first day of heavy bleeding I stopped taking my pill (as in i stopped it AFTER the bleeding started) cause I thought it was my body just doing its thing. I never went to the doctor, cause I was in no pain. Well it stopped on September 6th. I had unprotected sex on September 7th..then not again till September 13th, and then like evryday from the 17th till the 22nd. (my bf and I just moved back in with each other) And well my next period would have been on September 25th. It never came, so I took a pregnancy test...got a negative. So I waited until October 5th. Took another one and it was negative. So then on October 7th I took one in the morning and at night. Still a negative. Then I waited and took one 9th and it was a faint positive..took one again 3 hours later and it was a bit darker. So I knew I was preg. Went to the doctor and theres came out positive too.       Well. based on my lmp my due date is June 4th which is what the clinic gave me.   Well I went and had an ultrasound done and they told me there wasnt anything there and though it was an etopic preg. They tested my hgc and it was going up..so I went to another hosiptal and had an ultrasound done and they saw the baby, it was just very very small where I was super early. And that one put my due date at June 15th. Well I went to another hosiptal who dated my due date at June 16th. Well I had about 6 ultrasounds from 2 different doctors before my 12 week mark, and they all dated me at June 15th as my due date. And now at 23 weeks she is dating June 15th still. So based on ultrasounds she right on..but its some what off from my lmp. Based on my due date of ultrasound I got pregnant at around the time my next period was due to come. But based off my lmp I got preg a day after that crazy bleeding. Im confuced and need some advice. Its been on my mind.

The thing is, the tin says, that a baby 6 months + should be having 3-4 bottles per day and 1-2 'solids' per day.      My daughter is 6.5 months has 2 solids (on the recommendation of her doctor) as well as 6 bottles per day.  This seems like an awful lot. Is this ok?

And I've been asked out before by guy friends and when I turned them down they got mad at me. I'm tired of getting hurt and hurting others and ruining friendships so how can I possibly find a nice guy? My mom told me it's because I wear "rose colored glasses" and I try to find the best in people and that's why I end up talking to not so good guys....anyone else have this problem? Is there anything I can do?

20090223150253AAAaGht	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Questions regarding Post Natal Depression...?	if you've had any experience with PND, i'd love to hear about your experience. I believe i'm having one and it's been really hard admitting this to myself. I'm at 8 months post partum, for the first couple of months things were great but i've been miserable for the past 4 months or so. i try to control my feelings in front of the kids (29 mo and an 8 mo) but each time i'm alone, i can't stop crying.    i don't even know how to talk to my husband about this.    i want to know, is there any way this can go away on its own ? or do i really need to consult ? i really don't want to talk to my doctor or any doctor about this because i know it'll be impossible for me to get through a session without breaking down in tears and balling my eyes out and i really don't want to be seen with red puffy eyes neither by my doctor nor by the patients sitting at the waiting area.   so what was the first step you took once you found out? did you consult or not? if you did, how long did it take for you to feel better? and if you didn't consult, what did you do to make yourself feel better?      thanks a lot in advance. any answer will be helpful.

I don't know if just because ive been sad latley or if this is really happening. I might just be thinking it?   My boyfriend doesn't hold my hand a lot but he does sometimes, but rarely. When sitting on the couch he hardly pulls me closer and holds me. Im the one usually moves closer and he'll then put his arm around me. He used to say I love you all the time and now hardly says it throughout the day.   He did say not to long ago that he loved me and wanted to marry me and have kids someday.   I love him a lot and don't know what id do if i ever lost him. Alot of people say im too pretty to be with him but i love him anyways.    He also used to ask me a lot to go over to his house during the week and he only does on weekends now.   What do you think of this? Do you think im just thinking things?   ive also been sad about his ex gf being in his one class this semester. Ive been scared of that. He promised me he wouldnt talk to her, he switched seats to be away from her, and he said if he had to hed change classes. He didnt tho and is sticking with not talking to her.

We were having a discussion about parks and bringing children into them..and this female colleague told me that she saw some weird stuff going on recently so she doesn't bring her children.  I asked 'what kind of weird stuff' and she replied very dismissively 'oh, you wouldn't understand, you don't have children'.  I replied, 'oh I would, I have nieces and nephews and I was a child myself once'.  Another time, she said to me 'oh, many of my friends got pregnant on purpose when they reached 40 & hadn't met a guy'.  I answered 'that never happened to me'.  The fact is I've never married or had children, am a few years older than her and live a lovely life, contracting & travelling in between.  I feel she is giving me mean digs. Why is she doing this to me?  It seems so rude.

But lately, the air flow seems to be going backwards- if that makes sense. The balls aren't dropping after they go down the slide to pop back up. There is definatley air blowing, it just seems to be pushing the balls the wrong way. Has anyone else experienced this? And how did fix it?      Since there is air blowing, I didn't think it had to do with the batteries- but also haven't tried replacing them since we don't currently have any new ones of the size it needs.

20090223151606AAds2j7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Got pregnant with HEAVY bleeding, or is that not accurate?? PLEASE READ?	I was on birth control about 4 years. My lmp was on August 28th. I was on the pill, so it lasted a normal 4 days then I started the new pack on that Sunday. Well on the 3rd day of taking them I started bleeding super super heavy. No pain or anything. Just a ton of blood. And this lasted 4 days. Non stop heavy bleeding. Well after the first day of heavy bleeding I stopped taking my pill (as in i stopped it AFTER the bleeding started) cause I thought it was my body just doing its thing. I never went to the doctor, cause I was in no pain. Well it stopped on September 6th. I had unprotected sex on September 7th..then not again till September 13th, and then like evryday from the 17th till the 22nd. (my bf and I just moved back in with each other) And well my next period would have been on September 25th. It never came, so I took a pregnancy test...got a negative. So I waited until October 5th. Took another one and it was negative. So then on October 7th I took one in the morning and at night. Still a negative. Then I waited and took one 9th and it was a faint positive..took one again 3 hours later and it was a bit darker. So I knew I was preg. Went to the doctor and theres came out positive too.       Well. based on my lmp my due date is June 4th which is what the clinic gave me.   Well I went and had an ultrasound done and they told me there wasnt anything there and though it was an etopic preg. They tested my hgc and it was going up..so I went to another hosiptal and had an ultrasound done and they saw the baby, it was just very very small where I was super early. And that one put my due date at June 15th. Well I went to another hosiptal who dated my due date at June 16th. Well I had about 6 ultrasounds from 2 different doctors before my 12 week mark, and they all dated me at June 15th as my due date. And now at 23 weeks she is dating June 15th still. So based on ultrasounds she right on..but its some what off from my lmp. Based on my due date of ultrasound I got pregnant at around the time my next period was due to come. But based off my lmp I got preg a day after that crazy bleeding. Im confuced and need some advice. Its been on my mind.      Yes I kno babies will come when there ready.  And yes she is doing great and im healthy..but Its just been an issue with me and my doc. So im asking on here.

She has only had the stomach flu once, when she was 10 months.  Well about 1 week ago we were out kind of late so I fed my tot a jar baby food - it was Salmon and sweet potato by Beech Nut, and fed her an applesauce and milk.  About an hour later she threw it up.  It came back just how she ate it.  Well last night her dad fed her that same baby jar food again and this afternoon she throws up again.  But this time with a low grade fever.  She fell asleep right afterwards.  My husband thinks its because of that Beech nut Salmon Baby food, since both times they were fed to her she threw up.  But this time she threw up the next day after eating the Salmon dinner.  And the fever?  She also has a mild cold, with sneezing and some phlegm in her throat I can hear.  Could it be from the Salmon baby food?  Or is this a sign of something more serious?

My baby seems to get frustrated when reaching out to grab toys on her activity playmat. She'll grasp one of the dangling toys, and her movements are still somewhat spastic so she's unable to control the movement of the toy and then she ends up crying.      I noticed too that when I give her one of her other little toys to play with, she'll grab a hold of it but if it has too much crinkly noises or if she can't get it into her mouth easily, she starts getting cranky and then starts crying.      Do I just have a little chiona? LOL  (chiona is spanish for crybaby)   Awwww, my little sweetie.      Anyone else observe this with their baby?

I'm not sure if any of you have been following my questions but I had to have labwork today and was told that I had two sacs, one of which is gone.      Also, I found out that my HCG has almost tripled! I thought I had a miscarriage of just ONE baby but the doc that I dealt with in the ER said that she 'saw nothing' on the ultrasound. Turns out there were two sacs there.      The doctors said that if by Wednesday/Thursday, it (at minimum) doubles (HCG) then I might be on a positive path.      Do any of you have any experiences with this? I'm assuming they were fraternal twins b/c the one sac released itself on Sunday (it kinda looked like a placenta but I'm not sure that's what it was) but today, my hcg levels were shown to be rising.      Again, if you have any experiences, good or bad, please share. My HCG went up about 60% (if I did my calculations correctly).

How much allowance (per week) do you think we should give her?

(just found out)   :)      I've heard that morning sickness has started as early as 12 days fater conception.      Can you tell when you are getting morning sickness?      About twice or 3 times a day I tend to throw up a little in my mouth, burp a little and taste vomit.   Does this inidicate that morning sickness is coming? Is this a symptom at all?

20090223153655AAoHgMN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why do moms put their chunky girls in child pageants?	I know this is going to sound mean but please just hear me out. I think beauty is comprised on so many other facets besides physical appearence. That being said,if you are going to play by societal expectations of beauty by entering your child in a pageant then why would you enter your chunky daughter in one?      I just finished watching Toddlers and Tiaras on TLC, first and last time, disgusted me! I have a toddler of my own and would never put her in a child pageant but I was shocked to see one of the contestants. She was in the 10-12 age bracket and she was chunky and physically unfit. I don't mean curvy because curvy is beautiful at any size as long as you are fit, I mean chunky like her stomach was beyond pudgy. I think it is cute when it is a 2 year old and she still has some baby fat left but for a 12 year old? If you want your daughter to have some  physical appeal (which is so repulsive b/c she is 12 but to each their own) and she goes on stage looking like that then why would you be upset she lost against a thin contestant? My intention is not to insult anyone just to get some general feedback.

20090223154820AArJDgc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Severe bleeding after birth?	I was just wondering if anyone has ever had life threatening blood loss after the birth of their baby?  I did about one week after my c-section.  I had to have an emergency D&C and it stopped the bleeding, but overall I lost more than four pints.  Has this ever happened to anyone? The operating Dr. said it was leftover placenta and my dr said just giant blood clots. Not sure who is right.  Also did this bleeding effect future periods, as in were they heavier?  Just wondering - I am terrified the bleeding will start again and they won't be able to stop it this time.

Hi, I am a 17 year old girl, i just came back from seeing my doctor for a physical, i have not gone to him for about two years. He is usually nice you know, makes small talk but today something weird happened. He asked me to remove my clothes which i usually do and he felt my breasts. He usually does it for a few seconds but this time he was rubbing them and he flicked my nipple and told me i really have grown into a lady. It was like a tickle, it just made me feel weird. its weird when he was talking to me when he was doing that, When he checked my vaginal area, he did what he usually does but he said terrific at the end and smiled. After it was over, i was putting my  clothes on and i was about to leave and he kind of shook my hand but he rubbed my cleavage area, I left, told my parents but they said i was probably over reacting and the doctor always had to do this to his patients. Is it normal for the doctor to touch my nipples like that?

My daughter is 10 months old almost 11 months old and she does not hold her bottle at all. I have to hold it for her but she does hold a sippie cup and very well. She has been on a sippie cup for a while now. When she does drink from a bottle she only drank a ounce or two at a time and then wasnt interested in it anymore. She eats 3 meals a day, snacks in between and drinks whole milk very well. So i took her off a bottle. I was going to take her off it anyways at 1 year old but with all of that i just told you i thought i should do it now. Shes been off it for 2 days and 2 nights and doesnt even miss it. Now today my mother in law tells me thats dumb she needs a bottle and she called all her friends and told them about it and now they all think im crazy because her other grandkid wasnt off a bottle until 2 years old and I was wondering do you think im crazy or is this about right? I am her mother and I know whats best for her and i know i made the right decision but i was just wondering what others thought about this.

Her original routine is as follows:   6am wake up, diaper change, into bed with Mama for nursing   630-10 sleeps more   10am - wake up   2-3p nap   5-6p nap (30% of the time she sleeps, usually not tho)   6p dinner   7:30-8:15p bath   8:30-9p settle for bed   9p bed         Now her routine is    wake at 8-9a   nap at 1-3 or longer   nap at 5-6   dinner at 6 bath at 730-815p   settle and bed at 830-9   wakes up anytime between 12 and 3am      Also now that she stands she wont sit down and calm herself.

20090223155821AARqc2w	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Sort of a silly thing....does this happen to any of you?	Now that I'm a mom, I'm fascinated with all the new things they come out with- new bottles, new pacifiers, sippy cups (although my son hasn't found one he likes), clothes, teethers, etc....   Even bottle brushes- there IS a big difference is you've checked what's out there.   I hadn't been to Babies R Us in awhile - when I went to grab a bottle brush (my favorite), I see all these new little things- the new Nuby bottles, which are actually soft silicone (the actualy bottle)- new pacifiers.  The new bottle brush by Nuby (we don't even use Nuby- however they have really changed their look and upgraded)      My son is 11 months old, and won't be using a bottle for too much longer I should hope- so I wasn't about to buy new ones...      But I whenever I see something new, I always want to try it- it's how I came across the Sassy MAM bottles we use now.  At first glance, I thought cute, let's try them- then my "practical brain" kicked in and said no, we've used Born Free this whole time- (Ultivents weren't @ Babies R Us previously)- but I bought one, since they sell singles. They turned out to be a perfect match for my son- he eats better with them and they really are great.  So one mom ended up with some great gently used Born Free bottles for practically nothing, while my son ended up with his dream bottles.      I'm proud of my son for growing into such a big boy, but always want to try these new things that come out!!  I'm such a geek!!      Anyone ever feel like this?

20090223160318AAWnQrX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Are all 12yr old's like this? How do I stop my 12yr old from being so forgetful all the time?	My son has a really really bad memory... but only when he's been asked to do something. He'll remember conversations and situations from years ago that my partner and I can't even remember! But when we ask him to empty the bin or feed the cats, he'll get sidetracked by almost anything and forget. For example, I asked him to put his uniform in the laundry, he saw the cat whilst walking to his bedroom and "poof" he's forgotten. It happens pretty much all the time, it's a daily occurance, and it happens a number of times in a day. Also, he forgets things his teachers have told him all the time. He forgot to wear his formal uniform to school the other day when all the other kids were wearing theirs. He's meant to make his bed before he leaves for school and he'll forget unless I remind him. I tell him when he gets home that he forgot to make his bed and to please remember tomorrow, but he still forgets!       Oh - and he has 2 lists in his room, one for morning and one for afternoon of everything he needs to do. But we still have to remind him to check his list, then we have to go through the list one by one ask him if he's done everything to make sure he has = otherwise he forgets... It's getting really, really, really annoying.      Are other kids his age the same? Because it doesn't seem like it...

I went to the L&D room yesterday and my doctor checked to see if my water had broken which it had not so she sent me home saying it was just my baby breaching. So my fiance and I went home everything was fine for awhile till i went down for dinner then i started having really bad tightening in my stomach. It lasts between 1-2 mins goes away and comes back either an hour or just a few mins later.  Starting last night i started to experience pressure in my lower abdomen with the contractions which at times are painful but not doubling over painful. If I try to lay really still and not move at all the contractions finally disappear the contractions are worse when i move around like going to the bathroom and it feels like i'm about to drop something from my stomach cause there is alot of pressure when i get up and move. If anyone has suggestions  on what to do till Wed it would be great thats when i have my doctors app
