20090222145155AAFhTpG	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Are Conservatives doing anything to put more women in positions of political power?	I get all misty eyed when I think of that far off day when all of the pimps and knights are finally out of the way, and the madonnas (conservative women) and the whores (liberal women) can sit down and clean up this mess of a world that is the legacy of all male rule.  (For those of you who like to cut and paste my quotes, then present them out of context on your own questions, I am not calling women "whores".  I am referring to the division that patriarchy created for women and and the labels used to identify the two groups.)      Does anybody know if the conservative feminists are doing anything similar to the current push by NOW to get more women in politics?  I know we leftist feminists disagree a lot with our counter parts on the right, but we've always shared the same sentiment of eventual equal rule.  I sure hope they're doing something.  Anybody in the know?

20090222151014AAYVwsV	Politics & Government;Immigration	Skilled – Independent (Residence) visa (subclass 885) - Australia?	My wife and I are applying for Skilled – Independent (Residence) visa (subclass 885) in Australia, my wife is the main applicant as she has concluded a master degree in Australia, but because of IELTS we lost 10 points and now the time is clicking for us as we’re going to lose 5 points because of our age soon and unfortunately the next available date for IELTS is not good for us, we’re now trying to regain 10  points from the “partner skills” and “language community” criteria, but the DIAC website is not clear.      My doubts are:      Partner Skills -      I have a permanent job in AUS in an occupation on the skilled occupation list (SOL) and I’ve been doing this job for more than 1 year in the last 2 years but two of the evidences that the DIAC says I have to provide are:       - a positive skills assessment from the relevant assessing authority for my nominated occupation from the Skilled Occupation List (SOL)      -evidence that I meet the recent work experience      Question is: If I have been working in an occupation from (SOL) in Australia for the past 1.5 years, do I still need to go through a skill assessment? That doesn’t make sense to me, I was checking the relevant assessing authority (computer society in my case) and it’s costly and takes about 10-12 weeks to get the assessment.      Community Language -      The DIAC says that we have to give evidence of a qualification (of equivalent standard to an Australian degree) gained from a university where instruction was in one of the languages from their list, evidences are an attach certified copies of my wife’s degree, academic transcript and a letter from her university stating the language in which her course was conducted, no problem at all but the trick here is that it says that the degree has to be equivalent standard to an Australian degree which leads me to believe that she will need to submit her degree for assessment with the computer society and that comes down to the same problem in the partner skill criterion, it’s costly and takes 10-12 weeks.      Does anybody know something or have any experience to share? I'm trying to find out if we need to validate our degrees with the relevant assessing authority to get the points for both criteria?      Thanks,   Alex

Potential options:      - No major changes, just liquidate the bad assets, and maintain the US Dollar as the major reserve currency?      - A system of free-floating regional currencies, similar to that proposed by UK PM Gordon Brown?      - Fixed exchange rates with existing national currencies?      - A single world currency with fixed supply (the hypothetical "Globo") to replace the US dollar as the world's settlement/reserve currency, with countries free to determine the exchange regime?      - A modified variant of Bretton Woods, with the US Dollar pegged to gold, silver, or a basket of commodities?      - Replacement of the US dollar with a new currency fully backed by some tangible asset?      - Something else entirely?      Also, I anticipate many of you will say a gold standard; if so, how would we solve the problem of too little gold physically in existence, and the need for vast quantities of gold for industry?

What I want to know is why there seems to be a disproportionate amount of Democrats in poorly educated, Section 8 ridden communities. Any thoughts?"      Many of the responses I got said I was making generalizations (which is a fair argument), or, that I was "Pretending to be be black," that I'm a "Self-hating racist," or best of all, "You can't be black, you're conservative!"      Umm.... In my question, I made NO REFERENCE to race. PERIOD. Since when does being black mean you MUST be a democrat? Since when does living in the 'hood mean it is all black? Since when does being race have ANYTHING to do with political views?

I'll begin the discussion by suggesting a $15,000 tax credit for anyone who invests in a house in default in 2009. I think this is a better idea than trying to keep folks who are in houses they can't afford in their houses.

20090222111727AAJzRP2	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How to reduce America's crime rate?	My dad and I had a discussion about this over breakfast this morning.  America has a high crime rate and he proposed two things:      1. Death row immates should be allowed 4 years to appeal before they are executed.  After that time period, they would be executed.      2. Mild caning for petty thieves and other related criminals to deter crime (I DO NOT agree with my dad on this).  He feels this wouldn't necessarily turn the U.S. into a police state but says that if it works for certain South Asian countries, then it could work for us because it would supposedly deter would-be criminals, thus lowering the prison/jail population (I woefully disagree with my dad but he makes a good point).        Dad proposes these two ideas because 1.) prisons are overcrowded and 2.) some prisons have become some sort of "Club Med" where cellmates can work out, watch TV, and even receive a college education behind bars when they should be paying their debts to society (years ago, one of my English professors suggested that prisoners get a single mattress on the floor and be "forced" to work their way to earn an actual bed to sleep on and so forth).

Did we already know this  ?	~~~~   ~~and were more concerned that Iran's nuclear capabilities far surpassed those of the US or Israel?  and that Israel wanted to 'bomb away' so that it could never be proven that Iran was indeed creating nuclear power?      The Associated Press: February 21, 2009   Iran To Begin Operation of First Nuclear Power Plant   The long-delayed preliminary phase of operations for Iran's first nuclear power plant will begin on Wednesday, the state atomic energy agency said Sunday. A nuclear official in Russia, which is helping build the plant, however, said no major milestone is expected on Wednesday. "The pilot stage operation of the power plant will start on Wednesday," Iranian atomic agency spokesman Mohsen Delaviz told the state news agency.     He added that the preliminary phase will take place during a visit by Sergei Kiriyenko, the head of Russia's state nuclear agency.       The long-awaited 1,000-megawatt light-water reactor, which was built in the southern Iranian port of Bushehr with the help of Russia under a $1 billion contract, was previously scheduled to become operational in fall 2008. Some 700 Iranian engineers were trained in Russia to operate the power plant   In 1992, Iran signed an agreement with Russia to complete the project and work began on it in 1995.       The U.S. has long opposed the deal, citing concerns that it could help Tehran develop nuclear weapons, but it softened its position after Iran agreed to return spent the nuclear fuel from the reactor to Russia - a measure aimed to ensure it doesn't extract plutonium to make atomic bombs.       Russia says there is no evidence that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons and has joined China in weakening Western-backed sanctions in the United Nations Security Council, arguing that punishing Tehran too harshly for its nuclear activities would be counterproductive.       The Bushehr plant will use enriched uranium imported from Russia, rather than domestically produced fuel. Fuel deliveries began in 2007.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      How up to date are our nuclear facilities?   How up to date are the nuclear facilities of Israel?

20090222103820AATmPZT	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	To pay for the roads some states want to put a gps in your car and tax you for every mile?	Lost tax revenue, and no money to pay for roads is going to come from somewhere! Perhaps  a tax on the goods that are being picked up at the ports and driven from Texas to Michigan to Canada or other port areas to get the foreign goods delivered!  Since  goods are not made here, companies have gone to places like Mexico to save millions in tax dollars that leaves people driving 50miles to jobs, costs consumer with his lower paid job, higher gas get there and now extra fees to accommodate business.    Great for business. I love small business but they are getting the raw deal while big ones get the benefits to have high profits?  These "representatives " thinking?  Perhaps we need a new group of govt that decides to cut back the pensions of these four year  jobs with life long benefits that do nothing more then  soak the taxpayers while they continue to get paid? Govt, needs a gps to account for what they do or not do with more votes from taxpayers .    Do you have any thoughts on how to repair roads in this country with no money? Do you  think  idea is to have the "contractors" require citizens" to work on the project instead of the owner making huge profits and no responsibility to a poor job?.    In the 50's when govt built roads throughout the US for military, which we all use today, was it the military that did the work?  Some argue that we do not want govt in charge of these projects, but handing out money to lame indpendant companies that use shoddy material and have to be redone in 10yrs is nuts. A freebie to business is all it is. Some areas use better materials as they should and the cost is  no savings when it does not last. Perhpas insist on warranty? There are many states and places that have hard winters yet some states have worse roads . The joke in MI is for the whole county 30 mile stretch, there are barrells up for construction and NO work being done! Fall comes and the barrells are down.  I wonder if  ton paid for barrells and signs and no money was left for anything else. I have seen good signs replaced and where signs should be, there are none!    Perhaps govt should use the tax money more effecientlly instead. Spring is around cornere, and they say no roads are going to get fixed, what have they done with money they have collected? Was it being saved, it certainly wasn't spent on anything anyone can see!   What ideas do you have? How can they get implemented?

20090222051436AA7bE0Q	Politics & Government;Government	Does this sum up your feelings about the New York Post cartoon?	Open Letter to the New York Post      Dear Editor:      I'm trying to understand what possible motivation you may have had for publishing that vile cartoon depicting the shooting of the chimpanzee that went crazy.  I guess you thought it would be funny to suggest that whomever was responsible for writing the Economic Recovery legislation must have the intelligence and judgment of a deranged, violent chimpanzee, and should be shot to protect the larger community.  Really?  Did it occur to you that this suggestion would imply a connection between President Barack Obama and the deranged chimpanzee?  Did it occur to you that our President has been receiving death threats since early in his candidacy?  Did it occur to you that blacks have historically been compared to various apes as a way of racist insult and mockery?  Did you intend to invoke these painful themes when you printed the cartoon?        If that's not what you intended, then it was stupid and willfully ignorant of you not to connect these easily connectable dots.  If it is what you intended, then you obviously wanted to be grossly provocative, racist and offensive to the sensibilities of most reasonable Americans.  Either way, you should not have printed this cartoon, and the fact that you did is truly reprehensible.  I can't imagine what possible justification you have for this.  I've read your lame statement in response to the outrage you provoked.  Shame on you for dodging the real issue and then using the letter as an opportunity to attack Rev. Sharpton.  This is not about Rev. Sharpton.  It's about the cartoon being blatantly racist and offensive.      I believe in freedom of speech, and you have every right to print what you want.  But freedom of speech still comes with responsibilities and consequences.  You are responsible for printing this cartoon, and I hope you experience some real consequences for it.  I'm personally boycotting your paper and won't do any interviews with any of your reporters, and I encourage all of my colleagues in the entertainment business to do so as well.  I implore your advertisers to seriously reconsider their business relationships with you as well.      You should print an apology in your paper acknowledging that this cartoon was ignorant, offensive and racist and should not have been printed.       I'm well aware of our country's history of racism and violence, but I truly believe we are better than this filth.  As we attempt to rise above our difficult past and look toward a better future, we don't need the New York Post to resurrect the images of Jim Crow to deride the new administration and put black folks in our place.  Please feel free to criticize and honestly evaluate our new President, but do so without the incendiary images and rhetoric.      Sincerely,   John Legend
20090222155038AAGYzqZ	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you think our U.S government is making some bad decisions?	It seems to me that we are falling in one hole after another with all these bailouts. I believe if we had put money in the housing market problem much sooner. then we would not have been in such bad shape now. What I am trying to say is this. The reason for the problems we have now stem from the banks giving bad mortgages to people who really should not have been able to get these loans because they can't pay them back. If the government would had jumped on this in the first month of an increase in foreclosures then house values would not have gone down below the loan value and the economy would be in much better shape. But they waited waited way to long. What do you think?

Since U.S. Ground Forces are ambivalent about leaving Iraq, maybe they SHOULD stay a little longer, if only to clean up the mess created by Invading them in 2003.  It's just unfortunate we have to fight in Iraq when we could have focused on Afghanistan and maybe also Pakistan.

He knows I don't like that. I turned around and told him to knock it off. Another guy, Leif, grabbed my waist. I hit him in the arm, pulled out some perfume (LOL first thing I could reach in my pocket) I sprayed it in his face, like pepper spray or something. Alex did the hug thing again, so I did the same thing. He started cussing me out. He then stole my very expensive (lol I dunno how expensive, they had my name embroydered from lasersticks.com) drumsticks. A few minutes later He gave them to leif. I told them that I wanted them back the next day cause I have a test in beggining band.       The next day they told me they gave them to a girl named Chelsea who hates my guts. She then broke them.         I told them I would tell the principle for not only theft but sexual harassment, unless they buy me a new pair exacly the same.      They told me that I would get in more trouble than they would.      Who would get in how much trouble?       PS they have been doing those things for months. Well they might have been doing that last year. I was to preoccupied to remember such things. So IDK.      Also the school does have a bias against me for some reason. So that automattically gives them more of a chance at winning.

And then i also join the ROTC which will allow me to complete my schooling and give me a monthly stipend my jr and sr year while training me to be an officer.       It just sounds a little too good to be true, are there any hidden terms to agreeing to this? Or is it all golden how it looks? I mean, 26k per year for 1 weekend a month + 2 weeks out of the year and a few hours per week for ROTC? Sign me up if it's as simple as that.       Also, would it be better to join ROTC first since i would then be assured that i cannot be deployed and then join National Guard? Or does it matter? And does national guard have basic training? Maybe i should take that in the summer, but then i'd be kind of worried about getting deployed? I know i'd see combat eventually anyways, but i really want to get my degree.       thanks for any info.

I am currently in my second semester of college as a freshman, and as much as I like all of the parties and people, I do not feel "happy" I guess you could say. I hate being in the classroom, I make decent grades and all, but I always feel like I could be doing more. I was going to join straight out of high school, but I promised my mother that I would try out the whole college thing first before I enlisted. Well, I tried it and it still feels like I am missing out on life. I am not joining just to have something to do. I want to join, because I think it will help my character. I grew up without a dad, and I am an only child myself, so all my life it was basically just me and my mom. I never really had any father figure to "teach me the ropes" of being a man. I want to build my character, and learn how to take care and be responsible for my own self without my mother always being the one I can fall back on. I have also lived in this same city for all 18 years of my life. I have been out of state once and that was to Oklahoma so that really doesn't even count! ( I am in texas btw) I have never seen the ocean. I have always wanted to see the world though and I understand that the Navy can do that for me. I was thinking about doing 2 maybe 4 years of active duty in the Navy then come back to college with a better mind set to pursue my degree. Is the Navy right for me? Anybody with prior experience, please aid me in this decision. Do you have good memories and times from when you were active in the Navy? Would you do it again?

How can anyone think otherwise?
20090222115818AANmg8p	Politics & Government;Politics	Why have we, as Republicans, abondoned using   fear to market our candidates?	I get the sense that I may receive several negative responses from the far-left for asking this question, so I am going to address these proactively. I AM NOT advocating widespread (too much) fear among the American Public. I am, however, advocating sparking enough fear in the American Public for it to band together and support our candidates, and refuse to buy in to the obvious and proven socialism of the liberal left. Why have we abandoned using this tactic? It worked for us in every election from 1992-2004, and the instant we let up on it, our party lost both houses of congress and the Presidency. Now, with the election of the edgeless and dopey Michael Steele to lead our party, I fear our party's collapse is in the making. Why have we let Karl Rove (the genius behind our meteoric rise to power) hang in limbo as we are doing at the current point? Why our the moderates in our party trying to destroy it and turn it into something it isn't?

"Cheering crowds and 17 members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police greeted President Obama as he arrived in Ottawa, Canada, on his first international trip since entering the White House.      The response was so positive he once accidentally almost referred to Ottawa as Iowa, the state where his presidential career took off 13 months ago. Canadian newspapers sang his praises, crowds lined the streets as the president made his way to Parliament Hill and locals screamed, "I love you," as Obama shopped for souvenirs at downtown Ottawa's Byward Market."       http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/President...

20090222125157AAsIXCO	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you think millionaires should still be covered by S.S. and Medicare?	The Dems are so strident in taxing the rich, who have taken advantage of all the loopholes & often do not pay their taxes, why are they so adamant that these same people be covered by Social Security and Medicare, like the 'common people'? They have used this money for their pork projects and people living on S.S. & Medicare are limited in their care, forced to buy supplemental health insurance & no one can can possibly realize how many more years they will have to work & how much more they will have to pay.  Too many die before they collect a cent of this 'so called' insurance or benefits.  The politicians count on this.  Nationalized health care will have the option of deciding who gets care and in essence who will live or die.      They tell us they do not want the less advantaged to feel inferior but I find this a very lame excuse.  The less advantaged could only be better off if these politicians & millionaires paid their own way.  They got rich off the backs of the common worker.      These people have more than enough to take care of themselves and their families so wouldn't It makes more sense for them to save for their retirement and medical care instead of taking advantages of those who count on this little bit of help.      To add insult to injury they re-tax social security payment.  If you can educate me on the fairness I would appreciate it.

So, after that, she was a pro-choice patriot, wearing stickers on her backpack at college, waving pro-choice signs, etc.      So then, she graduated college, got married, and had a 'wanted' pregnancy. It was only this time she valued it as a human life. In the first trimester, and she had a miscarriage! And she cried buckets over it.      So, how can the 'unwanted' baby be just a clump of cells, when the 'wanted' baby was viewed as a human life, when they were both in the same stages of pregnancy?       Are babies only human if they're wanted?

My hobbie is the military, i've always loved it, but over the past couple of years, i don't think it makes me happy anymore. I don't know if it was the Iraq war or the massive explosion in anti-war protests, but it's become increasingly difficult to enjoy such a hobbie, without being hated by people, its even made me quite an enemy among some.      I do like to talk about what way and how we would strike say, North Korea and Iran, not that i'm supporting such things, just that because its my hobbie, i think its interesting about how we would do it. I support nuclear weapons and i understand the importance of nuclear deterrance, but this obviously brings me in direct confflict with a lot of people. I love spy novels and secret service stuff, and when people find out about that, they go ballistic saying "there were no WMD's!" almost threatening me, out of nowhere. I support our troops regardless of which war there in, yet out of nowhere i'm accussed of "wanting to bomb civilans! that i'm a murderer!" I supported "The Surge", why? well, military stuff is my hobbie, and i think about the best military way forward and i thought it was this, which turned out to be correct. Once when i was being heckled in a conversation about military stuff by an anti-war protester, i turned around to them and said, "Shut up! leave me alone, i'm not a murderer, i don't want to bomb civilans, and nar do our troops, they are not told to bomb civilans, and there isn't and never has been such an F'n plicy!" But almost immediatly after saying this, i'm accused of wanting to make love to George Bush, and i'm like "Eh! Where the hell is this coming from"    Your thoughts and views?
20090222112145AA1tVj9	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How to file charges against an abusive boss?	I am seriously thinking of filing charges against my abusive boss, but I don't know how to start or if I should. Please advise.      We had a huge emergency at home, which required my immediate attention and needed me to leave work for the day. I was working overtime on that day which was actually my day-off.      At the time, I was assigned on location, so that meant I just couldn't leave my station just like that or just abandon my post. A family member who lives alone had a heart attack. I asked my boss if I could go to attend to the crisis. He said no and yelled and said "Work is work and I don't care if she is dying."       I asked the higher ups to allow me to leave my post and had made arrangements with colleagues, who were more than willing to take my place so I could go. The higher up sent me back to my boss who again didn't allow me to go. He has been verbally abusive amongst others not only to me but to others prior to the emergency. But that's another story.       Because I wasn't able to attend to the emergency and get everything sorted out, I was forced to resign instead and resulted to a death of a loved one.      I'd just like to know if I could file a case against my former boss? I am not after money. I have heard that he is still abusive to my colleagues who are afraid of speaking up and losing their jobs. I badly want to teach him a lesson as well.      I forgot to mention, his immediate superior is allegedly romantically involved with him for over a year now, so I heard. His boss also covers for him every time he does something wrong.       The Human Resource Department head somehow cannot seem to put these two in their right places.      What would you do if you were me? What do you suggest?   Thank you for your time.

Background::   Week before last, the President said the stimulus would allow Caterpillar to bring back some of its recently laid off workers.       But Caterpillar CEO Jim Owens says that's not exactly the case. In fact, Owen says, Caterpillar will probably need to layoff additional workers before any rehiring takes place       Owens also cautioned that even if a stimulus is passed within the next month, the effects will not be immediate and are more likely to impact construction activity at the end of 2009 or spring 2010"      Did we miss the retraction where O said he lied?

20090222122612AAM11Rr	Politics & Government;Politics	Is the Vatican Behind the Mess and Revolution the Entire World is Now in?	I say this because what's happening is rather strange.  People all around are telling us we have to sacrifice our sons and daughters into the most ridiculous war "for our freedoms" are now constantly telling us about Martial Law coming and are making arrangements for this Martial Law all around the country, even making detention camps and coffins  in large numbers.         http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P-hvPJPT...       They are showing that they know something we do not.  When we interview these people on the internet and show how all this expensive repair work against 19 hijackers, fierce no-fly-zones and horrifying defeated dictators is not necessary, they never answer our questions but appear and constantly give us mental diagnoses and pharmaceutical advice, like the Communists and Nazis always did, telling us we have to take our meds because we think differently.  When we reveal to them BOLD AND PUBLIC DEATH THREATS AGAINST ALL WHO ARE NOT CATHOLIC, they just dance right over the evidence as if such threats are supposed to be an everyday circumstance and begin a persistent attack against those who expose these bold threats, telling them how evil they are for even thinking such threats are an issue.       http://www.TheirSecrets.info/AC/AppealCh...       We do not assume that anyone who acts like this proves he's a Japanese.  There is only one group of people throughout history that were like this, and the people who brought this evidence to us are still called, "Anti-Catholic."  Protestants were indeed by nature "Anti-Catholic," but history shows that Rome was always, Anti-EVERYTHING ELSE.      Then, as they become more bold, they issue public postings telling us that the Vatican controls the United States.  One poster by the name of "Maude" wrote this on the following webpage:      WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PURPOSE OF THE WARS:    http://www.TheirSecrets.info/iraqwar.htm       Contrary to the need to correct anyone who is not politically correct "or free to voice their opinions," this poster has never been opposed yet except for us who are usually given the free mental and pharmaceutical diagnoses by "freedom fighters."      That website shows a total war that's carried everywhere when a certain group of strange people all over the world start wars to "save innocent lives," then take more lives than the enemy they are supposed to attack to make them stop, and then when the American people even vote against those wars, their votes don't count.      We went to war to stop Saddam from taking innocent lives.  Why is it then that, like the Third Reich, we wound up taking far more lives than Saddam ever did?      Many strongly resisted the Iraq War and claimed that Saddam Hussein didn't have WMDs from his contained post in no-fly-zones.  Those people were given so much mental diagnoses and pharmaceutical advice for doing that, it's a wonder since it was proven that they were right, the mental and pharmaceutical diagnoses against them have more than doubled by the same people who were proved wrong.      Is there any other people on earth who can see the boldest public death threats against all who are not Catholic and then make war with anyone who doesn't like those threats?

I signed up for GEICO insurance and was told that my policy would be efective as of that day.  Later on that day while driving home from work, I was in an accident. When i called GEICO to report it, they first said that they were unable to find my policy.  But after beign on hold for what seemed like forever, they came back on the phone and said that my policy was not effective until the 20th, even though the cards they sent me in email were dated the 19th.  When I got hoem later that night I had new insurance cards in my email dated the 20th.  I called GEICO back and asked why they had changed the date and was given the answer of the customer service rep i spoke to that mornign had entered the wrong date and that my policy would not be effectiv euntil the next day.  Well Friday mornign rolls around and I get a call from the claims adjuster telling me that i am under investigation for fraud, because she finds it hard to believe that I was in an auto accident the same day that I saigned up for insurance. And that it wll take up to 6 months for the investigation, and until that time they were unable to settle my claim.  So, what do I do now, that was my only vehicle and i can't wait 6 months while GEICO plays around with me. Its a clean claim. I have a filed police report, eye whitnesses and the person invoved in the accident.

If that's not physically possible, they should die brutally. I think capital punishment is good but too soft on the criminal.  I think that if everyone knows who committed the crime but there isn't much physical evidence, the person should still be sentenced. I think if the crime had to do with murder or rape then the victim's family has the right to kill the perpetrator.      What's you take on punishment?      Please don't just argue with my point of view, I want to hear what your take is on punishment, not my views.      Thanks!

I just returned from France  (visiting my fiancee) after a 2 month stay. I am an American citizen so it was not necessary for me to get a visa for such a short stay.

I just enlisted in the navy reserves and I am in the delayed entry program waiting to ship in june.  Over the last few months I have been thinking about quitting my job as a full time police officer and going in to the navy full time.  One of the factors I have been wondering about is how exactly does BAH work when you are active duty and you have a house.  I was wondering if it would be mandatory for me to live in base housing with my fionce' (soon very soon to be husband), or would I be able to live at home with him? I live in norfolk va so i would hope to come back here although i know it is based on the needs of the military.  And if we are made to live in military housing would we get BAH and BAS once we are married or not ?  I was told that if you live on base you get no BAH or BAS but what about if you have a spouse and children does anything change?  Just trying to way all the odds, sorry for the long question.

On aug 08 i was made redundant on the same day with out notice. this was now the second time this had happened to me with the same company! After the first time i decided to join a union in i should fall into troubles again.    I contacted my union. this was the first time i had used them. I was instructed to arrange a greivance meeting. The first meeting was a hash as my rep did not pick up that i had made a mistake in my letter and the meeting was not official!. We did finally get the grievance meeting before the 3 month deadline and were waiting a reply from my former employer. Could never get in contact with my officer and the main office seemed to struggle too. Eventually i got a reply and informed the union and case was passed to another officer.    I was asked if i had filled in a ET1 tribunal form i replied no and asked what it was. They were concerned as there is a 90 day time limit which is very strict. I went to there solicitors and they were concerned. too. I waited for a reply to see if i could get a tribunal. no was the answer and they adviced me to get legal advice.   I feel extremly let down by the union who i felt would be there for me and put my trust in them. should they have advised me about this form?   The really upsetting thing is my old employer have got away with it again. not a happy boke!

Joy Behar interviewed Ann Coulter Thursday night on "Larry King Live" (Joy was subbing for Larry). In a wide-ranging discussion, that at times grew heated, Coulter spouted off on everything from the stimulus package, her recent appearance on "The View," her feelings on Rush Limbaugh as the voice of conservative America (hint: she likes it), and whether Americans hate her ("I'm very popular," Ann boasted, citing her seven New York Times bestsellers).

20090222135705AAQBc2y	Politics & Government;Elections	Republican Governor Crist is in support of the stimulus?	Governor Crist said:       "There are times when you’re in a crisis and we all need to work together in order to get through those crises. And I think this is one of those times.  This is a “time of need” for many citizens."      Given that not a single Republican House member and only three Republican Senators supported the stimulus, the governors' comments seem directed at their own party.      Crist went so far as to say it “may be” a mistake for Republicans to define themselves in opposition to the stimulus, when pressed by host David Gregory.      “It’s not a matter of bucking the party,” Crist said of his decision to support the stimulus, including stumping for it in Florida with President Barack Obama. “It’s a matter of helping the people. I really view it as an issue what can I do that’s best for the people of Florida.”

20090222131426AAa3Fvd	Politics & Government;Military	Military Branch That Will Educate A Woman?	I've always wanted to join the Military since I was young. It runs in my family- my Grandpa was a Marine, my Grandma was in the NAVY, my uncle was in the NAVY, my Dad tried the Marines, and my mom has been to a NAVY boot camp. I would be the first one of my two other siblings to do it, but I don't know which branch is right for me.     I'm 19 years old, and in my first semester of college for a Biological Sciences major, and I am really hoping to continue my education until I get at least my B.A., preferably an M.A.     I've looked into the Coast Guard because they have a school that has Environmental Science as one of its majors, as well as a Band program (I also do music).    Would this be a good choice for me? I know there are lots of you out there that are in the Military, and I'm hoping some of you might be able to help me out. I'm looking for a branch that will educate me, rather than get me ready for combat.     I haven't talked to a recruiter yet because I need to lose some weight first. I would feel awkward going up there now, and then hear them tell me that I need to lose about 40lbs. I'd rather lose the weight first so I don' have to hear crap about it when I talk to them.     I hope you guys can help me out! This is something I really want to do to better myself, my future, and to help our country...

20090222134543AA92mhO	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	DUI/OUI Question?! Breathalyzer?	Ok so relatively quick story here. My friend was pulled over last night (for reasons STILL unknown to us) and the officer who approached our car had asked if he had anything to drink. Driver responded that he had had only 2 beers. Officer took him out the car and performed a FIELD SOBRIETY TEST. Now he passed fine on the tests BUT on the 3rd one, he was asked to do the ABC's. Now, English is not his primary language, Portuguese is. He went from E to M, caught himself, but was notgiven a chance to correct it. Placed under arrest immediately. Was not given a Breathalyzer test at any point while he was in custody, nor was he given his Miranda Rights at any point in custody. They also wouldnt let us drive his car (although I was the only one who could drive it because it's stick, and I was pretty much sober by this time), so they towed it even though we ASKED can we just take it. This morning, he went to find out the details of where he has to go to court, and to ask for his license and hat. They told him they destroyed his license so now he has nothing, and has court tmrw at 8am.      now MY question is: aren't police required to give/offer a breathalyzer to determine "drunkness"? This guy was sober like crazy; I don't understand how they arrested him without accurate proof? Also, wasn't he supposed to get his Miranda Rights?      This is in the state of Massachusetts by the way; we all go to UMass Amherst      Thank you in advance for your answers..

Im a pro legalizationalist I love the drug and think it should be legalized.  I come from a family of alcoholics and have recently stopped smoking pot but in turn have started drinking.  The only reason ive done this is because i cant afford to smoke pot and get busted.  Another reason why I have quit cause it seems like the older you get the harder it is to find.  I want to see America get over the fact that people smoke and enjoy a fairly harmless substance.  I mean its natural for crying out loud.  Come on people voice your opinions and tell me if your in favor or against marijuana.
