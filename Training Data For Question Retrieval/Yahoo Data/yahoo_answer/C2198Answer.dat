ef2e71a8b6d543b0d52169db527810e7aa	It does not matter -- what does matter is the pokémon that you use the vitamins on.  It's better to use the vitamins on an evolved pokémon, because when it is at it's final evolution, the base stats that are required will be put into play.  Then, putting EV's into your pokémon with vitamins will be a better benefit than when the pokémon is not at it's final stage.  Otherwise, the time that you feed your pokémon vitamins does not matter.<br>  <br>  My advice is not to feed your pokémon 10 of each vitamin (which you cant anyway, because the max EV's are less than 600).  It's wise to train EV in 2-3 skills than to do in all.|`|13b810cdde7fa401588f2cc2f748e150aa	Level 50 - cause your pokemon stats will be already 100 and they cant go over 100 so its no point on leving up to lv 100|`|gVbHA0fQaa	Level 50, 100 is too late.|`|o0sH4kipaa	both it will make it stronger

It has bad Graphics. and slow movement. but good gameplay the only thig its mising is multiplayer!
kfFQRvZtaa	No, i think nintendo has the same thing worldwide for gba|`|A0yr8gVjaa	yeah u could cuz i have the same games as yours and i always beat the gym leaders and elite 4 cuz my charizard is on level 99|`|f4L6T2Lraa	Absolutely not. If the game didn't work, the gameboy itself would warn you when you put it in and turn it on. Enjoy your Australian Pokemon Yellow!
HzqR1hqWaa	Your question poses a slight plight,<br>  Though you seem more than a mite bright.<br>  If I offend Magenta,<br>  Then I truly repenta,<br>  But you really should spell write right.
qm3W7EQPaa	Well, you got to read the rules first. Here's a very good source.|`|VEU0ktbDaa	damage counters are how much damage youve done, and you put it on your pokemon. weakness i think doubles the attack power, and resistence minuses 30 from the attack of the poke mon. ( preety sure, havent played for awhile)|`|o0sH4kipaa	follow the rules in the booklet that you recived with the pack of cards it will tell you every thing you need to know about Pokemon card games it will tell you what to do and what the Pokemon can do and what it will do

AA10416237	Snorlax. The one with more defense and HP. Or you could try steelix too. Its high - very high defense makes up for its low attack. And maybe also try Gallade, high attack.|`|o0sH4kipaa	do you have a good Pokemo yet I want that game  so much|`|617d52239e55a1ba3ded5e7793725d0faa	garchomp

i84D9j5Paa	I would go for the regular edition unless you are either a collector, huge RE fan, or have some money to burn.    It's the same game, and you don't really need any of that extra stuff for $30..|`|hjbKQ7IKaa	i thought all of that stuff was worth another  30 bucks so i reserved the special edition  i would recommend u get the special edition.|`|lcy7F8izaa	i would go for the regular edition
ySnny27Raa	Yes. I mean are they even real animals that you can speak to and pet?    But I have to say, they're a great invention for kids who's parents won't let them get a pet.    -Porridge|`|PY2q9pBPaa	They're just brine shrimp.     But they could be entertaining if you did what Cartman did to his Sea Monkeys in South Park.|`|VjFkybpvaa	extravagantly so!|`|QIv9jeJ1aa	why is this categorized under toys? and how much do they cost?|`|EK3nwsAcaa	yes  they are horrible anyway|`|wbyVocSjaa	YESS!!!!|`|tNhFC1fmaa	Yes and BTW, Triops are better!
Klw3Ke3Haa	Yeah, probably.
YweJ1PfUaa	practice leading your shots with the battle rifle, practice using the sniper.learn the weapon spawns on every map, don't rush the other team if your in the lead. try jumping when an enemy with rockets approaches. don't run at a guy with a power weapon. rockets are an exception since if your close enough they will kill themselves too.learn how to bounce grenades, and the rest is up to practice|`|e5RBM1xMaa	Well Obviously practice will make you better ive been playing since halo 1 so im pretty good.Oh and always move around alot if someone is shooting at you dont give them a  clear shot and always aim for the head exspecially when you have a BR or carbine and melee alot|`|HspgRRSlaa	Theres not really no tips or Strategies or secrets really|`|6VZ8Ej4Aaa	Shoot bad guys, stay alive. All there is to it.|`|c8M4Y1Xfaa	Well, As a halo 3 gamer, I think the best strategy depends on the game type for instants, lone wolves... sneek attacks are always good on any game varient but its good on this one, first shot usually makes it alot easier to win the battle, try and go for the best weapons on map first, like shotgun on guardian, everyone goes for that, and if your first you should camp there (crouching) and wait for the rest to come. Also if a group of people are fighting, wait and when his/her sheild are down attack the group or remaining players. On team matches its good to work together and use vehicles, but make sure the other team doesn't have a anti-vehicle weapon before you start scrambling into a warthog. and finally... try and use the various things like powerdrain, bubble sheild (good for shotty), grav lift (good for sniping) and try and be creative with weapons normally people dont go for like plasma rifle, mauler, spiker, needler and smg's. And Dont forget to duel-weild    Thanks

FGIaKsPsaa	i'd say fable 1 is better but no you do not have to play the first one in order to understand the second one; the story line in 2 isn't a continuation of 1.|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Fable 2 is set many centuries after the first Fable. Having played the first Fable is not required to get the story. I personally think it's a reasonable game. Certainly worth playing, but not going in any top tens.|`|efqoz08qaa	It definitely isn't necessary to play fable 1 to get fable 2's story. I would however recommend playing through fable 1 because seeing how the world has changed over 500 years in fable 2 is cool and there are some allusions to the first. I'd play fable 1 before 2 because after playing 2 it would be hard to go back to fable 1.

idZpEDIdaa	360.    Better game selection.    Cheaper.    Better online (although you have to pay for it).    PS3 sales are horrible.    Only exclusive game for PS3 worth buying is MGS (FF XIII is no longer exclusive).    If you need a good Blu-ray player, go with PS3...that's the only reason I have one.    I could go on....    And no PS3 does not have better graphics.  In fact many games on 360, including madden, run at a higher FPS then on  PS3.|`|5pGj2duQaa	me and my roomie have both. and i honestly enjoy the 360 better, however when it comes to online, ps3 can connect via wifi and you can surf the web on there ( and you dont have to pay) but with 360,  you gotta have the cord connection unless you wanna pay extra for the wifi accessories and once you connect online you have the silver account. you have to have the GOLD, which you pay for, in order to interact with others. For me personally, the 360 has more titles that i like, ps3 isnt pushing out too many exclusives but that can change. another downsize to the 360 is the red ring of death, me and my roomie have two differnet experiences with those. Overall i would compare the game line up and whoever has the most appealing games will be your console.|`|W5E8GhiBaa	I"ll keep this simple: I own both.    360 for games    ps3 ONLY if you want a blu-ray player. Ps3 will make you mad after you have to  wait for the games to "install" taking up to an hour.    Plus online abilities for the 360 trump ps3 by far.|`|71EOipkhaa	360 definatley, its way cheaper and way better games.|`|yt1WguIDaa	There both awesome but one way to look at it is this...    -PS3 has free online servers for online gaming but this tends to mean that the online gaming experience isn't as crisp (personally, it works fine for me and I have no problem with it but some people do, which I think is due to people having slower internet connections or faulty networking)    -XBOX 360 requires a fee for online gaming but has better/more reliable servers (once again see above for my opinion on this, I prefer not to pay for online use)    Aside from that main difference it all depends on game likes and dislikes since some video game developers don't release certain titles to both systems.|`|raEUval8aa	Ask this in the consumer electronics boards (Playstation, and then Xbox.)    This section is famous for having nothing but rabid ignorant Xbox 360 fanboys who haven't seen or read or payed attention to anything about the PS3 since 2006.|`|lcy7F8izaa	360 because it has better games|`|IpmvWjVFaa	For better graphics PS3    For better games 360    360 worth its money  PS3 to expensive    however i feel that if PS3 was same price as 360 id get the PS3 but cus its expensive i bought the 360   there both great

O1Sqcc5yaa	If you have enough lock-picks, just use auto-attempt (X button on the 360) a bunch of times until it opens.  It will take more lock-picks if the lock is harder to open.  If you want to do it manually, go to the "Picking Locks" section here to read how: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Securi...    In the quest you are speaking of, go to the person he sold it to.  You must find Soris' house in the Talos Plaza and confront him about the staff.  Here's the walk-through: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Bravil...|`|nyylb6qUaa	When you are in the game, it depends on what level your character is. Then, start to open the door. It should bring you to a screen that has 3, 4, or 5 bars that are move able at the top. You have to make sure that when you hit the bars, and they move up, that you hear a click, and then push the button. Make sure you have lock-picks though. If you don't have any, search around in a few towns, or travel around till you find a goblin's cave. Goblins usually have them all the time. Good Luck.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	Not sure about the quest off the top of my head but this should definitely help you: http://oblivion.wikia.com/wiki/Oblivion_...    Picking locks is all about timing... Once you hit one of those pegs (with up) you hit X (Playstation) at the exact time it hits the very top... and if there's more than one peg move over and do the same to the rest. It's always best to save right before picking a lock just incase you break all of them... then you can start again. Once your level gets higher it becomes easier to do... And once you hit level ten you can get the skeleton key... awesome sh*t look it up in the website.|`|xwdhlaXGaa	Well, when i first started oblivion, lock picking was a real pain. until i did a quest called "Eye of Nocturnal" Basically firs you find the shrine of nocturnal. (near the road going east out of leyawiin going north a bit which is the yellow road) unlike many daedric quests, it requires no offering. but you have to be level 10 to start the quest. Do the quest, (its pretty easy) and you get an unbreakable lockpick.    To lock pick in general however is different. push one of the tumblers up with the lockpick and click when you think its right. all in the timing. however, with the Skeleton Key just press Auto Attempt until it unlocks.     On the quest for the mage's guild now. you've got to talk to kud-ei (the quest giver) and she will give you 2 beguile scrolls. Go talk to the other guy and use one of the scrolls. and with his disposition up to 70 he'll sell it to you for 200 gold. Or.. you can go to his wife and raise her dispositon to 65 (with a scroll) and she'll tell you were it is and that the key is on the desk upstairs. Go steal it (or buy it it doesn't matter.) and complete the quest.

Ou3pLyLNaa	Gioco spesso con gli amici. Da quando ho scoperto il texas hold'em non faccio altro che giocarci, il 5 carte draw l'ho quasi scordato.<br>  <br>  Il texas hold'em a mio parere è migliore perchè ci sono maggiori informazioni sul tavolo e il gioco, oltre che psicologico, diventa anche matematico e statistico. Questo mix di psicologia e statistica rende tutto più eccitante. Quando poi il flop lentamente di scopre la tensione raggiunge i vertici.<br>  <br>  Lunga vita all'hold'em! :D|`|8f9YuExBaa	Gioco ogni giorno su internet (anche se nn posso giocare a soldi) e quattro o cinque giorni a settimana dal vivo, naturalmente a texas hold em.<br>  Odio il poker a 5 carte, tende a far rovinare la gente ed è un gioco più fortunoso rispetto all'americana, dove hai il gran vantaggio di poter leggere sul tavolo che punti può avere l'avversario.<br>  Sono in attivo, ma nn lo sarei senza i 2 tornei di poker che ho fatto, dove sono arrivato a premi e che mi hanno portato decisamente in attivo.<br>  La mia fortuna è di avere un mac e di non esser ancora riuscito a trovare un modo per giocare a soldi su internet.|`|8qNgdbA9aa	ciao, gioco a poker una volta a settimana, preferisco le 5 carte ma appena uno dei 4 giocatori scopre un punteggio superiore al full si inizia con il texas hold'em fino alla conclusione del giro dei partecipanti.

It will take a bit for them to release patches to fix the bugs they will find.<br>  <br>  Try it on a Windows XP machine if you have one, and either Buena Vista (makers of the game) or Windows will likely release a patch to fix this problem sometime soon.

nnaXZxmxaa	No, evolve as soon as possible, the boost in stats is pretty significant. I would delay the evolving if you want to learn moves faster, though. Your call.<br>  <br>  However, do not evolve Pokemon with stones (i.e. leaf stones) too early - rule of thumb is: if you use the stone on them, they won't learn any more moves.<br>  <br>  Edit: some good Poke that evolve three times are:<br>  - any of the starter Pokemon.<br>  - Shinx/Luxio/Luxray<br>  - Budew/Roselia/Roserade<br>  - Zubat/Golbat/Crobat (super speed)<br>  - Pichu/Pikachu/Raichu (classic)<br>  - Gible/Gabit/Garchomp (dragon is an excellent type to have)<br>  <br>  Steer away from the bugs and the birds - too many weaknesses.|`|mG5GhKJfaa	yes, the stats of Haunter are lower than those of Gengar, Gengar has an amazing SP.Attack , you should definetely evolve it. the same goes for Alakazam, you should trade it for more speed and sp. attk, besides it's better all of its stats will rise.

gL7CfVRfaa	no tranquilla non è difficile...ci sono solo tre o quattro regole che devi imparare...una volta che le sai vai liscia...prova ad allenarti un po|`|VuscnuIfaa	Scala 40 è molto semplice (di + del poker).<br>  Ti danno 13 carte e devi cercare di fare 40 sommando le carte ! esempio devi fare o una scala, oppure tre numeri e tre segni uguali. Bhè credo che tu sappia già le regole... forse dovresti solo un pò allenarti. Ciao.|`|5X2FjdwMaa	certo che è piu difficile del poker perchè devi trovare diverse combinazioni devi aprire la mente non è solo un gioco di fortuna..a me piace tanto sincermente non l' ho trovato poi cosi difficile|`|6DlepM6naa	PERCHè Sì CRETINA|`|E3roNxwqaa	che io sappia non esiste questa malattia quindi deve essere che non ti va di imparare, perche è uno sei giochi piu semplici che ci sono|`|ZnR5KmDbaa	é il gioco più facile di questo mondo ed è molto più facile del poker.<br>  In scala 40 non ci sono molte regole, si hanno 13 carte in mano ogni turno si pesca al primo giro non si può aprire, per aprire devi avere  40 punti, vince chi non ha più carte in mano|`|7JpDZ9caaa	scala 40 è =al poker solo con 13 carte|`|8qNgdbA9aa	il segreto della scala 40 è di tenere più giochi aperti in assoluto ed esser pronta a modificare i tuoi tris. imparerai anche perchè il poker non è molto più semplice|`|NeYbGRgVaa	REGOLE:si inizia dando 13 carte ciascuno, quando tra le tue carte in mano hai qualce gruppo di carte che raggiunge i 40 punti o +, le puoi mettere scoperte sul tavolo. ES. (punti, le figure valgono 10, l'asso vale 11, mentre dal 2 al 10 valgono quanto scritto sulla carta, ES. il 2 vale 2, il 3 vale 3 e così via.), ad ogni turno un giocatore pesca una carta dal mazzo, ma quando si pesca ad ogni turno devi scartare una carta. Se hai carte scoperte sul tavolo puoi anche attaccare carte hai tuoi avversari, vince il primo che finisce le carte, il jolly può sostituire il punteggio di qualsiasi carta.(ES. di coppie:4 carte uguali 10+10+10+10; donna+donna+donna+donna ecc. scala come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ecc. o comunque tutte carte collegate tra loro da qualcosa, ES. colore, il numero, le coppie ecc.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  le scale da 1 a 10 o viceversa si possono fare solo con carte dello stesso tipo.<br>  <br>  a presto e spero che tu abbia capito come si gioca.|`|VLDY27DEaa	Carissima leslie, devi abituarti a tenere il conto delle carte già uscite (almeno in via approssimata) e, se possibile, evitare le imboscate dei "richiamini" (le carte affini a quelle scartate che l'avversario getta come esca per avere quelle utili per chiudere): è infatti fondamentale capire le carte che servono al tuo avversario. Un buon allenamento sarà sia mentale (se hai passione per le indagini o per le speculazioni sei avvantaggiata) che per il gioco della carta in sè. Good luck!|`|juElJI56aa	Con le carte che ti danno, per iniziare a scendere, devi prima fare 40 sommando le carte. Poi scendi...numeri uguali o segni uguali. é simile a pinacola.......

No, but you can recolour any object or clothing item in the base game and the EPs and SPs, but don't ask me how, because it's not actually in the game.  I know you can create stuff in Body Shop.
oice6iXAaa	Downloading and using a program such as this would violate the end user license agreement you signed when you installed the game. <br>  <br>  Unfortunatly it wouldnt be legal to help you out, terribly sorry.
yzbG8823aa	It doesn't load and why would you play ragnarok online? The same company made a better game called Rose Online in 3d and there's a private server for it called sevenhearts.net. Currently Ragnarok online 2 is in open beta in korea but you can sign up for it but it'll be a hassle but the Ragnarok Online 2 beta is coming to America in November. Just imagine RO in 3D. awesome..

c4132be70cdff2e5882d72c13f813f12aa	La baraja se compone de 4 colores: rojo, verde, azul, y amarillo. Las cartas están numeradas del 0 al 9. Hay 3 cartas "de honor" en cada color, llamadas "salto", "toma 2", y "reversa". Hay cartas especiales: "Comodín" y "Comodín toma 4". Hay 2 copias de cada carta regular y de honor, excepto el 0, que tiene 1 por color. Hay 4 cartas de "Comodín" y 2 de "Comodín toma 4", sumando un total de 108 cartas. Para empezar el juego, se reparten 7 cartas a cada jugador, y la primera carta de la pila se voltea para empezar a bajar cartas. Si la carta tiene alguna habilidad especial, se trata como si la hubiera jugado el repartidor, y la acción especial ocurre (como saltar o cambiar el sentido). Si la carta es un comodín toma 4, se regresa a la pila y se escoge otra carta.<br>  <br>  En cada turno, el jugador deberá poner una carta que coincida con el color o símbolo de la carta expuesta, o poner una carta comodín. Si el jugador no puede bajar una carta legalmente, deberá tomar una carta de la pila y jugarla o quedársela. El jugador puede tomar una carta incluso si puede hacer un movimiento legal, pero después de haber tomado la carta sólo se podrá usar ésta. Después de bajar una carta o tomarla, el siguiente turno le corresponderá al jugador de la derecha (a excepción de que esté funcionando una carta reversa). Si la pila de acaba, se toma la pila de cartas jugadas, se mezclan, y se vuelven a colocar en la pila.<br>  <br>  La ronda termina cuando algún jugador ha bajado todas sus cartas. Cuando un jugador baja una carta quedándole una, deberá decir "uno", en caso de que no lo diga, y algún jugador no lo pase desapercibido, coge de la baraja 2 cartas. El comodín toma 4 solo se puede tirar cuando no haya otro remedio. Se puede tirar cuando se tenga una carta para tirar (por ejemplo: hay una carta azul y tienes el comodín toma 4 y otra azul tu puedes tirar el comodín toma 4) pero si te pillan, se robará 4. Pero si el jugador siguiente pide que le ense?es las cartas y no había falta, el jugador robara 4 por el comodín y 2 más por falta.<br>  <br>  El juego se desarrolla en varias partidas; después de que un jugador termine sin cartas en la mano, el resto de los jugadores suma el valor de las cartas que quedan en su mano, asignando ciertos puntajes a cada carta. Estos puntajes se suman, y se asignan como puntaje al jugador que ganó la partida. El primer jugador en llegar a los 500 puntos (oficialmente) es el ganador.<br>  <br>  Eso puede variar siempre hay que contar las cartas especiales Los valores de las cartas son los siguientes: 1, 2, 3, etc... valen 1, 2, 3 ... respectivamente, excepto el 0, que tiene un valor de 10. Las cartas especiales de color ("reversa","saltar turno" y "robar 2") valen 20. Las cartas "robar 4" y "cambiar color" valen 50.|`|3WseeoWsaa	UNO se juega haciendo q el otro jugador se quede con las cartas y al quedarte tu con solo una, tienes q decir uno, si el oponente le queda una carta, tienes q decir uno antes q el para q el tenga q tomar dos cartas. las cartas puedes ponerlas del mismo color, numero, o tirar el comodin "wild o draw 4" para poder cambiar el color.|`|XZHgC7lpaa	Para empezar el juego, se reparten 7 cartas a cada jugador, y la primera carta de la pila se voltea para empezar a bajar cartas.

I suppose you could use a flat-needle sock pattern, which would have to be sewn together and seamed later, though. I'm not sure how standard patterns translate to a knitting wheel, but if it's do-able, there's a two-needle pattern here: <a href="http://www.lindascraftique.com/free/tnsocks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lindascraftique.com/free/tnso...</a>|`|08ef000f21bf4f05c5432622adedbf88aa	Yes, it's quite possible, you form the heel by knitting short rows (zigzagging back & forth instead of going all the way round.)  Here's a pattern for a couple different socks.
zWeadNetaa	That's one of the things I like best about crochet...there's very few "rules"! If you like it, it's fine! You want big holes so it's soft and squishy? Go for it!

ALWAYS good to gather leadership skills.<br>  |`|NWYdIIMHaa	Any hobby that you take up can be used on a resume if you are dedicated to it. Things such as attention to detail and creativity come out of hobbies. At times patience is learned when you participate in a hobby.<br>  <br>  As for reading - reading is very important and adds to your knowledge base for anything you want to learn or do.<br>  <br>  Photography might be something that could help you. You could take a digital camera and photograph everything from macro pics of flowers and plants to buildings (especially old ones with great architecture) to animals. I took some great photos this summer by being in the right place at the right time of a mother deer and her little one. I have another photo of about a dozen or more great blue herons, some were young and others were the parents. (I was in that location for about 2 hours taking photos and got 3 or 4 really good ones of hte herons.)<br>  <br>  Photography resume possibilities: quick thinking (action shots),  patience (action shots, animal photos of them doing something interesting), attention to detail (being aware of the background in the photos, the settings you're using, editing in your computer), creativity (those creative shots that are a different take on the world around us), focus (that you learned a new skill and are increasing your abilities), initiative (taking the initiative to start a new activity and pursue it), accomplishment (skills learned and applied and a sense of pride over the work you've completed, especially if you've made any money at it), dedication (sticking with the hobby over a long period of time), teachable (you learned a new skill and this is especially true if you sought out someone who has more experience and was your coach and you followed their advice), interpersonal skills (this would be true if you were to photograph fellow students for their senior picture in the year book, do wedding photography, photograph people for their Christmas cards, wedding invitations, etc).<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are more but I just can't think of any more.<br>  <br>  As you can see from the list I created for photography many of those skills could translate over into just about any hobby.<br>  <br>  Some other possibilities would be painting, drawing (this is a skill that is useful for all kinds of careers think of film making, fashion, engineering, architecture, illustrator, etc.), exercise (improves your health, you become educated on how the body works and how to eat a healthy diet, if you develop a passion for it then you desire to help others have the same sense of accomplishment in their lives).<br>  <br>  I hope you found this helpful and practical and that it inspires you in your choice.|`|zWeadNetaa	If you're good at athletics, there are a lot of things you can do that would look good on a future resume. Are you a swimmer? You could help teach little children to swim, or lifeguard for a community pool. Are you a ballplayer? Offer to help a little-league type group...you could be an assistant coach. Gymnastics? Again, help with beginner classes. <br>  Or going in another direction; if you play an instrument, offer to help a struggling student with some one-on-one times.<br>  Another idea, a lot of community centers have some type of "help people to read" program. Could you spend a couple hours a week doing something like that?<br>  All the above ideas show a sense of community involvement, and a willingness to help people. That always looks good on an application!<br>  Just remember, make sure whatever you choose to do is something YOU enjoy doing as well.<br>  |`|I8rnOqyeaa	To expand on your outdoors hobby you could take up something that requires team work. Like we have the Duke of Edinburgh award in the UK. Where you have to go camping, take a long hike and do a certain amount of community service, sport and something skills based.<br>  If you're doing it specifically for your resume, think about what soft skills you learn from each hobby. ie skills that an employer would like.<br>  e.g. camping and hiking with a team shows you can work in a team and are self motivated and determined.<br>  I'm sure anything you take up that you enjoy you will be able to figure out some skills employers are looking for. Look up transferrable/soft skills on google, you'll probably find something like oral communication, ability to persuade others, interpersonal skills, problem solving.<br>  Blag it.|`|YRrGv82Zaa	Wood working<br>  mathematics<br>  Sewing<br>  politics<br>  City speaking as a student.. <br>  of course leadership is going to look the best.. so its up to you.<br>  any volunteer positions are desirable on applications for college or other.. <br>  <br>  Keep records and even ask for a document to present on your future applications <br>  things of importance to fill in on job and or college.<br>  Name of the organization, program, or business.<br>  <br>  A short one to two sentence description of the group, program, or business.<br>  Any leadership positions you held and your responsibilities.<br>  Any special projects that you initiated or oversaw.

This is just an example of course, in your local area, Im sure theres plenty of volunteer opportunities you can find on the net. See what works best for you and choose from them. Not to mention that volunteering looks great on your resume!! <br>  <br>  You could also try part time baby sitting if you are interested in working with children in the future. <br>  <br>

A64Qr7DMaa	san andreas more lifelike|`|pl2SocVKaa	Grand Theft Auto 4 |`|WYfeH8nNaa	If San andreas had the more advanced graphics engine as GTA 4 has, it would be the greatest edition of the GTA series. In San Andreas, there was a more diverse collection of vehicles and features, such as the Quad Bike or tractor, and the Low-rider costumization garage. It had good deal more land to play on, and a wider variety of towns. There was a forest, mountain, casino strip, army base, and 2 airports, including a flight school. In GTA 4 yopu have nothing to do with planes, which in my point of view, was one of the funnest parts of San Andreas, and it really brings the experience down a notch. One more thing I think San Andreas has over GTA 4 is the cheats were more entertaining. There was cheats for everything from turning all the vehicles pink, to having every body turn into Elvis. You could have every body start rioting, while you flew around shooting a rocket launcher with unlimited ammo in your jetpack. In GTA 4 all you can do is spawn cars, get rid of cops, and get weapons. San Andreas was better in the fields of gameplay and generating laughs, but GTA 4 is better in graphis and missions. It is also a LOT more realistic. You actually react and obey gravity. If you get hit by a car, you actually move and twist like you would in a real situation. If you hit something on a motorcycle, you will fly and convulse, instead of just lying flat will going forward, like in certain-COUGH COUGH Vice City COUGH COUGH- game in this series I know.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	In terms of technology, grand theft auto 4 is the better game, it has a new graphics engine & is far more realistic than san andreas. That said, the gaming experience is pretty much the same for both though San andreas actually has a larger playing area than 4. I'm definitely looking forward to getting 4 on the PC!|`|ME5ZLGiRaa	San Andreas, was just a lot more fun and involving than GTA4, more stuff to do, better story and characters, missions, features, vehicles, more of that GTA flavor all around. I was pretty disappointed by 4 in case you couldn't tell haha. I still think Vice City was the best one.|`|jF2SVQ5waa	well i like my games lol but im not a nerd...<br>  gta has like better game engines n **** and is a bit more realistic , but the story line is a bit dull and all the cars and bikes hav crap handling so u hav 2 drift every corner<br>  <br>  wereas gta san andreas has a funny story line and ur less limited to reality.

22e3fc701fad49f917b1c157deed4af7aa	i don't think there is one, but if there was a difference I would have to say a cheat is anything that helps you beat the game with more ease.  I would say a code is something like a car code like on san andreas.  Where you can spawn all sorts of cars.  These cars won't necessarily have anything to do with you beating the game but they are just fun.|`|AA11464616	well you need codes to enter it so you can cheat in the game?|`|f5501f8d3db73741517a7e120ae51841aa	cheats are special things you do in the game, such as(usually in a way to make it easier or harder, eg:getting more lives or a power boost)<br>  codes are cheats that you type in sometimes in a cheat screen or just a combination of buttons(which do basically the same thing)<br>  <br>  there are also glitches which are things that happen in random spots ion the game that weren't supposed to be in that the game creators didn't notice or foirgot about(eg: in any of the Tony Hawk games going out of the level and still being able to move around and play)<br>  <br>  you can get gamesharks and action replays which are full of cheats that you put in before the game starts and tehn you have em in the game|`|9f49d44f100f63517d90208640ff6047aa	Codes are letters and symbols which you type in to your console to unlock special options "CHEATS"<br>  <br>  As I said cheats are just what you get from either find in the game or unlock using Codes!
cuR7T3praa	Lots of styrofoam.  You could also use the stuff that is used in quilts but if it does snow or rain it would probably get soggy unless you were there to cover it up.|`|zWeadNetaa	How about some wire? Kind of like the deer that have become really popular the last couple of years. If you just kept on wrapping wire into a spherical shape, then join the shapes together into snow-people. <br>  Or you could o a simple plywood cutout, paint it white, give it features, and you're good to go.

9byCkGXVaa	wow MAGIC KINGDOM that's DISNEYLAND how can you like something better than that?????|`|UYJgIfLZaa	If I had to chose 1 I'd say the Magic Kingdom b/c there are so many different things to do but I really think that Disney is a rip of.

If you have never been there though, you should go at least once.  Have fun and bring a lot of money.|`|zWeadNetaa	Best for whom? A 3 year old girl? Probably the Magic Kingdom. You just can't beat Cindy's castle and Tink and all the princesses floating around! Not to mention that awesome Dumbo ride, and maybe even the Teacups! ok, then....a 10 year old boy? Probably Animal Kingdom. Being able to go on a safari, then be chased by a Yeti, you can't get much more fun than that! Young teenager? I'd go with Hollywood Studios. If you're really lucky, they're filming something there the day you're there. And they do have that extremely frightening Tower of Terror, and the extremely LOUD roller coaster.

83afe7Dvaa	I agree with "twist", if you want to make it tight fitted as the picture shows, it will be a very hard project for a beginner.<br>  <br>  I you do want it fitted, you can buy a red unitard and color portions of it black with fabric paint or fabric marker. Or you can buy a red one and a black one and mix the two to make one (use the red leg from one, the black leg from the other, etc). Then you can sew the seams them together where they will meet up. It will not be very difficult to do but it will not be easy. I would say medium to hard on the difficulty scale. Here are some samples of unitards: <a href="http://www.e-dancewear.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=BW217%2F117&Category_Code=Unitards" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-dancewear.com/Merchant2/mer...</a><br>  <br>  If you do not mind it being fitted, you can use a costume pattern and make it that way. You can always make the pattern and take it in slightly after if you want it more fitted.<br>  <br>  Here are some patterns to consider:<br>  <a href="http://www.simplicity.com/dv1_v4.cfm?design=2849" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplicity.com/dv1_v4.cfm?des...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.simplicity.com/dv1_v4.cfm?design=9800" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplicity.com/dv1_v4.cfm?des...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zWeadNetaa	For an outfit this fitted, you'll need to use stretchy fabric, or it will split at the seams when you're wearing it. Usually you need special needles for sewing special fabric. And usually this kind of fabric is difficult to sew. There's issues with the sewing machine tension, and skipped stitches, etc. It's really a cool halloween costume,but I'm afraid you might get frustrated using this as your "learning-to-sew" project. |`|LwNguWkgaa	First you need to learn how to sew - properly!  How to measure each other and choose a pattern to fit those measurements, how to cut out and alter a pattern to fit, about ease and grain line, and how to lay out a pattern and cut it out.  Then you need to learn all the techniques for sewing it together, fitting it, making alterations so it fits properly, and finishing a project.  You need plenty of practice at sewing straight seams, putting in zips, and finishing...<br>  <br>  Then you need to learn to sew stretch fabrics.  You need to learn about negative ease, and the techniques for sewing stretchy seams that don't pop...  You need to learn how to put concealed zips in stretch fabrics, and how to colour block so you get the red and black and white bits in the right places.  I'd strongly suggest you learn to use a serger for sewing stretch fabrics like that: much better and stronger finish...<br>  <br>  Most definitely NOT a project for an inexperienced person, never mind a beginner.<br>  <br>  Not an impossible task, given that you want it for Halloween NEXT year...  ;)  It'd be quicker go go with bare skin and body paint, believe me...

2Qr8vcAfaa	when you're buying a game, it's best to make sure your PC is able to run it... it just saves time. the best way to do this is go on google and search "can you run it?" you'll get a website... something like systemrequirements (i've not used it in a long time). you simply select the game from the list (if it's recent) and it tells you if your PC can run it, and how well.<br>  <br>  if your PC can run it and you buy it, you just insert the disk and it SHOULD auto run... then you just follow what it says, and as soon as it's finished installing you're sorted. :) if it doesn't auto run, go on 'my computer' and you should be able to get it going from that. |`|bYqWHuzyaa	You install it.  Make sure your PC can run it.|`|x5xhqDxaaa	gfreat|`|OYtMXYdjaa	<br>  Well you should first know if your computer can handle the game. Some games have requirements that are needed to play the game. They usually have 2 sets a minimum and what I call the Preferred requirements.<br>  <br>  so say a game needs 512mb ram to play and you only have 256mb in your system don't expect it to work.<br>  <br>  Specs to know:<br>   your operating system ( examp: windows, vista ....)<br>  <br>  processor (xamp: Intel Pentium 3 800 mhz) this normally is the minimum so if you have better your good to go<br>  <br>  your ram (xamp: 256mb, 1gig, 4gig)<br>  <br>  what type of drive you have (xample Cd-rom , DVD)<br>  <br>  how much space you have left on your comp ( games need space so make sure you have the room)<br>  <br>  Video card (examp: ATI Radeon 8500, NIVIDIA GeForce3)  <br>  <br>  <br>  Most games are based on the minimum just plays way better on the preferred specs.<br>  <br>  As Always<br>  Play The Game Your Way<br>  Laterz <br>  <br>  Richie of <a href="http://www.online-games-your-way.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.online-games-your-way.com</a>|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	You are best off knowing the specifications for your PC & comparing them to the specs required by the game. If your PC matches or exceeds the requirements then you shouldn't have any problems installing the game to the PC. Most 3d intensive games will definitely require a semi-decent graphics card & more than likely require around 1Gb of RAM (XP) or 2Gb(Vista). <br>  <br>  Before you ask 'how do you install the game?' all you need to do is read the manual that comes with the game & follow the instructions!|`|QIt8M9Iyaa	of course u have to set it up.<br>  <br>  1st check if u have enough memory for ur computer so u can install it.<br>  <br>  2nd read the box if the game and check if u have enough rams to support the game too.(u dont want it to be laggy)<br>  <br>  3rd make sure u have a good processor like intel core 2 duo and a good enough graphic card.|`|3xlh2lBpaa	Ok 1st off all look at the back of the box and see if your computer can handle it(go to system infomation on windows start,all programs,accessories,system tools, system info)2nd install it put the disk in and it should run,click install and download all the extra stuff to make it work,after it has installed reboot your pc and you can play the game.Happy gaming.Peace out!!

djQ6UyzIaa	The best way to get money as a pathetic beginner is to kill cows, bury the bones and sell the cowhides. When you have about 100-200k (which doesn't take very long) start doping quests and figuring what you really want to do for money.<br>  I will say this. RUNESCAPE IS AN EXTREMELY COMPLICATED GAME!

(Sounds simple, but it's true.) There are a couple fairly simple ones around Lumbridge, like Chef's Assistant (castle kitchen) and Sheep Shearer (sheep farm outside the castle). But other later ones will require far more skill, like Demon Slayer - you're going to be facing a high level demon. Spend time leveling up your character if you want to do that one. If you want to see what quests are available to you, or if you're in the middle of a quest and forget what you need to do next, then click the blue star icon, next to the backpack. Quests you have already started but not completed will be yellow, quests not started will be red, and quests finished will be green. You can click on any of them to get a hint as to where to start, what to get, or where to go next.<br>  <br>  To earn money other ways, you need to either perfect a craft, like cooking or runecrafting. Then you can sell your wares to other users on Runescape. (However, for runecrafting you have to have completed part of the Rune Mysteries quest.) Or, you can spend a lot of time killing the random people generated by Runescape. Most all of them drop money or other items when killed. But most of the coins dropped are only about 3 per person killed, so be prepared to spend time killing if you do that.)<br>  <br>  P.S. Ernest the Chicken is my favorite quest. I know it like the back of my hand. If you ever need assistance on that quest, give me a holler.|`|e5981a592b6fe7cbc15da7f992be57ebaa	You can start a quest by clicking on the blue white star thing.

Depende tambien en la epoca del a?o que quieran ir, pero te recomiendo que no sea en epoca de vacaciones, porque te sale mas barato todo ( menos las entradas a los parques que siempre tiene el mismo precio, de aprox 100dls cada uno) y además disfrutas mas ya que hay menos gente en los parques y no tienes que hacer tantas filas en las atracciones.  Está hermoso, yo disfruté igual que mi ni?o y nos emocionamos también igual. busca paquetes en que te den todo incluido, además hay opciones a meses sin intereses con algunas tarjetas de crédito y asi no lo sentirás tanto.   Espero y vayan y disfrutenlo mucho
