XI5aQb2taa	The 295 is only slightly better at the resolutions you mention.  So slight, in fact, that you wouldn't actually notice any difference between the two cards when playing games ( a few FPS difference isn't going to be noticeable ).  The difference between the two cards just isn't big enough, performance wise.<br>  <br>  Price wise, the 4870x2 can be had over $100 cheaper at the moment, which is quite noticeable.  So, you have to ask yourself if the slight performance increase that you wouldn't notice is worth an extra $100 to you.  <br>  <br>  I'll leave the last word to HARDOcps review; <br>  <br>  "As you can see, most games are a wash with the same playable in-game settings.

This means your image is only allowed to use a certain set of colors, so if you try to add a color that isn't in that set, GIMP will automatically replace it with the closest color that is in the set.  Indexed mode is used in .gif images, for example, so that the image can be compressed more to take up less space.  To change this setting, choose "Mode" under the "Image" menu and select "RGB."  This will allow you to use any color in your image.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Do you mean on screen or when printing?<br>  <br>  Dont worry about how they show on screen, colors will display different on different screens.<br>  <br>  If you mean when printing, then check your printer ink levels (especially check your black).

These discs hold about 4.5GB per layer.<br>  <br>  The amount of data you want to write is only possible using dual layer discs, which are only available as DVD+R/DL (DL = dual layer) discs. Essentially there's two disc "sides" on one surface. By varying the wavelength slightly, the laser can access the top layer or the layer underneath.<br>  <br>  To store that much data, you would need to purchase specifically dual-layer media. You would also need to have a drive capable of writing to this media.<br>  <br>  If your drive is not older than 2 years, you can be pretty sure that it won't be an issue and you can do it.<br>  <br>  Older than 2 years and the model of the drive AS WELL AS THE FIRMWARE REVISION is important. There were small changes to the specifications (and thus to the media) that require some drives to have their internal software updated.<br>  <br>  It's really only the first or second generation drives from about 4+ years ago that are completely incapable of dealing with dual-layer media, as they might not be dual-layer capable. If your drive supports rewritable media, chances are good that you can deal with dual-layer discs, though.<br>  <br>  For more information about your drive specifically, look up the model in the computer's device configuration list or by opening the cover and reading it from the label. You can then use that to look up the drive at:<br>  <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/dvdwriters" rel="nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/dvdwriters</a><br>  <br>  You might find a link right in there to get the latest firmware for your drive.

However, don't expect anything mind-blowing out of it - it just barely fits into Bioshock's minimum requirements, and doesn't exceed Left 4 Dead's recommended specifications at all.<br>  <br>  If you have the money for something with a little more muscle, I would recommend looking into it (something like an HD 2000 or 3000 series). There are AGP versions of them, and it would give you a little more breathing room as far as future games' requirements go.|`|vBt5Dp09aa	just researched the card it did not get great reviews.<br>  spend a little more and get better and be worry free for a while ;)

They do not fade over time as much as older style laptops. They also can not be adjusted that low, which I consider a bad thing because its still pretty bright when you're trying to go as dark as possible (say, in a dark room).

CplVsj8Laa	Terrible ideas you're being given, really.<br>  <br>  Check what hardware is in your computer, and make sure all of it is supported by Windows XP, and that you have drivers installed for all of it. If there is something that isn't supported, either see if you can have it removed (and possibly replaced). Blue screens of death (which is indeed what you have) can be caused by a large variety of things, so only by checking most of what you have plugged in can you see how to cure it.<br>  <br>  Dell can possibly help you solve this - if they refuse to, and you don't want to lose that piece of hardware, check if Linux supports it - Ubuntu is user-friendly-enough for non-professional use these days. I doubt it, though.<br>  <br>  <br>  Drivers would be your first stop, though, it is mostly a matter of (re)installing them.|`|uJnEUX6maa	dell is s hit - hp is the way|`|sVXpuBv2aa	I had the same problem once.. dnt know much abt it ...but I searched on Google for the same...

You can use Firefox, or Safari, or Chrome, or one of the more obscure browsers. <br>  <br>  Try Firefox, it's safer than IE, faster, and is very customizable. Firefox has 100's of add-ons for it.

14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	There are countless source "vectors", but these are common<br>   sources of malware:<br>  1)  Permitting "active scripting" <br>      IE users will commonly allow 'Active X' and/or Java to 'run files on my computer' which permits a website to install into your system, some kind of software.  Hackers will use this critical security oversight to trick victims into allowing their garbage to be installed, with innocent looking (often mimicking legit window notices) 'click to view' or 'you must allow Active X to view this content' or 'install the latest Java here' to that end.<br>  <br>  2)  Requesting files from Peer-2-Peer servers<br>       Because they use multiple 'peer contributors' to feed bits & parts of a requested file (music, movies, etc.) back to you, there can never be any kind of certainty about the status of the sender's file.<br>  Whatever they have =  you get: malevolent or not.<br>    <br>  Once downloaded to your machine, all bets are off about it's safety to open, transfer, use or re-send; and size of a file has little bearing on what it may or may not contain; scanned or otherwise.<br>  <br>  Use @ your own peril...<br>  <br>  3)  Relying on single malware defense method<br>      Many folks assume they are immune to infections when they have a 'Security Suite' (like McAffe, or Norton, etc.) and engage in risky behavior like going to known 'dark side' sites, or porn sites.  Security must be done in layers; with user interaction with the system; and current threat landscape awareness.<br>  Because the Internet is so fluid, it evolves and changes almost hourly, and all users must stay current with all defense measures...it's just the way it is. <br>  <br>  *Prime Defense countermeasures*<br>  1) Use a "Limited" account to surf the Net<br>  2) Use Firefox, with "NoScript" add-on.|`|C2aWncmkaa	Yes, the viruses are all over the place.<br>  <br>  The malware writers are constantly writing new malware to get around the blocking that people put on their computers.  They also try to hack into legitimate websites to put their malware on the site (sometimes they have insiders do it for them on the computers systems that small businesses might have) and they create their own malware websites and try to trick people into visiting those websites, sneaking links into advertising pages and so on.  Then there is SQL Injection and Cross-site scripting (the IRS website got hit with one of those a long while back).<br>  <br>  So in the long run the best thing for you to do is copy all your important data off the computer to CDs or DVDs or an external hard drive, and then wipe the drive and reinstall the Windows operating system, your anti-malware, and any of your favorite software.<br>  <br>  At this point make a full backup of your hard drive to an external hard drive.  Then go onto the Internet and get the updates for Windows and the anti-malware.  Then make another full backup to the external hard drive.<br>  <br>  Next time you get hit with malware - the pests are getting more and more prevalent - simply copy off any important data, then reinstall the most recent full backup, and the malware is then gone.  It's a whopping lot faster than trying to remove the malware, and a full backup is faster to restore than starting all over.<br>  <br>  ==========<br>  <br>  Also remember to use this anti-malware program from Microsoft:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwar...</a><br>  Malicious Software Removal Tool description:<br>  Published: January 11, 2005 | Updated: February 10, 2009<br>  <br>  If you don't already have it, this is the Download Page for MSRT :<br>  Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (KB890830)<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD724AE0-E72D-4F54-9AB3-75B8EB148356&displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...</a><br>  <br>  The program is usually located at<br>  C:\WINDOWS\System32\MRT.exe<br>  <br>  ==========<br>  <br>  For more exciting reading, <br>  <br>  Microsoft Malware Protection Center<br>  Threat Research and Response<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal...</a><br>  <br>  Microsoft Collaborates With Industry to Disrupt Conficker Worm<br>  Microsoft offers $250,000 reward for Conficker arrest and conviction.<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/feb09/02-12ConfickerPR.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press...</a><br>  <br>  Conficker Worm: Help Protect Windows from Conficker.A and Conficker.B<br>  Published: February 6, 2009 | Updated February 13, 2009<br>  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd452420.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/secur...</a><br>  .|`|5aP8dMmNaa	not affected

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2.

Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4.

Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5.

NxBljj6Baa	It is really up to your budget and your needs.  Yeah if you have a billion dollars, price isn't going to matter.  Also if you only surf the net and do simple tasks then price is going to mean so much more.  If you are a simple computer user and do not run 4 or more tasks at a time, then you can get a good AMD dual core to do anything you will need and spend way less on the processor than the core2duo...  If you find yourself multitasking on a regular basis, then the core2duo or a quad core will be your answer.  <br>  I do feel like if you decide quad you might as well go Intel, if you are still on a budget then look to the q8200 and you can multitask on a budget CPU... <br>  Here is the deal.  A CPU is only as good as the motherboard you put it on.  Many storebought computers come with a restricted motherboard in one way or the other.  Many are only onboard graphics and do not have the option for upgrading the graphics to a dedicated card.  Others have very limited ram capabilities, limiting you on how much or what speed ram you can use.  Just like if you are building a computer from scratch.  If you buy a cheap motherboard you are losing your overclocking capabilities.  With intel that is what you are paying for.  The extra money they charge is the fact you are buying a say, 3ghz CPU, but it can overclock to 4ghz if you keep it cool.  They want you to pay for that ability.  Most people including myself buy a 2.4 and OC it to 3.0 on the factory cooler.  In Intel's eyes I am crapping them out of money when I should be buying a $300 processor, so they charge more for my 2.4 than they normally would.  What I am saying is that if you buy an Intel processor and a cheap motherboard you are crapping yourself...  With todays dual and quad core processors, 2.4ghz is 2.4ghz.  <br>  Case in point, I built my parents a replacement computer consisting of an ASUS micro ATX motherboard and a AMD 3800+ 2.0ghz CPU and 2gigs of 800mhz ram.  That thing boots faster than any computer I have ever seen.  It goes to the windows xp logo and only flashes 1 3/4 times and is on desktop, everytime...  My q6600 @ 3.06ghz cannot touch that...  Neither can my 9600 Phenom @ 2.4ghz.  Which brings me to my second point.  Between my q6600 and my 9600 there is no difference in real world software and programs.  With my q6600 running stock 2.4 and my Phenom at stock 2.3ghz I get the same boot times and program process times...  Only in games and benchmarks to I notice a difference.  The q6600 runs games smoother and scores considerably higher in benchmarks, running the same 4870 graphics card...  But at the same time think about this.  The 9600 is a $100 processor and the q6600 is a $200 processor.  That is what brings the cream to a head...<br>  By the way I paid $38 for the 3800 new from newegg.com...

AA10031274	I prefer the Mac OS; it has a nice user interface. I also like the lack of viruses. Not sure if anyone else mentioned this, but it's also got a very stable operating system, mine doesn't crash much. Someone else has already mentioned that Windows is typically better for gaming. Although, you can game on a Mac, too. I've played WoW and The Sims 2 on mine.|`|sf7lOcIiaa	If you feel like paying more than it's hardware worth, go for a Mac.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I run Windows Vista Home Premium and Windows XP Pro and I don't ever have them crash on me. I also don't get viruses. Sure, Windows does get more viruses than Mac. Do you know why that is though? Because Windows is a bigger target. No one makes viruses for Mac because of the small market percentage. It's not that viruses can't be made for Macs, just that people don't waste their time on trying to crash irrelevant OS.|`|dY1NU9koaa	Sometime but Intel Microsoft Windows related PCs are best, reliable and easy to operate.Means User friendly.|`|B7THwJxvaa	There's no correct answer to this.

Macs are more reliable than Windows and don't get viruses as often.

Most web host will have allow one-click installation (via Fantastico etc) of a blogging software such as Wordpress. If you are having problem choosing a web hosting to use, I suggest you do the following:<br>  <br>     1. Go to the webhost review sites such as webhostingjury, <a href="http://bestcheapwebhosting.org" rel="nofollow">http://bestcheapwebhosting.org</a> or webhostinggeeks and list down about 3 common top hosting companies.<br>  <br>     2. Next, for each web hosting X, do a “X sucks” search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.<br>  <br>     3.

It allows users all over the world to be able to access your website. There are a number of ways you can use web hosting. <br>  One of the methods is to do web hosting on your own. This method allows you to have total control over your website and be able to have control of all hosting services you require. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, web hosting does include blog hosting. <br>  <br>  Choosing a Web Hosting Service <br>  <br>  Many offer an array of features for different prices. If you are expecting heavy website traffic, keep in mind that you get what you pay for in a hosting service. Heavy traffic requires a dependable server, and this may not be available on an inexpensive hosting site. Before signing up with a company, find out about billing practices and important supported services such as e-commerce, shopping carts, discussion forums, blogs and customer support. If these features are vital to your website, make sure your hosting service can support them. Be sure to ask about customer support and website design support as well. It is also imperative to sign up for an e-mail feature when choosing a web hosting service.|`|jSq4ZO1uaa	Some web hosts offer both services. A blog web hosting service provides wordpress.<br>  <br>  As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.<br>  <br>  If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.<br>  <br>  As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which I’m sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements.

AA11297463	It seems like you are trying to get to the Internet from your computer without totally setting up the router.  Have you checked the IP of your computer?  With the router between the computer and the modem the router is now your gateway.  Your have established an Intranet for your house.  The computer shouldd be showing a new IP address with the router IP address as the gateway.  Most likely the gateway should be 192.168.1.1 and the IP should be something like 192.168.1.100.<br>  <br>  Try opening the browser page of the router by typing in 192.168.1.1 into your browser, or whatever IP the manual says is the default.  Once in here you can check the settings.  The router should be doing DHCP for your computer and thus the IP will have changed.  It is possible the IP was manually entered with modem directly connected.  If so change this.  Otherwise the router should give the computer an IP and the proper gateway to get to the Internet.|`|9c9c2a8134f9cc9647c94bde55ee91e3aa	you only use a router so you can have multiple connections using one modem. however, make sure that your westel modem is not a router. some modems are actually modem/routers. coz if that's the case, you wont be able to connect if you have two routers in use at the same time. disable one router and then you're good to go.

Tkb1TKwZaa	not very high if you're smart about what you download.<br>  <br>  Check the file sizes of files to make sure they're what it's supposed to be.  But don't download .exe files.  Music files usually aren't harmless, but .exe files can be much more malicious.  Also, if your media player can't play a song you download without asking you to download a license/anything, don't do it.  Never download anything you're not sure of.<br>  <br>  But generally, .mp3, .wma, and other normal audio/video formats are safe.|`|9Pj71Wa8aa	Extremely high. That is generally what limewire does. Also, it is illegal to download music from there. <br>  <br>  Try somewhere like <a href="http://www.mp3obsession.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3obsession.com/</a> that isn't going to give you viruses and is not illegal.|`|eUdk3VUvaa	You can try <a href="http://searchformp3.net" rel="nofollow">http://searchformp3.net</a><br>  You can download straight from there or you can just listen to the music from there.<br>  <br>  No need to download any programs, just download the mp3's directly from the website!|`|795710a8c5abcc7503a52df0739e00adaa	Use this<br>  <br>  I am using 1.7.6<br>  Use Old Version of Utorrent (Turn Off Updates) -<br>  <a href="http://www.oldapps.com/download_old_version_utorrent.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldapps.com/download_old_vers...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  To Open a Zip Files Use UltimateZip To Open.. - <a href="http://www.download.com/UltimateZip/3000-2250_4-10591706.html?tag=mncol&cdlPid=10884306" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/UltimateZip/3000...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Best Torrent Sites   (They Have Comments So Read Them before You Download)<br>  <br>  Mininova|<a href="http://www.mininova.org/search/?utorrent&search=" rel="nofollow">http://www.mininova.org/search/?utorrent...</a><br>  The Pirate Bay|<a href="http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=</a><br>  Btjunkie|<a href="http://btjunkie.org/search?query=" rel="nofollow">http://btjunkie.org/search?query=</a><br>  IsoHunt|<a href="http://isohunt.com/torrents.php?ext=&op=and&ihq=" rel="nofollow">http://isohunt.com/torrents.php?ext=&op=...</a><br>  <br>  & Get|`|TNT3RrP4aa	About 50:50.

It might be a virus...|`|h9RCu7P1aa	"But generally, .mp3, .wma, and other normal audio/video formats are safe."<br>  <br>  In reality, this is not absolutely true. There are many exploits for common media players - vlc and some codecs.<br>  <br>  These mean that even a non-executable file like mp3/wma etc, when crafted, can cause buffer overflows in flawed applications.<br>  <br>  The answer is to always keep your media players (as with all software) up to date.|`|gpFVAFwfaa	The chances of getting infected by a virus when using limewire would be low, provided if you are using a trusted anti-virus which is updated.<br>  <br>  That said, what matters is what you download, as accidents do happen after all. My suggestion? Torrents. =)

RjwyRrxtaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

Come on, seriously, if my place got robbed twice I would be looking for a better place.  Ok, your question wasn't "Should I move?" so let's be practical.  Personally I would get a custom box built that looks like a tv tray that you could slip the laptop into.  Even put a little piece of wood to hold paper so that it looks like a writing surface.  (Kinda like the old school desks with a place for a pencil)  Of course , on the inside, you could have it all plush so your laptop doesn't get damaged.  The outside should be dull, un-impressive.  Get some of those stupid looking Dutch Brothers stickers and put on it.  In other words make it look like it's not worth stealing.  Leave it in plain sight.<br>  put a few papers on it, even junk mail.  Thieves go for obviously valuable targets and spend time looking for hidden items.  A safe would be good too except it is hard to hide usually.

Will they immediately use it in a payment mechanism, or will it print out in an office for someone to handle manually? will they store it plain text on one of their systems?<br>  <br>  That is perhaps more important than SSL.|`|h9RCu7P1aa	That's a pretty open question. <br>  <br>  All SSL is encryption for data sent between your browser and the web server. Just because it is encrypted in transit, doesn't mean it is secure at the other end.<br>  <br>  Adding a proxy simply answers the next question: Do you trust the proxy provider?|`|IGxVxJdraa	My answer would be NO. It's not safe to type your credit card info through an SSL proxy. In fact, it's not safe to type your credit information at any place on the net. Let's say that you ordered something from the net which was worth, um, $5000 and you were thinking about using your credit card (which contains, let's say, $50,000 worth of credits) to pay for it. If you typed your credit card info on the company's site, instead of just taking $5000, they might take the whole lot! So it is definately NOT safe.

H95APlm7aa	A front side bus (FSB) is an electrical pathway on a computer’s motherboard, which connects the various hardware components to the main microprocessor, or central processing unit (CPU). If you think of the CPU as the brain of the computer, and the memory, hard disk and other components as organs, the front side bus would be akin to the main nervous system than links the organs to the brain.<br>  <br>  The front side bus is bi-directional, meaning data can flow both ways, allowing components to send and receive data from the CPU. Since so much data passes through the front side bus, a computer’s overall performance will be dependent, in part, on the speed of the FSB. Speed depends on how wide the front side bus is, its frequency, and the amount of data it can process per clock tick of the CPU.<br>  <br>  The front side bus’ width is determined by bit-size. A 32-bit FSB is twice as wide as a 16-bit front side bus. Frequency is indicated by the FSB’s megahertz (MHz). All else being equal, a 400 MHz front side bus will be faster than a 300 MHz FSB. Also considered is how many data transfers per tick the front side bus can deliver.<br>  <br>  The front side bus communicates with components through the computer’s chipset. The chipset consists of two processors, known as the Northbridge and the Southbridge. These two chips collect data from specific components, channeling all information to the CPU through the front side bus.<br>  <br>  The speed of the Northbridge and Southbridge buses is dependent on the speed of the front side bus. A fast CPU installed on a motherboard with a front side bus that is not efficient enough for the CPU will result in data bottlenecks. The CPU will perform computations faster than the front side bus can process them. While this doesn’t hurt the computer, the CPU will often sit idle, waiting for new instructions from the front side bus. To realize the full performance benefits of a fast CPU, a fast front side bus is also required.<br>  <br>  To further improve performance, modern motherboards feature a back side bus that directly connects the CPU to special cache (memory) reserves. These CPU cache reserves are commonly known as Level 2 (L2) and Level 3 (L3) cache. The CPU will store frequently accessed data here for quick retrieval.<br>  <br>  In modern computers systems, Accelerated Graphics Ports (AGPs) and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slots, both Standard and Express, use their own buses for processing graphic data directly, relieving the front side bus of traffic. This helps boost benchmarks and also improves video processing for gaming and streaming multimedia applications like movies.|`|5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	Easy way to think of it is like a highway that carries information from one place to another...the bigger the number or higher the front side bus the more lanes on the highway to travel.<br>  <br>  Now for technical reasoning the FSB carries information from the CPU to the Northbridge. From there the information is disseminated or released to the proper area like the Ram, Graphics Processor or PCI card.|`|NxwTTbOqaa	In personal computers, the Front Side Bus (FSB) is the bus that carries data between the CPU and the northbridge.<br>  <br>  Usually the clock speed of your computer (eg: 3.2 GHz) is determined by your set FSB and your clock multiplier:<br>  <br>  Example: FSB = 350 and Multiplier = 8<br>  <br>  Clock Speed = 350 * 8 = 2.8 GHz|`|fHtLBUcpaa	m|`|805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	The FSB accesses memory.|`|Dfx7S0tmaa	The bus or front side bus if you will is the circuitry (cabling) between your cpu and other components in the computer.<br>  <br>  example - The CPU sends/receives information through the bus. The CPU may send information to the video card, it does this throught the bus. the faster the bus - the faster the video card receives the information to process.<br>  <br>  Bus speed is very important.<br>  <br>  A 3GHZ processor may make calculations at 3 GHZ per second but if the bus speed is 800mhz, then calculations will only travel at 800 mhz.<br>  <br>  You are only as strong as your weakest link.... bus speed is always slower than CPU speed.

77PMVjAAaa	Google Adsense is not a scam. It's a genuine and proven advertising application. <br>  <br>  If you have google ads on your website or blog, every time someone clicks on the advertisements, you receive a payment that was preset. <br>  <br>  You will need to setup and launch your website before you can register with google. They will vet your website to see if its genuine, and not against their terms and conditions ( they don't accept porn, gambling, etc). <br>  <br>  Google ads is absolutely free btw, you don't need to pay them, just need a good website. <br>  <br>  And yes you will need to leave a space on your website where you want the ads to appear.

I dumped Fedora Core 10 not just because I detested KDE 4 (which Ubuntu doesn't use) but because it wouldn't let me sign in in text mode (init 3).  X-Windows was happily running on UNIX servers not just before the Linux kernel was WRITTEN but before Windows itself was released.  The desktops, fluxbox, GNOME KDE and XFCE were all written after by groups unconnected to the X-Windows consortium (which included MIT, IBM and DEC which was bought by Compaq which was bought by Hewlett Packard).<br>  <br>  Linux was created to RUN programs like X-Windows.  Netscape itself, the first graphic web browser, was available for UNIX and Linux six months before it was available for Windows.  And this means that neither X-Windows nor the desktops are intrinsic to the operating system or the distribution, despite what people may say.<br>  <br>  This means you can customize your Linux to your little heart's content.  <br>  <br>  Here is a tutorial for changing the GNOME desktop to look more like Windows:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jrm.phys.ksu.edu/Tutorial/Linux/GnomeDesktop.html" rel="nofollow">http://jrm.phys.ksu.edu/Tutorial/Linux/G...</a><br>  <br>  You do NOT need to reinstall totally to change from Gnome to KDE, incidently.  <br>  <br>  Here is one of many tutorials on changing Ubuntu (GNOME) into Kubuntu (KDE 3.x):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9369" rel="nofollow">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9369</a><br>  <br>  I like XFCE and Fluxbox, neither of which I think would appeal to you at all.

Another cause for it being slow could be those automatic windows updates that install themselves overnight.|`|RjwyRrxtaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

uAOkRBA0aa	Quick Neopoints Hack <br>  Set the time to 11:59 p.m. and wait one minute to have the game think it is another day. This is a quick way to get the neopoints From the games and the trophies, and to refill the shop without having to sleep until the next day. After you do this, change the time and date back to their original setting. <br>  <br>  How can I make 5000 a day? <br>  I buy lots of Spicy wings and lots of Hot Cakes and mix them up in the cooking pot and when i buy them i pay no more than 30 np each. Then i go and put them in the shop for 85 np!!! You can do this if you want because i dont mind losing business to someone thats poorer than me <br>  <br>  <br>  Carnival of Terror <br>  To get more time type in "custard" during the game <br>  <br>  Duplication Cheat <br>  1.) Go into Your Inventory. 2.) Click on an item that you want to duplicate. 3.) Right-click on the page that pops up and view the source. Copy and paste that source into an HTML section of your own free website. (You can get free websites right here at Neopets.) 4.) Change where it says "Select Action" to "Give To [Your Username Here]" (near bottom). 5.) Go to the website, and press "submit"! I dont think it works any more tho <br>  <br>  Free Chocolate Lupes <br>  10:00 p.m. - 10:05 p.m., (eastern time) the Lupe Pack donates hundreds of chocolate lupes to the money tree! Free Neopoints! umm, not sure if they do this any more but can still try! <br>  <br>  Codes for the hide and seek <br>  Go to the library or the tree, then click any were then click Tab then enter then keep repeating. <br>  <br>  Cheat to get atleast 1100 neopoints <br>  First get an account, then sign up for all offers (If you dont want all that crap in your mail box make a fake account at Hotmail) then get a shop, and put 4 apples in it (You can put only 1 in if you want but it doesen't matter you decide), price them at 1100 each and then go tot he sign up page and make a crappy account like W00W, W01W, etc (Sign up as a teen or above). alright so your new account has only 500$ crappy eh? will make 4 pets (dont bother with the names,and stats) and be sure to open the Cartoon Network Page (At the bottom of the page where it says: "Your Pet Has Been Created!"). Now you have 800 $ still not enough, so go to the soap box, say your under 6 and do the rest of the page and voila! 1100 dollars now go to your shop (you should know how too do that). <br>  <br>  Easy money <br>  If you neglect your Neopet, the game will give you free money. You cannot touch the game for a day. <br>  <br>  Mystery Money Cheat <br>  Ok, this one is simple, but risky, but sometimes worth it (I say this, because I got 30,000 from it in 1 hour). Now, sign up, as a teenager, then go to Terror Mountain, then to the Ice Caves, then, go to the kiosk game, and play it, yeah, I know, your thinking, whats he talking about that stupid, but hey its a pretty good thing to do. <br>  <br>  Quest Cheat <br>  This is a little old but what the heck!? Now get a quest from the faeries and make another account (make the account pass and username easy to remember) now go there and go to the Shop Wizard, search for the item you are supposed to find, take the url and then go to your REAL account and get the money needed for the payment and voila you did your quest. (Note: Some people were calling me a liar about my pet because his abilities and strength were so high, the reason he was so good, was because, when I was around, you asked the faeries for quests, so instead of it popping up rarely). <br>  <br>  Snowager Cheat <br>  Well, this is a pretty good cheat, and the items, are good to get, anyhoo, make an account, go to the snowager when he's asleep, (Which I have found was 11:00 PM EST to 12:00 AM EST, and 1:00 AM EST to 2:00 AM Est) So then you try to get the item from him. <br>  <br>  Tombolala Coins <br>  Ok, make the account, (teen one), and make one pet, then go to shops, go to your items, and then to the Tombolala Coins, then signup for all the ones you want! (I find, the fastes ones, are the 1st, and 4th) <br>  <br>  Selling Your Products <br>  Alright I know from experience that the lower the prices the more customers. So go to the Shop Wizard and search for whatever product that in your store if you see someone has a lower price, lower yours by 1, just repeat over and over. <br>  <br>  Best Time To Shop <br>  Alright I have found that the best time to shop is from 3:00 AM (Eastern Time!) to 7:00 AM (Eastern Time!) There wont be as much people then and the Neopets Shops have items longer which means more time to browse, But dont dawdle. <br>  <br>  Nerkmid cheat <br>  Buy a Nerkmid anyone then put it up for auction then use it and you still get the money from the auction and you get the nerkmid but you USE the nerkmid. <br>  <br>  Pet Combos <br>  Mongmong + Snorkle = Moink<br>  Poppit + Spyder = Spoppy<br>  Angelpuss + Triffen = Blooky<br>  <br>  Whack-A-Staff <br>  To get a bigger mallet type in "a5paragu5" <br>  <br>  Tug-O-War Passwords <br>  Theibos= lrslsts<br>  Khadir= sltltsr<br>  Ramset= sslrtrl<br>  Horak= lrlrss<br>  <br>  Hasee Bounce<br>  Type “more doughnutfruit” to reset your time (once per game).<br>  <br>  Ultimate Bullseye<br>  Type “catapult” to get a random bonus.<br>  <br>  Frumball<br>  Type “frumball” to get an extra life, and type “kougra” to skip a level.<br>  <br>  Kiko Match II<br>  Type “ineedmoretime” to get an extra 15 seconds.<br>  <br>  Spell or Starve<br>  Type “channyhungry” and get an extra 30 seconds.<br>  <br>  Sutek’s Tomb<br>  Type “scarabeus” to get an extra 30 seconds, and type “pyramibread” for an extra bonus.<br>  <br>  Ice Cream Machine<br>  Type “strawberryvanillachocolate” to get an extra life.<br>  <br>  Whack-A-Staff Member<br>  Type “a5paragu5″ to get a bigger malet.<br>  <br>  Korbat’s Lab<br>  Type “spiderbite” to get an extra life.<br>  <br>  Kreludan Mining Corp.<br>  Type “kreludor” to get an extra life.<br>  <br>  Meepit Juice Break<br>  Type “hungrymeepits” to get an extra life, and type “juice-o-matic” to reset all meepit’s timers.<br>  <br>  Volcano Run<br>  Type “lava” for an extra shield.<br>  <br>  Attack of the Slorgs<br>  Type “marrow” to get an extra life, and type “slorgerizer” to blast a few slorgs at once.<br>  <br>  Faerie Bubbles<br>  Type “Faerieland” to change your current bubble to rainbow, and type “stardust” to change it to a nova bubble.

pRTh6SmTaa	OpenGL is a library that allows a program, such as a computer game, to draw 3D graphics to the computer screen. A game has to be specifically written to use openGL. DirectX is a similar library created by Microsoft, which most games use. You can make sure you have the most recent version of openGL and DirectX by updating your video card driver. If your video card isn't relatively new, though, then you won't really benefit from openGL 2.1 or DirectX10. As a computer gamer, you don't really need to be all that directly concerned about openGL or DirectX. It isn't going to make your older games magically nicer looking... an old game will look exactly the same because it was specifically written for one version of openGL or DirectX. Just install the games you want to play, and if it doesn't run or runs slowly, buy a newer video card, CPU, and/or more RAM.|`|KTz3qpCvaa	OpenGL is manly used in either Linux, Autodesk software like AutoCAD and other similar software counterparts. Very few games use OpenGL, you can't force a game to use OpenGL when it was designed to use DirectX.

o36YrSWRaa	Wikipedia is a great starting point to gain a general overview of your topic, but it is not entirely credible and should not be cited for your essays. However, it can be a great tool to help you think about other sources and how to find them by giving you information about the subject. <br>  For instance, if you were looking up Augusto Pinochet in Wikipedia you would find out that he was a dictator for many years in Cuba, beginning in the mid-1970's. This could lead you to look up books or scholarly articles on politics in Cuba, famous dictators, and political revolutions in the late twentieth century.|`|6e1900d7b64ea005bd49f87f1a831a95aa	I use Wikipedia for some information.  The only problem with Wikipedia is that anyone can go on there and edit it and change information.  <br>  <br>  However if anyone puts rubbish information on Wikipedia normally it gets changed quite quickly as also the people who know the information is rubbish also go on there and take it out quite quickly.  <br>  <br>  It is very similar to the way more viruses attack Windows than Linux, because Linux is open source if someone attempts to attack it someone else can very quickly re-write that code to prevent the attack from happening, however if someone tries to attack Windows they have to wait a few days or weeks for Microsoft to catch up.<br>  <br>  Although I'd be a bit wary of using some of the articles that get looked at very rarely.  For example the information on Microsoft on Wikipedia is probably far more likely to be up to date, then the information on some random software company that very few people have heard of.<br>  <br>  But again be wary of this as some companies pay people to go on Wikipedia to actually edit their information to keep them looking good.<br>  <br>  I have actually been caught out once by Wikipedia when using their information on Scouting for Boys on a scouts website, then someone pointed out to me that it was being very offensive towards Baden Powell!|`|c0lbIvxKaa	i use wikipedia for my homeworks in history,science etc. subjects but for some reasons i check the links below(or External link sites) it for me to tell whether he/she is telling true.<br>  <br>  well going for a good reference i think you should check first its external link or main site from where it got taken|`|1c2d2c282b304317cb81bf613f2141eaaa	What I will do is go to wikipedia and then use their links to find more reliable sources of information.|`|n3C25dcYaa	yes I do, but I always require at least another source; many times I look at wikipedia only to find references|`|6303924aca31975d4efe5df45761b87caa	There is rich irony in Tayleuur's answer, suggesting how much you can learn from Wikipedia about a "Cuban" dictator named Augusto Pinochet.  Sigh.<br>  <br>  I am going to give you two facts about Wikipedia, and if they don't help make up your mind, then you may be beyond assistance from adults.<br>  <br>  Taner Akcam. Have you ever heard of him? He is an author and professor who teaches about Turkey's role in Armenia. He has political opponents around the world who hold more nationalistic views of Turkey. One day, Akcam was flying from Minnesota to Montreal, to deliver a lecture at a university there. He missed the lecture because he was detained for 4 hours in the airport. Why? Airport security looked him up on Wikipedia and they read that Taner Akcam was involved with terrorist organizations. Even though this was false information maliciously entered into Wikipedia, Akcam's civil rights were violated.<br>  <br>  Here's another fact. The Wikipedia article about Jackson, Michigan recently corrected a piece of misinformation about Abraham Lincoln. The article had said that Lincoln attended the first convention of the Republican Party, in Jackson. The thing is, Lincoln only ever visited Michigan once in his life, and it was a trip to Kalamazoo and had nothing to do with the convention in Jackson. Guess how long this error persisted in Wikipedia? A few minutes? A day or two? A week?<br>  <br>  No, the error was in place for 600 days, Adarsh.<br>  <br>  That's why you are a fool if you think Wikipedia, on its own, should be considered a reliable source of information.  Go ahead and have fun reading it to get your mind prepared on a subject, but don't ever cite it as a source in anything to which you formally affix your name.<br>  <br>  Don't be like this kid:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/114010/" rel="nofollow">http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/a...</a>

AA11134471	You need to use the UART. Since you dont say what micro you are using, all I can do is give you a general idea.<br>  <br>  first you need to set up the UART transmit and receive (if you are going to use it). this is usually done through the SCON register. Then you need to assign a timer to the UART, usually through the T2CON register. Then you need to set the baud rate for the timer using the TH, and TL registers and the reload registers RCAPH, RCAPL. Then enable the interrupts by setting EA = 1. Then to send a byte, just write it to the SBUF register. When you receive a UART TX interrupt, you can send another byte.<br>  <br>  Thats the basics, but if you want the exact setting then I need to know much more info about the wireless transmitter and the exact micro you are using.

44aU5Gp6aa	hello|`|zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people suggest that you either install or "get" something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think<br>  of those two as you would Windows XP compared to Vista.<br>  Please consider this previous "Best Answer" of mine, then<br>  check out the Asker's comments afterwards:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that my information proves somewhat helpful for you.<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now|`|edPeEGzmaa	Well it shouldn't be flash, since most of the videos work.

If the answer is yes, then follow the instructions below. If the answer is no, was AVG8 or any version of AVG ever on your computer? <br>  <br>  First of all, go to start, settings, control panel, if you are running Windows Vista you will click programs and features all other versions of Windows you will click add/remove programs. Find anything marked AVG on the list (sometimes there are more than one element to a program). Uninstall anything marked AVG (regardless of the version) one by one. <br>  <br>  Then, click on My Computer on your desk top, double click on your hard drive (generally the C Drive), click on program files, look for a folder that says AVG if any. If there is a folder marked AVG, delete it, it might also be listed under a different name, so browse thru the folders to see if you can find it (generally the publisher's name is used if it is not listed under the program name). If the file or folder will not delete because of denied access, reboot your computer, then try deleting the whole file or folder. If it still will not delete, open the folder, and delete the files one at a time, and then delete the empty folder. <br>  <br>  Next, press CTRL ALT DELETE. Make sure that under processes in Task Manager that AVG is not running. If it is running, then click on it, and stop the program from running. <br>  <br>  Reboot your computer. See if Kaspersky still lists AVG8. <br>  <br>  If it still lists it, you will need to edit the registry. It is important that you do not tamper with any other registry keys or you could mess up your computer. Click Start, Run, type regedit in all lower case letters, click Ok. Find the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\  <br>  Right click on it, select export and save it on your computer (just in case). Then find the AVG key listed and delete it from the registry. Reboot your computer. If AVG is still listed in Kaspersky, run regedit again and navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wi...<br>  Right click on it, select export and save it to your computer (just in case).

And it doesn't have to depend on Microsoft's operating system. They have their own Mac OS X, which i can say truly is superiors for working professionals, i wouldn't pull down Microsoft as they cater to all more family centered package. Apple is leading innovation over functionalities.<br>  <br>  They are other parties that are involve as well, for sure Intel is profiting from the rivalry, as both are running on intel's precessors. <br>  <br>  I'm with Mac aka Apple, although i'm a season windows user, due to mainstream gaming. I dont believe in out of the box pc, which is why i got my own custom gaming rig.|`|slCUkmm1aa	Microsoft owns them both. So I pick Microsoft. haha they own pretty much everything one way or another..|`|sSEy6KYiaa	No there isn't although Apple could happily buy Dell and still have change. Apple has $30 Billion in the bank and Dell is only worth $17.2 Billion<br>  Microsoft DOESN'T own either company although Microsoft Windows does run as OEM on Dell PCs.<br>  <br>  Microsoft has NO money invested in Apple.|`|edPeEGzmaa	Personally I wouldn't purchase either, but I would take a Dell over a Mac any day. <br>  <br>  Unless they were free, then I would take the Mac and sell it for a profit to a moron that I could manipulate and rip off. Steve Jobs does it well, why couldn't I?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Mac fan boys are far too quick to give the thumb downs.

Besides parts of the task bar, some web pages can disable the right click feature. Such a web page might be an artists work where they programmed the web page to prevent people from copying their artwork.<br>  <br>  Open up a 2nd IE window and surf to www.yahoo.com and see if toolbars return.  Some can return if you click on File - View - Toolbars.<br>  <br>  I hate giving obvious advice.  If toolbars return and you keep returning to the same web page and things go missing again then stop visiting that web page.<br>  <br>  Update: I only have the obvious fixes.  Replace the driver or something is physically wrong with the right mouse button.  Same type mouse on the same machine should have the same problem if it is the driver.  Something physically wrong with the mouse then right clicking on your desktop should also fail. Right clicking on Windows Explorer should fail.<br>  <br>  One more thing: I installed a game rarely played by anyone.  That software crashed and left my right clicker disabled.  It was actually remapped to my center mouse clicker.  I had to go into Control Panel - Mouse - to enable it. You might be able to test your right clicker with it.<br>  <br>  I finally figured that out by downloaded mouse software from Kensington.  I used to run tests for their wireless mice.  Their software can turn your mouse into a powerful tool for certain projects.  That software can change your mouse so left and right clicks behave like a left click.

I don't think you'll need all the extra power if you're just going to do Word essays and surf the net.<br>  <br>  The MacBook is the perfect balance of power and size. It's 13.3 inches wide, which is perfect for carrying.<br>  <br>  Also the new one has the illuminated keyboard which REALLY comes in handy.<br>  <br>  The 2.4 has 250GB of hard drive space, which is way more than you'll probably ever need. It also sports 2GB of memory, which is plenty to make it fast enough for what you need.<br>  <br>  When talking about GB, that's a measurement of size. Meaning how much you can store on your computer. I'm pretty sure you won't need to pay the extra for more space because unless you're a video editor or graphic designer like me, you won't need A TON of space.<br>  <br>  Macs are the best computers I've ever had and you don't need to worry about getting viruses, which is really great.<br>  <br>  Here's the link for the one you should get.<br>  <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook" rel="nofollow">http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/sh...</a><br>  <br>  You want the one in the middle, the 2.4. That has everything in one great price.<br>  <br>  If you buy online, it's free shipping, and if you buy with the education store, you can get a discount for being a student. I thought that was really handy.<br>  <br>  If you don't know how to buy online, or want to look at the Mac before you buy it, you can go to your nearest Apple store, and they can recommend one for you, but they might try to talk you into something a bit more than you need, so ask for the 2.4Ghz MacBook.<br>  <br>  It's $1,599, which isn't bad for all the great things you're getting.<br>  If you do decide to get one, you can add me, and I can help you with anything you're wondering about it, or help you install things.

SJM0rzHtaa	I'm using a 52" Sony Bravia LCD HDTV as my monitor.  It's connected to my computer using a DVI-to-HDMI cable.  (Yes, DVI is compatible with HDMI).  The image is razor sharp and the text is nice and big--  easy to read.  Photo of my setup:  <a href="http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/armchairaviator/computer/IMG_0880c.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/a...</a><br>  <br>  Just make sure the video card in the computer has either a DVI or HDMI port.  DVI / HDMI is the best way to connect to a big-screen HDTV because it's a digital signal.<br>  <br>  I agree with Carl about a good wireless keyboard.  The one I'm using is a Logitech DiNovo Edge bluetooth wireless keyboard and trackpad, works just like a laptop keyboard and touchpad.  A lot more convenient than having a separate keyboard and mouse.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|60d0cf49a04353e2a9ac75325ad25476aa	Absolutely!! the hook up is simple.  Most big screen LCD or Plasma screens come with an HDMI or VGA connector which will connect directly to a computer.  The user simply has to switch the source to HDMI to have the computer screen.  I would add that a good quality wireless keyboard and mouse would compliment this arrangement.  This way she is able to control everything from her bed.

60d0cf49a04353e2a9ac75325ad25476aa	I'm curious about how dirty your computer might have been before you "cleaned" it.  If it was really dirty especially the processor heat sink and fan, it is possible that you have overheated the processor and caused the thermal compound (put between the processor and the heatsink to ensure a good thermal bond) to create an air gap.  Once that happens, the processor can overheat and then shut down the computer.  It might be even just enough so that when you start running multiple programs it overheats the processor. Use a good compound (I.e Artic Silver) and use it sparingly, only about the size of a small pea.  Once you complete that, run "Prime 95" (google it) as a torture test for your processor.  If it is going to overheat your system it will happen using Prime 95 (looks for new prime numbers) I feel pretty confident that this will resolve your issue.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|edPeEGzmaa	Have you actually done several reformats? Or were you merely doing system restores? <br>  <br>  If it was software related then a reformat would solve it, as anything that shouldn't be on your computer would be gone. It is normal to have several dozen processes running at any given time, these are used by various applications and by your system and many are integral to the normal operation of Windows. <br>  <br>  Anyways, do a real reformat where the disk is wiped clean by formatting it, then reinstalling Windows. If you did in fact do this several times, then it is possible that your CPU is shot, thought that isn't overly likely since it is working fine. If it was broken and wasting all of its power, I doubt it would remain functional or usable.<br>  <br>  If it's not software related, I really don't know what could cause your CPU to do that. Perhaps a corrupted BIOS.

edPeEGzmaa	You could write a batch file to do it, which would be especially handy if you already have your list on your PC so that you can just copy and paste it. If you're running Vista make sure you go to the Start Menu, then All Programs, then Accessories, then right Click on Command Prompt and click Properties then go to the Shortcuts tab and enable "Run as Administrator".<br>  <br>  Then open up notepad, and if you have your list simply copy and paste the various commands to get the same format that I will list:<br>  <br>  type nul>Test1.txt<br>  type nul>Test2.txt<br>  type nul>Test3.txt<br>  type nul>Easy huh.txt<br>  type nul>etc.txt<br>  <br>  Simply copy and paste " type nul " 50 times in front of each file name, and paste .txt after each file name. That'd be a lot faster then having to manually create and save each file, and once you type all of that it's fully automated.<br>  <br>  If you don't enter a specific pathname like I failed to do in the example above, the files will simply be saved to your User folder, (the folder that is your name, or whatever you entered as your name during Windows installation).<br>  <br>  If you have a specific folder that you wanted to save it to, for instance "NewFolder" in your C: drive, then the command would be:<br>  <br>  type nul>C:\NewFolder\Test1.txt<br>  type nul>C:\NewFolder\Test2.txt<br>  type nul>C:\NewFolder\Test3.txt<br>  type nul>C:\NewFolder\Easy huh.txt<br>  type nul>C:\NewFolder\etc.txt<br>  <br>  Using CTRL+C and CTRL+V to copy and paste them I was able to create that batch file in like 5 seconds. <br>  <br>  To save your batchfile in notepad go to "Save As" and type whatever you want to name your batch file ("batchfile" for instance) and put .bat on the end. So "Batchfile.bat" "test.bat" etc. And make sure that beneath that where it says "Save as Type" that you select All Files and not Text Documents (*.txt). Save that someplace easy like your root drive (C:).<br>  <br>  Then open up your command prompt, and enter "C:\batchfile.bat" or whatever you named your batch file, and be sure to include the pathname for wherever you saved it.<br>  <br>  Then voila, it automatically and instantly creates empty text files for you.<br>  <br>  People are typically weary to do anything in the command prompt, but they needn't be. It's a really handy way to do all sorts of things that are otherwise impossible to do in Windows without third party software.<br>  <br>  You can even add text to each of those files in different ways, like inserting one line into every file, or different lines into specific files, or a specific line for each specific file. Command prompt is pretty awesome.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	It will take as long or likely longer to set up software for this as it does to open the editor and simply enter  the file save as then type in the name.|`|Pm6rM9e2aa	Yes, there is a template maker tool<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sfx.site40.net/file_tool/" rel="nofollow">http://sfx.site40.net/file_tool/</a>

7nimzIDsaa	Q1: No, if there isn't an OS in the hard disk itself, you can't repair anything as the screen will most likely prompt for an install.<br>  <br>  With reference to the article from tech recipes, part of it goes like this:<br>  <br>  one method of repairing the MBR for an XP host using the recovery console.<br>  <br>  You have to have a host o/s in order to utilise this function.<br>  <br>  *I will be focusing on how to salvage the data in the hard disk and hopefully this few links are useful to your cause.|`|U0fjB82qaa	No I don't think you've/ he's lost the OS and The recovery consul is correct to use "fixmbr" thats      f i x m b r    but no spaces and you may have to boot off of your OS/ XP (?) CD to get to the recovery consul<br>  f i x m b r  = stands for fix main boot record<br>  Here is the link cut and pasted:<br>  <br>  Boot with the XP installation CD.<br>  <br>  When prompted, press R to repair a Windows XP installation.<br>  <br>  If repairing a host with multiple operating systems, select the appropriate one (XP) from the menu. If you have only one operating system, enter 1 to select it.<br>  <br>  Enter the administrator password if prompted. <br>  <br>  To fix the MBR, use the following command:<br>  <br>  fixmbr<br>  <br>  This assumes that your installation is on the C:\ drive. You will be presented with several scary warning lines the reading of which will make you want to say no. Microsoft is exceptionally vague regarding the conditions under which fixmbr can cause problems although they are clear about the consequences (losing all data on the hard drive), so use this at your own risk. <br>  <br>  Type y and ENTER to fix the MBR.<br>  <br>  Type exit to leave the recovery console and reboot.<br>  hope this helps dude

Start Microsoft Internet Explorer, and then try to visit the following Web sites: <br>  Messenger service status<br>  Microsoft web site<br>  If you cannot visit these sites, contact your Internet service provider (ISP) for information about how to set up your Internet connection so that you can visit both secure (https) and non-secure (http) sites. <br>   <br>  2. If you are able to visit the Messenger service status page and notice that there is a service issue, please visit the site later to determine when the service is available so that you can sign into Messenger. If the site indicates that the all systems are stable and running, go to the next step.  <br>  <br>   <br>  3.  Clear the proxy settings in MSN Messenger.<br>  3.a. Start Messenger.  <br>  3.b. On the Tools menu, click Options.  <br>  3.c. Click Connection in the left navigation pane.  <br>  3.d. Click Advanced Settings in the Connection Settings section.  <br>  3.e. Delete the content of the SOCKS field.  <br>  3.f.  Click OK two times to save the settings.  <br>  3.g. After you clear the proxy settings, verify if you are able to sign into Messenger. If you are still not able to sign into Messenger then please go to the next step.  <br>  <br>   <br>  4.  If you are using Windows Vista, disable the Auto Tuning Networking feature: <br>  4.a. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, and then right-click Command Prompt and choose Run as administrator.  <br>  4.b. Click Continue when Windows requests permission to continue.  <br>  4.c. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled  <br>  Note: This command disables the Window Auto Tuning feature. <br>  4.d.  After you disable the Auto Tuning Networking feature, verify if you are able to sign into Messenger. <br>   <br>  5. If you are still not able to sign into Messenger then please re-enable this feature using the information below and then go to the next step. <br>  5.a.  Re-enable the Auto Tuning Networking feature by typing the following command at the command prompt, and then pressing ENTER: <br>   <br>  netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal  <br>  <br>  Note: This command enables Window Auto Tuning again so that you can take advantage of the network throughput performance increase it provides.  <br>  <br>   7.If you are using Windows Vista and you also use a router (eg. Linksys, D-Link, Netgear) on your home network to connect to the internet please visit the router manufacturer’s website to update to the latest firmware for that product.  <br>  <br>  ★to include MSN into the firewall exceptions go2<br>  start<br>  control panel<br>  security center<br>  windows firewall<br>  options<br>  exceptions<br>  mark the windows live messenger box<br>  <br>  ok<br>  <br>  ★do the same to your antivirus exceptions★<br>  <br>  <br>  ????????*`?. ? ??ρε ? ?εlρε??.?* ????????<br>  ☆<br>  ::: (\(\ <br>  *: (=' :') :* <br>  ?..

jZ5MnD7Qaa	It means your Processor is capable of doing more per clock cycle than a typical processor, or that it's equivalent to a 6 Ghz processor.<br>  <br>  For example: Say you have two processors, A and B.<br>  <br>  A runs at 2 Ghz, and can run one instruction per clock cycle<br>  B runs at 1 Ghz and can run up to four instructions per clock cycle<br>  <br>  Which one is faster? If you say "A" your wrong, "A" while having a higher clock frequency, it can only get so much done at a time, while "B", running at a much slower clock cycle, can get more done in a given period of time.<br>  <br>  B is 'equivalent' to a 4 Ghz CPU because it can run 4 instructions per each clock cycle.<br>  <br>  Think of it as two construction projects building two identical houses. Construction Team A works a 12 hour shift, and gets alot of work done in a given day, but only has 5 construction workers. While Construction Team B works a 6 hour shift, BUT has 15 construction workers. Construction Team B will finish it's house before Team A, dispite working half as much time.<br>  <br>  You see where I'm going? <br>  <br>  More workers = job completed sooner<br>  More instructions per cycle = code runs faster - CPU is faster<br>  <br>  Now most modern CPUs can run many instructions per clock cycle, for example AMD CPUs tend to be lower clock than comparable Intel CPUs, which may run 1 or 2 Ghz faster. However that doesnt mean the Intel is faster, AMD CPUs tend to do more per clock cycle than Intel CPUs, which puts them right up with or even ahead of an Intel CPU.<br>  <br>  This is why AMD, a much smaller company than Intel, is still in business. Intel advertises Ghz as a measure of speed, while AMD uses "equivalent" clock cycle nymbers.<br>  <br>  hope that helps :D|`|aJ0AL6RFaa	6Ghz resemble theoriticaly  max frequency at which proccy can work.<br>  How ever practicly it is impossible 2 achieve.<br>  <br>  If speeking truly I have overclock proccy max 2  3.5 Ghz<br>  <br>  BTW 2.4 is of course higher den 2.4

0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	I'm guessing that you have an older CRT type monitor as opposed to an LCD monitor. If so, I suspect the CRT noise you hear is the flyback transformer inside that provides the high voltage for the monitor to run (I won't go into all the technical details), but that noise is not all that uncommon and does not mean anything detrimental in most cases especially if you can't hear it under normal operation. The noise can come and go depending on differing factors, but when there is no picture it could be being driven at a frequency that you can hear. As to why the monitor comes on could be that its sleep circuit isn't working quite as well as it used to to detect when there is no more video signal being received. You could try reseating the video cable at both ends, if possible, to see if that helps. If that doesn't work you could manually turn off the monitor using its own power button. The other option would be to replace the monitor with a newer one, but that would be up to you. If you don't mind using the monitor's power switch to turn it off/on each time and the monitor still works well, then I'd say keep it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

H5iVq0fwaa	i dont believe that there is a best internet security. but there is such a thing as good internet practice like having a backup - so you can restore it whenever you ran into a problem.<br>  <br>  having a backup is even better than having an antivirus which hogs ram resouces. the only downside to a backup is that your files will be reverted back to when you made your backup. to update these files, you can either copy and paste or use microsoft synctoy to backup outlook files, my document files, ie favorites, etc. after restoring the backup; you can update your files by copy and pasting or importing by the software (like outlook).<br>  <br>  this will also save you from a lot of trial and errors trying to delete a virus.<br>  <br>  you also need a windows installer to reformat your harddrive. but if you have a backup that is clean of any malwares. then after reformatting, you can restore the backup without reactivating windows.<br>  <br>  regarding antiviruses and any other softwares, i dont believe in the best is always the latest. i have used the latest trend micro and it is too strong for me. so i am using trend micro antivirus version 2006. my software is expired. so i cant use the automatic updating. but it still works perfectly and i know how to update it manually.|`|df75o2iCaa	Try AVG.

Before I discovered Kaspersky, I used Trend Micro's PC Cillin, I thought the most recent version of it was pretty bad however, and now I am sold on Kaspersky for life. <br>  <br>  If you decide to choose a different brand, look for an Internet Security Suite that protects against: Viruses, Malware, Trojan Horses, and Spyware at the very minimum.|`|FZ0hwowaaa	Try Avast...it saved my computer many occasions and a great program.
6e1900d7b64ea005bd49f87f1a831a95aa	Yes you don't need an isp, but you can only use the wi-fi close to the library or coffee shop.  Its great if you live next door to the library 'cos then you can use their internet, but if you live miles away from the library you wont be able to use the internet at home, you'll need to go to the library every time.  Also some of these free wi-fi's you need to go into the place and ask for the SSID and password to access their network as it's hidden to stop everyone accessing it.<br>  <br>  If it is hidden you'll need to add it manually, in Vista you do this by adding a new network, or in XP you have to double click on the wi-fi icon and click change the order of preferred networks and add one there, make sure you add a tick to the box that says "connect even if it's not broadcasting", if you get stuck the library should have technicians there to tell you how to do that.<br>  <br>  If you do want to use the internet at home and not pay for an ISP you might be able to connect to someone via FON.

0pYituSBaa	No, you need internet.|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	You need to have an Internet Connection to download anything from any location. If you plan to download updates from Rising, you will need to be connected to the Internet. In order for a software program to update, you need to use the computer that has the software on it and then let the program download the update and update itself automatically. That is how antivirus programs work. However, if the company has released a new version, and you can download the entire new version for free instead of just a quick update (like a definition update) then you could go to a public computer that allows downloading, download the program to a disc, and then install the program on your computer. However, with an anti virus program, you really need an Internet connection, so that you will always be up to date and protected against the latest "nasty bugs" on the Internet. <br>  <br>  If you do not use the Internet enough to justify paying for a high speed connection, I suggest that you get a limited use connection, but be careful that you do not exceed it's download limit, or you will get strapped with an extra fee that can be extremely expensive. <br>  <br>  By the way, if you aren't using the Internet, why do you need an active anti virus program anyway? If you are just running legitimate software from legitimate companies and not putting downloaded crap from other locations on your computer, you should not need any kind of protection software.|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	I don't know....You tell me.Do you know anybody that has internet?lol<br>  never heard of "RISING" AV....Must be crap.Get a real AV like NOD32,Kaspersky,AVG,even AVAST.|`|dll0Y0n8aa	you must be Chinese if you are using Rising use AVG its free and better if you are studying in a Western country ask your friends or teachers can you use their internet someone will help you it is a very reasonable request

It's possible that your computer is dealing with too much bandwidth if you have more than one page open or something.  You can try leaving the page open for a bit and going back to it, see if it works then.  If not, you will have to contact customer service, and it's possible that closing the window, going back and re-creating your page will allow you to save and publish.  Also, I would check to make sure that you have verified your account if you have just created it.  If you haven't, then go to your email, verify and then try saving.  You might not be able to save still since you started the page before verification, but it will work afterward.

From there will you need to transfer all those files from your external hard drive to your new Windows XP computer, and then you will most likely need to re-install a bunch of your programs that you originally had.

zorYTX59aa	I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth.

RjwyRrxtaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your computer.<br>  <br>  4.

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed.

What these are how you use them is described here.<br>  <br>  My recommendations are that you try each of the methods listed below in that order. Each method has an indication of which Windows operating system it is applicable to.<br>  <br>  1) Using a program's own configuration options - Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP<br>  The best option is to check if a program gives you an option to disable the function you're interested in - via a right-click on a System Tray icon or maybe an "options" menu within the program. If this isn't available then you have to try something else.<br>  <br>  For example, Norton SystemWorks has an "Options" tab on the main start-up screen that allows you to configure the utilities in the suite - Norton Utilities, Norton AntiVirus and Norton Cleansweep.<br>  <br>  2) Windows StartUp folder - Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP<br>  If you click on Start -> Programs -> StartUp (Win9x/Me/NT/2K) or Start -> All Programs -> StartUp (WinXP) you may find programs loading from here via shortcuts. If this is the case, you have two options :-<br>  <br>  Delete the shortcut from the StartUp directory (based on your OS):<br>  <br>  Win9x/98/Me - C:\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp<br>  <br>  WinNT/2K - C:\Winnt\Profiles\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp<br>  <br>  WinXP - C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup<br>  <br>  Create a temporary directory for your OS called "Disabled StartUp Programs" and move the shortcuts there. If a program doesn't work as expected you can always move the relevant shortcut back again<br>  <br>  Win9x/98/Me - C:\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br>  <br>  WinNT/2K - C:\Winnt\Profiles\All Users\Start Menu\Programs<br>  <br>  WinXP - C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs<br>  <br>  3) System Configuration Utility (MSCONFIG) - Windows 95/98/Me/2000/XP<br>  Work your way through the list of programs included here and deselect the appropriate boxes in your version then click OK followed by re-starting Windows.<br>  <br>  WinME and WinXP display items for the same program in different ways in MSCONFIG. WinME uses the same descriptive text under the MSCONFIG "Name" and registry Run keys "Name" columns. WinXP often uses the first part of the filename under the "Startup Item" column and the equivalent descriptive part in the "Name" column of the registry "Run" keys. For instance, on my WinXP Home machine I have ZoneAlarm and see:<br>  <br>  MSCONFIG : "Startup Item" = zlclient & "Command" = zlclient.exe<br>  REGISTRY : "Name" = Zone Labs Client & "Data" = zlclient.exe<br>  Virus entries in the program list are only shown using the registry version in this case to prevent unnecessary duplication due the number of them.<br>  <br>  Notes:<br>  <br>  When you have deselected an item in MSCONFIG, you will be starting in "Selective startup" mode. This can be seen under the "General" tab. Working in "Selective startup" mode is perfectly acceptable - I do and don't have a problem. Warning: If you subsequently decide to choose "Normal startup", all disabled items will be re-enabled<br>  <br>  Some disabled items may disappear from MSCONFIG when you re-start Windows<br>  <br>  MSCONFIG is intended to be used to temporarily disable programs from running at system start-up. In some cases, disabled items may be added to a new category under Start -> Programs (Win9x/Me/NT/2K) or Start -> All Programs (WinXP) called "Disabled Startup Items". If the entry has disappeared from MSCONFIG and is available here they can be copied back into the appropriate OS StartUp directory:<br>  <br>  Win9x/98/Me - C:\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp<br>  <br>  WinNT/2K - C:\Winnt\Profiles\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp<br>  <br>  WinXP - C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup<br>  <br>  For WinME users - If you have disabled items in MSCONFIG and at a later date uninstall the program they are associated with, you can click on the "Cleanup" button to verify and remove all invalid entries from the startup sections of the reigistry<br>  For Win9x/XP user - If you have disabled items in MSCONFIG and at a later date uninstall the program they are associated with, you can try a free application from Virtuoza called MSConfig Cleanup<br>  If there is an option within a program to disable parts of it running at start-up (see here) and you don't use that method to disable them, you may find they are re-enabled in MSCONFIG the next time the program runs<br>  <br>  4) Use a 3rd party utility to control start-up programs - Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP<br>  There are a number of programs widely available as shareware or freeware that achieve the same purpose. Each can identify what programs are running at startup and allow you to control them to differing degrees. I cannot personally recommend an individual program as I don't use them and am happy enough with MSCONFIG (even though it is only intended to be a temporary solution while troubleshooting - see above).<br>  <br>  Want to try a start-up manager? Try from the list given here. <br>  <br>  5) The System Registry - Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP<br>  Note: if you are run|`|NQmF1FwOaa	You can explore the start menu/program files/start up.<br>  Then you can remove the shortcut.<br>  Or you can do by using editing the regedit.

I've been running the Beta on my desktop for a few weeks and it's already rock solid for what I've been doing, even during renders which are quite resource intensive. <br>  <br>  But Vista has been extremely stable and reliable for me, and I've used it on 3 different set ups now, all varying in specifications. Whether it's my tablet with a 1.9GHz AMD dual core and 3GB of RAM and an ATI 3400 graphics card, my old desktop that had a 2.6GHz AMD dual core and 2GB of RAM with a NVIDIA 8600GT, or my new desktop with a 2.75GHz Intel Q8200 quad core, 4GB of RAM, and a NVIDIA GTX 260, they have all been rock solid and smooth for gaming, rendering, anything that I throw at it. XP gave me nothing but trouble when I used it on various other setups, although it has been running nicely on my tablet's VMWare for school. I think that I was just incompetent back then and didn't take care of my system, since I did use XP when I was like 15.<br>  <br>  From my experience, Vista > XP. Windows 7 isn't even out, so I can't really say.

The unit "GHz" or "gigaherz" is a common misspelling for gigahertz. The gigahertz, abbreviated GHz, is a unit of alternating current (AC) or electromagnetic (EM) wave frequency equal to one thousand million hertz (1,000,000,000 Hz). The gigahertz is used as an indicator of the frequency of ultra-high-frequency (UHF) and microwave EM signals and also, in some computers, to express microprocessor clock speed.|`|8x7VkHhIaa	GHz is a form of measurement to measure the power of a processor. Processor is the brain of a computer and about intel, and no it does not have any thing to do with intel. but intel is a company producing the best processors in the world.

7nimzIDsaa	Its a myth out there, that dual gpu graphic solutions will have micro stuttering problems. I don't believe vSync is necessary, however vSync will improve the performance at the expense of fps. You can try playing fear 2 for a while with vSync off and see how it fare. Fps is just an average real time diagnostic, you don't have to go jumpy on that. As long as it doesn't go below 40 fps, a normal human's eye can't detect the difference.<br>  <br>  the gpu might not be the sole cause of stutters and lag, you have to have consistency in your system as a whole, problems arises could be attributed from the other hardware.<br>  <br>  To be exact make sure your running on the latest nVidia drivers.

I would suggest you set up 192.168.0.2 for one and 192.168.0.3 for the other. <br>  The gateways for both machines should be the same. Set up 192.168.0.1 for both. <br>  The subnet masks have to be the same. Set up 255.255.255.0 for both. <br>  DNS settings can be anything. Put in something random for both (they are anyway not going to access the internet when they are only connected to each other, right?) say 111.222.111.222<br>  Now, you should be able to see each other. What OS are you running? If Windows, turn off firewall (not needed, but simplifies a lot of things, and rmember to turn it back on when you connect to hte internet again). Then go to your machine where there s shared stuff. Let's assume it is laptop with the IP 192.168.0.2.<br>  Right click on the folder you want to share, and hit "Sharing" in the context menu. Once you do that, you can simply share. Ignore any warnings. <br>  Go to the PC (with the IP 192.168.0.3) and open xplorer. Type in "\\192.168.0.2" in the address bar and you should be able to see the shared flder.

0a233bd5749b72a4fcdc30c835d8592baa	Without being able to weigh the items, you could not really estimate the cost.<br>  <br>  If the seller will not give a price for shipping, enter $0.00 in the shipping price and send the monies due.<br>  <br>  You can add a note (in the Paypal box provided) that you will pay shipping when you are told how much.<br>  <br>  They should be obliged to send the goods and may bill shipping seperately.|`|38dad445f34cde94feb830c6629395c5aa	Well first, I would be suspicious of the seller unless they have a legitimate reason for having yet to contact you.  Most reputable sellers will either specify a fixed cost for s&h that usually includes the fees they have to pay for listing the item(s) or provide a shipping cost calculator.<br>  <br>  That being said, you need to check what shipping method they specified, i.e. USPS, FedEx, UPS, etc.  If they didn't specify and it says 'Check description' and they didn't provide a shipping cost in the description, I would further be suspicious.  If it does say what method, then go to their site and calculate the shipping based on your zip code, the seller's zip code, and the estimated weight of the items.  Most sellers will use FedEx or UPS for particularly heavy items because it's cheaper than USPS.<br>  <br>  Now, if I were you, I would give this seller a neutral--you should not have to go through the hassle of figuring out the s&h cost--it should be provided for you.  Actually, if the purchase was more than $50 which I'm figuring it was, I'd reevaluate if I wanted to continue with the purchase based on the fact that this is showing some of the tell-tale signs of unscrupulous sellers.  If the seller didn't inform me of s&h costs within 7 days of winning the item, I'd contact eBay to cancel the purchase.<br>  <br>  A lot of people don't realize the amount of deception that goes on on eBay.  You need to be careful with these sellers.  Check out eBay's buying guides posted by users.  Search for 'safe eBay tips' or something of the like.  They provide you with some good rules of thumb for safely buying on eBay.  Good luck!

Routing TCP/IP, Volume I, Second Edition, has reaffirmed Jeff and Jennifer’s excellent pedagogical prowess, with the TCP/IP routing framework. When I read Routing TCP/IP, Volumes I and II several years ago, the excellent presentation of the various routing protocols in a clear case study driven manner helped me develop a firm understanding of the various interior and exterior routing protocols available for TCP/IP. Routing TCP/IP, Volume I,  Second Edition is a more concise edition of the first edition with several new chapters on IP version 6 specific protocols. <br>  <br>  Unlike the 14 chapter, 1026 pages long first edition, the second edition is organized into 14 chapters also but is 910 pages long and comes with a 45 day free online access at Safari Books  Online. That’s a great deal. The organization of this edition is similar to the first; Part I deals with basic concepts,  Part II with interior routing protocols and Part III discusses routing controls and interoperability. Part IV is a collection of appendices and solutions to problems discussed throughout the text.<br>  <br>  Part I now includes an expanded review of IPv6 in a chapter by itself. This is arguably one of the better treatments of the subject I have seen in a text and provides a concise introduction to IPv6 protocol headers, control protocols and addressing.  <br>  <br>  Part II includes an expanded treatment of RIP version 2 as well as the new RIPng which is an RIP implementation for IP v6.  The now deprecated IGRP has been dropped and a totally new chapter on OSPF version 3 explains the updated OSPF for IP v6.<br>  <br>  Part III, like I and II also includes updated and new case studies to reflect current and future trends.  A new case study on IPv6 redistribution with route maps  shows a simple example of route redistribution from RIPng to IS-IS for IPv6  networks.<br>  <br>  Like previous Doyle work, this book is heavily invested in sample configurations using Cisco IOS, but the clear treatment of technology theories and directions make this book a great reference for all internetworking engineers out there.<br>  <br>  The clear and detailed presentation of the materials make this book accessible to networking professionals of all grade, newbie to experts alike. And as organizations prep themselves for the inevitable migration to IPv6 , Jeff Doyle’s book  is definitely an additional resource for the engineers whose job it will be to provision the change.<br>  <br>  Definitely not the be all book on TCP/IP , the book will likely become a key ingredient in the arsenal of network managers, administrators and even researches and an excellent guide to Cisco network professionals and students. If anything, I will recommend this volume, and highly so, to aspiring Cisco Certification candidates and anyone who already owns or has read the first edition. This edition is indeed an upgrade.

edPeEGzmaa	Your only options would be to get a wireless connection from a cell phone company (which is not advisable, since this is not economically practical for a home computer thanks to the high cost) or to subscribe to a local wireless internet provider if one was available. Some towns and cities have towers that transmit the internet, and you can subscribe to these and use the signal. There is also satellite internet, which is again inadvisable thanks to high costs. Also, all of these are subject to weather which is a downer. The further away that you are from the tower broadcasting the signal, the weaker the signal and thus the higher the chance of failure and slower speeds. For satellite, heavy overcast weather and storms can have bad effects on your connection. <br>  <br>  None of these are very practical if you can get DSL or cable by land. For basic use, I'd say that you'd be spending a minimum of $50-75 a month. that's a guess, but I don't think that it'd be far off. And you would probably have a very low bandwidth cap as well, going over it would incur more fees.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Well of course, if you have access to cable then get it instead of DSL. But I am assuming that a person who has no phone line won't magically have a cable line running into their house.|`|GI27dKIkaa	One option - would be to find a neighbour with a wireless router and connect using that !<br>  <br>  I have a Toshiba laptop with WiFi and where I live, there are SIX wireless routers available !

0AMmBDdRaa	A stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications accessing a relational database system. Stored procedures (sometimes called a proc, sproc, StoPro, or SP) are actually stored in the database data dictionary.<br>  <br>  Typical uses for stored procedures include data validation (integrated into the database) or access control mechanisms. Furthermore, stored procedures are used to consolidate and centralize logic that was originally implemented in applications. Large or complex processing that might require the execution of several SQL statements is moved into stored procedures and all applications call the procedures only.<br>  <br>  Stored procedures are similar to user-defined functions (UDFs). The major difference is that UDFs can be used like any other expression within SQL statements, whereas stored procedures must be invoked using the CALL statement<br>  <br>  CALL procedure(…)<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  EXECUTE procedure(…)<br>  <br>  <br>  A stored procedure includes<br>  1.      A CREATE PROC (CREATE PROCEDURE) statement;<br>  <br>  2.      The procedure name;<br>  <br>  3.      The parameter list<br>  <br>  4.      And the SQL statements.<br>  <br>  Example<br>  Let's take a look at a practical example. Assume we have the table shown at the bottom of this page, named Inventory. This information is updated in real-time and warehouse managers are constantly checking the levels of products stored at their warehouse and available for shipment. In the past, each manager would run queries similar to the following:<br>  <br>      SELECT Product, Quantity<br>      FROM Inventory<br>      WHERE Warehouse = 'FL'<br>  <br>  This resulted in very inefficient performance at the SQL Server. Each time a warehouse manager executed the query, the database server was forced to recompile the query and execute it from scratch. It also required the warehouse manager to have knowledge of SQL and appropriate permissions to access the table information.<br>  <br>  We can simplify this process through the use of a stored procedure. Let's create a procedure called sp_GetInventory that retrieves the inventory levels for a given warehouse. Here's the SQL code:<br>  <br>      CREATE PROCEDURE sp_GetInventory<br>      @location varchar(10)<br>      AS<br>      SELECT Product, Quantity<br>      FROM Inventory<br>      WHERE Warehouse = @location<br>  <br>  Our Florida warehouse manager can then access inventory levels by issuing the command<br>  <br>      EXECUTE sp_GetInventory 'FL'<br>  <br>  The New York warehouse manager can use the same stored procedure to access that area's inventory.<br>  <br>      EXECUTE sp_GetInventory 'NY'<br>  <br>  Granted, this is a simple example, but the benefits of abstraction can be seen here. The warehouse manager does not need to understand SQL or the inner workings of the procedure. From a performance perspective, the stored procedure will work wonders. The SQL Sever creates an execution plan once and then reutilizes it by plugging in the appropriate parameters at execution time.

Have a look through that to see if the PC itself can see the hard drive. If it can then you may well have a sata type hard drive, and the problem is that the install disk you have does not have the drivers. In that case, the easy option is to find the recovery CD that may have come with the laptop when you bought it. There may have been an option to make the revovery CD instead - If there was, I hope you did it....

ySKsOfIMaa	Most games are designed for 32-bit. However, Windows 64-bit keeps the 32-bit libraries around for the sake of running 32-bit applications, and I have yet to have any compatibility issues with a 32-bit program.<br>  <br>  The biggest benefit of 64-bit is being able to use more than 3.5-4GB of RAM. However, a 64-bit OS will also use all the data lanes on a 64-bit CPU rather than just 32 when running a 64-bit application.

Do so.<br>  Now go to Start --> My Computer --> Program Files.

Delete every Symantec folder there. And, again, restart your PC.<br>  Go to Start --> Search --> All Files and Folders --> More Advanced Options. Check each option except for "Case sensitive"<br>  Now type in Norton and delete each Norton folder from the search results (Again, right click, choose "Delete"). One more time, restart your PC.<br>  Repeat step 5 except type Symantec in the "Search" box.<br>  The next step is trickier: go into the Registry.<br>  <br>  First thing to do is Back up the Registry. I'll be saying more about the Registry later. But suffice it to say that the presence of uninstalled security software in the Registry can conflict with newly installed security software and cause system freezes.

Click (+) next to HKEY_CURRENT_USER. Go down the thread until you see Software. Click on Software and scroll down the thread until you see Symantec. Right click on Symantec and choose "Delete".<br>  From there go down to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and repeat step 3. Restart your PC. <br>  Click (+) next to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, now: Click (+) next to Software, Click (+) next to Microsoft, Click (+) next to Windows and Click (+) next to CurrentVersion.<br>  Select the Run folder.

2vL8wOHZaa	DDR1 is actually called DDR instead. DDR is 184pins and DDR2 is 240 pins. DDR2 is faster than DDR. I hope this helped.|`|54b385c151eb6a2e169596e7504acbbeaa	The primary difference between DDR and DDR2 memory is the ability of DDR2 memory to operate the data bus at 2x the speed (compared to DDR). However, DDR2 runs the internal modules's speeds at 1/2 the clock rate. This means that if you take 2 similar DDR and DDR2 modules, and run them at the same external speed, you'd get the same data rate, but DDR2 would have twice the latency. Likewise, if you run DDR2 at 2x the data rate of DDR, you'd get 2x the data throughput, with the same latency at the DDR modules.<br>  <br>  When you are installing or upgrading DDR/DDR2 memory, make sure you get memory modules that are supported by the motherboard by type (DDR/DDR2), speed (MHz rating), and latency (most motherboard don't care about this last one), and also that ALL modules of memory on the motherboard are exactly the same speed, and latency. Ideally, they'd be the same brand too, but that can be relaxed a bit, so long as everything else is the same. Modules do not need to be the same size, but some motherboards may exhibit slightly reduced performance in DDR2 Dual-Channel mode if the modules are different sizes. Check your documentation of the Motherboard to see what your manufacture recommends for speed, max size, and latency. <br>  <br>  Hope this will help you..|`|cNZbaEDEaa	<a href="http://www.overclockercafe.com/Articles/DDR_vs_DDR2/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.overclockercafe.com/Articles/...</a>

Saying you can remove vocals from an audio track is like saying you have a cure for the common cold (but it involves is killing the infected person).

When you set it up, it will check and make sure that the needed ports are open in your firewall. this is an important step, so don't ignore this during setup.<br>  <br>  And for searching for files, I use isohunt.com. When I view the results, I sort them by the column "s", (stands for "seeds") so that the results with the most seeds are at the top.  <br>  <br>  Worst case scenario would be that your ISP blocks this type of traffic, but that is not too common.|`|AA11975901	reinstall ur torrent,,,, maybe it help

You did mention that it should run between x=-3 and x=3. I think you have left out the loop after this line (the line we changed before): <br>  printf("%8.2f %12.4f\n", x, f_x);<br>  <br>  You have created the block-using the { and }, but no looping statement.

il36RWQDaa	A proxy server is a client or computer server that blocks your IP address from the Internet. This type of tool is typically set up within a company or a private residence. You can use this with a downloadable program or several different clients. Games that you may play can also use proxy servers to access the Internet.<br>  <br>  Significance<br>  Proxy server are used mainly for security reasons. A company or even a private residence may use this technique to hide their IP address from non-reputable sources. When you surf the Internet, you may find websites that want to harm your computer with viruses and spyware. This is also important for gaming as well. A company may want to block certain websites or Internet options from their employees. A proxy server can accomplish this goal, also.<br>  <br>  Types<br>  An anonymous proxy hides your identification from websites or Internet games. Other tools you use on the Internet including FTP sites or Telnet can operate a proxy to keep your identity a secret.<br>  A web proxy is installed on your computer through a program. This allows the web browsers to filter content. You can use this for a company or a child's computer to block harmful or unnecessary websites from the computer.<br>  An open proxy server is a method which anyone can use. You can choose from several free and open proxy servers. However, hackers and people that intentionally misuse the system usually seek out this technique.<br>  A caching proxy server is what most businesses use. It is a way of adding certain websites to your proxy for simple access. You can log on to the website without having to identify yourself through user names or password log ins.<br>  <br>  Function<br>  Each type of proxy server has a different function.<br>  The open proxy server is simple to find. You can receive a list of proxy IP addresses and use them without a hassle. However, this method is riskier than others. Hackers scan open proxies to find holes in the system that allow them access to your computer without your knowledge.<br>  The anonymous proxy hides your identity in case you need to view a website, email or play a game from another location. Individuals that are committing criminal acts often use this type of proxy. However, law-biding citizens may also use this style to provide privacy and security.<br>  Caching proxies were the first proxy system in existence. This is the most popular type for businesses, especially those that rely on Internet access. The proxy allows administrators to give access to resource websites and other viable sites that assist employees' job functions. Employees can log on to pre programmed websites without log in information.<br>  The web proxy is another type used by companies and families to limit the types of websites that can be accessed. It can set it up to avoid specific web addresses or types of content.<br>  <br>  Features<br>  Proxy services can be completely customizable. They can ban words or complete web addresses. Disabling files is another key feature. Certain files can be harmful to your computer, such as .exe, .ace or .zip. Employers and owners of the computer may not want these kinds of things being downloaded to their machines. Storing or sending a history of websites to certain individuals is possible, also. You can obstruct ports, servers and protocols as well. Protocols are the beginning of a browser address. For example, HTTP is a protocol.<br>  <br>  Considerations<br>  You can use a proxy server inside your Internet browser or use a program with more options. It is important to understand the laws and regulations behind a proxy before you use one. Several places online can give you a proxy IP address free. However, these are dangerous and sometimes illegal.|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Proxy sites are blocked by network administrators, as they are discovered.  <br>  -<br>  Example: Schools block access to proxy sites to prevent students accessing game & social networks.<br>  -Students bragging is the usual way to hear about a new proxy site.<br>  -<br>  Websites of Proxy sites.<br>  ====<br>  <a href="http://www.stayinvisible.com/web_proxy_list.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stayinvisible.com/web_proxy_l...</a><br>  =<br>  <a href="http://www.prospector.cz/Free-Internet-services/Web-proxy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prospector.cz/Free-Internet-s...</a><br>  =<br>  <a href="http://www.proxyroll.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.proxyroll.com/</a><br>  =<br>  <a href="http://proxy.org/cgi_proxies.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://proxy.org/cgi_proxies.shtml</a>|`|5278056def382af0b21f54ea93a11be6aa	Emm..

Use an editor that keeps the size ratio, and then save at the ico size.<br>  Now, to the lines, saving the items you create has to be very precise, so a pixel out will leave the black lines, that is what I suspect has caused it... just adjust the file when you save it

If the components are slowly dying on your system it is because you system is beginning to fail, probably the motherboard or the CPU itself. Essentially what's happening is that the voltage distribution of your system is beginning to weaken and not all components are working at the voltage their suppose to. Eventually the system will fail completely. Formatting is a process of software not hardware at least of floppy disks anyway. The software is being corrupted by the voltage drops that cause it to skip, slow and loose information from the dynamic link library. This throws off the heuristics and causes the system to work harder to achieve the same results, results it cannot achieve. This creates a systemic paradox and soon the program will eat itself. The system itself will follow shortly thereafter. It's probably time to let that system go.|`|bcc56e7c76182ea1ac643102c3d59d43aa	The computer that the internet no longer works sounds like it is infected with a virus or spyware causing it to not be able to read the floppy.

If that's the case, then you need to either find the driver disk that came with the controller, or download a driver from the Internet (since your existing OS appears to be working, you should be able to get the model in Device Manager/SCSI or RAID devices). Then, when you start the XP install, hit F6 when it first starts booting from the disk (you'll see a note at the bottom, "Hit f6 to specify additional boot devices"). Then, when prompted, put in your floppy disk with the driver and you should be able to see the hard drive.|`|AA10974986	check whether your bus settings are correct in the system. <br>  While booting press "Del" and go to the second option and see whether harddisk is detected or not.

82a34811f4d028066467abd38849204aaa	Expanding on Ginnsu's answer:  Typically, there are two IDE connectors on the motherboard.  Each IDE connector can have one ribbon cable with two drive connectors so you can have up to four drives on a computer (I said typically).  A drive can be a hard drive or a CD drive.  There are other kinds but you don't see them much.   On each ribbon cable, one drive should be MASTER and the other SLAVE (or you can take your chances with cable select).  If you have only one drive, make it MASTER.  The Jumper(s) are used to make the drive a MASTER or SLAVE.  Usually, there is a diagram on the face of the drive showing you the jumper positions.  On a CD drive, there is usually a M, S, and C imprinted on the back over the jumpers.|`|AA12360662	They are there to identify whether the hard drive is a slave drive, master drive, primary drive or cable selected drive.|`|1ac340ad180cd3aee2ab563d84a933fbaa	you mean jumpers theyre the little plastic thing between where the cables connect every manufacturer is different and most have them printed somewhere on the drive|`|0f0f47b2a56288dfaa29b247c027b260aa	I can give you a link that deals with hard drive problems.<br>  Some RAM/ hard drive problems can be easily fixed yourself by using easily available tools.

Jumpers are little plastic cases that hold connecting wires that will complete a circuit. They rest on "Jumper Pins" which when the Jumper completes a circuit, tells the hard drive how it should communicate with the computer. The most common options are Master, Slave, and Cable Select. The jumpers and jumper pins are most commonly found on the same part of the drive where you plug in the power, and data cables.

FAT32 supports smaller cluster sizes and larger volumes than FAT, which results in more efficient space allocation on FAT32 volumes.<br>  NTFS:<br>  An advanced file system that provides performance, security, reliability, and advanced features that are not found in any version of FAT. For example, NTFS guarantees volume consistency by using standard transaction logging and recovery techniques. If a system fails, NTFS uses its log file and checkpoint information to restore the consistency of the file system. In Windows 2000 and Windows XP, NTFS also provides advanced features such as file and folder permissions, encryption, disk quotas, and compression.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell NTFS is more secure than FAT32.<br>  <br>  By default hard drives are FAT32 when they come out of the box.

That way, as users change, you don't have to re-do all the permissions.  <br>  Once the security group is set up, set the permissions to it through group policy.  Give them the right to join workstations to the domain, of course.  Also, make them administrators of all local machines (not a domain administrator).  This can be done through group policy, or computer by computer.  This gives them the right to install software on all systems except the domain controller.  It will also give them an account to modify/troubleshoot all issues on workstations, without domain admin permissions.  If software needs to be installed on the DC, do it yourself.  You might consider giving him permission to add/remove/modify domain user accounts as well, so he can deal with adding/deleting users, lost password issues, etc.<br>  As time goes on, you can add or remove permissions as your desires and trust regarding your employee change.|`|5af017cbe3d4cfc8093c70b6c4a92844aa	You are probably going to have to give them Administrator.

The only thing this doesn't give them is "Full Control", but there isn't a big difference.<br>  <br>  ====UPDATE====<br>  <br>  OK....the new info you entered gave more info......You can give them admin privileges in active directory for the domain, but on the servers you can create more restrictive "local" privileges. You can do this by setting their user privileges on the server partitions to be lower than the admin privileges and the more restrictive permissions will take effect on those machines. They will still be able to log into workstations and have admin privileges.|`|AA11276226	Ditto what the other user said.

NZDY5IJxaa	There can be two reasons for your issue, one would be hardware, but is most likely software.<br>  <br>  1) Boot from the CDs that came with the computer (Insert the CD after the boot chime and hold down the C key) after it boots you will want to run Disk Utility. It is is located either on the Apple Menu or the Utilities menu, depending on what version of the OS you are running. <br>  <br>  2) After finding Disk Utility, highlight your internal hard drive in the left hand side pane and then click on 'Repair Disk'. If no repairs are available, or is was able to repair the disk, then your Hard drive is fine. If the Hard drive is not able to be repaired, then your hard drive is either pending failure, or just need to be repartitioned. If it says your SMART status is failing, then you definately need a new hard drive.<br>  <br>  3) If your disk was able to be repaired, now press 'Repair Disk Permissions'<br>  <br>  4) Now re start your computer if the hard drive was able to be repaired.

7b044ee035bfa721fdccf5cf466bba17aa	Definitiv nicht! Folgende zwei Punkte brachten mich zu diesem Entschluss:<br>  1.: Geld: Mit ?einmal 30 Euro zahlen? ist es leider nicht getan. Bei World of Warkraft fallen leider auch Monatskosten an, und zwar nicht zu knapp: Ein Monat für 12,99 Euro, drei Monate für 35,95 Euro (11,99/Monat); um mal zwei der Tarife zu nennen. Mitunter glaube ich, World of Warcraft sei in Wirklichkeit eine enorme Geldmaschine, welche f?lschlicherweise von vielen für ein Spiel gehalten wurde. Schau doch selbst bei ?eBay? nach! Du brauchst nur mal die Stichw?rter ?WoW? und ?Gold? (Gold: Die W?hrung in WoW) eintippen, und schon wirst du mit Angeboten überschüttet. Im Fernsehen wird nicht selten von Firmen berichtet, die Mitarbeiter arbeiten lassen, welche in WoW Gold beschaffen sollen. (WoW ?spielen? als Beruf – Ich frage mich, ob das ein wirklich sinnvoller Beruf ist...)<br>  2.: Bindung: Wenn in World of Warcraft erfolgreich (also m?glichst nah an der Spitze der Rangliste) sein m?chte, muss man es schon richtig intensiv spielen. Ich hatte mal von jemanden geh?rt, welcher es in der Profiliga auf Platz 7 oder so geschafft hatte; da war er mal für 3 Tage nicht dabei – Zack! Da fiel er – was den Rang betrifft – aus allen Wolken und all die Mühe war scheinbar für die Katz.<br>  <br>  Was deine zweite Frage betrifft: Da h?tte ich zwei kleine, aber im Spielspa? nicht zu verachtende, Spiele:<br>  Zum Beispiel Soldat.

zitPsWXWaa	I would suggest learning VB.NET first before tackling ASP.NET. You can get Visual Studio 2005 Express edition free and find several Visual Basic quick start books and tutorials on the internet. Once you get a solid foundation with VB.NET then ASP.NET will be much easier to learn as your ASP.NET code behind will be done with VB.NET code. Likely you will need at least some Microsoft Certifications if you do not have a College degree to even think about getting an an entry level programming position. If possible, I would strongly recommend going after a 4 year Computer Science degree.|`|IosWNmy0aa	I'm in the same boat.<br>  <br>  I started learning Java, last December, with no prior programming knowledge (apart from a little html).

Make sure your links start with http:// - otherwise they won't work.<br>  <br>  Is your question that they are going to a broken page, or that they are not working at all?  If they are not clicking at all, it could be that your code is interacting with the code on the page, or that there is a z-index issue, and that your flash file is actually behind another div.

a4bc0879a26f1fda20f460171a300078aa	You must try  UWIN - Unix for Windows.<br>  <br>  UWIN or Unix for WINdows, is developed and released by AT&T Laboratories and David Korn - the creator of Korn shell. UWin basically consists of a set of tools and libraries which helps application developers compile and run Unix applications natively on windows. The tools include a complete shell (Korn Shell) for windows which is bundled with all the command line tools you find in Linux/Unix. UWIN is not a new development in fact, it was around since a long time back and AT&T even enjoyed a tie-up with Wipro technologies (a foremost IT firm in India) to sell this package for commerical use. The tie-up has since been dissolved.<br>  <br>  UWIN comes with its own Unix compiler 'cc' but developers can also use Visual C++ or mingw (windows port of gcc) to compile the Unix applications. Some other software bundled with it include development files like libraries, groff, perl and X windows libraries. <br>  <br>  Salient features of UWIN<br>  <br>  Access to almost all the command line tools from Unix on windows. 245 command line tools to be exact. <br>  Comes bundled with the original Unix compiler 'cc' as well as a plethora of tools like 'make' and the necessary libraries which allow Unix applications to be build and run on Windows machines with very little or no changes in the source code. <br>  Option to use other compilers like Visual C++ or Mingw to compile programs. <br>  Full fledged Perl package. <br>  X windows libraries for those who aspire to develop X applications on windows. Though to run those applications in Windows, you need an X server which is not bundled with UWIN. <br>  UWIN comes with a control panel applet (accessed through 'Start->Settings->Control Panel->UWIN') which can be used to configure some of the UWIN system parameters.<br>  <br>  Uses of UWIN<br>  <br>  - Run Unix applications natively in Windows in full speed. <br>  - Use the full power of Unix command line tools on Windows. <br>  The korn shell bundled with UWIN makes a Unix user feel right at home in a Windows environment. <br>  - Develop and run UNIX applications on Windows. <br>  - Develop X applications on the Windows platform.<br>  <br>  Drawbacks of UWIN<br>  <br>  - UWIN does not come bundled with a X server so a user will not be able to run X applications on windows. Though there are third party commercial X servers available which can fill this gap. <br>  <br>  - UWIN is not released under the GPL but is free to download and use for educational and non-commercial purposes.<br>  <br>  <br>  To get it go here : <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwi...</a>|`|COz8aC3aaa	Try Cygwin. Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. You can run all command line tools as you where on linux. Yes it's not an unix emulator but since Linux is inheriting all the unix commands what is the difference ?<br>  In our IT university learned unix on Redhat, and in our pc's with cygwin. If we could learn unix then you can learn too.

It will also make your computer run faster.<br>  .<br>  ?I know this procedure looks long, but much of this is explanatory text to help less experienced people. <br>  ?Please do not cheat by skipping any steps. You are only hurting yourself if you do. And you will waste more time. The goal is to get your PC fixed. Completing the steps in this generic guide may or may not resolve all of your malware problems, but in all cases it gets your PC into a known state to help make it easier for me to fix your problems. After completing all steps, if you still need help, please send a new question. You may have a problem trying to run steps in safe mode on user accounts that have limited priviledges. This will only be on Windows 2K, XP, & 2003 systems. Limited user accounts will not show when you boot into safe mode. You have two options, run the steps in normal boot mode which may not work to remove malware, or you can temporarily change the user account to an admin account and then complete the steps. <br>  ?0: Preliminary House Cleaning & Setup<br>  <br>  Unistall Malware thru your computers Add?Remove program.<br>  You MUST be sure that MSconfig is not being used to control Startups. Note: That some Window's OSs (like Win 2K) do not have MSconfig! <br>  ?MSConfig Startup Mode <br>  Please go to Start > Run > type msconfig and click OK!<br>  Select the General tab and select Normal Startup. <br>  Thenclick Apply and OK and reboot PC before continuing.<br>  Remain in this Normal Startup mode while your PC is being cleaned of malware.<br>  1: Secondary House Cleaning<br>  <br>  This second step of house cleaning may save a load of time later . <br>  ?Empty any quarantine folders for antivirus and antispyware applications. Make sure you do this. Logs could be huge otherwise. If you are a Symantec/Norton user make sure you empty their Norton Nprotect folder guarding the Recycle Bin. Empty your Recycle Bin<br>  ?Download and install CCCleaner<br>  ?MAKE SURE you download and avoid getting the Yahoo Toolbar version. I do not want you to install any unnecessary baggage. <br>  ?Also it is recommeded to login to all other User Accounts on the PC including the Administrator account which will only show when you boot in safe mode. Run CCleaner on each account. This can greatly reduce scan time and log sizes from the later scanning you will do below.<br>  2: Enable viewing of hidden files, system files and file extensions <br>  <br>  Some programs hide themselves by making their files invisible in normal Windows settings. Not doing this would allow file extensions commonly used by trojans and spyware to be hidden, for example a file ending in .exe or dll making manually finding it, if needed, difficult to impossible. <br>  <br>  <br>  3: Do not use Multiple Antivirus Applications or Software Firewalls <br>  ?Antivirus: If you have multiple antivirus applications installed on your PC, please choose the one you prefer and uninstall all others. Do this now before continuing because you will only be asked to do it later if not done now. This does not mean online scanners. It is only referring to full antivirus applications like McAfee, Symantec, AVG, Avast, AntiVir, Kaspersky, etc. <br>  ?Firewall: Only use one software firewall. Running multiple software firewalls is unnecessary and using more than one software firewall on the same connection could cause issues with connectivity to the Internet or other unexpected behavior including excessive use of system resources which will slow down overall PC performance.<br>  4: Downloading Tools<br>  <br>  Download the following tools and save in your favorite download folder or create one, for example C:\Spyware Tools or C:\Downloads. ( It is not a good idea to download them to any folder within C:\Documents and Settings.) And then install, update, and configure as indicated below. Do not run the scans until later when indicated. Also DO NOT confuse the word download with the actual installation of the program. You should install all programs to their recommended (by the install program). default installation folders. First you download the files and then you install (if the program requires installation) the program. It is also a bad idea to download and save anything you need into any kind of Temp folder. Malware hides in Temp folders and standard cleaning practices will delete everything from Temp folders.<br>  <br>  Download GetRunKey.Zip and ShowNew.Zip from the below links and extract all files from both ZIP files into a folder of their own. You can extract both ZIP files into the same folder. Like C:\MGTools While these tools will run from your Desktop, i strongly recommend that you DO NOT extract them to your Desktop. Please install them where recommended. Do not run the scans yet!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  SpyBot - Search & Destroy <br>  ?PLEASE leave all settings at default!!!! Install, do the search for updates now and get any updates, then fix the below problem with Spybot default products. If you get an error message about "bad checksum" when trying to update, just choose a different server location. Also look for the Immunize feature in Spybot and use it. Do not use the Teatimer function. It can be a resource hog and also makes removal of certain problems more difficult. Make sure you leave the SDhelper ( IE bad download blocker) checked to install (this is the default).<br>  ?Fixing SpyBot's Ignore Products Bug: Please run SpyBot and get into the Advanced mode by selecting Mode and then Advanced mode. Then select Settings and the in the left column select Ignore Products. In the right window pane make sure the All products tab is selected. Then in that window, right click your mouse and choose "Deselect all". Now exit Spybot. We will run a scan later.<br>  Now if running Windows XP, 2K or NT do the below. If you have Windows 95, 98, or ME skip to Downloads for Older Windows OS below. CounterSpy and AVG Antispyware will no longer run on the older Windows's OS.<br>  <br>  CounterSpy<br>  <br>  ?If you had previously used a CounterSpy trial, you may not be able to run it again. If this is the case, then run the below AVG Antispyware Removal procedure and attach the log later.<br>  AVG Anti-Spyware <br>  ?Only run the AVG Anti-Spyware procedure if you could not run CounterSpy. You do not need to run both of these.<br>  Note: If you are using an older Windows OS you may not be able to run some of the above tools! So if you are running Windows 95, 98, or ME run SUPERAntiSpyware and save a log from it so you can attach it. This step is not required if you are running Windows XP, 2K or NT) HOWEVER, no matter what OS you are running, if you could not run CounterSpy or AVG Antispyware then run SuperAntiSpyware.<br>  <br>  <br>  5: Cleaning Malware<br>  <br>  <br>  Important Note Before continuing with the below scans:<br>  <br>  The best method to remove malware is to do it after booting in Safe Mode with no connection to the internet possible and no browsers running. Booting in safe mode is important because best results are achieved since safe mode disables most drivers and running programs. If you cannot boot in safe mode due to the malware problem then run the scans in normal boot mode but make sure you tell us later in any messages you post.<br>  <br>  Thus you will need to print or save these instructons locally in a text file so you can refer to them while offline. Do this before continuing! <br>  ?Reboot into safe mode<br>  ?Physically unplug your cable to the internet (even if you have dial-up, unplug modem) <br>  ?Shut down ALL unrequired applications including browsers <br>  ?Run Ccleaner with the default options to clean out temporary files. Only use the Default Scan on the Windows Tab and select Run Cleaner. Do not run any other options from other tabs. <br>  ?Run Spybot Search & Destroy and allow it to fix all that it finds. Make sure you use the Immunize feature and use the SDHelper function but do not use Teatimer. <br>  ?For Windows XP, 2K and NT users <br>  ?Run CounterSpy - Make sure you have it Quarantine all detections! Also attach the log from CounterSpy later if you still have problems. To get the log after scanning. Click View -> Spyware Scan -> View Spyware Scan History. Next click on the scan you want to view, then click view full details of scan. Right-click anywhere in the window that just opened, click on Select All, right-click again select Copy. Now open notepad and right-click anywhere in notepad and select Paste. Now Save As CounterSpy.txt. If you could not run CounterSpy for any reason, run the steps in the following link for AVG Antispyware Running AVG Anti-Spyware and allow it to fix all that it finds. Save the log as requested and attach it later if you still have problems and have to post a message requesting support.<br>  ?For Windows 95, 98 and ME users <br>  ?you should now run SuperAntiSpyware<br>  6A: Online Virus And Trojan Scanning<br>  <br>  Please run the below two online scanning tools and make sure you save and attach the logs later to any request for help that you post. From step 5 you should already be in safe mode but you will need to reconnect your cable now and possibly reboot and choose Safe Mode with Networking Support. If you cannot connect in safe mode for any reason (like dial-up users), run the online scanners in normal boot mode. You will need to use Internet Explorer to run these online scans. Also MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST SUN JAVA Version installed by checking against the below link which normally has the most current version. This may help prevent some problems in trying to get these online scanners to run. Before installing the current version, you should uninstall all previous versions first!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  *** MAKE SURE YOU RUN BITDEFENDER BEFORE PANDA ACTIVE SCAN ***<br>  *** But if Bitdefender cannot be run then run PandaActiveScan anyway ***<br>  <br>  <br>  Bitdefender agree to the license and then select Scan. DO NOT CHANGE THE OPTIONS TO SHOW ALL FILES SCANNED. Once Bitdefender completes the scan:<br>  <br>  Click-on the Detected Problems tab. When the window comes up to save the report, change the Save as type: box to Text (Tab Delimited) (*.txt) and then in the File name box enter change to bdscan then click save. This will save a file named bdscan.txt in whatever folder you are currently in when you save the file (take notice of where you are at so you can find it later). This bdcan.txt file will actually contain HTML code that i can easily view later while reviewing your log. All i have to do is rename the file to bdscan.html.<br>  <br>  If you do not follow these step, you will have an incorrect log or worse a log summary which is useless to me.<br>  <br>  Panda ActiveScan It will only fix certain viruses and trojans. Most items found will not be fixed. When it finishes the scan click on See Report . Then in the next window click Save Report. The default report name is Activescan.txt. Just save it where you can find it so you can attach to your message when you begin a thread with a request for help. If you have any problems trying to get a PandaActiveScan log,If you use Avast antivirus and it gives you and error like below when trying to use Panda, just disable Avast while your run the scan. The error is a false positive.

Nir9TCtQaa	You probably selected the "tile windows horizontally" option or something.  All you have to do to resize it is open an internet explorer window (or the window of another program, say Word) and manually resize it - this means pulling the page in all directions (not just hitting the Maximize button at the top of the page).  After you've dragged the window to show up on the entire screen, close the window (x out of it) and the next window you open up should be the same size as the one you just resized.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
