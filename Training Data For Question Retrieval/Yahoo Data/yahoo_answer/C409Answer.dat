OwCUYWeUaa	It is possible you need a new compressor, but I wouldn't jump to that conclusion. It could be just a defective run capacitor which is a pretty common problem and is a lot less expensive than a compressor or a new unit.  Now, it is possible the compressor is going and caused the cap. to fail, but if the cap. is bad, replacing it may buy you some time and keep it running for a while.  I would call a heating co. to check it out.|`|AA11465383	check the capacitor with your multimeter <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Possum, HVAC serviceman|`|PE8vFmGcaa	You should not replace just the compressor, yes you would be throwing good money after bad. If I were you I would replace the complete condensing unit. With new technoligies the energy savings will help pay back for the cost of the new system.
AA12330575	You will not harm your drywall job if it gets moisture on it while it is drying.  As you noted, all that will happen is drying will be delayed.  You won't hurt anything.  Of course, once the mud has thoroughly dried you should seal it with a good primer and then a couple coats of paint.  It would deteriorate over time if left unpainted.  Drywall contractor since 1960.|`|XQiH90x2aa	follow the instructions|`|944iJNAdaa	Even after the joint compound is dry, it needs to be protected with a coat of primer, and then a coat of paint.

Prime and paint as soon as possible though.|`|d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	Joint compound is not waterproof, even after years. Prime the stuff, put on two coats of paint and then give it at least a day to cure.|`|6CyScIKBaa	if the instuctions wait 24 hrs. wait it needs to totaly dry before it gets wet|`|SHNYP6Xpaa	I can safely say, after dealing with joint compounds on bathrooms walls, that if you leave a compound on a wall in a humid environment, the plaster will disintegrate. <br>  <br>  You need to get a waterproof compound specifically designed for patching holes in a moisture rich environment.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Seal over the compound with paint and use a vinyl caulk around the edges of the wall, to prevent any moisture going behind the wall.<br>  <br>  It's a long story, but I've used both techniques on the wall in the same bathroom.|`|Wz6jHzSEaa	Why run the risk of having to redo the joint compound?

QmwYOQuDaa	You essentially have little to no recourse on legal action against City Plan Check Reviewers.  Usually, they have a release of responsibility on their part in the permit application form.  The responsibility of compliance to current codes is on the architect.  The architect is also responsible for the work done by his consultants.  You can bring legal action against the architect as well as file a complaint with the local State Board of Technical Registration for faulty work.  The builder/contractor is not responsible to check for structural accuracy of the plans.  They can point out discrepancies in the drawings such as dimensions, but they will not verify beam sizes or calculations.  It really depends on how bad the drawings are.  <br>  It's unfortunate some architects will actually use the City Review Process for their QC, but it happens.  If your architect is a designer (non-registrant), your only course of action is to seek legal action against the structural engineer who stamped the drawings.  A non-registrant has no professional responsibility so you will not be able to sue him for bad drawings.  If he represented himself as an architect, you can turn him in to your local State Board of Technical Registration.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	As long as your contractor has corrected the mistake so your addition is up to code it is not a big deal..you do not say what the actual mistake is...a contractor will catch these things as will the inspector who will visit throughout the building..so, if it is structural, then it should have been done to code by the architect. If it is the placement on the lot, then it is the city engineer who hands out the building permit...it totally depends on what is wrong and how you are affected...I honestly don't know how indepth the permit people will look at the blueprints...they require a registered blueprint here, so they might not look that indepth at one as it should be done correctly by the architect.|`|944iJNAdaa	I doubt you win this one, but you need better help than we can give you if you want to try this.  I'm sure you could always hire a lawyer and try to sue them, but I bet you find it's very difficult to fight city hall.  The people that approve this occupancy certificate wield broad powers, too, and they can make your life miserable if they so desire.  Most people just suck up and make whatever changes are required, in order to make the inspectors happy.  There might be liability on the part of the architect here, too.  However, these are legal items, and would require court action for you to even have a hope of collecting, and it's up to you to prove negligence.  Most builders just make the changes, and grumble.  This might be one of the reasons so many of them spend time in bars.  :)
VUNTunxiaa	Because you purchased the 4-conductor cord, I will assume you have a 4-opening receptacle for your stove.<br>  <br>  If the cord is a listed product, and I wouldn't install one in my home that isn't; the installation instructions should come with the cord-set.<br>  <br>  It should install almost exactly like the 3-wire cord-set you will be removing, but the equipment grounding conductor of the cord-set will attach to the stove's frame. Some older stoves do not have provisions for attaching the white (neutral) conductor anywhere on the stove. As an Inspector, I would allow the neutral to be bonded to the Grounding conductor in that case; so it should also be terminated on the grounding attachment on the stove frame. (Most grounding terminals are listed to accept 2 conductors.)<br>  <br>  Read the directions again, to see if they provide additional insight. The National Electrical Code, Section 110.3(B) requires that all listed electrical equipment (a cord falls into the broad definition of equipment in Article 100) be installed according to the Manufacturer's Installation Instructions. As the Instructions are a part of the listing & labeling of the equipment, as I said before, no instructions more than likely means no listing.<br>  <br>  If that is the case, exchange the cord. If you are still uncertain of how to do this, call out a service representative from a local appliance store that sells the same brand of stoves, and pay to have it done correctly.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Bring it back and get the correct cord.|`|d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	Strangelove is right, go back and get the proper cord. Your four wire is a very simple hookup for an experienced electrician, but since you appear to not be, take the thing back and get one of the older three wires.|`|AA11474133	"Electrical inspector" is pretty close, but even he made a wrong statement (saying there is no neutral connection on some stoves).  The other answers are completely wrong.<br>  <br>  You had to buy a cord with 4 wires, and I assume that is because you have a 4 wire (hole) outlet.  You always buy the cord to match the existing outlet, not change the outlet to match the stove.  New outlets need to be 4 wires.<br>  <br>  The 3 wire cord has 2 hots and a neutral (not 2 hots and a ground).  The 4th wire added to the 4 wire cord is a separate ground.  Your old stove would have a connection between the frame of the stove and the neutral.  When you connect the 4-wire cord to the frame this connection to the neutral must be removed.  The 3 wires in the new cord (other than the green) will attach to the same place the 3 wire cord had.  When you are done there should be no conductivity between the neutral and ground wires.  If you can't figure out how to get the green wire attached to the frame and the frame connection removed from the neutral (white), feel free to get an electrician to install the cord.  That should cost under $100.|`|k3EObSxwaa	You failed to mention how many openings were on the wall plug. If there are only 3 you purchased the wrong connector. Normally 2 wires would connect to the range connection block and the third wire (green) would connect to the ground wire as a rule located on the same block but colored green. This is the one that grounds the range to prevent shock.
FXnHE7mmaa	Flooring will cost you anywhere from $2.00 a sq. ft. to $10-15 depending on what you get, and if you are doing the work yourself or not. Count on $100.00 for paint minimum. Then curtain cost will depend on how many windows, size, and the material chosen. I don't know if you are redoing countertops, or vanity in the bathroom, or new furnishings, or new bedding..just keeps adding up..then there are frames, and artwork and pillows and plants..wow..just endless.|`|AA10097817	Most of the budget will be going to the flooring, if you are changing it.|`|XQiH90x2aa	$1 per sq/ft|`|XzLUA7ataa	Decorating on a Dime.  There's a show by that name on Home and Garden Television.  They also have a website HGTV.com.  Take a look and see if that gives you some thoughts.|`|Y0ffbZKraa	Depends on what needs to be changed and if you want the best/most expensive of everything or if a lamp from Target will suffice.|`|6C287vmdaa	About $1,500|`|Lg4cmiL5aa	That all depends on how much your budget is, a very wealthy person might spend a whole lot on that space compared to another person with no money. All depends on what you want to do. I used to decorate with very little money and I just bought things at garage sales and changed the way I wanted them. I painted or refinished furniture, painted walls and the rest was up to searching out for good prices. Paint is the cheapest way to change a room.

The steam from the boiling water should loosen the baked on crap.<br>  <br>  Another tip:  the next time you buy a microwave, check the interior design.

The draw back is that the shoe loses some of it's cushioning when washed.  My rule is that I'll wash them once it the shoe's lifetime.  Seems not to affect the shoe much.  Make sure you take the inner sole out, and, DON"T put the shoes in the dryer.

74Ks1Mx9aa	You can buy a new valve assembly at a hardware store, or if you wish a rebuild kit, I would suggest the whole assembly.<br>  To remove and repair your faucet:<br>  <br>  Turn off the water under the sink, Remove the nameplate cover plate, remove the screw, remove the handle. Remove the chrome cover piece that is round and has a small rectangle on top. As you look now down at the valve, on top you will see a very small hole (which is actually a horseshoe shaped retaining pin) pull this up and out and put in a safe place. The valve can be removed now, you didn't say how old this valve is but, they can get very hard to remove, a puller is available (which I would also suggest), get the valve out and put your pinkie finger in the opening and check for broken pieces of O-rings. Use heat proof grease on your new valve, before you begin your reassembly. Push the new valve into the opening, make sure to fully insert the valve, open the valve a little bit to release any pressure and re-insert the retaining pin, the cover, the handle, the screw. Turn on your supply valves and check to see if the hot and cold are in their correct positions (if they are reversed, simply rotate your valve 180 degrees). Put on the nameplate and your done! Good Luck!|`|UQWusO1waa	just google that question and you will find sites, and videos to show you how.|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Most Moan faucets work off a cartridge in the main body, if this is a single handle unit, then it certainly does.  The only way to repair them is to replace the cartridge, which is usually available at home improvement stores or hardware or plumbing supply stores.  Ask for a lav faucet cartridge, there are only two types, but the other type is for a tub/shower fixture and won't work in the faucet.   The removal procedure spelled out by fwatkins is good, but as he mentioned, these things can come out very hard, especially if they've been in there awhile.  You may have to use a pair of visegrips on the stem to pull up on, if you don't want to buy the puller.  Sometimes you have to yank really hard.  The new one should go back in considerably easier however.  Just make sure to put some lubricant on it, some good waterproof grease, or some petroleum jelly will work.   If you come out with the sides reversed, hot on the cold side, and vice versa, take the handle off and turn the cartridge 180 degrees.

mWkkh9L7aa	Granite tile is what people use who do not want to spend the money on slab granite.  It won't add value at all because potential buyers prefer slab granite.  Slab granite is more expensive and should only be used on remodels where it will not seem out of place with the rest of your home.  If you're selling, use a good-looking laminate top.  Buyers don't mind tearing out less expensive items, but they may pass if the cost of new granite is added to the selling price.  Especially if they don't like the granite you've selected.  There are many good looking "granite-look" laminates made by Wilsonart.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Granite or any stonework actually.  People expect to see it in homes these days.|`|Pav5KhmLaa	Granite.

AKrTZqbKaa	One of three possibilities. The button is sticking, but you said you replaced it. Second: it is wired directly into the transformer and not feeding through the button first. Third: the wires are shorting out somewhere and powering the chime. You only need two wires and you have six, try using another pair of red and white wire. Wire the white directly to the chime and the red one to the button and then another wire from the button to the chime.

Paint in thin layers of paint and let dry between coats as lots of paint on the roller may cause the wallpaper to bubble upcause it got to wet.  Best to roll on a thin coat of primer before painting.  Paint the wallpaper in an earthtone deep beige that matches the color blue.  It will soften the impact of the blue.  <br>  Paint the cabinets in a pure white high gloss enamel.  The pure white seems to go well with  bright blue counterops, and the high gloss has more polyurethane to protect the cabinets.  Enamel is better than oil as it will not fade and yellow like an oil based paint.

You can literally spend hours:<br>  <a href="http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/</a><br>  <br>  I think "hep green" (# 6704) might look funky - if that's what you're going for.<br>  <br>  You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.roomvues.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.roomvues.com/</a><br>  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	I think black furniture would look best, but dark brown would work too.  I'd paint the walls a pale shade of pink or even gray.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	It really depends on what effect you want in the room.  You could pick any of the colors in the comforter for the walls, or choose one of the darker ones for the headboard/accent wall and a lighter color for the other ones.  I'd be tempted to have a black headboard wall with light pink or white on the others and let the comforter be the focal point.|`|l9xnybUMaa	Pale grey or white  a white bedroom set or dark is great.  Hope you enjoy it!

That would ruin it. As far as i know they don't make a vacuum/carpet shampooer. Most  shampooers are very cheap and don't work well and will leave your carpets pretty damp. <br>  <br>  Kirby as you might know has a shampoo system, but kirby's are WAY over rated and over priced. <br>  <br>  In general, i would stay away from a shampooer. Sebo makes a dry cleaning system that works GREAT!  And it is waterless so there is no drying time and it is non toxic, chemical free and all of that.The way it works is you poor a powder granual type mixture on your carpet, then work it into the carpet with either a machine you rent or you can buy. Then you let it sit for as long as you can. 1 hour will work if you need it done quick. If you can leave it overnight that will help even more. Then once it has sat for a while, you vacuum it up with a vacuum cleaner. This system works great for restoring the nap of the carpet, removing all molds and mildews, and a overall dirt removal. It won't spot clean for you tho, you must get the individual spots out first by hand with a spot remover, or by using the producgt with a small hand brush first. This system also leaves no residue behind so the dirt won't cling to the carpet like it will after using a wet shampoo system. <br>  <br>  Check it out and see for yourself! oh another note - i wouldn''t buy a bagless vacuum! You will be much more satisfied with a bagged machine.They filter better, clean better, and last longer. I would know cuz i work at a vacuum repair shop and i see hundreds of vacuums a month!|`|3IfBUUH0aa	Get a dyson.
e29SePOvaa	I swear by colour catchers! The trick is to put them into one of those netting bags you can buy to wash tights and delicates in (available in supermarkets).

That keeps them in with the laundry rather than shuffling to the front of the drum and also stops them slipping down the seal and into the outlet pipe which has happened to me a couple of times!|`|grKtTRYtaa	I'll bet everyone who has done wash any length of time has mixed loads accidentally.<br>  <br>  I have never used this product but have mixed loads before, especially 1 RED article with lighter.<br>  <br>  I know this works.

A little goes a long way....an accent pillow, candles, flowers, art, but not walls or bedding.  Use a black and white comforter with pink sheets and pillows.

UQWusO1waa	often the venting is the problem, as well a fan that is designed to sell but barely works. the lower ceiling will have no effect. us a piece of toilet paper, hold it near the fan. if the fan is drawing air it suck the paper against it. If not you have poor venting for the fan, or a lousy fan. A lot of builders do a poor job with the bath fan. Also, there has to be a way for air to get into the room for the fan to exhaust , like a gap under the door or a open window.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	I would leave the fan where it is but get a stronger one that can handle the job.<br>  <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&langId=-1&catalogId=10053&productId=100377324" rel="nofollow">http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stor...</a>|`|Z5g7hCXraa	Before you do anything drastic, take the cover off the fan and see if you just need to clean it.  Check outside your house to see if the vent is blocked somehow.  Basically, make sure there is nothing to slow the air flow.<br>  <br>  The fan should run an hour for each shower.<br>  <br>  Other ideas:<br>  Take shorter or less hot showers.<br>  <br>  Shower with the window open a tiny bit.
dip4oxB5aa	Certainly you can, even ones you designed yourself.  The good builders will gladly accept it.  The bad builders try to stick to a certain group of floor plans for their ease and try to get out of building your floor plan.  <br>  Many people chose a floor plan from thousands offered on line, purchase it and give it to the builder.  A small fee to get exactly what you want.|`|AA11215068	You can give him a floor plan to use as a layout but the drawings will have to be submitted in the form of a blueprint in order to show elevations, wall thicknesses, electrical and cable locations, and all of the other details that go into building a house.

Yes, there's been too much water or paint applied here and that's why the ceiling looks like this.  If it's dry and has this appearance there's a good chance the texture will begin to crack and come down in pieces and maybe sheets.  If it does your going to have to scrape down and redo the cieling.<br>  <br>  If your going to have to remedy this yourself I can walk you through a likely fix, but we'll need to get on it pretty much right away before the texture starts to let go.

Most contain lye, and if they do not do the trick, then you have lye in your pipes and tub which can burn and blind you at best.  First, get the bleach water out, put in some plain water and let it sit for a bit, then let it drain or pump it out.  <br>  <br>  Then you could put in some baking soda, jostling it around with an unfolded coat hanger, then put white vinegar down.  Sometimes it will upstop the problem.  You can also invest in a hand-type auger especially for this problem.  They are about $12 at places like Harbor Freight.  Home Depot/Lowes may also have these cheaper types.

I'd rethink your choice of finish in the kitchen.|`|l9xnybUMaa	Your kitchen walls are painted in flat white paint, and you are painting the living room in a semigloss?  Usually its the otherway around, but anyway. Just use painters tape and a plumb level to get an architecturally straight line, it will be just fine.

I7YwG0Mcaa	There are lots of ways to do this but if you arent into tearing down your drywall and insulating the walls I would suggest hanging a ceiling to floor curtain on the walls that face into the house. Walls that face the outside don't matter. Loose hanging cloth is a great sound dampener, carpet is even better but it would look weird to have carpet on your walls.|`|eeUVIvgRaa	Back in the day, my friends & I used to jam in his garage. Full band playing very loud music. We used egg crates stapled to the wall to baffle the sound, then hung moving blankets ( from u-haul ).<br>  That brought the sound down to a semi acceptable level|`|sqUVjpElaa	Hrmm, the only goofy idea I can think of is purchasing an egg crate mattress pad, and use some double sided tape to adhere it to the door.  It cuts easily, so that won't be a problem.  Do you sit at a desk and play comp games?  If so, maybe you can build a little cubicle to sit on your desk when they want some quiet.  Just make a thick box type shape to sit on your desk.  You could also line it with the egg crate or cork, to make it more functional.  Spray painting the egg crate also could make it look cool, just spray from a distance and not too heavily so it can dry fast.
AA11215068	A dense rug on the floor will help to absorb some of the sound. You can also install solid core doors for the bedrooms. I hope that helps.|`|CzrycXWxaa	Our doctor had us add soft music to the babies room so that the soft noises that can't be avoided wouldn't shock him awake.<br>  <br>  Could also try hanging a decorative quilt on the back of the door.|`|169d74657ea6f56aa856686eb0081bcfaa	The acoustics of the room cause it to be loud.  I assume it's a hard floor, drywall walls and ceilings, which will reflect sound waves fairly well, and be louder.  a rug on the floor will help a little bit, but some of the most effective things can be "decorations" and window treatments.  In medieval europe in castles and cathedrals, they figured out that tapestries were excellent at dampening sounds and echos, as well as reducing drafts.  Generally, all a tapestry is, is a decorative blanket, or a persian style rug that's placed on the wall with a curtain rod, or hung from a curtain rod off of the ceiling.  The cloth doesn't have to be overly thick, as one of the performance halls at Kansas State University uses flags, which are fairly light material (there are however over 200 of them).  Thicker materials will tend to work a little better, however the ascetics has to be something you can live with.  If you're a fan of victorian style window treatments, you can also use those on either side of the door (if there are windows) to dampen some of the noise.
98XExOmqaa	if you stand the sheets up on a 28 ft wall you will see every joint even though they are factory edges. i hung drywall for 20 yrs and regardless of the size of the wall i always ran the sheets horizontally. you will get a better looking wall the more studs you join with a single sheet. also i would put the 2 ft piece at the bottom. might be a little awkward to reach it but did you think any of this was gonna be easy ? by the way i was a finisher before i was a hanger so i know what it takes to make a wall look good and standing the sheets up does not give the best results.|`|CzrycXWxaa	It sure would be tempting to buy 12 foot sheets and stand them up... Don't fall for it. It will result is weak walls that crack at the seams.<br>  Always run sheet rock horizontally on walls. This way you tie as many studs together as possible.  <br>  <br>  If you can transport 12 foot sheets use them if not, you will have to use 8 foot sheets.<br>  <br>  Start at the top and work your way down to the floor.<br>  <br>  Do not try for an easy short seam over the door. this is the most common area  for cracks.|`|OMEmacEyaa	Bit has the right answer.  The sheet rock in itself does not add strength to the wall.  What it does is hold the studs in a vertical position which is the strongest.|`|dip4oxB5aa	Use a 4X12 sheetrock and cut the top two feet off.  Put seven sheets up vertically by four feet each equals the 28 foot length you have.  Its less cutting and less sheetrock to buy.|`|0GUZlo4Iaa	i agree with max<br>  i also agree with larry|`|XLQxfjocaa	Get 10 foot sheetrock instead of 8 foot and it eliminates the 2 foot gap at the botom which leaves a hard joint to finish and make look right. Hanging the 10 foot sheetrock vertically means you only have tapered edge joints to tape, block, and skim which is much easier than the 4 foot butt joints which you would have if you hung the sheetrock horizontally.|`|169d74657ea6f56aa856686eb0081bcfaa	The way one of my bosses used to have me do sheetrock for 10Ft ceilings was with sheets vertical, and leaving the 2 foot gap at the bottom, and filling it in last.  He always said if the ceiling or the floor were off, it's best to be working on the floor to fix the ceiling.  It did make that  long seam easier to tape and mud.|`|c64322bd68c3bf339c51d6a04265cdf6aa	I'd say "bit" has the best answer here...I did similar job like yours and it's far less work on finishing seams etc. Vertical installation won't crack either. I hope you can find 4'x10' sheets in your area!|`|tOCESHLYaa	You want to hang the sheetrock horizontally. In theory standing up the sheetrock seems like the best way to do it. Just for the fact that you will have no butt joints. All your sheetrock will meet with factory edges. Which are easier to finish. But in the real world it does not work that way. Only if you are dealing with a job framed with metal studs, which can be moved if they have to be. If dealing with wood framing the lay out would have to be perfect and the studs straight. Does not happen. So if you stand up the sheetrock you end up cutting off the factory edge. Giving a a 10 ft butt joint which is harder to finish. Anyone who tells you to stand up the sheetrock on wood does not do for a living or does not do good work. If they are dealing with framing and wood that is perfect then yes it can be done.

TNwvuazEaa	If you haven't come across signs of water damage, it might not be a leak at all. What I'm guessing it is is vibration of the the drain pipe in your wall. Somewhere within your wall, there is probably a 2 x 4 with a hole drilled in it and the pipe goes through that hole. What winds up happening when you flush the toilet is the pipe vibrates ever so slightly and it makes a ticking (dripping) sound where it contacts the 2 x 4. We had the same thing in our house. The solution to the problem is to open up the wall where you hear the sound and spray (minimal expanding) foam insulation around the pipe where it goes through the hole in the 2 x 4. This will stop the sound. If the sound you are hearing has been going on for a long time and you haven't come across any traces of water anywhere, then I'm almost positive your problem is a vibrating pipe contacting wood and not a leak.|`|AA11215068	If water is dripping and you can hear it, then it's going someplace. I would start by flushing the toilet and checking to see if there are any leaks between the tank and the bowl. Next, I would take the toilet up and install a new wax ring under the toilet. Once that's complete I would have someone flush the toilet so you can listen for the drip again. All is well if you don't hear anything. <br>  <br>  You will be able to see if the wood is wet under and around the toilet base when it is removed. The wood will absorb the water for a while before it just decays and rots out. The water will start dripping down to the drywall of the ceiling below after that, so it's something you should take care of right away.|`|Jfo6XyAZaa	It could be a pipe leaking, watch for any mould on the ceilings.I think youre best bet would be to call your plumber and see what he/she thinks is the problem

Pull the snake straight out without turning it and hopefully the clog will come out with it.

The footing will help keep the wall so much more stable and it will last longer and crack less, I recommend it.<br>  <br>  No one can tell you exactly what you need to know without knowing your area, but the concrete companies and maybe landscape construction companies will know.|`|3W18HDxxaa	there a dollar a pc here, <br>  delivery is $45<br>   min of 50 blocks ]on delivery]|`|Nae32k07aa	totally depends on where you live and how many blocks you are going to get delivered

Very difficult to get rid of if you change your mind. Seeds are viable in soil for up to 10 years & quite invasive.<br>  Clematis- Very beautiful in bloom. Perennial, so it comes back every year. Very long to cover and bloom all over fence. Many bare spots. Not a long blooming plant, though.<br>  <br>  My all time favorite is Sweet Autumn Clematis. It blooms in late summer and into fall with the most heavenly-scented little white flowers. Even when it is out of bloom, the foliage covers nice and consistent all summer.|`|lXVIaLVTaa	Wild sweet peas are lovely. We have them here in Alaska and they grow well even in harsh conditions.

Just shut the door when you "bomb" that room. It will cost you about $5.00- $6.00 bucks!|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	Get some raid. Spray all the corners of the room and around the baseboards all along the walls an d doors. Do some spot spraying in the kitchen along  the baseboards and around all the doors of the house. RAID residue kills for like a week.  But you didn't have to destroy the desk. Most cockroaches( the big ones live in trees and travel alone) The small ones are the ones you have to look out for. <br>  <br>  Growing up at my aunts house our neighbor had a horrible roach infestation and they would travel to the two houses on the sides of them. Our house being one of them. One night I woke up and our kitchen was crawling with roaches, everywhere. It almost seemed like I could hear them scattering when I turned on  the lights. But that night I went to Walmart and bought some Raid. Cleaned and sanitized the kitchen, sprayed Raid all around the perimeter of  the room. In th air conditioning vents( the are in the floor) in every corner of every shelf. And in the corners of every drawer.( with everything taken out of course). I never saw a roach after that. We live around lots of big beautiful oak trees, so occasionally a big roach would wander under the door, but we would find it dead right by the door. Having  only walked a few inches. We reapplied the spray every month to the perimeter of the rooms. <br>  <br>  The raid worked better than the people from Sears that used to come spray pesticide every months.|`|vhtD98g3aa	make sure you check used stuff before you buy it to make sure there is nothing wrong for what ever you are buying!<br>  <br>  Once my Dad bought a used game and he did not look at the disk first before he bought the game and when he got home the game was all scratched up and the game did not work one bit!!!

mWkkh9L7aa	I've seen this done many times and it is great if you use a professional.  Do be sure to look at some completed jobs once you find a pro and ask how long they've been done.  Look for someone with a 5 to 10 year warranty.  The longer the warranty, the better the job.  Most of the pros doing epoxy work in our area only offer a 1 year warranty.  I found someone  that actually offers a 10 year warranty and have been referring him for about 12 years.  His charge for an average size tub is $350 to $400.|`|tDBRH5U6aa	Check in the phone book. We pay $300 for the tub and $325 for the tile walls.|`|73aa4bf33f680a909f0c2ac17afbaee3aa	Yes, about $350 for a tub.  You won't be happy with the results.

xoLGphSBaa	I am in the U.S., and the off-the-shelf dye is Rit brand.  They also had a dye removal pack.  Possibly, you have a similar brand there.  However, color removal is difficult to do evenly, and dark brown is one of the most intense colors to remove.  <br>  <br>  Bleach is the most obvious and immediately effective ingredient for dye removal, but you chance rotting the fabric.  IF you use it, try it in dilution (mostly water and well-mixed:  never pour bleach into a machine with clothing and no water) - AND always neutralize the bleaching effect by following up with a solution of vinegar and mostly water.  <br>  <br>  Two ways to "set" a dye (make it permanent) are to soak the fabric in salty water or water with  a good cup or more of vinegar.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  But - I doubt you will be satisfied.  What I would do, if you have a comforter, is to get a duvet (cover) or make one by sewing together two sheets.  If you are talking about sheets - I'd get another set or use these for curtains, covering something else, or just passing them on.<br>  <br>  Cotton bleaches far more easily than polyester.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	I've been in textiles for 20 years and there is no way to get satisfactory results at home.  The cotton will have vat or reactive dyes and it takes strong stipping agents at elevated temperatures to remove the color evenly and it will damage the fabric.  If there has been a finish added, it is next to impossible.  Finding a container in going to be the biggest problem.  Your washer will not work or be hot enough.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to find the manufacturer of the bedding and buy a new set.  This will actually be cheaper than what you propose in the long run.|`|AaoclPYCaa	You are fixing to turn your bedding into a big mess!!  I wouldn't even try to bleach it out and redye it.  Bleaching out brown is going to be next to impossible to get the bleaching even.  Then dying it blue will make it a bigger mess.  Just buy new stuff and save yourself the frustration of the whole thing.

In your home you will use a 22lb. freon most likely. Your automobile is 134a. An ice machine probably 404. If you are trying to buy for your home it is sold in 30lb. drums that would cost you about $100. Any a/c tech will come charge your unit for around $150 dollars.

It is available at HVAC wholesalers.  You need to have a gauge set to charge your AC unit (or whatever you want to charge) and have a knowledge of the pressures and temperatures, superheat and subcooling, and whether the system uses R-22, R-410A, R-12, R-134a for the refrigerant.  If you're charging a new system you would need a vacuum pump and gauge as well to evacuate the system before charging it.  So unless you're planning on doing alot of HVAC work, you'd be better off just getting a technician out to do the work.|`|N0TJqtzMaa	first of all freon is a brand name not a product,and if you need to know where to buy refrigerant and where it gos then maybe its best left to the ones that already know where to put it|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	The only one I know of that you can buy without a license is 134a, used in car air conditioners.

Find a mild cleaner -- or even laundry soap, if you aren't sure what cleaners to use -- and put a bit on the carpet.

4qTlIEWyaa	I think it's a really bad idea.  I really don't like wallpaper, and to put it on cabinets would be a hard job if you wanted it to look good.  It would be a real pain to get it off again, too.  If you own your home, it would reduce the resale value.|`|AA10097817	Sorry, I personally hate wallpaper. I can't imagine the grief you would go through trying to put the wallpaper on cabinets. Maybe practice on something else, like a cardboard box?|`|dip4oxB5aa	wallpaper is out of style and tough to remove later on unless you prime your walls before applying it.  its messy to install.  that is why many people try faux finishes on their walls when they want a design.  most people use a sponge and dip it into different color paints and make a consistent design on the wall.  if you dont like it then paint over it and try it again.

ww12lItvaa	You may have gunked it up. It is always a bad idea to run a tank low because there is always a little sludge or condensation in the bottom of the tank. That is why the lines don't go to the bottom. It is a VERY bad idea to tip the tank because of this.  When is the last time you had it cleaned? <br>  <br>  Running it low pulls gunk in to the system. If you have an inline filter do you change it at least annually? It could be plugged up. If you don't have one you likely plugged up the pump and nozzle.|`|AKrTZqbKaa	Is the furnace an older one? Is the tube feeding the boiler in the ground or does it go up and over then down? On some older guns there isn't enough suction power to lift the oil up and over then down. They have to have gravity feed in the line to the gun. With 9 inches in the tank you should have enough to last a few days. Try to add a few gallons to the tank to see if it flows to the gun. This is a common problem with older units. The newer guns are more powerful and can lift the oil out of the tank. Email back if you have any more questions.       <br>  <br>      Did you check the controls on the exhaust stack. This has a little red button that you can reset if the boiler went through a cycle without firing.|`|ZKUukv55aa	what type of boiler is it. If it  is steam make sure you have water in the glass.

hKJIDdVqaa	now a days, white clothing often cannot be washed with bleach. It is made with a special chemical, that will actually yellow when bleached. Also too much bleach will yellow your laundry, especially if you have hard water. With that said generally once the clothes are yellowed it cannot be fixed.  Carefully follow the clothing directions when washing whites.  A fix to help may be washing your whites in HOT water, a cup of white vinegar, and a cup of baking soda. The baking soda will also soften your water  :) If you do not want to get rid of the clothing, I would suggest dying it with RITE dye.  New color, but you can keep the clothes.   :)|`|grKtTRYtaa	Rit Dye has a product called Whitener and Brightener; I have used it.  It works.<br>  It is about $3 for a large load.

AA11474133	ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!<br>  <br>  It is unfortunate that the term "grounded" is used.  The "ground' pin on your outlet is not connected to the earth, it goes to the main panel.  It's purpose is to draw current and trip the circuit breaker if there is a fault in your equipment.  If you connect it to a ground rod, that will never happen, and a fault in your equipment will leave exposed metal energized (shock hazard).|`|0qI6dlUEaa	It is very unsafe to disable the ground on an electrical appliance that is made with one.  It is not legal with the NEC to drive a separate ground rod and more importantly it is ineffective.  The surge suppression, internal and external, won't function without a ground.  The wireless card or modem has better range with a ground reference.  Run a new circuit from the panel, or take a chance on voiding the warranty when you have a power surge.
jcauTPLZaa	First of all most of the answers you got so far are dangerous. NEVER EVER break off a ground pin. Second it is never code to use the neutral for a ground. THEY ARE NOT the same thing. Even though they get bonded back at the main service panel. They must always be separate. If you hook the neutral and ground together and you have the possibility of your ground always caring current and anything metal that comes into contact with the ground will now be a shock hazard. You cant just drive a ground rod either unless you run a bonding jumper back to the main service panel. Any additional ground rods must be bonded the the main, because it will have a different grounding potential and this becomes dangerous as well. Check your outlet to see if there is a ground wire present. Sometimes in the past they would just hook the ground wire to the box. If this is the case,  you can install a modern outlet, by either pig tailing a new ground wire from the back of the box to the outlet, or just install the outlet. It will pick up the ground from the screws holding the outlet in. If you have old metal sheathed cable called bx/mc the metal sheath is the ground, if no grounding wire is present. If none of the conditions are present, by NEC Code you can install a GFCI outlet, but you must mark it as being ungrounded. You wont have a ground but it will offer protection against ground faults. GFCI's don't require or need ground wires to work.|`|0qI6dlUEaa	Computers are required to be grounded for safety reasons because they have exposed metal parts.  You can meet codes by using a GFI, but you lose some other benefits.   A ground rod will not meet code, and is ineffective for surge suppression.      A ground is required for any surge suppression, internal or external, to function. It is also required for warranty repairs.   If you have a wireless card or wireless modem it may need a ground reference.  Run a new circuit from your panel to the receptacle, or be willing to accept the damages that can result if you don't.|`|LzWfHMZhaa	yes|`|89Jt1XzVaa	your appliance could be double insulation or from overseas that not require earth conection.so just connect the red or brown wire to the conection of the plug mark A and the other black or blue colour wire conect to the conection mark N.then don't aboult the E conection.If you still not sure please consult your local electrician.|`|lmLle24Iaa	You'd be better off grounding it to your water pipe ( if copper )..in replacing the outlet you might be in luck and find the outlet box is grounded and you can get some utility out of the ground prong ( as opposed to being tied into the municipal common )|`|NGYa5Q0oaa	yeah|`|IqlDYwH6aa	I had this same problem in a 60 year old house. I had a licensed electrician show me a neat trick, that supposedly is up to code, easy to do and saved boat-loads of loot. <br>  <br>  Replace the outlet with a standard 3 prong. If you have modern wiring, you should already have the ground, so no problem, hook it all up. <br>  <br>  Assuming you have ancient wiring and no ground, like me, wire up the new 3 prong with the black and white wires as usual, then take a scrap piece of wire (well, same as the black or white) and run it from the ground screw into the white terminal (either at the screw or use the little holes in the back). <br>  <br>  As another user mentioned, at the breaker box, the white and ground all goes to the same grounding rod.|`|AA12168890	If the conduit which contains the wires is of metal, most likely it is already grounded to the main "earth" near your electric meter. In that case simply replace the two pin outlet with a three pin one. Of course the GFI will indicate if the ground is working.<br>  Please do not cut off the ground - that is for YOUR protection. Also there should be no need to install a separate ground.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you have no experience with electrical wiring call an electrician. Electricity is not water (as in plumbing), it is deadly.|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	yes

AaoclPYCaa	You have actually burned your shirt.  Use a lower setting.|`|xoLGphSBaa	Two possibilities:<br>  you're scorching the shirts<br>  or<br>  you didn't spot treat before washing and the residue discolors under the heat.<br>  <br>  Padding will make it easier to iron, won't make spots.|`|uMj5csRdaa	i'm pretty sure it means you've burned your shirts. put the iron on a lower setting or dont leave in the same place for so long.
2zEGBgL1aa	you can't really get an average monthly cost.  i have a 3000 sq foot home built in 1835.  the average monthly cost is about $110. and my hot water comes off the boiler.  <br>  that's $1320 for last years oil, divided by 12.<br>  <br>  so to get a good idea of what you might expect to pay, you need to mention what type of fuel, what type of house (age, insulation) and the region where you live.   <br>  <br>  i keep my house at 55 deg, because it doesn't have any insulation and i would go broke if i ran it much higher than that
4qTlIEWyaa	I think a drum roller would compact the ground too much.  Buy some chain link fencing, and drag it behind your yard tractor or lawn mower.|`|AA10097817	I think that's pretty much how the builder did it to our soil before they put down sod.|`|59c3b42b981e8e7cddf9e38ed4ba42b6aa	It's up to you if what you want with your ground. If you want it leveled or you want it like rolling hills. If you want it level, you just scrape the highest point and fill it on the lowest part until you have the level you want. When you have it all leveled, you just roll the drum to tamp the soil a little bit. There, you are ready for laying your new sod. You don't need to rototill it. It should be okay.
4qTlIEWyaa	You could just put a few tables and chairs in there, and use it as a party room.|`|oAfBQheCaa	make it an office/den kinda space. or since you are living with 3 friends. i'm assuming your  college age.... FOOSBALL!  Ping Pong , Pool table and a few pinball machines should do it. OH and don't forget the Full Size Soda machine.  All of your other friends will be so jealous.|`|umouBcZvaa	How about a game room, put like a ping pong table or something, or a study, office type room. How about a exercise room? Once you guys settle in, you will find something to do with it, trust me.|`|dtm9Eqvdaa	How about a guest/meditation room. I have one and since then i went there to calm myself down. :)
4qTlIEWyaa	There's a hot pepper spray that keeps squirrels out of our sweet corn in the garden, but it's kinda waxy and I don't know what it might do to your car.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	yeah a 30-O6.  I need one for my house too.  Don't like blood, try moth balls.<br>  :)|`|N73oZyY8aa	Ciyite urine comes in a bottle, it works on deer in an orchard. Try that.|`|MJpDjGeUaa	Two options. First a 22 or good pellet gun. Second, encourage them. Remove your engine and replace it with squirrel cages connected to a generator. The first squirrel hybrid. Sometimes I just can't help myself.  RScott|`|ef5KDy0Gaa	Put cayenne pepper in a sock and put it under the hood,take out when in use or place it in a crack where it wont jostle loose.|`|MrVM1T0Xaa	You can try putting a dried hot pepper around the hood of your car. The smell burns their nose and if they were to lick their paws it would burn their mouth.|`|Yfjh3kBAaa	no, there isn't.  the only remedy i have ever had success with was a .12 gauge.|`|BL2NfTafaa	You may want to saturate an old rag with urine from a predator. Maybe you can use dog urine. It sounds gross, but may help to deter them if they think the dog will come back under the hood of your car in their tiny brains. I suggest the towel instead of spraying it in there. It is quite acidic and could corrode some important mechanisms in your engine. Maybe even the hot pepper spray on a towel instead of spraying in the engine.
AdoTLU0xaa	It almost looks like an Edwin Sharringham. from around the 1930's but without a good inspection, I couldn't confirm.   There were a large number made of these, but not many appear on the open market today.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|KwBF3WvGaa	I don't know but it is a very pretty chair thought!
SaCMyfHPaa	It really depends where you live, if you need to get permits and who you have plumb your house, and the layout of your house.  To rough in a typical layout 1500 sq ft home a quick estamate of materials would be 1200 dolllars of ABS and pex fittings.  However the labor cost would be to hard to estamate the national average for liscenced plumbers is $42, here is $65 per hour.  Then it really depends on what you want to do with fixtures you can go as cheap or expensive as you want.  Brand new construction I have bid these size homes for 10000 or less depending on the layout.
l9xnybUMaa	Dubet covers are great! get two, and when one gets dirty just replace it.  With the color scheme I would do the room in a soft grey, or white, and use colorful graphic poster and lamps to add your color.|`|KmwrfHPtaa	I'm usually all for big splashes of color and bold prints, but I'm not so sure that orange is really the color for that bedspread. It's not that it's "ugly" or anything, the orange is great, but it doesn't go with the colors or motif of the bedspread. I'd say a green or purple would be nice though, as having a secondary color on your walls really fits with the primary colors of the bedspread (except orange).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|FXnHE7mmaa	I think the Hedda Blom would look great with orange walls..really pops...not too fussy on your current bedding though..the lighter orange seems washed out compared to your wall colour...go for the new one..love it.|`|AA12233727	I don't like orange with that bed spread because there is no orange in it, as far as I can tell. Try getting your current bed spread professionally cleaned.
AA10097817	I bought a cotton filled with silk comforter from overstock.com. It is just plain white, but fits my needs. I put it in a duvet cover to change up the color. That makes it heavier and warmer.|`|xoLGphSBaa	If you intend to sleep with it next to you, get a duvet.  (Doo-VAY.)  That's a comforter cover and is like two sheets sewn together, then it folds over, or snaps, or zips closed.  You can take if off weekly to wash it.  Duvets are usually make out of fabric like sheets.

It's inhumane to torture them.<br>  <br>  That being said, most places you have to have special permits to trap and relocate them, so you need to talk to your animal control or game warden.|`|qUGVYNItaa	ask them nicely. stay calm. if that doesnt work then ignore them, myabe they will go away.<br>  <br>  make sure to put out fresh garbage every night, they lkike that.|`|coI0o5XMaa	We called our local humane society/SPCA  and they came and captured the one.<br>  Please call your local animal shelter. .|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Make sure you do not have your garbage cans outside.  They love bird seed and pet food and have even gone for scented candles.  In our last home in the woods, they even tried to run off with our grill tools as they picked up the smell of food on them.  You can purchase traps at Home Depot or Lowes and relocate them but frankly I wouldn't want an angry raccoon in my vehicle caged or not.  There are critter control companies that can relocate them for you but if you are in the woods you have an endless supply of raccoons.  So it's best to keep all garbage and food stuffs out of their scent range which means in the garage or a similar inside enclosed area.|`|l342ysWnaa	Well, it may be inhumane to shoot them, but in my state, it's illegal to relocate them.  If you trap them, you either have to release them where you trapped them or "euthanize" them.<br>  <br>  Nobody else wants your raccoon problem, and the other raccoon populations do not want rabies transmitted to them.
o0oYsQM7aa	Pinch the ends that are still alive off. Place those in a glass of water in indirect light. They will grow roots. In about three weeks you will have enough root there to try again.<br>  <br>  Look at the dirt. Is it moldy? Is it bone dry? If the dirt looks good, look at the environment. Is it directly under a heat vent? In direct sunlight? Is the cat using it for a litterbox?
4qTlIEWyaa	Yes, it'll take stain, but it would look better painted.|`|AA10097817	You might want to paint it instead.|`|AA12233727	You can stain it , but it's not going to look like real wood.
