cHhEC9fpaa	The rate of doing work (P), force (F), and velocity are related by     P = FV    (assuming the force and velocity vectors are parallel). The work being done by the engine overcomes the frictional force (air resistance etc.) acting to bring the car to rest.     Thus F = P/V.     Before applying this formula we need to convert to S.I. units (watts and m/s). The speed 73 km/hour = 73,000 meters/hour = 73,000 meter/(60 x 60 seconds) = 20.28 m/s     F = = 45,000 W/20.28 m/s = 2219 newtons.

bnYcacoxaa	Asexual reproduction only requires one organism. The organism can create offspring from itself, with the daughter cells being genetically identical to the mother cell. For example, sponges reproduce asexually by budding, in which a fragment of the sponge is separated from the mother and can grow into a complete, functioning organism. Therefore, asexual reproduction produces diploid cells (complete set of chromosomes).    Sexual reproduction produces haploid cells called gametes, with only half a set of chromosomes, requiring fusion with a second gamete in order to complete the set of chromosomes. The daughter cell will not be identical to either cell that fused to produce it.

You need to use the AND rule as you are choosing two people (so you multiply the probabilities).    This means that you do 3/10 times 2/9, it's 2/9 because one person has been taken out and they cannot swim.    3/10 times 2/9 = 6/90, this simplifies to 1/15.    Therefore the probability that you pick two people of whom both cannot swim is 1/15.|`|0LUBf2Juaa	First pick will be 3 in 10.

For your next pick you've got to pick another non-swimmer which would be a 2/9 chance, this is because you've already picked one non-swimmer and now your pool of non-swimmers to choose is just 2 out of 9..    To get the probability that neither can swim you must multiply 3/10 * 2/9.    3/10 * 2/9 = .30 * .22 = .0667  or 6.7%

This is designed so that while the cam is rotating the lobe controls the linear action or motion of whatever its connected to. This allows it to gradually open and close a linear system by using rotational force. many lobes can be connected to one cam. this is how cars open and close their valves using 1-2 camshafts. try howstuffworks.com, they might have an animation (theyre pretty good about that stuff)
xbma9SuWaa	Sure the history of neutrinos is a great idea.      Neutrinos are neutral particles (charge is 0)  that have very low mass. There are 3 kinds of  neutrinos that are different because of there mass.  Neutrinos are classified under a larger group of particles called leptons.  When neutrinos are created they are created along with another lepton.  Usually an electron, which will make an electron neutrino (smallest mass).  Other kinds of leptons are called the tau  and the muon. They are accompanied by the tau neutrinoand muon neutrinos.  Strange thing about neutrinos is that the change from one neutrino to another.  Meaning that neutrino could be an electron neutrino one minute and then change to a tau neutrino and then to a muon neurtion.

WNxTv08Taa	33 moons is nothing.    Jupiter has 63 "known" moons.     Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants and are the two largest planets in the solar system, they have immense gravity wells that capture passing comets/asteroids.     An asteroid belt intersects Mars and Jupiter so thats where some of those moons came from. It isn't impossible that saturn has captured some moons from here also.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Most of the time, a planet does not capture an asteroid falling past it. In the reference frame of the planet, the asteroid approaches on one branch of a hyperbola and leaves along the other branch.    Someone suggested that what lets a planet make a moon capture is the asteroid dissipating some of its energy in the planet's upper atmosphere. But in that case, the asteroid would tend to loop back into the planet's atmosphere at the periapsis of its captured orbit, repeatedly, losing more energy on each pass, until it crashed down on to the planet. So if atmosphere braking is involved, then there must be some other gravitational influence (like from an already captured moon) to elevate the periapsis of the recently captured moon.    There's a small window for moon capture that's simply due to the fact that the planet is an accelerated object. It's being accelerated by the sun's gravity, v^2/r = G(M+m)/r^2. This can put an asymmetry into the hyperbolic trajectory of an asteroid, relative to the planet, that could maybe cause a capture.|`|E0U2yII3aa	The gas giants have so many moons not only because they have immense gravity but also because they have "thick atmospheres" (if you can really call undifferentaited layers of gas an atmosphere) where they can dissipate the energy received from the capture of such objects. A planet may be massive and has considerable gravity to attract objects hovering at a distance, but if it has no or a very thin atmosphere, an object which comes close enough may end up colliding with the planet instead. The  inner planets' atmosphers are "very thin" compared to the gas giants'. The other reason for having too many moons is that the gas giants have participated in a "gravitational dance" ever since their formation. Jupiter and Saturn have been migrating closer to the sun since then. Neptune, which is mysteriously more massive than Uranus sits last in the planet lineup. Theorists, say it may have been closer but was disturbed by Saturn and Jupiter's "dance". Smaller objects got disturbed, too, in their orbits and end up hurtling away or towards these giants. Today and lastly, the astroid belt sits close to Jupiter which makes it a rich reservoir for capturing more moons. As it completes its orbit around the sun, it may end up kicking some of these objects into the inner Solar System or out the other way. Then, again the planets farther out may end up capturing it. (It's like pinball.) The same role, too is played by Neptune which can disturb objects in the outskirts of the Solar System sending them into the Sun or the other way around. Gravitational collision or direct collision itself, plays a major role into why some objects end up being partnered with other objects in the Solar System. I forgot, some moons are also a result of the materials left collecting themselves to form larger objects around their parent planets specially the big ones.    A planet can have as many moons as long it can hold onto them and/or as long as the moons' orbits with respect to other moons in the system are stable coz they can be either freed, kicked out or spiral down into the planet.|`|K9EnwXP1aa	why does earth only have one moon..........ask sum scientist|`|AA10551791	Allot of saturn's moons are captured asteroids. Saturn and Jupiter have so many moons because they are basically a cosmic vacuum cleaner protecting the inner planets from bombardment of 'space junk' due to there enormous gravitational pull.    Chances are we would have more moons if the 4 gas giants weren't there.|`|Ra5HCf1Baa	Saturnhas a total of 60 moons, many of which were only discovered in the last few years - 52 of them have received official names. Believe it or not, this isn't the most in the Solar System (Jupiter has 63).    Most of Saturn's moons are quite tiny, just 2 to 3 km across, and would be considered merely comets if they weren't orbiting around Saturn.    Saturn does have some larger moons, including the second largest moon in the Solar System    Saturn's innermost moon is Pan, circling the planet at only 134,000 km above Saturn's center. The largest inner moon is Mimas, at 397 km across, and orbiting about 185,000 km from the center of Saturn. Then Enceladus at 238,000 km, Tethys at 295,000 km, Dione at 377,000 km, Rhea at 527,000 km, Titan at 1.2 million km, and finally Iapetus at 3.56 million km.    More than 35 of Saturn's 60 moons orbit at a distance of more than 10 million km from the center of the planet, and this makes is likely that further moons will be discovered at even more distant orbits. Smaller moons - moonlets really - have been uncovered at gaps inside Saturn's F-Ring, and it's unclear if they'll ever be recognized as moons.    For some of the smallest moonlets, Cassini can't image them directly. Instead, the spacecraft was only able to find them because of the propeller ripples they leave as they churn up material in Saturn's rings.    This article reports on the discovery of Saturn's 60th moon, and here's a photograph that contains three of Saturn's moons all in the same image.    Here's a general article on Saturn's moons, and further information from the Cassini/Huygens mission.

Today it is rare on Earth to find a person with a halo larger than 1 inch. Yellow halo appears as a result of a highly active brow chakra (which can be seen glowing with violet by many people at my workshops). Highly spiritual people stimulate the brow chakra continuously for many years, because they always have intensive spiritual thoughts in their minds.

As the muscles generate more heat by activity the blood flow to the body's surface is increased by the opening of surface-feeding capillaries and reduction of blood flow to other parts (e.g. stomach & intestines).  Heat is dissipated at the surface by evaporation of sweat. Heat is also extracted from the lungs by the air breathed in and out - in dogs for example (although not in humans) this is a major cooling mechanism.|`|nM7xmhgiaa	Body heat is generated by metabolic activity.

Asteroids are real, they are out there, stuff has hit us in the past and there's no good reason not to believe it won't hit us again in the future (assuming we don't take active steps to steer an object away).  The probability of a collision causing significant damage is quite low however.  The biggest "collision" (technically an airburst but I don't think that really matters in this context) of the last century or so was the Tunguska event in 1908.  It levelled a forest but may not have killed even a single person (hard to say for sure.)  It could have destroyed a major city had it been on a slightly different course.  Events of this magnitude are estimated to occur only once about every 1000 years.  (This is as a result of studying the population of objects over the last decade or so, about 20 years ago it was thought such events might happen every 300 years or even every 100 years.)  So a great many people have lived out their lives in the last century without ever being affected by an asteroid strike.  Asteroids have thus been essentially no threat to "us".  In the longer run, however, it's not a case of "if" but rather "when" (and also I guess "where").  So they are a threat, though at this stage we know of no objects on a collision course within the next 100 years.|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	For every known asteroid that crosses Earth's orbit (about 300) there's hundreds more on similar orbits that haven't been discovered.<br>  <br>  Asteroids are a threat.

All are 100% ionized strong acids so at least the pH per se would be quite similar.|`|qL99iWAaaa	Yes acid rain contains Sulphuric acid and Nitric acid.<br>  HCl reacts with some substances these two dont and i think the affinity of chlorine is much more than other substances making the reaction of actual acid rain faster (not sure about this affinity thing).....
DRVSCxKpaa	No, because of the density of the solution; particularly at higher concentrations.<br>  For example, concentrated hydrochloric acid is 37% by weight (370000ppm); but a litre of solution weighs 1200 grams.  Therefore, 1200 grams would contain 440 grams; or 440,000 mg/l.<br>  You have to adjust for the density; but if you are measuring at or near the mg/l level, the difference is insignificant.|`|ossCVxPqaa	mg/litre = ppm.This is generally used for aqueous solutions<br>  If you are dealing with solids, Say you want to express the amount of a trace element in a sample of iron, you can say that it contains 100ppm X.

NSQaDOhYaa	The basic equations for the linear, surface and volume expansion of an object made from a homogeneous material with temperature T are<br>  <br>  L = L0.(1 + α.T); <br>  S = S0.(1 + α.T)2 = S0.(1 + β.T); <br>  V = V0.(1 + α.T)3 = V0.(1 + γ.T).<br>  <br>  Since the expansion coefficients are small, to good accuracy the approximations β = 2.α and γ = 3.α are valid. <br>  <br>  The discussion given by the previous Answerer is complex; it does however contain an error in that the change dVS in the volume of a solid sphere is given as<br>  <br>  VS = V.γ.T<br>  <br>  but this equation is later taken to describe the volume VS itself. If this is corrected, use of the equations above lead to the conclusion that the ratio VS/VH (where VS relates to a solid sphere and VH a hollow sphere) is in fact one.<br>  <br>  The use of spherical objects, in my view, complicates the discussion of this point. If instead we consider a solid and hollow cube, it is much easier to relate changes back to the fundamental linear expansion process and its coefficient. If the walls of the hollow cube are considered to be made up of a fixed number of identical elemental cubes, then this adequately explains the expected behaviour of the macro object. There is no reason to suppose that the behaviour of a particular cube would depend upon its physical position or the presence or absence of other material.<br>  <br>  The point of this argument is that, if the expansion behaviour of a hollow cube differed from that of a solid cube, the various expansion coefficients could no longer be regarded as constants, but dependent upon the shape of an object and the distribution of material within it. There is no experimental evidence that this is the case.|`|20a28a16f9146e565f0d0f4721edc101aa	Good question. Let alpha be coefficient of linear expansion beta = 2(alpha) be coefficient of surface expansion and gamma = 3 (alpha) be coefficient of volume expansion for the material of which the two identical balls are made. Let R be the surface area of both S = 4piR^2, V =(4pi/3)R^3 be the volume of the solid or hollow sphere at zero degree C. Suppose now we increase temperature of both balls by dt. Then change in Volume dVS of solid sphere is given by, <br>  VS = gamma x V x dt     ---------------- 1<br>  Change in Surface area, dSof the hollow sphere = beta x S x dt.

So your "source" is me....your getting your information strait from the farmers mouth.<br>  <br>  GM food pros:  It lines the pockets of huge agribusiness companies like Monsanto, Dow, ect.  They make titanic profits, in their quest to control the worlds food supply.  <br>  <br>  GM food cons:  It lines the pockets of hugs agribusiness companies like Monsanto, Dow, ConAgra, ect.  They make titanic profits, in their quest to control the worlds food supply.<br>  <br>  Not a SINGLE GM food is tested before being released to be put in the human food supply.  No kidding, not a single one.  They are released by the FDA.  The general human public of the world are the lab rats of these companies.<br>  <br>  So if you are allergic to something, like say fish, you have zero idea if they have snuck fish genes into your tomatoes, or strawberries.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you have religious (or moral) reasons why you cannot eat rodents (specifically mice).  Do you know which vegtable crops you will find mice genes in?  (I do)<br>  <br>  These mega agribusiness companies have turned farmers into serfs on their own land, in the quest to do things ever cheaper.<br>  <br>  These GM crops are helping to create supper weeds, and supper bugs.<br>  The only thing that kills the weeds is to hack them out by hand, or to have goats graze on them several years in a row.<br>  <br>  The only thing that kills the supper bugs (insects) are chickens and ducks if they are the ground dwelling kind of bugs.  If they are the flying type farmers are just S.O.L.<br>  <br>  GM foods are NOT sustainable.  Not at all.  They are going to fail, and fail spectacuarly!  <br>  <br>  The European union has very wisely decided not to allow GM foods.  The countries that are setting themselves up for famine where people are actually starving to death in the streets are:<br>  <br>  The U.S.A.<br>  Canada<br>  South America<br>  Australia<br>  Africa<br>  <br>  Think about what will happen if the corn, wheat, or soy bean crops fail in those five countries all at the same time.  Think it cannot happen all at once?  Your kidding yourself.  Disease in crops can travel the globe as fast as the flu does.<br>  <br>  GM crops will NOT deliver the better nutrition, yeild, vitamins, ect that the mega agribusiness companies state they will.  They will ONLY provide a way to further enslave (through debt) farmers.  They will ONLY produce crops which are quick to line their pockets....not actually be good for the world at large.<br>  <br>  ~Garnet<br>  Permaculture homesteading/farming over 20 years|`|gCn6bXAFaa	I think the Bt insert may be more sustainable because it reduces need for pesticides while reducing insect damage.  <br>  <br>  Other modifications to make plants resistant to viruses may also be more sustainable.  or these mods may make people neglect the sanitation needed to prevent the spread of plant viruses (once introduced to soil many viruses can persist indefinitely) and produce a situation where the GM crops are more likely to be needed.<br>  <br>  There is a concept that has been around since the fifties called the pesticide treadmill.  insects adapt or evolve resistance to whatever tech. used to control them, so new methods are required frequently.  many insects can have 10-20 generations year so they can evolve quickly.  all this is prompted by the very low levels of insect damage that can be economically tolerated.  I think sustainability or lack thereof is a product of much larger societal influence rather than any particular ag. tech.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  While I agree in principal to bohemian garnet’s point of view, many of the points she makes are factually untrue.  <br>  <br>  All gm food are tested for allergenicity through a process called protein homology where any novel proteins produced by the new plant are compared to known allergens.  An attempt to put genes from a brazil nut into a soybean was stopped with this test. <br>  <br>  There are weeds (horse weed, pig weed, & palmer amaranth) that have developed a resistance to glyphosate, but only glyphosate, so it only maters if you’re a fan of roundup. <br>  <br>  The only evidence of resistance to Bt is in the diamond back moth, which is not a pest.  Refuge requirements enforced by the usda (or epa) have prevented real pests from developing any kind of resistance to bt.  There’s no way transgenics will help foster resistance to any chemical pesticide.<br>  <br>  Garnet, while essentially I agree with you, if you say a bunch if things that aren’t true you can only ruin your credibility and the credibility of what you represent along with it.|`|bXcmhRUOaa	I am in complete agreement with Bohemian.  Another factor against GM food is that the seed must be purchased every year.  It is illegal or impossible to save it and reuse it.

JTO49rdIaa	It's quite true that the world is warming, but the question remains as to exactly how much of each contributing factor is responsible for the warmth. I can't remember where I read this, but I came across a document that claimed only 2% of greenhouse emissions each year can be attributed to mankind. I think what we should do is remember that we are all responsible for the way in which we impact our environment, regardless of how serious the consequences, and do our best to live as cleanly and efficiently as possible.

Paroxetine tablets and oral solution are also used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder (bothersome thoughts that won't go away and the need to perform certain actions over and over), generalized anxiety disorder (excessive worrying that is difficult to control), and posttraumatic stress disorder (disturbing psychological symptoms that develop after a frightening experience). Paroxetine extended-release tablets are also used to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD, physical and psychological symptoms that occur before the onset of the menstrual period each month). Paroxetine is in a class of medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.<br>  Please see the web pages for more details on Paroxetine (generic name) Paxil (brand name).

Plus they also have counter-current heat exchangers at the top of their legs, so if the feet get too hot, the cold blood from the legs can rush down again to neutralise the blood temperature.
faad4d1a2758bfb1e4ec7e12b94e3276aa	Die casting is a generic expression: You have a mold (or a die) and you pour liquid metal in. After the metal cools and hardens, you separate (or destroy) the die, and you are left with the desired metal piece.<br>  Pewter (96% tin and 4% copper) is one of the metals you can use for die casting. But because the melting point of Pewter is relatively low (about 230°C), the mold can be made of cheaper materials than if you would make - say - Zinc (420°C), or Aluminium (~660°C) castings.|`|l0U5k26Jaa	Die casting is a method of casting, pewter is a material.<br>  <br>  Die casting is generally done in a die casting machine where the charge is injected into the permanent molds under extremely high pressure. When the charge cools enough to solidify the mold halves are seperated and ejector pins push the casting out of the mold where it falls in a bath of coolant. Die casting is suited to high volume production and produces parts of extremely high dimensional tolerance and the process is very automated.<br>  <br>  Pewter casting, or to more accurately term the method, permanent mold gravity feed casting uses molds usually made from alloy or steel. A ladel is used to pour the charge into the molds at atmospheric pressure, and when the charge solidifies the mold halves are opened and the opperator pulls the part out by the sprue and/or the riser. This method is labour intensive and is used extensively in the jewlery and pewter sectors. Look on youtube for videos of the processes.

The only thing unique about it then, is that it happens to be near this (current) reference point in the sky.<br>  <br>  Though to be fair, the pole star itself very likely is moving, just it's so far away that its relative motion is insignificant compared to the local precession of the axis.|`|FoL7ENdnaa	Yes both earth an pole star are moving, earth because of the big bang and latter because of precession

nL3tIuAcaa	Whales are marine mammals of order Cetacea which are neither dolphins – members, in other words, of the families delphinidae or platanistoidae – nor porpoises. They include the blue whale, the largest animal ever to have lived. Orcas, colloquially referred to as "killer whales", and pilot whales have whale in their name but for the purpose of classification they are actually dolphins.<br>  <br>  As mammals, whales breathe air and must surface to get oxygen. This is done through a blowhole. Many whales also exhibit other surfacing behaviours such as breaching and tail slapping.<br>  <br>  Females give birth to a single calf. Nursing time is long (more than one year in many species), which is associated with a strong bond between mother and young. In most whales reproductive maturity occurs late, typically at seven to ten years. This mode of reproduction spawns few offspring, but provides each with a high probability of survival in the wild.|`|RoOAckfJaa	yes and their penis grows so yep their mamals|`|uPVnqbE8aa	The only animals on the planet that suckle their young are Mammals.

They breathe air, have hair (although it's minimal), and produce milk via mammary glands.  Therefore they meet all natural qualifications as a mammal.<br>  <br>  They also give birth to live young, but this is not a qualification to be a mammal. Because several mammals lay eggs and some reptiles give birth to live young. so this cannot be used to determine mammalian status.|`|28d07970c3adc9d81a00eeb71a258aa1aa	Yes, they are the largest mammals in the world. they are considered mammals because they have mammary glands necessary for feeding their youngs which fishes don't have.|`|mt81CABQaa	yes , they are  all mammals.

Comparing genomes or, more specifically, regions of DNA for certain genes, we can hone in on the most likely evolutionary relationships.<br>  <br>  Also, as databases continue to grow with sequenced genomes, it is now possible to discover a particular DNA sequence in some organism you're investigating and compare it with the database to see if there is another organism with the same sequence - this leads to possibly discovering a very similar or in fact the same protein(s) this DNA sequence encodes for and what these proteins might do.  Understanding DNA also enables us to utilize the new information into disease treatments by allowing us to target specific genes for amplification of expression or destruction of cells expressing these genes.<br>  <br>  We are also now able to manipulate bacteria into incorporating certain genes into their genome for expression for our benefit (like having the bacteria make proteins we need for drugs).  The possibilities with ongoing genetic research are exiting.  My short list here with poor expansion of the topic does not do justice to the amount of insight we will gain as we continue to explore genetics.

The code letter has the following interpretation:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/locked-rotor-code-d_917.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/locked...</a><br>  <br>  For example, if your motor nameplate has Code letter G, then the range of starting KVA is:<br>  5.6-6.29 KVA/HP with Avg = 5.95 kVA/HP<br>  And the starting KVA for your motor would be:<br>  5.95 kVA/HP x 7.5HP = 44.6kVA (on the average)<br>  <br>  You asked how many watts per leg would that be.  The watts are low, but the kVA per leg is one third of the 44.6kVA.  But that number is not terribly useful.  You probably want to know the starting current in each leg.  That is found from the total starting kVA as follows:<br>  Istarting = 44.6kVA / (square root of 3) / (nameplate voltage)<br>  Or, perhaps you are sizing a generator.  Then the total starting kVA is the important number.<br>  <br>  Running overload protection normally is set no higher than 115% of the Full Load Amps (FLA) rating shown on the nameplate.  It is not based on the starting current.  If you need help figuring out how to size protective devices, ask.|`|qkblT2hgaa	Check the voltage that the motor is wired for.

The start up current is important however because you must size your current limiting devices accordingly to avoid nuisance trips.

Many computer programs contain algorithms that specify the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees’ paychecks or printing students’ report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a Turing-complete system. Authors who assert this thesis include Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):<br>  <br>  ...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine (Gurevich 2000:1)...according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine. (Gurevich 2000:3)<br>  <br>  Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data is read from an input source, written to an output device, and/or stored for further processing. Stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more data structures.<br>  <br>  For any such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).<br>  <br>  Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation will always be critical to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom", an idea that is described more formally by flow of control.<br>  <br>  So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation, setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "memory" as a scratchpad. <br>  <br>  <br>  ab|`|ppb90MA0aa	an algorithm is a logical step-by-step procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps, often involving repetition of the same basic operation|`|ScOGDJg4aa	it is a logical step by step sequence to solve task or problem

zaVdDdv6aa	A microwave oven, or a microwave, is a kitchen appliance that cooks or heats food by dielectric heating. This is accomplished by using microwave radiation to heat water and other polarized molecules within the food. This excitation is fairly uniform, leading to food being adequately heated throughout (except in thick objects), a feature not seen in any other heating technique. Can have cold spots, so some say bacterial can survive.<br>  <br>  Microwave ovens heat food quickly, efficiently, and safely, but do not brown or bake food in the way conventional ovens do. This makes them unsuitable for cooking certain foods, or to achieve certain effects.<br>  <br>  Microwaving food raises several safety issues, largely connected with leakage of microwave radiation outside the oven, as well as reducing risks, such as that of fire from high temperature heat sources. There has been some concern that microwaves might damage food (microwave radiation has sounded alarming to some), but the dominant view is that microwaved food is as safe to eat as other food.<br>  A microwave oven works by passing non-ionizing microwave radiation, usually at a frequency of 2.45 gigahertz (GHz) (a wavelength of 12 centimetres , through the food. Microwave radiation is between common radio and infrared frequencies. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. This molecular movement creates heat as the rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion.<br>  <br>  Microwave heating is more efficient on liquid water than on fats and sugars (which have less molecular dipole moment), and also more efficient than on frozen water (where the molecules are not free to rotate).Microwave heating is sometimes explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect: such resonance only occurs in water vapor at much higher frequencies, at about 20 GHz.Moreover, large industrial/commercial microwave ovens operating at the common large industrial-oven microwave heating frequency of 915 MHz -  also heat water and food perfectly well.<br>  <br>  A common misconception is that microwave ovens cook food from the "inside out". In reality, microwaves are absorbed in the outer layers of food in a manner somewhat similar to heat from other methods. The misconception arises because microwaves penetrate dry non-conductive substances at the surfaces of many common foods, and thus often induce initial heat more deeply than other methods. Depending on water content, the depth of initial heat deposition may be several centimetres or more with microwave ovens, in contrast to broiling (infrared) or convection heating, which deposit heat thinly at the food surface. Penetration depth of microwaves is dependent on food composition and the frequency, with lower microwave frequencies (longer wavelengths) penetrating better.|`|fSu5c3l1aa	Micro Oven cooked food lose their NUTRITIONAL VALUE.<br>  <br>  Micro Wave uses a ELECTRO MAGNETIC WAVE TECHNOLOGY  in its process.<br>  Its high frequency radiation makes the food cooked in it harmful for consumption.<br>  Hence its use to be restricted to the minimum,.|`|EOxPpBtqaa	usually very unhelthy<br>  <br>  read the nutrition info on the back of the pack|`|qaMPEdL2aa	It is the same as cooking foods in any other way.  <br>  <br>  The electromagnetic energy is absorbed by whatever water and oil molecules are in the food.  This excites the vibration that we call heat. <br>  <br>  It is not ionizing radiation as is present in radioactive materials.  The term "nuke" applied to microwave cooking is a misnomer.|`|HrQDQvUUaa	Microwaves excite the atoms in the food, causing them to vibrate and generate heat which cooks the food. <br>  <br>  As far as being healthy, there is no radiation hazard or anything else. The health of the food is determined by making sure it is properly cooked (even in microwaves) and the ingredients of the food itself.<br>  <br>  So, microwaving food is harmless to the food (except for maybe drying it out a bit).

With that much snow vehicles get stuck, accidents happen, depending on the wind factor on the highway alot of people will not travel because of poor visibility, possible backup in traffic because of snowplows, and if the weather turns even a little bit warmer that of course will cause the snow to ice.  There is always another day to have your seminar.|`|fvuEtkROaa	I am from Grand Rapids, MI.  Nothing was ever canceled due to the weather for exactly the reasons you give.

This is evident in the formula Rate = k[Concentration]^n, where k is a rate constant and n is the degree order.  On the other hand, the catalyst makes it easy for the reactants to collide in the proper orientation and it also decreases the energy of activation needed for the reaction to occur. Thereby increasing the rate of reaction as well|`|09pyt63Taa	I would like to point out that in some cases too much catalyst can actually inhibit the reaction,<br>     For example if you dope sodium aluminium hydrate with titanium butoxide only 1% dope is needed for the reaction to be catalysed. Addition of 5% dope slows the reaction rate over 100 fold|`|bhZ83dJAaa	increasing concentration increases rate of the reaction as there are more particles so there is a larger chance of collision.<br>  <br>  adding a catalyst increases rate by providing a surface to react on or by offering an alternate route of lower activation meaning more particles have the energy to react so more collisions are successful|`|59yuFLIMaa	Simply like this:<br>  (a) More concentrated<br>  -> more particles<br>  -> more successful collisions<br>  -> increased reaction rate.<br>  <br>  (b) a catalyst provides a reactants with an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, so more particles can collide successfully. Hence, a faster reaction.

159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	Larger animals need a larger brain.  Some of the brain controls muscles and the brain is somewhat larger in a larger animal of the same intelligence.  The brain of the elephant is like the cliche very good at storing memories but it doesn't have the same amount of the frontal cortex that allows humans to have such great logic skills.|`|IEDaIsoUaa	The elephant (both Asian and African) has a very large and highly convoluted neocortex, a trait also shared by humans, apes and certain dolphin species. Scientists see this as a sign of complex intelligence. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule, such as the Echidna who also have a highly developed brain. The elephants brain exhibits a gyral pattern more complex and with more numerous convolutes/brain folds than that of humans, primates and carnivores, but less complex than cetaceans.<br>  <br>  Elephants also have a very thick cortex and even though the cell density is lower than that found in humans, it is estimated to have as many neurons. Elephants are believed to rank equal with dolphins in terms of problem solving abilities and many scientists now rank elephant intelligence to be on par with dolphins and whales.<br>  <br>  Elephants, like humans and a few other animal species (such as Orca), must learn behavior as they grow up. They are not born with the instincts of how to survive.<br>  <br>  Elephants have a very long period in their lives for learning. One comparative way to try to gauge intelligence is to compare brain size at birth to the fully developed adult brain. This indicates how much learning a species accumulates while young. The majority of mammals are born with a brain close to 90% of the adult weight. Humans are born with 28% of the adult weight, bottlenose dolphins with 42.5%,chimpanzees 54%, and elephants 35%.The learning period for an elephant is around ten years. This indicates that elephants have the highest amount of learning to undergo next to humans and behavior is not mere instinct but must be taught throughout life. It should be noted that instinct is quite different from learned intelligence. Parents will teach their young how to feed, use tools and learn their place in highly complex elephant society. The cerebrum temporal lobes, which functions as storage of memory are much larger than that of a human.<br>  <br>  Asian elephants have the greatest volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing of all existing land animals. Elephants have a volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing that exceeds that of any primate species and extensive studies place elephants in the category of great apes in terms of cognitive abilities for tool use and tool making.<br>  <br>  Elephants also have a very large and highly convoluted hippocampus, a brain structure in the limbic system that is much bigger than that of any human, primate or cetacean. The hippocampus of an elephant takes up about 0.7% of the central structures of the brain, comparable to 0.5% for humans and with 0.1% in Risso dolphins and 0.05% in the bottlenose dolphin. The hippocampus is linked to processing emotion and memory. This is thought to possibly be why elephants suffer from psychological flashbacks and the equivalent of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

When word got out about what I had witnessed, the Army had me take a lie detector test, and then had be undergo hypnosis.After that , I asked the doctor if I was having some sort of mental problems . He said no, you saw what you said you saw.Since my memory was very plain about some things and vague about others, I had heard that hypnosis could clear things up, and I asked him about some of the memories that were extremely vague to me, and he said that he couldn't tell me anything else. Go home and forget about it.Army Intelligence told me to just keep quiet, because if you talk about it, people are going to think that you are crazy. So that's what I've done.Kept my mouth shut.

This situation isn't helped by a recent ad on MySpace which promotes a fake organisation which is said to be holding a lottery to see who will be chosen to survive 2012. It's part of an advertising campaign for the film '2012' and will no doubt persuade the kids (along with some pestered parents) to go and see it at the cinema.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

They figured out to the day, all the stars, eclipse's, rain etc. Their calender ran for 3,000 years. I may be wrong on the exact number of years, but when it ran out the planets and the sun lined up together. But and this is a big but, it is the second time their calendar has run out. So if they were still a thriving culture the calender simple starts over with day one. plain and simple nothing to worry about.|`|F32uPjAraa	If you are interested read this book. "The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" by Carl Johan Calleman, Ph.D.  Bear & Company  One Park Street  Rochester, Vermont 05767    Basically it is a different way of looking at all the major world events. Using the current calendar most of the great happenings in the world seem to have no connection, and appear to be random. If you use the Mayan Long count calendar, every things has occurred during specific epochs, or time spans. Positive things that have benefited mankind, like the invention of cursive writing, and the printing press, and more recently the internet have occurred during spans of time called days. And negative things like The dark ages, and wars occur during spans of time called nights. I cannot do justice to the brilliant writings of Carl Calleman. Read his works and you will be pleasantly surprised. This calendar does not predict the end of the world, that is just a christan invention. Incidentally, the word apocalypse does not mean the end of the world, the Original meaning is enlightenment, or awakening. Perhaps the religionists think that it means the end of the world as they know it. Any way happy reading, and have a good enlightenment.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	First, how did we get to this complicated hoax about 2012.    The whole thing began as astrologers noticed that a point called the winter solstice was crossing the Milky Way (and the Galactic equator).    Astrologers being those who believe that the sky runs our lives, decided that this "event" must mean something special. In a way, this is strange as astrologers have generally ignored the Galactic equator (being a recent invention, it was not part of the "classical" astrology).    So they made "New Age"-type predictions (a new chance for humanity, more peace, brotherly love among the nations, etc.).    Still, not much was made of it, because a lot of our Western Civilization "New Age" stuff is normally based on the Spring Equinox moving through the constellations (e.g., we are moving from the age of Pisces to the age of Aquarius).    We (western civilization) had no reason to pay attention to the Winter Solstice.  Until...    ---    Later, someone found that the Mayans had a day-count calendar that reaches a round figure on a date somewhat in the general area of the "event" (even though the "event", described above, does not happen in 2012).    And this date, in the Mayan calendar, had a direct link with the Winter Solstice. On the day we call 2012.12.21, the Mayan calendar reaches the round figure 13.00.00.00.00 in their counting system.    This is not surprising, since the day of Winter solstice was, every year, New Year's Day for the Mayans. If you are setting up a calendar with an important round figure, you fix it so that it falls on New Year's Day. Big celebration. Lots of cake.    "Well", someone thought "this must be an important date that is linked with the event we described earlier". Because of the link to the Winter Solstice. This is where Jos A. came in to the act.    So the New Age predictions started again. Except, this time, some hoaxers got into it and decided to crank up the scare factor. (Some people just love to scare others, just for the fun of it)    This is when began the lies about the Mayan calendar "ending" (it does not) or the Mayans having predicted the end-of-the-world (they did not).    From that point on, there seemed to be a contest, which I have called the Big 2012 Hoax Off, as to who could come up with the biggest boldfaced lie and still get people to believe it.    All this had begun quite some time ago but we did not hear about it until the year 2000 had passed (Y2k -- the Year 2000 end-of-civilization -- had distracted us from these other lies).    ---    Meanwhile, another group had predicted the end-of-the-world for the year 2003. You see, there was to be this Planet X coming close to us, causing earthquakes, tsunamis, even pole flips.  "Nancy L." had been told all this by some aliens from a planet around Zeta Reticuli (some star in the small constellation Reticulum).    Yeah! Right!    Charlatans associated with Nancy had a book for sale on how to survive the end-of-the-world of 2003.    Well, 2003 came and went, and many of us actually managed to survive the end-of-the-world... and we had not even bought their book.    So they revised the book, they changed the date to 2012 (already made popular by astrologers and by Jos). They added Nibiru and Nemesis (two more fictitious bodies) to their Planet X, and they created fake documentaries for YouTube and for television.    The matching 2012 "predictions" by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Egyptians and so on, were also created after 2003 (otherwise, they would have contradicted the 2003 end-of-the-world prediction).    You have to admit that the marketing is far better for 2012 than it was for 2003. A lot more people are talking about the 2012 end-of-the-world than they were about the 2003 end-of-the-world.    But it is still fake.    -----    As to why is it believe more in America?    Because some people have found a way to make money from the hoax.  And, as we have often found out in the history of capitalism, this is the land where there is a sucker born every minute.    Money is plentiful (still), and people are gullible enough to believe in boldfaced lies.    Also, a lot of the "advertisements" ends up affecting children and pre-teens who are most vulnerable.  This is because the brain accumulates information in a less logical way before puberty.  This is necessary for survival: there is so much information to store that wasting time for processing it logically would reduce one's chance of survival.    This is why, for example, religious leaders know that it is important to get the religious brainwashing down early in school.    So people (including adults who have never been taught to think logically -- that is apparently against our values here) find this information and get scared.  They need to know more.  But they do not know how to find out by themselves what is true or false, so they ask others.    Hence the questions.|`|NgUbzaF9aa	I only read questions on Y!A. I haven't really watched any documentaries on it or read any material for quite some time. Though there's nothing relatively close to w y they chose 2012 other then the Mayan calender.   It ends, that's the end of that. Do you know how many people have been predicting the end times throughout history? Hundreds even thousands of years ago? It's silly to think even now we can predict the end of humanity or this Earth.    I think it's more prevalent in America because of our gullibility. I'm not saying everybody but some majority will believe anything they are told without taking the time to study it themselves. To argue both sides is what people should really be doing, and then make a decision.    I've seen videos about "Planet X" and super-storms, but even when the Earth was young it had massive Earthquakes and hurricanes. It's much more stable now, so that's why I feel the Earth will not end for millions of years. Though I'm sure it's going to have something to do with the sun.|`|6wNbnZNKaa	it's because the aztec calendar ends in 2012, so thousands of people actually believe we're going to all die -.-

cKzfxE0Zaa	The ability of a planet to retain volatile gases is a function of three variables, not merely the two being the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.

DRVSCxKpaa	I think you might mean: "Why is Saturn less dense than water".  It's true - if you were able to get an ocean large enough, Saturn would float!  This is because Saturn is a gas giant, and most of its volume is taken up with atmospheric gasses, which are lighter than water.  Jupiter is also gas; but it is so large that its inner layers are compressed to greater than the density of water.  The other gas giants; Uranus and Neptune, are so cold that their inner sections are made of frozen gasses.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Saturn retains more gas than even Uranus does.|`|Mr6X043xaa	are you italian?

70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	The relative humidity depends not only on the amount of water vapour present in the air but also on the air temperature.The higher the temperature,the lower is the relative humidity provided the amount of water vapour remains the same.That is why the relative humidity is normally lower over the deserts and higher over the polar regions.So latitude plays an important part as the decrease of  temperature towards the poles increases the relative humidity in the same direction.Further,a coastal station will have more relative humidity than an inland station as the on-shore wind(sea breeze) brings lot of moisture towards the adjacent land area.<br>  Altitude of a place also affects the relative humidity.Cold air will hold less water vapour than warm air.So,when we go up,the temperature decreases and the capacity to hold water vapor by the air also decreases.That is why high clouds (which are above 6000 metres) like cirrus,cirrocumulus or cirrostratus are not able to produce any precipitation even though they contain some moisture which is not sufficient enough to produce the precipitation.

Take an example,if a tennis ball and a cricket ball is thrown with the same velocity,it will be easier to stop cricket ball than tennis ball,its because of their momentums as we know momentum is the amount of energy required to start motion in a stationary body or stop a moving body,<br>  But,light is just a type of energy,it sometimes behaves like a  particles  and sometimes like waves,and photons which constitues light are considered to be massless (research is going on)but  they do have momentum,so heavy mass will have more momentum|`|0jj72nn0aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqohrHcAO2b0kmr8h7TNUfbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221031840AAPZVC6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

TMB4d3FAaa	Zero Degrees has never existed as a constant in the environment for an entire day anywhere naturally on the earth.  We can now easily solve your dilemma.  If it were 10C and fell to oC We now know it fell 10C. Tomorrows temperature will fall to -10C. It will now be twice as cold in terms of the difference of the drop yesterday.  On the other hand, If it had been -10c and rose to 0c you have a 10C difference again. It was 10C below 0, tomorrow it will be twice as cold or -20C.  Changing the parameters will change the readings. With incomplete datum, any answer is possible by setting new criteria.  This is like the question," If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it does it make a sound?".  If it falls on you and kills you instantly, did it make a sound crushing you?

Unless you have a clear, dark sky without light pollution, you'll need binoculars to see the comet.<br>  <br>  Lulin is called a "backward" comet for two reasons.  One is that it orbits the sun clockwise.  All of the planets and nearly everything else in the solar system orbits the sun counterclockwise.  Most of the clockwise-orbiting objects are actually comets, including Halley's comet.<br>  <br>  The second reason is that it has an antitail pointing towards the sun, but this is an optical illusion.  The dusty part of a comet's tail is actually curved, and when viewed from the proper angle the far end of the tail seems to curve ahead of the rest of the comet.

And, of course, for the Southern Hemisphere it is the exact opposite.<br>  <br>  The slight change in distance between the Sun and the Earth has absolutely nothing to do with it.

How difficult is it for life to come into existence out of non-life.<br>  2. How unique is the Earth's environment and its environmental history in the universe and how necessary was that environmental history to the development of intelligent life (man).<br>  <br>  The first question addresses whether, given the right environment, would it be likely that life would start up anywhere?  We suspect that the answer to that question is: Very Likely.  The reason is that the more we look around the universe the more precursors to life we find.  The more we look around the Earth the more we find evidence that life on the Earth happened very soon after the Earth was created (geologically speaking).  The question of life elsewhere in our solar system is probably the most important question that all of our space exploration is aimed at answering.  We have not found any slam-dunk evidence for life elsewhere but we continue to find places where it could have developed and we continue to look.<br>  <br>  The second question addresses the nurturing of primitive life into complex organisms.  On Earth (our only example of life we currently have) it took over 3.5 billion years to come up with man; three and a half billion years where the environment on the Earth was relatively stable.  For about 3 billion of those years life was mostly single celled.  During this immense time period the environment on Earth was favorable to the continued development of life even in the face of a drastically changing solar environment.  Is it likely that such a planet would exist elsewhere in the universe?  The numbers of stars are staggering so it might seem a virtual certainty that there are “Earth-like Planets” elsewhere in the universe.   Consider this: the Earth has developed life and as far as we currently know Mars and Venus have not.  They are Earth-like planets - very similar planets to the Earth.  The answer must be more complicated than just “Earth-like planets.”<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider: our sun, Sol, has over the last 4 billion years increased its output by about 25% due to normal stellar evolution.  That is an enormous change in output and without some compensating factor the Earth, over that time period, would have gone from an ice ball to a barren Venus like planet.  It didn't- but we don't know what the factor or factors were that maintained such a constant environment.  It is highly unlikely that another “Earth-Like Planet” would have a continuously nurturing environment over a multi-billion year span.<br>  <br>  Now consider the likelihood of the Earth receiving visits from aliens.  The chances of alien life forms visiting us come down to three additional questions.  One addresses the spatial problem and one the temporal problem.  The third addresses actual travel possibilities.<br>  <br>  1. If a technologically sophisticated life form did develop elsewhere in the universe would it be likely that they would be contemporaneous with man when he is also technologically sophisticated. <br>  2. Is it likely that a technologically sophisticated life form could develop near enough to us so that they could reasonably visit the Earth?<br>  3. Does there really exist a “new physics” that would allow travel over immense distances in reasonable times?<br>  <br>  When alien extraterrestrial life is considered what we usually referred to is: technologically sophisticated life.  We aren’t usually talking about bacteria or worms or even Homo Erectus visiting the Earth.  Humans have been technologically sophisticated for only about 100 years with radio communications and rockets. Our first satellite to orbit another body was only 42 years ago. That is 100 years out of a total history for the Solar System of 4,500,000,000 years and of 13,500,000,000 years for the universe.  The chances of a second life form becoming technologically sophisticated and also overlapping in time with man- also being technologically sophisticated seem vanishing small.  Alien civilizations may have come into being, developed and become extinct hundreds of millions of years before or after Earth’s man became technologically sophisticated.<br>  <br>  The problem of travel is also daunting.  With all of our present sophistication we do not have the ability to travel to even the nearest star.  The development of super-sophisticated intelligent extraterrestrial life capable of traveling to nearby stars would first require a nurturing environment existing for billions of years and then the development of science and technology far beyond ours. Put all together- that in itself is very, very, very unlikely.  For intelligent life to happen a second time NEAR enough to our star, Sol, so travel would be possible is vanishingly unlikely.  In talking about alien visitors to Earth there is an implied uncovering of a ‘new physics’ that would allow what our present physics does not allow- travel over large distances in reasonable time frames.  It may be that that physics does not exist.  If you indulge in new physics then you are opening yourself up to creating a fantasy world that may not exist in reality<br>  <br>  Man presently might have the technology and ability to send a man to Neptune.  At the speed of 50,000 miles per hour we would need to provide life support to the astronauts for several years.  It would take 6.4 years at 50,000 mph to go to Neptune – one way.  Now consider the NEAREST star.  At a speed of 1,000,000 miles per hour it would take 2,885 years just to get there AND that is only to the nearest star!<br>  <br>  Unless there really is a new physics unknown to man there is essentially no way for aliens to visit the Earth.  If you accept physics as we know it- then there are too few nearby stars for there to be a high probability for the development of technologically sophisticated life forms.  <br>  <br>  Consider this: if the sun were about the size of a golf ball, 1 inch in diameter, the closest approach between Earth and Mars would be about four and a half feet and the orbit of Neptune would be 300 feet away.  At that scale the NEAREST star would be 461 MILES away.|`|30a4ee65246d549232fafd90921ce359aa	This is a much debated topic.<br>  <br>  A good discussion and description of possibilities is in the link|`|AA10943329	yes it does exist but not necessarily in the form of little green men.

If you really want to go back to basics and look at Americans, you can also cite Benjamin Franklin, who discovered that lightning is a form of electricity, and Joseph Henry, who discovered electromagnetic self-inductance.

Fluoxetine (Sarafem) is used to relieve the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, including mood swings, irritability, bloating, and breast tenderness. Fluoxetine is in a class of medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

X4EBNoNUaa	well the 50% NaOH is equal to 12.5 M and the 20% is equal to 5 M.<br>  It will take less volume of the higher percentage NaOH to neutralize a given amount of acid than it will for the lower percentage  because you have 2.5 X more OH in the 50% solution. I do not know what you will be neutralizing but those strengths of base are really high. To put it on an equal basis...The 50% neutralizes 2.5 times more acid per unit volume than the 20%. If the price of the 50% is less than 2.5 times that of the 20%..it would be cheaper to use the higher concentration assuming you can buy the amount necessary with very little left over.

And you are, I hope planning on an advanced degree.  It's pretty hard to find anyone who is going to hire you if you don't get one.

Anyway, it was actually the first professonal registry for Entomologist, the advantages of being registered is that you are recognized as a professional, and your credentials cannot be challenged in court.  If you aren't registered, you are examined by the other side with you basically having to prove you know what you are doing.

One of the people in running or working at the farm is a woman named Rebecca Wilson.  She should be able to answer your questions.  I've only met her once, so I feel uncomfortable giving you her email address, so just tell here you found it on the internet and UT website:    rwilson8@utk.edu    If that doesn't work: fac@utk.edu

3pEFEmSCaa	ok - so I'm assuming this is A-level (if you're in the UK), or the equivalent if you're in L'America or something....  so we will presume you do not need to account for end-corrections (which would be degree-level).<br>  <br>  so: for an open pipe we can have oscillations set up at integral numbers of half-wavelengths - i.e. half a wave, a whole wave, one-and-a-half-waves, two waves etc.<br>  <br>  we normally write this as L = nλ / 2 , where n is any integral number 1,2,3 etc, and λ is the wavelength of the oscillation.<br>  <br>  so, first we work out the wavelength.<br>  <br>  now, the general notation is that the first mode of oscillation (n=1) is called the fundamental, the first harmonic is n=2, and following on therefore the third harmonic is at n=4.<br>  <br>  as such we have four half-waves fitting into the length of the pipe, with each half-wave measuring 1.5m<br>  <br>  using L = nλ/2 , with L=6m and n=4, we rearrange to find:<br>  <br>  λ = 2L/n = 2(6m)/4 = 3m<br>  <br>  use v = f?λ and rearrange to find the frequency<br>  <br>  i.e. f = v / λ = <br>  <br>  ermm i don't have a calculator to hand, but it will be 344 / 3, so approximately 115 Hz.<br>  <br>  if you want to *see* a visual representation of this go to play with this funky java applet at <a href="http://www.physics.smu.edu/~olness/www/05fall1320/applet/pipe-waves.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.physics.smu.edu/~olness/www/0...</a><br>  <br>  it will only take 2 mins of your time and should *really* help you to understand it.<br>  <br>  really - do go look at it - you will do much better to understand these things than to get random people on Y!A to answer your homework questions for you!  (and i just spent easily 5mins explaining this for you, so you'll still be *at least* 3mins in credit!)<br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  I looked up the end-correction, 'cos to be honest i'd forgotten the exact details!<br>  <br>  the wave is reflected *slightly* beyond the outside of the pipe.  How much depends on the diameter.<br>  <br>  for each open end, the reflection takes place at a distance of 0.6 x the radius of the pipe.<br>  <br>  so for your pipe you have 0.6 x 4cm = 2.4cm beyond the end of the pipe.  this is at each end, so you effectively have a pipe of length 6m + 0.024m + 0.024m = 6.048m<br>  <br>  substitute L = 6.048m into the above calculation instead of the original 6m and you will have your end corrections accounted for.<br>  <br>  Voila!<br>  <br>  *surely* that's worth a best answer now eh?  =]<br>  <br>  oh, and go look at this page - <a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/flutes.v.clarinets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/flutes.v....</a> - if ya wanna read up on it.  is all very informative.<br>  <br>  .
b9906294d88c8e875c10481120cf0286aa	Even though I am a paranormal Investigator  and even though i have seen  a few ghosts, I am very skeptical of things. First feelings are not a  very good indicator that anything is wrong I grew up with a mother who let her feelings run amuk and it was very  hard growing up because if I had plans to do something and my mother had a bad feeling about that event, I was not allowed to go, because she just could not ignore her feelings. Some places can give a spooky feeling for many reasons. I used to work security in a mansion that was being converted into a fancy, expensive restaurant and it had no locks and was huge and had some parts that the lights did not work but I had to go unarmed and search the building several times a night.  Just being alone in an old mansion with hundreds of thousands of dollars of Silver ware and other items was spooky enough than it was unlocked and anyone could enter at anytime without my knowledge but I did not let my imagination go wild. I did find people in there from time to time in the dark rooms. Nothing paranormal just ignorance on the owners.<br>  <br>  I tell that because just being in an old mansions by oneself at night can stir up spooky feelings. It also had many unidentifiable noises I never could track down but I knew it was just the house itself. As a paranormal investigator who had my own team I noticed at supposedly and real haunted locations my team members would have weird feelings, sadness, anger, ety intrepreted these things as ghosts or demons. I noticed nothing had no feelings and could not convince my members it was nothing. There is this one spot where a massacre took place  1836 and the state built a monument where the family is buried. Many legends abound about this spot and many, many claim evil spirits are there. I have been visiting this spot for 9 years and never, never once saw or felt anything but peace. It is a family cemetery and the people buried there died a tragic death were good people and no reason why there  should be any evil there. People just let their feelings control them. <br>  <br>  Now to get to your question, I lived in one house that was haunted for sure and I was a skeptic and unbeliever but this old man appeared to me and screamed at me to get out of his house. He vanished that is how I knew I was living in a haunted house. That is also when I found out ghosts do exist.<br>  <br>  Read this article about  how to tell if your house is haunted <br>  <a href="http://www.ghostweb.com/hhome.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ghostweb.com/hhome.html</a>|`|12ALGqtdaa	Sage your basement... If you don't know how... Buy a sage bundle at any specialized store (meaning Native American... Pagan... Hippie etc.) Get a small plate or bowl to hold underneath the sage bundle, light the bundle and let the smoke from it go into the air (including corners and doorways) and say out loud "You are not welcome here, you do not belong here, leave now." Be forceful in what you are saying (not yelling by any means). This should help, I've saged a lot of times in my life (Grew up in New England and it's haunted out the yin-yang) and I've always had wonderful results.

Have him check the wiring in the basement area. If your house is 100 years old, then most likely the wiring is not updated properly to carry the load and the insulation is allowing allowing a higher then normal emf rate. High emfs cause paranoia, visual and audible hallucinations, an ill feeling and sometimes physical rashes. Also animals are more sensitive to the electrical charges, so that could be a reason your cat freaked.<br>  <br>  If it is only that room I do not think you have anything to worry about.

DoEUlpadaa	It is a lot of physical work and it's not a typical 9-5 job.  Cows calve 24/7.  Fence always needs repaired.  And crops need planted or harvested weather pending...this means you could be in the field at 1 a.m. You could be hauling grain to the city in the middle of the night just to be first in line for the next day.  And don't forget about break downs and flat tires.  It pays very little, but the work is very rewarding for the right kind of person;)  You can find job listings in the back of most farming magazines.  Most of them provide housing, but you pay for your own utilities, minus water...that is usually well water.  Expect to make $7-9 per hour...and again, no time scheduled work days.  Over time will be seasonal and generally no time and a half pay.  This really needs to be a persons passion, or use it as a learning experience for your future.  But you are correct, life is much more simple on the farm.  Ppl (and animals) don't care how many material items you own, dress doesn't matter, and they don't care what you drive.

It absorbs the longer wavelengths (reds) better than it absorbs shorter wavelengths (blues) but it does not absorb them very strongly.<br>  <br>  Water usually LOOKS clear, because you're not looking through much of it.  If you were to dive even a few tens of feet under the ocean, you'd notice that everything looks a bit blue, because the water above you has absorbed less of the blue light than of the rest of the spectrum.<br>  <br>  Just look at the waters around tropical islands.

Just very weak blue. You usually don't realize it unless you have been in a nuclear power plant where they keep some stuff in >10m deep water.

And when the sun sets, it's not blue anymore either.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the ocean does not look blue no matter what the sky is.

It didn't just spit out planets and stars and people.  The first stars probably took millions of years to form, planets later, people much much later.  You do have a lot of misconceptions about science - I recommend taking a few classes in astronomy and biology.  That's really the best way to not sound ignorant - there's far too much you'll miss trying to do it all yourself, especially if it's all through asking questions on sites like this.

Quantum physics and the properties of matter and antimatter are quite fascinating both on a theological level and a scientific level.  Basically, matter can appear in a vacuum and spontaneously be destroyed, and this matter that appears and destroys its self with complete efficiency is called matter and antimatter.  Further, this matter and antimatter is caused by a phenomenon known as vacuum fluctuations, and zero point energy which is explained by the uncertainty principle.<br>  <br>  Very very confusing stuff.  I would suggest you either get a degree in quantum physics or subscribe to a religion to fully answer your question.  <br>  <br>  Why do humans have to have a purpose?  Why can our purpose not be simply to live and be happy and to embrace the immense and beautiful fortune of our world?<br>  <br>  Steven Hawking has written some truly illuminating books on this and similar subjects.  So has Aristotle.  Good luck!|`|MxezQ5rmaa	I just went cross-eyed.

7uFaB8QQaa	Lets assume the cylinder (piston) contains an ideal gas and that the pressure of that gas remains a constant no matter what the cylinder volume is.    Now the volume of the cylinder of a fixed radius a, is    V =pi*a^2*z  where z is the height of the cylinder.  So work done by expanding or contracting the cylinder is    dW = d(pV) = pdV = p*pi*a^2*dz  where p = pressure = constant    Since the gas is ideal    pV = nRT -->  pdV = nRdT  where n = moles of gas and R = Universal gas constant    Now teh cylnder raises a person of mass m a distance z0.  The work done is:    W = mgz0   where g = acceleration due to gravity    So  W = mgz0 = p(V1 - V0) = p(pi*a^2*z0) = nR DT    DT = temperature change in gas  -->  DT = mgz0/(nR)    Clearly the gas has to heat up for the cylinder to expand 4 m.  So heat flows into the cylnder and you need to provide mgz0 Joules of energy.    If you now lower the cylinder to z1 (z1     W = p*(V2 - V1) = p*(pi*a^2*(z1-z0))  = mg(z1-z0) = nR DT1    Note that z1 - z0     DT1 = mg(z1-z0)/(nR)    Now let's pick some dimensions.  Suppose we use 10 mole of gas (n = 10) and the initial temperature is 280 K.  Further, we don't want the piston to get too hot so make DT = 50 K. Finally we let  p = 1 atmospheres = 10^5 pascals.  So then the cylinder radius is      p(pi*a^2*z0) = nR DT --->  a = sqrt(nR DT/(p*pi*z0)) = 5.7 cm    a =

Well, Jupiter fails that because of the Trojan asteroids.    It does go to show, however, that science is not a bunch of facts to memorize--they are concepts that have evidence to support them. In otherwords, it doesn't matter that we call Pluto a planet, a dwarf planet or a jar of mayo--it is still what it is.
Gnfc4wRlaa	Nothing is going to happen in 2012 any more than any other year.  I have watched the 2012 Doomsday program on the Hysteria Channel.  If you pay attention and listen carefully, you will hear all the "weasel words" like "may be", "could", etc.  The entire program was done that way. Their "experts" didn't actually say that anything was going to happen. They didn't give any actual Bible verses to support their theory, and all the Nostradamus "quotes" weren't what he actually wrote. They were what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted. He never mentioned 2012.  Watching this program just confirmed what I already knew, that the whole 2012 hype is a silly scare tactic being promulgated to sell books.    There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years.   It is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  They didnt predict the end of the world, it was only the end of that cycle.  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar.   Galactic Alignment  There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.  Asteroid Apophis - the 2001 alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.  Polar Shift - the magnetic poles are moving all the time.  Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we cant predict when they will occur again.    Passage through a "photon belt" has been added. This is also untrue and wouldn't hurt us if it were. Photons are merely units of light.  Solar flares happen all the time and we have more of them at some times than others. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|OGw6Upv8aa	no.    are you listening to stupid ppl again? or just being unusually gullible today?    rumours? give me a break!|`|Lsz5Nqw7aa	i know the mayan civilisation in mexico had a reason for 2012, think it was something to do with them building pyramids for the years ahead, but they stopped at 2012...   but no, i don't think the world will end then... i've given up believing any of those predictions!! :)|`|7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	The fact is no one knows for sure.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

However that is not the furthest we can see. In 1964 two astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered 'The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.' The fossil remains of the Big Bang, this earned them the Nobel Prize in 1978. Since the discovery the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation has been mapped.

UFteXlqwaa	What a strange question!<br>  ... Okay, if the geo-potential height at 500 hPa (sorry, it is now called hectoPascal!) is high, it means that it is a low pressure. So, what is the atmosphere in a low pressure?<br>  <br>  Well, the temperature at 500 hPa is colder than the surrounding because rising air cools down adiabatically. But, at the surface, there is always warm and moist air. So, what the right answer? I don't know.<br>  <br>  Is the wind light? It can be but usually, low pressures are associated with stronger winds than high pressure so, we'll forget that one.<br>  <br>  Is there plenty of moisture? ... What does that mean? Relative or absolute humidity? A low pressure doesn't have more absolute humidity than a high pressure but yes, the relative humidity is very high in a low pressure, mostly 100 percent or, at dew point temperature very near the ground; especially in the warm sector of a frontal low.<br>  <br>  So, I don't know what to say because I don't know what the question mean by "below 500 hPa." Is it at the surface or just below, like say 5,000 meters?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you understand better the question than I do and you can figure out the right answer from what I gave.

WxWLC9yDaa	This is my favorite thing about investigating.. learning the land.. well that and catching something...     Research the area and land at the local property appraisers... if you do not know the physical address look at a nearby address and then move the map around until you locate it. Usually the county records like this will have the name of the cemetery.    From there go to news papers or even google the cemetery name. Also look and see if you can find any markers with names and look for anything on them.    I would be glad to lend you some assistance...as stated I absolutely love this and being a history teacher it keeps up my skills.  feel free to contact me if you like my profile has all the info.|`|YUAp3pXDaa	If you Google or Yahoo the address, it will likely give you the name of the location.

CzBNTeLAaa	No, because there are different subspecies of giraffe, which are mainly all lumped together into one group. On the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) their status is "LC" (least concerned).<br>  <br>  The subspecies having the most potential of being in danger is the reticulated giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulate) and another African species (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta). Also the (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) giraffe population in Uganda is very small (445).|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	Unfortunately, this animal is being killed by poachers.

NbdTgyLPaa	First calculate the distance the vehicle travels while it's breaking to a stop.  Let<br>  v = initial velocity, 25.0 m/s<br>  a = breaking acceleration, 3.75 m/s<br>  s = distance traveled during the breaking<br>  Then<br>  v = sqrt(2as)<br>  v^2 = 2as<br>  s = v^2/2a<br>  s = (25.0 m/s)^2/[2(3.75 m/s^2)]<br>  s = (625 m^2/s^2)/(7.5 m/s^2)<br>  s = 250/3 m (approximately 83.3 meters)<br>  <br>  So the driver must apply the breaks at that point or earlier.  The total distance is 95 meters, so the distance that can be traveled is 95 m - 250/3 m.  Since at that time the vehicle is moving at 25.0 m/s, we can divide to find the time, that is let<br>  d = maximum distance possible to travel before safely applying the breaks, in this case 95 m - 250/3 m = 285/3 m - 250/3 m = 35/3 m<br>  v = 25.0 m/s as before<br>  t = maximum reaction time before applying the breaks<br>  then<br>  v = d/t<br>  t = d/v<br>  t = (35/3 m) / (25.0 m/s) <br>  t = 7/15 seconds<br>  or approximately 0.467 seconds

zy4CMYSUaa	Your house could possibly be haunted.<br>  <br>  Do you have a voice recorder? you can try using EVP (Electronic voice phenomena). Record a few minutes of silence and play it back to see if you can hear anything. The better the recorder, the better quality you will get.<br>  <br>  Someone DOESN'T have to die in a house for it to be haunted. It could be someone who lived there, however did not die there and loved the house so much so they linger there. It could be someone from years ago who died on that land or you can bring in items such as antiques that are haunted. Spirits can also follow you from a cemetery.<br>  <br>  But it is important to not be afraid and understand that a ghost is a person who most likely wants to be recognized or noticed. Try asking things like "I know who you are" and try to make contact with it. Also tell it things like "move into the light" or "I won't hurt you, I understand" <br>  The things you described are all ghostly activity. <br>  <br>  Maybe you could try taking pictures as well. If one or two orbs, vapour trails, unknown lights (energy lights) appear in the picture it could be manifestation of a ghost. I would personally use a high quality digital camera for this. <br>  <br>  good luck ;)<br>  <br>  EDIT: as for the black thing, there is a type of ghost manifestation called 'Shadow People'. These ghosts usually appear as a smudge or fog over an image. They are usually seen out of the corner of ones eye and can see and react with people.<br>  We have theorized that perhaps their darkness mayb be just an indicator of their lack of progression into the light - unaware of where they are, having unfinished business or afraid to move on|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	it could be, but unless it starts telling you to leave the house it probable is fine|`|m8wMKhOoaa	it could be a haunting but there are other things that may be going on. one thing for with the computer and tv thing is it could be electric problems or it could be a haunting. doors swinging open at random times could be the wind, there may be plumbing problems and you dog staring into space could be that he/she smells something or heard something. it could possibly be that its a haunting. if these things keep happening and more things happen i would suggest you call in a paranormal team (TAPS) to come and investigate it and tell you whats happening. good luck(:<br>  <br>  edit: you may also want to do research on the house and see what past events have occured in it|`|FgWx0hfPaa	call the tv show 'a haunting' from discovery channel they help you.|`|ANNeg6Voaa	I have been in your shows people said I was crazy then it all stopped thank god it was creepy.

ossCVxPqaa	Methane gas, which is a fuel, is produced in septic tanks, so it would be possible to use it as a car fuel.   Is it a practical idea to do this? I doubt it because the collection, purification of the gas, removal of CO2, H2S,etc, would be too expensive in view of he small amount of mehane produced.  One of the successful uses of methane from waste is the harvesting from land fill sites and burning the methane gas in boilers for steam generation.  Methane is also collected from digesters on farms from animal waste, where the concentrtaions are much higher than in a domestic situation.|`|8dffbce3266bc6eb44bbe27559482b26aa	Possible, but costly.

Heonb5DDaa	The exact injury mechanism that causes whiplash injuries is unknown. A whiplash injury may be the result of impulsive stretching of the spine, mainly the ligament: anterior longitudinal ligament which is stretched or tears, as the head snaps forward and then back again causing a whiplash injury.    Whiplash may be caused by any motion similar to a rear-end collision in a motor vehicle, such as may take place on a roller coaster or other rides at an amusement park, sports injuries such as skiing accidents, other modes of transportation such as airplane travel, or from being hit, kicked or shaken. Shaken baby syndrome can result in a whiplash injury.

So during its journey in the inner solar system it is traveling a lot faster than it is further away from our neighborhood.

For example:  it is 20 below zero and a child freezes at the bus stop or the back roads have a very low visibility due to blowing and drifting or black ice.....if the bus was to cause an accident or just be a victim of one the school becomes liable.  The rules have changed dramatically with the legal system.  It seems more people want to sue someone or something for any reason valid or not.

Ice creates broken bones.    Unless the school has grit (and lots of it with the rate it's going), they should close.. But thats all depending on the circumstances really.    You should be able to tell by looking and feeling whether a school is fit to be open. If you're slipping around everywhere then it is obviously not safe and should close for the day.    Also if nearby roads are too icey then schools close sometimes, because it is hard for people to get there.|`|EtWsBnZHaa	Schools are subject to the Health and Safety at Work Act. Teachers and pupils walk outside, between school buildings and teachers have to supervise pupils at break and lunchtimes. It is virtually impossible to stop pupils snowballing and this is a potential danger. Schools may then be liable for not ensuring as far as is practicable, the safety of the pupils.The headteacher, or governors are directly responsible.    Around 50% of all legal action involving solicitors of professional organisations of teachers involves falling, tripping or slipping. All of this can cost a lot of money in compensation which is why schools have to be cautious. In addition, many employees may not be able to make it to school on tme or at all.    Most members of the public who work indoors and never have to move outside in poor weather or supervise children do not realise the potential dangers posed to pupils and staff. No-one would deliberately put themselves at risk of falling and injuring themselves. We live in a blame culture, but it is probably better that we are all covered by the H&S at work act.

OXsRXLx1aa	Well you know how an electromagnet is formed right? Electricity goes through coils of wire that make metal a magnet (thanks to the connections between magnetism and electrical current).<br>  <br>  It works backwards too; if you have an electromagnet, and pass a second coil of wire nearby, it will pick up some of that magnetism and generate a current. Assuming you have a very resistant wire, the current cannot pass through it so easily so it resists the motion through the magnetic field!<br>  <br>  So if a roller coaster had some of these coils of wire in it, and passed by a bunch of electromagnets on the track, it could be slowed down using this technology (and because you don't have to have the magnets touching each other for the effect to occur, they last a very long time!)<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can use the current generated by the secondary coil of wires to charge a battery in the roller coaster cars to provide power for safety or monitoring equipment. They already use this technology for this in a number of other locations involving wireless energy transfer. (Check out my sources for some of these)

When the materials enter the blow bar area, they are crushed due to the high-speed impact of the blow bar and are thrown to the impact plates on the rotor for secondary crush. Then the materials will be shot back to the blow bar again for the third crush. This process repeats until the materials are crushed to the required size and discharged from the lower part of the machine.<br>  <br>  SBM-VSI crusher (Hydraulic) ：<br>  Technological advantages:<br>  VSI crusher incorporates three crushing styles; its feeding style incoporates material on material, materials on iron and falling at sides.

2lQ8DJAcaa	The Arctic ecosystem has a unique, complex food web that is fashioned by its distinctive plankton, animal species, and environmental factors. Carbon also cycles through the web from atmosphere to seawater and back. Phytoplankton and algae take up carbon dioxide from seawater and transform it into the organic carbon of their tissue. Then it flows through successive levels of eating animals that convert their prey’s carbon into their own tissues or into sinking fecal pellets. Along the way, some carbon dioxide escapes back to the atmosphere through the organisms' respiration.|`|PwiKEVGQaa	Yes the artic is an ecosystem.

7AnSi7g1aa	if the stagecoach traveled 40 miles in 5 hours that means that it traveled 8 miles per hour (just do 40 divided by 5).  Then the speed was increased by 4 miles per hour and she travels 8 miles per hour, so add 4 miles to 8 miles (which equals 12 miles per hour).  Then you have 12 miles over 1 hour (as a rate) or you can say 1 hour over 12 miles.  Since you need to find out how long it would take to travel 36 miles, 1 hour will be over 12 miles.  Then you simply multiply 1 hour over 12 miles by 36 miles.  Then you have 36 over 12 and lastly you divide 36 by 12 and you have your answer 3 hours.  I hope this helped!  Good Luck!|`|RhPTJITUaa	1.

lKXLaJ0Taa	If you are referring to crystal meth, it is a methamphetamine.  These drugs are adrenergic stimulants.  They will increase blood pressure, heart rate, force of contraction of the heart, cardiac output, and will also increase the risk of developping arrhythmias and in someone who is suffering from angina or other heart problems, it can have very serious consequences, like a heart attack, etc.  This drug also crosses the blood brain barrier and has effects on the brain, which is what makes it addictive.  The drug is supposed to have a multitide of  effects on the brain including short attention span (unless you suffer from ADD/ADHD), decrease sleep, but can cause psychoses in some people who take it often.  It can also cause changes in memory and cause stimulation of the sympathetic response.  Good points are, if you're healthy and you've got a lunatic with an uzi chasing you, some amphetamines will help you run faster, fight harder, seem stronger, feel less tired until the effects wear off.

7HKTDcvYaa	We avoid repeating some crops year after year because that crop requires heavy feeding of some nutrients, and we get disease and insect infestation. But when we use a crop that is a perennial such as hay, or trees, shrubs, we go right on using the same soil for up to a century with the same crop. The crop in this case has to grow and produce based on the combination of  soil provided nutrients and top dressing.<br>  <br>  Hay crops, when fed all the manure from the animals eating the hay do not decline in productivity, and they maintain tilth of the soil over decades. <br>  <br>  Corn, grown year after year and fertilized for optimum production and with stover left on the field is one of the few crops that will actually maintain carbon content of the soil. We avoid doing this for prolonged periods almost entirely because we get a buildup of disease and insects. But to control insects and disease one needs to rotate a whole county at a time. Rotating to adjacent fields does not work. Rotating, but leaving volunteer plants growing does not work.<br>  <br>  Planting a crop that provides a lot of fibrous roots does improve the soil tilth, but many of the crops that do this still do not maintain soil carbon content, and so do not maintain ion exchange capacity.<br>  <br>  So, it takes more than just rotating crops, but a careful engineering of the crop rotation to get really good results.|`|AA12007810	Each plant - during its growth secretes specific biochemicals from the roots. These are specific to stage of the crop. These biochemicals can be anti-nutritional, antagonists, or beneficial to various crops.

AA6Aq94vaa	The evidence for dinosaurs is pretty damned strong. millions of fossils of thousands of species have been identified.  Radiometric dating puts them between 220 and 65 million years ago (depending on the fossil)   People who say that dinosaurs are leading you away from God have little or no knowledge of science. Science makes no statements about the existence of God. You can still accept science and believe in God.|`|8cDd70dSaa	Haha! Seriously? Loads of scientific evidence and you still think it's not real?

The evidence demonstrates the most probable explanation is their existence and, should you happen to believe in a deity, that's part of the way they decided to create things.    Should that aspect of the creation of the planet not be to somebody's liking, then they should address any complaints or suggested improvements to the Manufacturer(s) of the planet, and seek to instruct their god(s) on how to do things correctly.|`|l5O6CTzJaa	Based on some of your other questions I think you are just trolling...|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Dinosaurs did indeed exist...they died out 65 million years ago.

It is *vital* to remember that *no* field or discipline of science can comment on God in any way at all!  God, if He exists, is a *supernatural* phenomenon; He can obey or bypass the "natural" laws of physics as He wishes. Since science can only use those laws to investigate things, it is not possible to investigate God through science.  Science essentially *ignores* the possible involvement of God when performing experiments and forming theories.  (remember that many scientists believe in some form of God)|`|wlOUQIRjaa	Go to the nearest natural history museum and stand underneath one of the skeletons. Pretty compelling, eh?

AA10335036	There's a good description in ref. 1. It's the radiation emitted by a hot body, and spreads across the spectrum continuously, as distinguished by emission lines which occur a particular wavelengths.  The graphs in ref. 2 show the general idea of the shape of the emission spectrum, and show how the wavelength of maximum emission shifts with temperature.|`|xbma9SuWaa	Everything radiates heat.  If you wanted to measure the heat radiation from a wall for instance your reading would be incorrect.  This is becasue you are measuring the heat radiation from the wall as well as all other radiation from the room (other than the wall) that is bouncing off of the wall (color etc.).  If you truly want to measure the temparture you would need an object that did not reflect other radiation back at you.  Hence you would need something that is truly black.  Which means that it doesnt refelct any light.  This is called a black body.   Now if you were to measure the radiation from this black body you would only be detecting the radiation from the body itself.  This radiation will be in the form of infrared radiation.    You need a blackbody spectrum graph to see this.    Hope that helped
eiim3tJuaa	*pet spa/groomer/boarding  *vet assistant  *petting zoo or pony rides  *pet sitter  *dog walker    Are you just looking for a PT job, or when you grow up do you want to work with animals? If the later, don't be opposed to volunteering, it's good to get as much animal experience as you can. Volunteering also looks good on resumes and applications.    http://www.seaworld.org/career-resources...  CATCH 22?  1.  To get a job working with animals, you need experience with animals. This bit of truth seems to create a frustrating circle. You need experience to get a job, but you can't get experience unless you have a job, right? Well, yes and no.     VOLUNTEER  1.  To begin a career caring for animals, you should be prepared to start with a volunteer or entry-level position. Call your nearest zoo or aquatic park and ask for details on becoming a volunteer (also called a docent or intern). Humane societies, animal rehabilitation clinics, and some veterinary clinics also welcome volunteers. Although your duties with a humane society or veterinary clinic will most likely involve working indirectly with animals (cleaning cages and preparing food), volunteer duties at a zoo or aquatic park range from filing or answering phones to being trained to make educational presentations or feed newly hatched birds.    Volunteering your time shows that you're serious about your commitment to animals. Develop a reputation for being an eager, cooperative, hard-working person, and your volunteer effort may help you get a job in the future. Supervisors are often asked to give character references for volunteers who've worked for them.    http://www.sandiegozoo.org/jobs/keeper_f...  What are some other ways to gain animal experience?    Some places to look for volunteer jobs or internships might be:      ? Veterinary offices      ? Animal training classes (does your dog need obedience training?)      ? Local Humane Society      ? Local Park Service      ? Wildlife rehabilitation centers (like for wolves, bears, big cats, birds of prey, and even bats)      ? Animal shelters      ? Farms (for domestic animals, or even ostrich, llama, or butterfly farms)      ? Pet breeders (those that breed specific kinds of dogs, cats, or horses)      ?

GdSMwXLvaa	Well then how do you account for the abundance of Methane in the atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus?  Both planets are not known to harbor life as we know it.  It's the Methane which gives them both an exquisite hue of blue/green atmospheres.    Methane may, in part, account for the color of Earth's blue sky.  If so, that's great because Methane is given off by organic matter that's decaying, like compost piles and pet poop.  All mammals, humans included, give off water vapor, CO2 and methane gas as part of the respiratory process.  All 3 are greenhouse gases, and methane is 25x more potent at heating an atmosphere than CO2.

ftwGaZ4Uaa	All three together? Techno-babble. Likely stolen unethically from the movie "Event Horizon".     Space fold is the theory of controlling the dmetric of spacetime by exotic matter. Guess what: Exotic matter only exists on the paper of some scientists and fulfills the role of Unobtainium.    Gravity drive would be the technical implementation of such a science-fiction technology.    A singularity is a point or region, where a mathematical function is not defined. For example a Black hole is a singularity, as inside it, spacetime is undefined for us - a black hole has only a surface for us, but no inside.
mH1Tnv5Naa	Any one of those possible reason could be correct, as well as all of them.|`|6AIRllZfaa	Well, all of the above could have a factor.     A house that has constant melting snow, and large icicles hanging from it's eves usually indicates that the heat from the house is escaping through a poorly insulated attic. However, if the house doesn't get sun and has a low angle/flat roof, then those will also contribute to the snow building up on the roof.    As to F, less heat means less heat escaping, so that could contribute as well.     Also, what happened to E?|`|DN5zSCowaa	I guess I'd have to say D.    This is like asking what color is a car?

uVJeeWHFaa	Yes. Increasing the temperature of the reaction will increase the rate at which amylase hydrolyses the starch, up to the point at which the amylase enzyme is denatured (above 60C -ish). The enzyme cannot work beyond this temperature because the bonds holding the protein enzyme together are broken at high temperatures and the protein structure is crucial to it's function.  Increasing temperature means that the molecules move faster and so there are more interactions between the amylase and the starch.    Hope this answers your question.

Gnfc4wRlaa	No, without the axial tilt, we would not have seasons.  Our seasons are caused by the tilt.  As the Earth revolves around the Sun, the 23.5 degree from the Equator lines are presented to the sun at different times in the orbit.  The hemisphere that is most directly facing the Sun experiences summer, while the hemisphere tilted so that it is less directly facing the Sun experiences winter.    "The Earth's seasons are not caused by the differences in the distance from the Sun throughout the year (these differences are extremely small). The seasons are the result of the tilt of the Earth's axis."    The summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs when the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north of the Equator, is directly facing the sun (the Sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer).  That makes it warmer in the Northern Hemisphere.    At the spring and fall equinoxes, the Sun is directly over the Equator and the hours of daylight and darkness are equal (12 hours each).    The winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.  The Sun is directly over the Tropic of Capricorn.  The Enchanted Learning site shows a good diagram of this.|`|wlOUQIRjaa	Your intuition is correct. If the Earth's axis was perfectly orthogonal to it's orbit, we would have no seasons.|`|2teJ2BgIaa	No tilt, no seasons.  Earth's orbit is an ellipse, so we will be closer to the sun during part of the year.  That would lead to a mini seasonal difference, but nothing like we have now with our 23 tilt.    Precession will give us summer in January in the northern hemisphere in 13,000 years.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	We would just BARELY have seasons, because of the elliptical orbit of the earth.  We are at perihelion (nearest to the sun) sometime in January, so that would be the middle of our "Summer," in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Six months later, at aphelion (the furthest point from the sun), it would be the middle of Winter.    Please note that these "seasons" would be MUCH milder -- in both directions -- than the ones we currently experience because of the tilt of the earth's axis.
