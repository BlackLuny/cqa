l0uJlMaWaa	Saving more for retirement is never really a bad idea but there are a few things that you will want to consider.    The power of compounding is amazing as I am sure you are aware.  The more money you put in, and the longer it has to grow, the more likely your money will grow along with its earnings and its earnings earnings.    You just want to make sure that any money you are putting into your 401k is money that you WILL NOT use until retirement.  The reason for this is that any money you pull out you will pay taxes on and typically before age 59.5 you will pay a penalty.  For some people this total tax bill can be almost half of what they withdraw depending on their income tax bracket.  While it seems like a good idea to put all of your savings into a 401k you need to look a few years ahead.  Is there any reason why you may want to pull the money out (house, car, education, etc)?  If so, you are better off putting the money into a non-retirement account such as a savings account or individual mutual fund.      Definitely put as much as you can into the account but also realize that you will not be using this money for a LONG time.|`|ww12lItvaa	Because it is not that simple.    You could have said the same thing 10 years ago, and many people did but almost every dollar you invested in the last ten years has lost money as the market has fallen to a value equal to 10 years ago.     You might have the "buy low" part figured out but most of the money is made with the "sell high" part.      What will you use to know to pull your money out of stocks and put it in the money market to miss something like this 50% fall we have had in the S&P 500?      What is your sell strategy?|`|TOPJybbsaa	Young working adults should invest the maximum amount allowed by law in their 401K. The employer usually contributes a share, and the money goes in before taxes. It's also a good idea to maximize the investment in a Roth IRA.     And if you want a chance at an IPO, usually available only to the wealthy, take a look at the URL below. It costs nothing to look, and it may be a great opportunity with a very small investment.|`|Vh49zJjyaa	Should young adults double the investment amount in the 401K? Yes they should. Why they don't do it? It's hard to say, everybody lives different lives, some people want to save for a house, so they'll cut the contributions and move the extra money to savings. Some young adults want to just party and worry about retirement later.    Everybody has different reasons in how much they want to contribute. It's up to them. You can preach all you want but it's up to them whether or not they want to do it or not.    I used to contribute 15% to my 401K, then I got a house, so I don't contribute to as much as I used to. Again, people have different agendas. For those who like to party and not save for retirement, you're only young once.

They CANNOT charge you for replacing the flooring in the entire apartment for one small damaged area. They can ONLY charge to replace the damaged area.

They must provide you with receipts and can only charge actual cost.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Well, if you withhold rent you will lose your deposit, as you violated the lease, AND you will still have to pay them back, as they will win that in court.    If you were a manager before you know this is a stupid idea and will cause you to have an eviction on your record, even if you were not literally evicted.    If the vinyl is one continuous piece you have to replace the whole thing, you can not spot repair it.    You should not have to pay for a black light test, it does not really cost anything.   The test will show up if you pissed on the carpet, or allowed someone else to do so.   Unless you are in this habit (you would be surprised how many people allow children and pets to piss on the floor)  you have nothing to worry about.    Do take pictures, but keep in mind not everything photographs, and judges know this.    When I go to court over the piss issue I literally bring a piece of the carpeting in, as piss shows up in the backing and the actual carpet proves my point.    Also, ask for a walk thru before you leave and obtain a signed copy.    This will cover most major issues, floor, walls, windows, counter tops, etc.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Don't stop paying rent or they will file eviction and have you out in about 10 days and you will have an eviction on your record.

The good news is that it can be fixed (at least until the credit card "reforms" go in next year) easily by applying for a fee-based credit card for newcomers.    Some places to start with are First Premier, Tribute, or Orchard.    However, with new laws going in in 2010, these will become very hard to get, as Congress forbids credit card companies to issue these type of cards anymore.

K45ZTwryaa	You do not have to work on any particular area to pass the Bar exam.  The mandatory classes for law school coupled with a reputable bar exam preparation class will ensure you pass the Bar exam, and state bar exams and the multi-state Bar exam do not distinguish how you scored in specific areas of law.<br>  <br>  Law school elective classes will often include courses in specific areas of criminal law, many which are often taught by adjunct professors that are practicing criminal law attorneys or judges.  While you should strive to get in the best law school possible and graduate at the top of your class and on law review because it is, generally speaking, a very competitive hiring market, making high marks in such elective courses can make a strong impression on your professor and establish a good rapport that could help in obtaining a criminal law attorney position (one of my professors offered to pull some strings to get me an interview with a District Attorney's office).<br>  <br>  Most law firms that interview on campus and offer summer associate (intern) positions do not offer any exposure to the practice of criminal law and in any big law firm even if they offer any exposure, it will in all likelihood be cursory and of little substance.  The summer positions you will want to look for are with government offices such as a District Attorney's, Attorney General's or Legal Aid criminal defense office.  Unfortunately these positions do not pay much, and compared to peers who will be moving on to big law firms the starting salaries in these offices are also low, but they offer the most intense, immersive exposure and training in criminal trial law for graduating lawyers.|`|MttTiUrIaa	Don't worry about the bar exam just yet.

SM0JL0yaaa	Hello Laura,<br>     I was in your position 8 years ago.  I went ahead and went to school, got my bachelors in Business Management.  I figured, every business will need a manager...whether it's a ballet school or a bank...everything is a business in one way or another, even a non-profit corporation needs to be managed!  As I was about to graduate I realized I was still not sure what I should pursue and with a job I wasn't going to earn that much money, so I went back and got my MBA!  I worked through that two year period as well so I gain work experience!  When I finished, I got a couple of years of work experience for a large corporation (corporate world) which taught me<br>  how business really works and I could learn to apply some of the lessons learned.  I wasn't crazy about my job, but I learned so much which helps me every day!<br>     As I worked I realized my passion was real estate, so I got my real estate license to begin as a "hobby" on the side.  That took off immediately and it was a natural progression into my own business.  My suggestion, while you don't have any great ideas for business or as far as a field you'd like to get into, school is the best way to go at your age and stick to a broad degree like Business Management.  It's healthy and very education to also work (you learn from good and bad work experiences so go for it!).  You will notice that you begin forming hobbies and interests as you are exposed to new ideas either at school or work and then you'll be able to pursue it.  You will have some financial backing because you'll put aside your money starting NOW ;) and the education to command respect at whatever you decide to do.  <br>     Good luck!  And don't forget...whatever you decide to do, hard work always pays off!|`|qW3V1qpWaa	Since you have a long future in front of you I would suggest that you pursue a business degree.

You would be better off to stay with a regular savings or possibly some in a CD.  They will not yield the greatest return but it would be a far more conservative investment at this time.  Down stream when we see a shift in the direction of the market and you want to test the water you may want to invest some in the Russel 2000 IWM.

Gun3UGzaaa	Don't go with first premier bank.  The upfront fee is a total ripoff.  Try with a local bank or credit union, and see if they will give you a low limit credit card.  You can even ask them about secured credit cards, where you deposit $500 in an account, and they give you a card with a $500 limit.<br>  <br>  I would also write to the credit bureaus and demand they remove the negative notation about the dental bill. Under the fair credit reporting act, you are not responsible for a debt incurred when you were under age 18, and they cannot give you a negative score as a result of that. Have them remove the score.<br>  <br>  Another way you can trick they credit scores into boosting your score is to ask an adult if they will make you an "authorized user" of one of their cards.  It links your ss# to their accounts, and lets you piggyback on their good scores.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, pay all your bills on time and it will improve over time.  <br>  <br>  The cards and loans to stay away from are the payday lending places, household finance, rent to own furniture, and store credit cards that are the kind of "buy now and get 10% off kind.".  In the credit reporting world, those kinds of debt are scored as "only desperate people take these" and hurt your credit score.|`|A66etPmAaa	the website CardLister helps people with bad credit by providing them with detailed reviews about the different credit cards along with credit card comparisons to help you pick the right one for you, and once you pick the perfect card you can apply online in a safe application.<br>  Click on the link in my source to see more about it. It's Genius!|`|MbzyriZ4aa	Open a checking account and savings account with a bank.<br>  Use your checking account wisely... never overdraw and start putting money into your savings account.<br>  <br>  Once you have about $500 in the savings account ask your bank to issue you a secured credit card that reports to the credit bureaus.<br>  They will freeze the $500 in your savings account and issue you a real credit card with a limit of $500. Don't get confused here... this card is not loaded with your $500 but a real card.<br>  <br>  Only make small purchases - maximum charge on the card during a billing cycle should not exceed $50. Pay off that $50 charge every month on time. After 8 months ask your bank to issue you a real credit card. If you handled your secured card in a responsible manner they should give you a real credit card and release the $500 in your savings account back to you.<br>  <br>  This is how you build your credit from scratch.|`|z24kXczKaa	There are several ways to establish good credit again; however not knowing more that what you've just described, all I can offer is what might help you best at this time. Banks and credit card companies are very tight when it comes to loaning money, now that the economy is so bad. I recommend borrowing your own money! What I mean is, you can deposit lets say $1000 in a saving account at a local community bank ( not the big name kind, like B of A or Chase) . Then ask the bank a week later for a $1000 loan using your savings account as security (you will get approved). Make your payments on time every month, and from time to time make an additional payment during the month (ex: two payments in one month). After making payments for one year, you can take your savings account money and pay off the balance.  Then repeat the process with another bank.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Secured credit cards are the best way to build credit.<br>  <br>  Basically you put money into a savings account and then you can get a credit card for that limit.  <br>  <br>  Usually if you make all your payments on time for a year, they graduate you to a non-secured normal card.|`|oMHjhxUXaa	I wish that people told me which ones to apply for. I had collections from work comp and a judgement against me!!<br>  First Premier Bank is awesome. I got approved when I couldn't get credit anywhere else. The only thing was that they approved me for $200- (A mastercard) and charged me a $150-processing fee so I only had $50- credit to use but it let me establish some good credit (a smaller price to pay) than 6 months and no late payments later, they offered me a second card with a $350 limit.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

There's an annual fee on "sub-prime" cards typically, and every credit card in the world is going to have over the limit fees, late charges, etc.  Your interest rate probably won't be very good either, but then again, if you use the credit card to pay for something and then pay it off completely when the bill comes in, it doesn't matter what your interest rate is, since you don't pay interest on balances that aren't carried over from month to month.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear JIm:  When you go from a Trad to Roth it is called a conversion(and you must pay tax on the conversion). If you go back to a Trad. it is called a recharacterization. When you open a Roth or convert to a Roth it is money that has been taxed. That money maybe withdrawn at any time tax free. The 5 year restriction applies to gains in the account. If that money is with drawn within 5 years and you are under 59 1/2 it is taxed and the 10% penalty is applied. <br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

If you had only bought what you could afford and paid it off in a timely manner then you would not have had to file Chapter 7. In other words you went over your means. Like my daddy always told me..." don't let your house payment be more than one paycheck that you bring home. That way you can afford to live and not be strapped. You will always have a roof over your head that way." That is what I try to live by. If you can't afford something then save to pay cash for it or you don't need it. I rent, and am unemployed at the moment and can't find work. Where is my help? My car is paid for, but I can not find work to pay my living expenses.

If a judge allowed you to file a Chapter 7, that means you have no way to pay off your debts.  If you're asking yourself if you deserved a second chance, then what was the purpose of you filing in the first place?  And besides, bankruptcy law didn't "bail you out," it totally nullified the debt.  Your creditors are out of luck, they'll have to try to collect from someone else.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Victim for sure.

If you make a really good impression, they'll remember you more, and they'll consider you above other applicants when going to fill the position.<br>  <br>  As far as a good impression, just be friendly, be prepared, stand up straight, look them in the eye (eye contact is crucial), and just be very professional.|`|SITdHSDkaa	uh... fill it in with volunteer work or things like babysitting and yard work<br>  ... put all the hours you are available... minimum wage<br>  ... a resume isn't really necessary for your first job unless you're out of college<br>  ...uh in person definitely...no one will respond to an online application...<br>  and.... tips.... wear cover up and semi dressy stuff... and act like you actually care<br>  <br>  that's basically it!|`|ckHSPoYVaa	don't leave the employment history blank: instead say u babysitting or did volunteer work. make something up that deals with the job you want. then put a # of a friend or someone in your family as your ""boss"""""<br>  <br>  say u can work any time and for the $$$ look up your job and see whats the base pay for it. this will help you get ur foot in the door. <br>  <br>   def make a resume go to monster.com or some jobs offer (on thier site) a way for you to set up your resume.<br>  <br>  def online. but it depends on the job<br>  <br>  -look your best, but dont over dress.<br>  - always make and keep EYE contact!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  - when the interview is over ask questions. this shows them u r interistedinterestedal a weakness you have and how u over come it.<br>  -<br>  <br>  ---------------------- look in to thier eyes__________EYE CONTACT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... CONTACT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|zmab07Giaa	with it being your first job and all, expecting anything above minimum wage is asking for too much. You dont need a resume if its a job at mcdonalds or starbucks lol. Smile and act like yourself, answer questions honestly|`|l4Rbb8Q5aa	Beware of work-at-home job solicitations. Almost all are scams. Get a real job. Dress neatly. Smile. Make direct eye contact with your interviewer. Be yourself.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to discuss current and future educational plans. Anticipate that you might be asked why you think you'd be a good fit for the position. Or why you selected their company to work at. <br>  <br>  Questions to ask...what opportunities are there for advancement. Are there any special training programs. How long can I expect to be considered a trainee. What happens after I am trained? If you're talking McDonalds, Wendy's etc., I don't think you have to worry too much about where you expect to be in your career in 5 years. I wouldn't think it would be your intention to build your career around a fast-food restaurant position.<br>  <br>  And if they don't hire on the spot, ask when they expect to make a decision.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  kmr|`|6C24kJhaaa	In person application is better. They actually know. Don't chew gum, be on time obviously, dress nicely, smile, dont laugh too much, stay focused, take some notes, u need to seem motivated so ask your interviewer "where can i be in 5-10 years" even if you dont plan on staying for that long. just to show commitment and a desire to achieve and level up. For your hours and availability go ahead and tell them if somedays arent good. Make sure to start a good impression and get to know eerybody around your work, makes you more likebale and a better asset to the company. For pay expectations idk it kinda depends what u r applying for. <br>  <br>  Be focused, calm, happy, follow up with small short questions (not too many) Thank them for their time and shake hands and leave.
DL8rZdIlaa	i worked in the billing department for four years with at$t...the company is terrible...so many things would be on a person bill that shouldn't be there...what at$t hopes is that some people do not notice bill "errors" and never call in...if you are having that many problems you should demand to talk to a supervisor...unfortunatly this rip off company will state that you are in a 2 year contract and can't get out of it...file complaints with any government agency that you can...for example: the better buisiness beauro, the attorney generals office, fcc, etc...if you don't get out of that contract i can assure you that you will continue to have problems every single month...good luck with that terrible company...oh yeah, they treated us employees like crap...that is untill they moved the call center i worked at to india!!!...|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Well I would call the BBB and AG office in your state and file complaints. I had a problem with sprint nextel. I got a bill for $95 worth of overage minutes. I had called the customer service number to verify when my free night started and they told me 7pm when in fact it was 9pm!  I had free incoming calls/minutes unlimited so why would I run up a bill talking to my long distance bf when he could call me back on his free minutes after 7pm??? I eventually got it taken off my bill and cancelled as soon as my contract expired. I also wrote letters to the CEO and described his employees as complete morons who needed to go back to kindergarten and learn thier numbers!<br>  <br>  Bottom line is figure out if the cancellation fee is worth not having the headache. I called it extortion in my letter to the CEO.|`|sDNfmRsTaa	Ask to speak to a supervisor, explain the difficulties that you have had, and continue to have. If that doesn't work, downgrade to the cheapest plan possible, with the least amount of minutes, etc. Then take out a new plan that will work for you with a competitor. Have the new company transfer your phone numbers. If you aren't using the phones with ATT, that might work. No guarantees with them tho.
xBd96wvRaa	They do that. Various reasons the economy sinking could be just that. <br>  Or you only make the minimum payment for a long time. <br>  <br>  I just noticed my Wamu Visa went from 15K to 6K overnight, I had about 5600 on it. I have no idea why. I do know their goal is to get you where you can only afford to make the minimum payment. <br>  <br>  My rebuttal was to pay it all off immediately and cease using their card.|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	They must not want you as a customer. I would just pay it off and forget it. BOA lowered my credit limit on my Charles Schwab card because I got a Cabalis card they service them all and said I had too much available credit. I hadn't used my Charles Schwab card in about 6-7 years but soon after than did, good thing my limit was still enough.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	It's been happening lately.  Not to me, but you're not the first person to report it.<br>  <br>  I can only assume they're having trouble, or are at least nervous, and are limiting the credit of anyone they even *think* might have trouble making good if they used up their full credit line in this economy.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	you need to call them and ask as they seem to be cutting every-ones at the moment and american express did it to me last year and said i had too much debt already|`|qaw8BwqTaa	HSBC is a funding bank for MyTributeCard.com and sister company of MySaluteCard.com  The economy seems to be eating up both companies as well as insider employee fraud investigations.

Why, you ask?  Because they know you'll pay it off, because you want to keep your credit rating up!<br>  Insidious, isn't it?|`|AA11908567	The opposite has happened to me, they increased my limit.<br>  Ring up HSBC and ask them why did it go down.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	idk but those bastards charged me for credit card insurance when i specificaly said I didnt want any!!!!

8fRodbOQaa	Have you tried to Google the company name & see if it's associated with any scams.  <br>  <br>  Where are the training sessions?  Are they offered by a legitimate company?  I did google 'loss prevention" course and found they do exist.<br>  <br>  I have had jobs where I was required to take outside courses in First Aid and Safe food handling.  Generally they cost less than $300. mind you and they hired me first.<br>  <br>  You might try finding another company that hires people for loss prevention and see what kind of training they require. <br>  <br>  It may be a scam but I'd do some more investigating before I gave up.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|LBltscBLaa	3-hour training with a fee of $300. its not right. i think it is a scam. i never heard anything like that before. there has been always on-the job training but paying for your training is not good. don't take it. it shouldn't be like that. training should be free.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	Nope - total scam.  Get yourself a job as a security guard and a company will train you for free to do loss prevention.

He does not like any job that costs you money to start.<br>  clarkhoward.com|`|SQe4ghfdaa	Oh my gosh! My boyfriend almost got scammed too. This company wanted $165 so he could get this kit before he could start training for the new "job". This all happened today...<br>  <br>  It's definitely a scam. You shouldn't have to pay money...or at least not THAT much!|`|VFAdWPKFaa	I would say any job that requires any kind of payment is too risky. I've done that mistake before and although it wasn't $300 that I lost I was still upset. If I were you I would check with the Better Business Beaurea first.|`|PYPExr72aa	3 words....... SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!!!! do not take the job 99.9%|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Sounds fishy to me too. Never heard of paying for training that should be included in orientation. You might look on your local better business beareau website and see if there are any complaints about them. You could also call your state Attorney General office and ask.|`|S2FhDtfSaa	Ask if job placement is guaranteed upon completion of the course and get it in writing. Of course, they could fire you the next day. I think it's a scam for their school. I doubt completion of the course will get you a job.

You would get additional exemptions if you were claiming children as dependents.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about making your actual income tax return match what you put down on your W-4, don't worry. People put anything from zero to six or seven on their W-4s, and it quite often doesn't match their real-life situation. The IRS doesn't care, as long as you fill out your tax return honestly.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Yes, you still need to claim yourself on the actual forms.

XZG35fxSaa	My mother-in-law has worked for Account Temps, and I've worked for RHI, and that's how it is.  The employers aren't usually in a hurry to make a permanent hire, because as long as you're a temp, it's easy to replace you if necessary.  Keep in mind, though, that if they weren't happy with you, you'd be gone already.<br>  <br>  With my position, it was about 6 months, as I recall, so I recommend being patient.  When they're ready to hire you permanently, you can negotiate a new salary.  Hiring you involves other expenses, like payroll taxes, vacations, and sick days, but even so, you can expect some kind of a raise.  And yes, there's usually a minimum contract length before you can be hired.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	It could be because there isn't much work around since a lot of companies are having to lay people off.  Normally they would tell you is something is just temp or temp to perm.  Sometimes it seems you work 90 days temp them you could become perm with an employer.  You will get benefits too if you become perm.

3AVHxNNTaa	you lied about your balance. you stole money from them. you are the one at fault, not them|`|RqQDKEVHaa	I'm not a lawyer. Check with a lawyer.<br>  <br>  However, fraud involves intent. Problem is--though the bank may not realize it and assume that your error was innocent--it kind of sounds like fraud (or grand larceny) to me.<br>  <br>  Consider: You withdrew $5,000. The next day, you checked your account and saw that the bank hadn't deducted your withdrawal. While the bank made a mistake, you saw the mistake; you knew it was a mistake. Then you went ahead and withdrew the same amount again, knowing that you really didn't have that $5,000 in your account. If you withdrew money knowing it wasn't there...well, that's not good.<br>  <br>  Pay back the $5,000 IMMEDIATELY and apologize for the overdraft. Again, check with a lawyer for details. But since the bank has given you an option--a fair option--follow through and return the $5,000 to the bank.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	I would say... YES.<br>  <br>  you withdrew $10,000 and only had $5000 in it.<br>  That means you took off with $5000 of your bank's money and they didn't really agreed to give you this money in the first place but you got it because of a computer error.<br>  <br>  Deposit the $5000 back immediately and pay your overdraft fee.|`|040c9f7b5e5d15e9ea0733db21793933aa	I would just give the money back because chances are if you don't:<br>  <br>  A) You will get someone fired<br>  <br>  I dont know if the bank will go after you but they could.|`|2KjMxlmJaa	Considering the amount in question...

71fdc65a048e11ac79a34e44367969e5aa	That's INSANE spending that much money on an "investment" that DEPRECIATES IN VALUE. Never spend more than $5000 on a car!|`|Gun3UGzaaa	Not for any kind of reasonable payment.  Do yourself a favor.  Save up a little more, and buy a used car for $5,000.  Enjoy driving that with no car payment at all.  Then, put the money you would have spent on a car payment for the $22,000 loan into a savings account until it is enough for you to pay off other bills.  Carpool for a while, or take the bus/train.<br>  <br>  If you absolutely must have something nicer than a $5,000 car, then save another $1,000 and get a $8,000 used car and put half down.<br>  <br>  If your credit score is "sad" (your words) you cannot afford a $22,000 car.  My credit score is great, and I bought a used honda for $8,000, and it has run just fine for eight years.  I love not having to make a car payment, and my insurance is lots cheaper.  It will be a much wiser use of your money to pay bills you already have on time to get your credit score up.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Sounds like you should try building your credit. You can start by trying to find a car that is not in that price range.invest in something that is more realistic for you to keep up payments on.And try not to let to many people run your credit.It only make the next dealership look more deeply into your credit report to turn you down. Be honest when looking talk to someone before you give up information on yourself (SSN) I just helped a good friend make a much wiser choice!!!|`|MbzyriZ4aa	No... it means you will have to find a used car for $3000 and pay for it in cash.<br>  <br>  Why... would you want to buy a used car for $22,000?<br>  As soon as you drive it off the lot... it's only worth $15,000!!!
mi5L30Khaa	Ask your boss for ideas.  One of his main responsibilities should be helping his team improve.  Sounds like some supervisory training could be a big help for you.  If your boss can't provide you with assistance to resolve this situation or he is the type of leader who won't support his management team because it might cost some revenue, then it's time to look for a new boss.<br>  <br>  As for being a better manager, I don't think you have to toughen up.  However, you should realize that your job is to motivate the people under you to do their jobs to the best of their abilities.  Sometimes that means encouraging a fun atmosphere.  Other times you have to hold people accountable.  There are thousands of books written on this topic.  I recommend that you pop over to the local book store and invest $25 in your career.  <br>  <br>  Also, are there other managers in your company who can give you advice?  (Be sure you're asking for help with the situation, not trashing your boss).  If you're are serious about this career, a good mentor is invaluable.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|wjUZBIPmaa	maybe she is jealous of you. i think she wants your position and feels bad about it because as you say she throws big numbers but she don't have it. don't mind her. show to everyone of your subordinates that you are a good manager that is why you have that position and not her. manage by example. be on time, make plans, achieve goals, delegate jobs, give credit to those who performs well and don't get intimidated. you are the boss. next time she is rude, say "thank you, but i am still your boss."|`|JkjUNObDaa	It really depends on what type of business you are in. Forget the fact that she says she doesnt respect you. One thing that I have always found that works is to tell them what to do (as most managers must at some point) but quickly follow that up by telling them what you must do. Tell them thank you for doing it for you as it allows you to do more things. In most cases lack of respect presededs them thinking you do nothing. You must allow them to know partially what you do.

IGYa2yF6aa	Possibly, but it depends entirely on your contract. Read your contract carefully, the answer is in there somewhere.|`|eYFRKmPOaa	The majority of time, when you default on a timeshare, they just recycle it back into the inventory and sell it at market value. Rarely are you sued, unless you live in the state that there headquarters are at. The issue is that your credit will get dinged and depending on what you owe, that can follow you for many years because it will be unsettled. Your best option is to try to sell it for the best deal possible and then pay off the rest. Even if you fall behind, that is better than defaulting. Go to Dave Ramsey's site, the author of the Total Money Makeover. He discusses this topic in great detail. Additionally, Timeshare Advocacy International has some great information on this topic as well. Good luck, I know this is a tough thing to deal with.|`|H7AZxsplaa	As the owner, you need to have an exposure. That is exactly what those Timeshare Resale Services provide. With Ad-Listings, your timeshare is made securable to the interest of other resale companies, rental companies and most importantly, potential buyers.<br>  <br>  Or if you’re up to it, you can just not sell it and donate it to charity. As a consequence it will reflect a write off on your tax return. If you want, you can also exchange it in for another timeshare week at a different resort. You can actually trade what you have for something better.|`|0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	If the selling or auction price is less than what you owe then yes you will be liable.

SM0JL0yaaa	Hello,<br>     I worked as a Human Resource Manager at Target Corporation.  Your answers to those questions are designed to ascertain whether you would make a good Target employee or not.  Target looks for positive can-do individuals and that test is a great judge as to whether that applicant will work out, in general, or not.  The result gets rated as "Green" (good candidate), "Yellow" (a maybe), "Red" (which we needed special approval to go ahead and hire after a formal interview).  From my experience, every time I did not heed the test results and the few times we hired a "Red" I was not happy with the resulting employee.  Target has invested lots of money into this analysis and those questions, while seeming simple, are great at assisting Target Human Resource Managers sift through the many many applicants and get to the good ones! ;)|`|RyUq1lWKaa	Job applications are frequently gruelling - how should you fill them out?

AA10305589	I believe that is thte period which the unemployment covers  - however, there is only a certain amount of money they will receive for that period, so it may run out before the time does, particularly if they collect continuously during that time.  They need to check the Unemployment Benefits page of their State's Departrment of Labor website - it should show the total amount they can expect to receive - each payment reduced the total by increments, so they should be able to figure out when tthe benefit will run out.
pNy8lakjaa	No, you would not qualify for section 8. First off the waiting list takes YEARS to get on. Then once you are on the waiting list, it takes YEARS before your application is processed. Then it takes YEARS for a unit to open up. NYC's list is closed unless you have the following 3 things happen to you;<br>  <br>  1.) DA's office states that you have been a witness to a crime and could possibly be put into danger, called the "intimidated witness program"<br>  <br>  2.)Administration for children and family services refers you for family unification and independent living programs (if you have kids/or you are disabled)<br>  <br>  3.)victim of domestic violence, with an order of criminal protection from the court<br>  <br>  Now.. you don't fall under these categories, so the waiting list is closed until further notice.|`|AA10045620	Section 8 is for low income earners.

Especially if you live in the UK. People in the States have slightly more options, but even then it is not going to make anyone rich.<br>  <br>  Most of the adverts that are trying to get you to sign up with companies that find surveys for you will say that you can make up xx amount of dollars for a survey. You can. It's true. But what they don't tell you is that it is only people who are doctors or engineers etc who are paid this and if you were a doctor or engineer would you really need to suplement your income by doing surveys?<br>  <br>  I live in the UK and I only ever bother with two survey companies now. The first one is You Gov now (<a href="http://www.linkbrander.com/go/73946)" rel="nofollow">http://www.linkbrander.com/go/73946)</a> So far I have earned about ￡27. I need to earn ￡50 before I can cash in. It is taking a while, but I don't always bother filling out the surveys when they send me emails about them. Sometimes I am just too busy.<br>  <br>  You Gov is a reputable company and so I don't mind them having my details, but I am never asked for them while doing a survey. You Gov got my details when I signed up so they don't need to ask for them during a survey ( I would worry if they did). I just tick a box to say what area I live in and that is it.<br>  <br>  How many suryveys can you do? Not that many. I get sent a few a month. Other people might get more or less though, because the surveys that are sent to you are sent because they match your profile (you fill this in when you join and it lists your interests etc). <br>  <br>  You Gov pay 50p for some surveys and about ￡1 for others. They usually take between 10 and 25 mins to complete. They also have a few surveys which offer quite large monetory prizes, but I seldom bother with them because it is still only a maybe even if it is a lot of money. I don't ming spending a little time to get 50p or ￡1, but I can't be bothered with maybes.<br>  <br>  The other one I use is Opinion Bar (<a href="http://www.opinionbar.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.opinionbar.com/).</a> I just got a ￡15 payment the other day. Straight into my bank account (so no paypal fees). Opinion Bar don't send me a lot of surveys but when they do the average payment is ￡1. I think the minimum payout is ￡10.<br>  If you decide to sign up with Opinion Bar I wouldn't bother with their toolbar. I used to have it, but I hate having too many toolbars on my browser they can slow it down. I find the best way with Opinion Bar is to wait for the emails or to sign in to your account and check what is available.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of Cashcrate, but I would not like to keep handing out my name, DOB and telephone number. These are all things that people can use to try and appy for debt in your name. That worries me.  I was once signed up with about 80 survey companies and I never got asked for all of that stuff during surveys. Only when I signed up. And if you are giving out your telephone number I bet you will start getting a lot of marketing calls. Give it a few months and see if I am right.<br>  <br>  Having said that, just did a bit of googling and found a guy who got a $60 cheque from them: <a href="http://www.brokegradstudent.com/the-cashcrate-scam/" rel="nofollow">http://www.brokegradstudent.com/the-cash...</a>|`|i2r8FSEwaa	I have done surveys online....as long as you find the right sites you CAN make a few bucks.  Most of the places do not let you request a payment until you have a certain amount (like $20 or more).  I have received checks anywhere from $20 to $30.  It is VERY time consuming, but if you have some time to kill...why not make a little money?  <br>  Off the top of my head, two sites that actually do pay money are surveysavvy.com and American Consumer Opinion.<br>  Another note:  sometimes the surveys come few and far between.  You might have an inbox full of them one month, and hardly anything the next.

sZg4QZs0aa	Does the clause apply?  The answer is - it depends largely upon the state you reside in.  Many of these no compete clauses are really not worth the paper they are written on, as they generally will not hold up in court.  So why do companies write them?  Because they are counting on the fact that their employees will not do the necessary legal research to find out how binding these clauses are in their state.  <br>  <br>  This is contract law, and as such is governed by each of the 50 states, and not the federal government.  So if you are working in the state of Washington, the state courts are very, very pro-employee and will probably throw out this clause if you had to go to court.  On the other hand, if you live in Virginia or Maryland, chances are the courts are more conservative and will side on behalf of the employer.<br>  <br>  From my research, what I have seen been held up by the courts is clauses of no compete for 6 months or so.  However, I believe 24 months of non-compete is unreasonable, and believe that most courts would rule the same.<br>  <br>  However, it is up to you to do the necessary legal research.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|BCgp7GTpaa	I would ask your HR.

hvcjyEmDaa	A dividend is a portion of the profits distributed to shareholders. <br>  <br>  Earnings are what the company bases its decision to distribute dividends on- along with a host of other considerations.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Earnings are what a company earns. Dividends are what it pays out.<br>  <br>  Example: A company manufactures widgets. During the year, it pays $1 million to manufacture the widgets. That includes the raw materials, the machinery it uses, its workforce, packaging, and delivery costs. Everything.<br>  <br>  However, the company sells the widgets for $1.5 million. Therefore, during the year, the company has earned $500,000 ($1.5 million minus $1 million).<br>  <br>  That's earnings: $500,000.<br>  <br>  The company has to figure out what to do with the earnings. It decides to give raises to its workers. It decides to buy new manufacturing equipment. It decides to buy some new computers. After spending all of that--costing $400,000--it's left with $100,000. It decides to pay out the $100,000 in dividends to its stockholders.<br>  <br>  That's dividends: $100,000.<br>  <br>  Often, those figures are expressed on a per-share basis, such as "earnings per share" and "dividends per share." So, if the company has 1 million shares of stock outstanding, then its earnings per share would be $0.50 ($500,000 divided by 1 million) and its dividends per share would be $0.10 ($100,000 divided by 1 million).<br>  <br>  They're not grouped together because they're two entirely different things.

4MypYVHYaa	Did you and you fiance explore the possibility of getting an FHA loan with your mortgage banker/broker? You might call and inquire of the person you tried to get pre-approved through and see if you are qualified for a FHA mortgage. FHA has a loan that might pay for a few cosmetic repairs on a real estate purchase.<br>  <br>  If your parents purchase the home for you guys, why don't you sign a contract of purchase with them for the purchase price of the home. You can then reopen escrow and and title to transfer the property into you and your finance's name with you being responsible for the fire (hazard) insurance, county taxes as well as the mortgage payments each month. <br>  <br>  Your contract would indicate the purchase amount, any interest rate, the amount of any late fees they would charge, how many months the mortgage would be for (10,20 or 30 years).<br>    <br>  Their name would appear on the title as the lender as well as on the insurance as the Loss Payee (Your escrow closing agent will understand this term and ask the insurance company to place your parents on the insurance policy as such.<br>  <br>  Once you have paid the payments either directly to the mortgage company or to your parents for 12-24 months you may then simply refinance the mortgage into you and your finance's name.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you use a personal checking account with you and your finance's name on the checking account.<br>  <br>  Your parents are protected because if you and your finance fail to make  the monthly mortgage payment they have the option of foreclosing on their daughter. <br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"

vigFmfLmaa	Most brokers don't charge if the deal falls through and you don't make it to closing.  Their big fee is the 1% origination which is based on the loan amount.  If you don't actually get the loan they shouldn't charge you.  Though some could charge for costs they incurred - such as an appraisal, processing or credit report fee.  However, It typically works similiar to the buyer/realtor situation.  If the deal falls through the realtor gets no commission.  If you don't get the loan the broker gets no cut.|`|AA11173563	not unless  they had an appraisal done on an offer you made then there is a bill for that.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	You typically never pay the mortgage broker.

I do not believe in anything else. I know this because i have been researching this for the last 5 years. It goes like this you need a SUPPLY=Of service or products-it must be constant(either you must work on a constant basis or sell on a constant basis) That means you must have a ready supply, which is half the challenge. The other half is marketing it and selling it.  What proves to be difficult is unless you have the cash to buy a large quantity of something you are in for a bit of trouble. All these gimics and scams, that promise wealth and freedom are untrue. If something is legit you should not have to pay for something you dont get to see.

5BTKscZraa	There is only ONE 7-year cycle for the reporting of bad debt....This cannot be re-started regardless of how many debt collectors buy this debt. This 7-year cycle starts on the date of your first missed payment that led to the default on the account. It is illegal for debt collectors to change the “Date of Delinquency” to “re-age” the debt for  their advantage. This is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.<br>  <br>  Mail a letter via certified mail with return receipt to all three credit bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion & Experian). Include a photocopy of your driver's license and social security card...If you don't include these, they may write back requesting them, which would slow the process down by several weeks. In your letter, simply state:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I am requesting <br>  <br>  - validation that this debt is being reported within the 7-year time frame as allowed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act <br>  - validation of the original "Date of Delinquency" for this debt|`|OacSIfSiaa	There are only 2 explanations for this to have happened.<br>  <br>  1) the account was charged off and they sold it to a collection agency or lawyer who won a default judgment against you.  Judgments are listed for 7 years or follow your state statutes which ever is longer.  Many states will list a judgment for 10 years and is renewable and in some states it could remain on your credit report for 30 years.<br>  <br>  Check your credit report and see if this debt is listed as a judgment, charge off or in collections.<br>  <br>  2) If it is listed as in collections then some bottom feeding collection agency has illegally re-dated the debt and this violates the FDCPA and you can sue them.<br>  <br>  You can file a dispute with the credit unions, here is a link to the FTC on how to do this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre21.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.

e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	Photographers can be full-time employees of newspapers, magazines, other photographers, advertising agencies, or a wide variety of other companies. However, many photographers work part-time, or as freelancers, offering their services to several clients rather than being restricted to one organization or individual.<br>  <br>  Most full-time photographers earn between $30,000 and $55,000 a year. The national average wage for all photographers is just over $16 an hour. This translates to roughly $34,000 a year for those who can find full-time work.<br>  <br>  Those working for newspapers and periodicals tend to make more than those working for other professional or scientific services. Full-time photographers with lots of experience and good reputations can make over $100,000 a year.<br>  <br>  Freelancers’ earnings vary widely, depending on the success of their business. They are only assured of a regular income as long as they are able to attract clients and sell pictures. In addition, they incur the costs of acquiring and maintaining their own equipment and running their own businesses. Freelance photographers may also be responsible for producing cost-estimates and budgets, organizing studio or location shoots, and hiring the necessary people.

bkykGxWraa	With the banking industry not doing well the risk is much higher in money markets since they are not insured by FDIC and hence are not able to be covered in the event of a bank failure. In light of the mortgage industry crisis I would steer clear. The CD deposits may not make much money on interest however they are FDIC insured up to 100,000 dollars.<br>    Also the stock market being in the tank creates opportunity for those that are cash tight. For researching safety of banks that are doing the best can be found in such online places as Morning star.com and Bankrate.com .|`|Ch9TedMcaa	none<br>  <br>  Money market accounts are FDIC insured.<br>  <br>  <br>  Zeuz is referring to money market mutual funds.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Money market accounts are investment accounts on (theoritically) low risk, short duration bonds.

fec25f298a046824d209e22ca386b7f1aa	It all depends on what kind of career you’re talking about. Being competitive shows employers that your willing to go the extra step and put more effort in then the others.  If you were hiring, would you want someone that does just enough to fulfill his job requirements or the person that goes beyond it to make the work easier for everyone else around him.  Plus being competitive will make you more noticeable to other companies looking for employees, if you make a name for yourself and want to go somewhere else to make more money, and then being competitive and getting people to talk about you is the best way to do it.|`|p2TCIUfRaa	No, b/c there are plenty of other opportunities out there that can make a person succeed. Sure there will be competing occasionally, but I dont think a person should try too hard in order to get what they really want b/c its possible they can get it elsewhere. They have to at least put out enough effort to show that they tried their best though. You cant receive everything you want bc another person might get it before you.|`|sDNfmRsTaa	Depends on what kind of business it is. Some are definitely highly competitive, some not so much. I am actually in a business that is not competitive at all, and we are a great team! Team work is the key to our success, not competition.

This is just roughly estimated and an average at that. You know you can spend a fortune or very little if you want.<br>  I could get you a decent 4 bedroom in the country for $125 grand but it'll be out of the city. You'd have to drive. But not over an hour, no matter where you live.. That's not too bad.|`|W8GMnYMZaa	Just as someone else mentioned, it depends where in the US you want to live.

I'm pretty happy with our management in our company and I can't say that heir making huge mistakes. Maybe that the focus is on point A in 2009 in a such a way that we ignore point B. Because we ignored point B, we should focus more on point B in 2010, so that point A becomes an issue again. For example: we should focus on service level so that we forget (not really) about the cost factor. The next year, we should focus on the cost aspect, and then the service levels will go down.

If your audience are techies or those who have the propensity to purchase higher-ticket items, then you can charge a higher price as compared to an audience of students.    - What is the rate of comparative websites in your niche? You don't want to overprice yourself out of the market yet you don't want to undercharge as well    - What is the rate advertisers are willing to pay in your site? You may charge $5 per CPM and yet for months nobody's taking you on the rate even though you may get inquiries -- this implies that advertisers think your rate is too expensive. But if you charge $0.50 per CPM and advertisers are flooding in, then you may be too cheap and can afford to increase your rate.    - What is the CPM you get from other advertising vehicles? Do you run Google Adsense, and if so, what is your effective CPM rate with them? Or if you run banner ads through ad networks like Burst Media, Valueclick or Tribal Fusion, what is the CPM you're getting? You can use those values to help you gauge your rate.    Since you're just starting in the game, experiment and see what rate the market will bite. You can start at $1 per CPM and see how it goes.
cs4n4Fgzaa	Having a clear objective gives you something to work towards. Without a goal, it is hard for a company to make strategic decisions. For example, if a company's objective is to provide the best customer service web portal in their industry, that would guide them to invest in the most advanced software to run their website.  Without clear objectives the business decisions become random and may end up hurting the company because time, money and effort are not focused on the right outcomes.

You can't control what happens with others around you.  Not all bosses are idiots, even if they don't know all the technical things you do.  Good bosses know how to delegate and get the underlings to do their work.  They are paid to get you to use your technical talents.  And, very smart bosses are not at all afraid to hire someone with better skills than they have, because it gives them a reason to shine and can make promotion opportunities for them if you can take on some of their work.  And, sometimes they appreciate the lesser GPA people for other talents they bring to the workplace.<br>  <br>  GPA means almost nothing in the work world.  If were interviewing you and you asked me my GPA, I would (secretly) laugh at you. While an academic credential helps, what matters in the workplace is your ability to build relationships, work in a team, accomplish things together, get creative about solutions, serve customers.  Each company has its own culture and style and you will need someone to coach you and teach you the ropes.<br>  <br>  Keep your snobbery about "inferior schools" to yourself.  Many very successful people graduated from those schools.  Even Bill Gates didn't technically graduate from college.  <br>  <br>  Tone down the attitude on your first job.  If you come across as a snobby know it all, no one will help you learn the ropes.  In fact, some will delight in watching you fail, and you will fail, if your coworkers think you look down on them.<br>  <br>  Simply do the best job you can, and let your abilities shine.  If the workplace recognizes that and rewards you for it, then be happy.  If they do not,move on to another place that will.

DisdrG4Taa	The prerequisites for many BSN programs are usually a combination of the following courses or something similar:<br>  English 6 hours<br>  History 6 hours<br>  Sociology 3-6 hours<br>  Psychology 3-6 hours<br>  Human Growth and Development 3 hours<br>  Humanities Elective 3 hours<br>  Algebra 3 hours (or some comparable math course)<br>  Statistics 3 hours<br>  Biology 3 hours + lab<br>  Anatomy and Physiology 8 hours + labs<br>  Microbiology 3-4 hours + lab<br>  Chemistry 3-4 hours + lab<br>  Nutrition 3 hours<br>  Some may have alternatives, like I took Organic Chemistry, but actually took it in addition as I knew I would need it in the future.<br>  Then you have the basic nursing curriculum for the last 2 years at most schools.<br>  <br>  Whether it is difficult is always a matter of individual point of view.  While there are always people who go through school with 3.8 to 4.0 averages; it is also true that in most BSN programs slightly over 50% of the students who begin school in that major drop or fail out of the program or college entirely.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, the major is not academically difficult, especially once you are past the prerequisites.  However, there is a large volume of material, and a great amount of the student's time is spent studying or in clinicals. For that reason, many people find nursing school very difficult and stressful, especially if they have other distractions, such as families or jobs which also occupy a large amount of time. The key to nursing school is organization and planning.  If you maintain a good schedule for classes, clinicals and studying, you can also manage other parts of life. Many of the people I went to school with also worked part time, and some had families. I worked part time and also was on an athletic scholarship for part of my BSN program, so I was involved in practices and on trips part of the time.

My background is well diversified so I know I can give you the best advice.  First, why would you want to buy a cheap used car that won't last you that long?  With auto dealers willing to kiss your feet, now is the time to make a great deal.  Also, your insurance will be discounted a little since you have a new car.  Moreover, with a warranty you will have some peace of mind from costly car repairs.   <br>  <br>  Regarding purchasing a home, now is the best time to do it.  With prices sinking why would you wait three years when prices might and likely will go back up?  With mortgage rates low, home prices at their lowest market value in decades, this becomes a "No Brainer."  Remember renting a place is like throwing out $$$$ every month.  With a home you would be building equity while your investment hopefully would appreciate in value.  Good luck.

Ch9TedMcaa	Simple.    Stock prices rise when more people are buying a company's stock.    They fall when more people or selling, or if one investor is trying to dump lots of shares, thus driving the price down.|`|ONRpcM82aa	Stock prices are also related to the company and industry news.  Good news may result an increase while bad news cause it to decline.  It also reflects the company earnings.  When the company announce good earnings look for the price to increase.  However, if they announce poor earnings the stock price should move  in the opposite direction.  Investors are attracted to stocks with good news and good earnings.|`|sI3krJULaa	While there are more complicated causes specific to different kinds of stock or companies, the basic force at work that makes the price of stock rise and fall is that of supply and demand.    If there are a lot of people selling a given stock- more than want to buy it, then the price will fall until those buyers are willing to purchase.  On the other hand, if there is a hot stock that a lot of people want to purchase, the price will rise until some of those owners are willing to sell.    Like I said, that's a highly simplified version, but it's the basic underlying mechanism of the stock market.    Hope that helps. :0)|`|AA10566552	It is really not complicated at all.  Supply and demand cause the rise and fall of stocks.  The stock market is really a forecaster of future earnings.  That is why stock market recoveries typically happen before economic recoveries.  If investors think that earnings are going to increase at an accelerating rate, stock prices will rise.  The same is true in reverse.|`|Mn1mODPzaa	You'll hear many people say supply and demand, but that does not explain the fluctuating price movements between a range of prices.    It is really all about perceived value.  All the investors in a companies stock take a look at all the available data that they consider relevant and then decide how much they believe the stock is worth.     This is why stocks typically trade within a range, trading between a high (resistance) and a low (support).  When a stock reaches the high range, people/traders re-evaluate the perceived value of the stock...if nothing significantly has changed to make the perceived value higher, then the stock will start to sell off.    The opposite happens at support, i.e. as the stock approaches support people/traders evaluate the perceived value of the stock and if nothing has changed then they start buying because they perceive the stock to be priced at it's lower range.    When this perception changes, usually due to some news event, is when these ranges break and the stock starts to trade higher or lower than the range previously defined.    Steve J.

What really needs to happen is that the government really go after the creditors for reporting bad info.

They will send it to the FBI for investigation and hopefully catch that person.  Search the IP address and see what country it's from.  The UK is a hot spot for Nigerians.  <br>  <br>  I know about that scam... it is used in real estate rentals all the time.  The person expected to go and deposit or cash at your bank where have an account.  They would cashed it against your account if you had $2,000 in it.  Then after a couple of days the bank would have gotten the money order back from the reserve sticking you with the bill.

I once bought some hand lotion from Ebay. In the persons advertisement it said it was a larger bottle then what I was sent. So make sure you read the comments and feedback about the person.<br>  <br>  Another person I bought an xbox game from, everything went smoothly other than the time it took to get here. It said 3-5 days, it took 2 weeks. So when you do order something, don't expect it to arrive when it says it will. Holidays or pour weather can cause delay's. And many people need to wait for payment to go through before they can afford to ship it out.<br>  <br>  Also be careful with what you are buying from another country. With border taxes you may be charged extra when the parcel arrives. The parcel must be labelled gift when coming from over sea's. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, and hope you have good experiemces as most of us other ebay / paypal users have!!

Ra3FksCQaa	Retail managed futures can generally be defined as a globally diversified basket of futures contracts which are listed on worldwide exchanges. Retail managed futures funds have the ability to go both long and short, and thus have the potential to profit in rising or falling markets. Moreover, managed futures funds historically have had a low correlation to stocks, bonds and other investments, and therefore have the potential to improve returns and lower the overall volatility of a portfolio.<br>  <br>  Retail Managed Futures Funds are an asset class of their own and do not correlate with hedge funds.

IF your lender participates in the program, then it will help  you lower the amount you owe and correspondingly lower your payments. The catch is that a significant portion of the equity created in your home goes to FHA, in other words, when you sell your house someday, FHA will get most of the money. The real advantage to you is that you don't lose your residence and you get smaller payments in the meantime.    I really don't think the Hope program is what you need. It only addresses your loan, not the escrow account that your property taxes come out of. Your real problem is the mess created by the errors in your property taxes. You need to look over everything and push back on whoever is screwing you. You may need a lawyer to help you.     I find it hard to believe that your mortgage can go up $800 per month for property taxes alone. If there were back taxes owed before you bought the house then your title company needs to step up and pay them because it was their fault for missing it when you bought the house. If your bank is trying to charge you for underpayment previously, you need to have the escrow account audited by a professional to determine where the error is and hold that person/company responsible.|`|t4F59gf2aa	You can't pay for your OWN mortgage and taxes so I guess you want me to pay w/ MY money and tax dollars right?

As already noted, it's an attempt to bypass some of eBay's built in protections. Now, why would anyone want to do that?  Hmmm . . .    Please review some of the US government's information regarding check fraud.  "But it's not a check, it's a money order."  True.  However, different paper, same effect.  In the end, the US Postal Service will trace you as the purchaser of the money order.  Any forgeries on that money order will be attributed, rightly or wrongly, to guess who?    Now, do you really, really, really need that item that badly from that particular seller?  Hmmmm . . . ?    Walk away.    Granted, this could be a perfectly honest and honorable seller who only wants to evade the fees associated with PayPal, credit cards or the possible fraud of personal checks.  Those are 50 - 50 odds but since you're the only one bearing all the risks, probably even worse.    That's playing Russian roulette with your money.  As Dirty Harry would ask, "Do you feel lucky?  Do you?"    Good luck.

If you wish to choose a fund with a front end load, perhaps American Funds would be a better choice.  American Funds generally has among the lowest expense ratios.    To make this point, lets compare similar funds from both companies.    Putnam Voyager Fund--growth fund-- 10 year return -3.9% expense ratio 1.2%     American Funds Growth Fund--10 year return +2.55% expense ratio 0.62%  The difference in return is almost all attributable to the difference in expense ratio.|`|ww12lItvaa	They have been known to have good funds.

CHCPnvksaa	It won't hurt your credit score. If that was the case, most of us would have bad credit.

The amount that you are paying will affect your debt-to-income ratio of course but unless it is significant it should not have a major negative impact.  Paying it off with a credit card or other loan would have the same overall impact.  The IRS interest rates are much lower than most credit card cash advance rates so paying the IRS directly is usually the best way to proceed.

y2y88JpFaa	There are lending programs designed for this type of transaction.  They are called 203K Loans and the process is that before you buy the house; you get prequalified for a max loan amount and the house you are thinking about buying gets 2 appraisals.  First is what the house is worth right now in current condition and a second amount fo what the house will be worth after the repairs you are planning on doing.  The bank will give you the amount needed at closing to purchase the house and then advance some of the remodeling funds to get you started repairing the property. During remodeling they will send out an inspector to sign off on certain projects and advance more funds to finish the project.  Once repairs are completed the inspector signs off and the remaining balance of escrow funds are released.  The number of inspections and draws are based on the application you turn in and the amount of work needed to be done.|`|AA11173563	right now if you have 12 payments under your belt you can take $20,000 out for repairs. in a second note or refinance and take about 42,500 with FHA assuming the house would qualify|`|qBCGH52haa	You can only borrow what the house is worth based upon an appraisal.  Say the house sells for $100,000 and needs $25,000 in repairs.  If the house is appraised for $100,000, you would need to find another source besides a mortgage for the repair money.  On the other hand, if the house sold for $100,000, appraised for $150,000 and needed $25,000 for repairs, and assuming you were approved for the full $150,000, you could borrow the $125,000, buy and repair the house and still have some equity in the house.      The key is that regardless of how much you are approved for, the bank will not mortgage more than the appraised value of the house (and usually require a deposit at that point).|`|01odBlpjaa	you personally may have been approved for 150k but that's only 1/2 of the equation. the other half relies on what the house is worth. basically, the bank is comfortable giving you 150k as long as the house you're buying appraises for that much. if you want to buy a house that appraises for 100k then the bank is only giving you 100k.

Otherwise you can go to the apt complex office and file a written complaint that she is harassing you. That way they have it on record that you dispute her claims. You have to speak up at least as loudly, if not as often, as she does. If you don't things will only get worse. Some people are just not happy unless they have something to complain about. You are not a welcome mat. Don't let her walk on you.|`|RZzMse3Haa	They will soon realize she is crazy and she can be evicted for false complaints.

If she starts going off, ask for specific examples of how smells or visitors have disrupted her.  Most likely she might be confusing you with another tenant and will not give you any.

I would also ask your property manager what SHE/HE would like you to do to resolve it.  Include them in the solution so they realize you are the one trying to correct the situation.   Hopefully this trouble maker will get evicted for filing false police reports, slander and above all personal harassment.  I would be cautious if you do talk to her, she may try to act like a friend and have ulterior motives.  Be polite but don't get too close.  She sounds like she has lots of problems.

However, if you're anything like me, being in the lame *** IT world where it's all about pushing paper/code and never actually using any of that hard-earned physics knowledge, it'll drive you bonkers. <br>  <br>  I've found and have seen for a lot of friends, that really the only career choice for people with a strong interest in physics is something directly in physics, be it teaching or research or private industry. I'm working on an MS and with any luck that will translate into the long hard road towards the PhD. In the meantime I moonlight as a physics instructor and teach a little math on the side, too. <br>  <br>  With an MS you can teach community college or lower level physics classes at a full university (depending on the school). <br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you what to do though. Physics is in my opinion the hardest subject you can study. Often times people will offer you work that's completely unrelated just because they know a physicist can handle damn near anything they set their mind to. Use that to your advantage and figure out what you love. Good luck!|`|sBinN9kXaa	Radiation Physicist would be a great career - You would be involved in commissioning, fixing and maintaining Linear Accelerators - which are the machines that are used to treat cancer patients. This is a highly skilled and highly payed career option.<br>  Job opportunities exist in most major hospitals - anywhere that has a Radiation Therapy department. Most departments have 2 physicists.<br>  If interested, and you want to know how to get into it, visit your local Radiation Therapy department and ask to speak with the Radiation Physicist. <br>  <br>  NOTE - I am from Australia, and I guess by the wording of your question (Fall, college...) that you are in America? if this is the case, the terminology may be different, and the pathway into the field may also be different.<br>  Study in Australia is also cheaper - especially if you are a citizen (when it is able to be put off on a government loan scheme until you are earning over a certain wage).|`|POgWt901aa	IT career-<a href="http://myitcareer.info/" rel="nofollow">http://myitcareer.info/</a>
