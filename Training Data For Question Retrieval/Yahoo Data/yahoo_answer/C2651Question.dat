20070221054348AASKuEM	Pets;Dogs	New puppy.?	We had a puppy, but had to let him go a couple of months ago. He was very hard to house train, so one of his kennels (in the house) is probably smelly to another dog. He also had accidents in the house sometimes. We are getting a new puppy in a couple of weeks (great dane:) and I wonder if I can use the same kennels and if I should do anything to remove the odor of our previous dog. Will the new puppy smell the kennel and think it's ok to go the the bathroom? Will the same happen in the house? We have carpet. I've cleaned my carpet professionally twice since. Thanks for the help.

20070416031618AAeYYB9	Pets;Cats	Consigli per la mia gatta con zampa rotta... sopratutto da veterinari on-line?	Una settimana fa' è stata investita da un auto e si è rotta l'omero. E' già stata operata (2 chiodi e 2 cerchiaggi che tengono insieme l'osso).    L'ho portata a casa e la tengo in una gabbia (tipo quella dei veterinari). QUando ancora ricoverata aveva ripreso a mangiare, ma a casa mangia pochissimo (nonostante il cibo specifico nutriente per convalescenza che dovrebbe essere molto goloso a detta del medico), fa solo pipì e poca.      Sta ferma tutto il giorno (mi aspettavo qualche passo ogni tanto)...mi fa veramente pena. Secondo voi è possibile che stia male perchè non più sotto l'etteffo degli analgesici che le davano via flebo in clinica?      Potete darmi qualche consiglio e raccontarmi le vostre esperienze di zampe... rotte?      Grazie a tutti

Quando sono di ritorno con la mia auto, e mi accingo ad aprire il cancello elettronico per posteggiare la mia auto nel parcheggio interno condominiale, che confina proprio con il mio giardino, il mio cane appena sente il rumore della mia macchina comincia ad abbaiare insistentemente fino a che non entro in casa ed alzo la tapparella della cucina.   Domanda: Cosa potrei fare per porre rimedio a questa situazione? Visto e considerato che sopra il mio appartamento c’è un condomino che è andato dai Carabinieri per lamentarsi perché infastidito dai lamenti seppur non sempre costanti del mio cagnolino, poiché  questo Signore lavora sempre di notte (ed è un suo problema), e tengo a precisare che durante le ore di silenzio tengo il mio cane dentro casa.

20070531230542AAut6MW	Pets;Dogs	Sahsha's barking?	What is the best way to teach a dog to stop barking on command?  Sahsha was adopted a few months ago from the humane society. Every time we come outside, she barks at us, loudly and non-stop. She acts like she is demanding attention, but we don't know how to get her to stop on command, cause she barks so loud, she doesn't hear the command. Any suggestions?       Also, she sometimes slips out the gate and runs off. Nothing will make her come back to us until she decides to come home. How can we teach her to come when called off leash - for when she slips out, or teach her to stop trying to slip out?       We have a pack of 6, and the other 5 get out the gate when she opens it, but they stay close to home and come back inside the gate when we call them, but they do it on their own, we didn't train them to do it. How can we help Sahsha with these behavior problems?

Last night he couldn't stand up on his own but once I helped him up he was okay well he still walks like he is drunk but that scared me.   This morning he was trying to bark at a cat and again he couldn't get his back legs up so he layed back down until I made him get up but after that he wanted to play and he has been up and down by himself since then. He falls a lot when he is playing but it doesn't bother him. I know he is not in pain.  I want to know if that is the nature of this disease. It is also hard with off and on symptoms to tell when to put him down. I love him and don't want to do it to early but he weighs 100 pounds and once his rear legs don't work I can't cary him

20070419142124AAQ36j2	Pets;Cats	Per tutti gli amanti degli animali, ho un vicino di casa che ha sempre odiato gli animali...?	Ha sempre detto che dovevano stare lontano dal suo garage altrimenti li avrebbe ammazzati tutti, si è sempre lamentato del fatto che andavano spesso dentro al suo garage o nel suo giardino a fare dei bisognini, gli dava fastidio il nostro cane che abbaiava la notte e non lo faceva dormire.   Per farla breve " questo mostro" in questi ultimi tre anni ha ucciso ben nove gatti usando del cibo avvelenato, molto probabilmente ha sempre usato il veleno per topi.   Due settimane fà è morto un'altro gatto a cui io ero legatissima ed un cane di grossa taglia che viveva quì insieme a me e alla mia famiglia da quasi una decina d'anni.   Non siamo riusciti a trovare neanche i corpi per potergli dare almeno una degna sepoltura.   Naturalmente tutti i sospetti sono caduti su questo S.T.R.O.N.Z.O.   Non abbiamo le prove per incastrarlo, per dimostrare che è stato lui, e quindi per denunciarlo, ma lui quando noi lo guardiamo evita i nostri sguardi, abbassa sempre lo sguardo, come se nascondesse qualcosa.

20070504031208AApl5Jd	Pets;Dogs	Cagnolina in calore?	La mia cagnolina, un meticcio di nove anni, è in calore. Questa volta, molto diversamente dalle precedenti, ha perdite davvero molto abbondanti (tanto che è tutta sporca, anche se la lavo ogni sera). Inoltre il suo comportamento è strano: si rintana negli angoli della casa, di notte ansima (come quando d'estate fa caldo), piange, si muove di continuo, ad esempio passa sotto ai letti avanti e indietro per un pò di volte, sale e scende in continuazione da poltrone o letti (che poi su letto non dovrebbe proprio salire)..   è una cosa normale? mi spavento perchè non ha mai fatto così..

I'm fostering a cat for only a few more days, and just a couple days ago he hasn't been able to keep any food down.  He would throw up just a few minutes after eating.  The kibble that he eats is in full form in his vomit.  At first I thought we were just feeding him too much, but I only gave him maybe a tablespoon at one point and he threw that up.  I don't know how long cats can go without food, but I don't want him to have to go hungry--and I certainly don't want him to starve to death!

Vet gave him two shots (antibiotics and to lower the fever). On the way back he was also great, however when we returned home he started to run away for us. I gave him his favourite mat to sleep on, but he didn't. I didn't want to chase him around so I just let him be.    Why did he acted like this??       We need to go to vet once again today what can we do to prevent it?

20070524134531AAG3woX	Pets;Dogs	Everyone blames the Pit Bull, how about penalties for owners?	Nobody wants to protect and help these poor animals just destroy them.  They have been mistreated and abused.  All the people complaining should come with good solutions benefiting both the animal and people.   My idea is to have bad owners (and people willing to help by volunteering and fundraising) pay for quality retraining.  Many aggressive dogs can still learn love, and be suitable in the correct environment. The people who feel threatened should also put their time into helping the animal, instead of writing laws.   What are your ideas, to help Pit Bulls, and not make laws and destroy them?

Since she had her pups, she's been constantly unhappy and distressed.  Although she regularly nurses her pups, every other time she stays a far distance from them, often nesting in  corners. She also wonders around the house carrying her toys, shoes, and other objects whimpering and crying. I've had 3 other litters with three other mothers and I have never seen this type of behavior.

I know it's hard to judge by these pictures, and I'll probably be called dumb for asking on Yahoo, but it's only out of curiosity.      Before anyone flames me, these dogs are fixed and won't be used for breeding. I was just asking out of curiosity. Tell me honestly what you think.

20070609225602AAM40RQ	Pets;Dogs	12 wk old puppy and the piano?	I have a 12 wk old pomchi and have had him for about three weeks now. He is currently only allowed in our dining room (it's where he sleeps, roams, etc...)  and there is a piano there too.       When we first brought him home and I played him some notes on the piano he was scared and cried, even more so with chords of any kind. I thought that if I played something to him everyday he'd get used to it.       And so three weeks on he is quite calm whenever my sister has her piano lessons. Although sometimes he has a little cry when she plays something off key...       BUT whenever I play (with very rare mistakes), he sort of whimpers a bit.. and well... howls? I'm not entirely sure.It's a strange howl like sound. If I ignore it, he just continues and even gets louder       I've tried putting him on my lap but all he does is lick my fingers resulting in awful piano playing. He is still startled with chords sometimes.      Any tips on how to make a harmonious relationship between me, my pup & piano?
20070612134908AA4wsza	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog act so strange?	For instance I come home from work she runs right up to me wagging her tail, rubs her face on me and is really happy to see me.  After a few seconds of that she runs away in an angry huff growling at me.  And Vice Versa!        Say I come up to see her, she sees me and starts to growl and snarl at me, runs away for a few seconds then comes right back up to me wagging her tail and putting her head down to my legs like she wants some attention.        Also she growls viciously at me like she wants to bite me but sometimes she'll be wagging her tail while she does this.   I realize this could me she wants to play - but her growling seems too vicious to me.        I've tried to look in books about Cocker Spaniels but none of them have told me anything about why she behaves this way. Does anyone have any ideas as to why she does these things?
