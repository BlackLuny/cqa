20080305184541AApphOu	Pets;Dogs	Puppy gets distracted, disobyes commands?	My 4 month old puppy has been doing very well in her training but there is one area where she is having problems.  She gets distracted and will basically ignore her commands.  This is normally when outside and I need her to sit while waiting to cross the street.  I'll take her to play fetch at the park and let her off her leash and she is very good about coming to me when I call but if she sees people or another dog she will head towards them and seem to not hear me at all.  What can I do to make sure that she listens to me at critical times?

Probably around 2 months ago, we got a year old male and they share a pen.  Recently my female, Delilah, has been eating a lot less (not as vigorously and not at one time), and staying her house rather than being her outgoing friendly self.   Every time the male gets around her she bucks at him, and no signs of mating have been seen from either my mom or I, though they would have all day to mate.   Could she be pregnant, or is her lack of eating and shyness from something else?  What would be ways to tell if she is pregnant?

So about a month ago, i had 3 snails and two of them died, nothing else died though. So i went out and bought 3 more and a week later, 1 more died. I woke up to see him floating on the surface of the water, out of his shell and he smelled like crap. I took him out of the tank and changed about 50% of the water(i spilled some). If there is anything else i could do, HELP?         plus my snails always seem to be on their back and i turn them around. is that wrong?

20090131095845AAoXuPZ	Pets;Fish	Need help with my mean goldfish?	I am quite new at raising fish.    I got the first one on Nov 1 last year, I put him (I have a feeling it's a him) in a rather small fishbowl (the only kind they had).   Two weeks later I got a second fish which I put in the same bowl.  The first one kept chasing and biting the second and in 2 weeks the second one died. I said it's my fault, I shouldn't have put two fish (both were goldfish, but not the same color) in one small bowl. Around Christmas I bought a second goldfish (or a third rather) and I also bought a pretty big aquarium. In the meantime the first one had grown even bigger and meaner and killed the other in 3 days. Now (yesterday) I bought one mean looking goldfish, a real thug. At first my mean goldfish who is very fat and active seemed scared of it but that lasted half a day. After that he started chasing the new one and biting it. This new one turned out to be mild-mannered after all.  The mean guy is back in the bowl right now. This past month he was in there only when I changed the water in the aquarium.  How do I make this behaviour stop? Can he have some kind of health problem? Is this normal? Because if it is and this last goldfish is killed too I am done with fish forever. I also considered getting many fish, then he would be too busy chasing all of them to focus on one, but I wanted a pet...
20090131102618AAP78kS	Pets;Dogs	Is there any way to report bad dog breeders in the U.S.?	Does anyone know of a process to report bad dog breeders in the U.S.?      Now, I did all of my research and checked out the parents and the facilities and the parents, etc., etc. before buying this puppy.      This puppy got very sick though around 5 months of age. The specialists that we took her to were able to help and he seems to be recovering now (several thousand dollars later, but we are responsible and knew that if we were going to buy a dog, that we would be financially responsible for this dog). We were told not to bred her because of this condition and that the parents should not be bred again.      I contacted the breeder and provided medical information but the breeder doesn't seem to care. I contacted the BBB, but they told me that they can't do anything about this. They referred me to the Vet Board of the state where the breeder lives, but the Vet Board told me that they only regulate vets.      Any other ideas to ensure that these people don't breed these dogs and put another puppy and owners through this?

Anyway I'm going to be taught how to teach the lusitanos and I was wondering if it would work with my horse. Would it be worth moving him because he's settled were he is and the lusitano yard is a lot more expensive. Also I don't know about turn out because he won't go out on his own but I don't know if he would be allowed out with the lucys incase he kicks one because they're worth a fortune lol.

20090131102715AAImMrZ	Pets;Rodents	Hamster abandoned 2 babies, but they're already 8 days old?	My dwarf hamster had 8 babies, and has been taking care of them all until last night I went to check up on her and noticed one baby was out of the nest, I tried to push it back in with a spoon after rubbing it all in the hamster scent and the mother just grabbed it and brought it outside the nest again. Maybe she just thought she couldn't handle it anymore? But now this afternoon I go look in and the same thing, but this time the baby isn't breathing, so I pick it up and know that it's dead.   Don't get me wrong, I know this is common, and so is eating the babies, but isn't 8 days a bit too late for that? I mean, they can start eating little hamster seed at 10-15 days, so they can almost live without her.   Just wondering if it was normal for the mother to abandon them this late after her birth.

I have a blue, red, Yellow, red blue and purple, orange, and a white with red and light blue male Betta's. I have been wanting to breed my Betta's but I decided to start with something more simple. I started with live-bearers. I bread guppies. Then mollies. Now My sword tail is pregnant along with my platy. I still have my female mollie but unfortunately my male has pasted. Now I am trying my betta's, which i understand is a harder task. I have only gotten one male betta to blow a bubble nest and it is my blue male betta. I am trying to breed my crowntail, which I am sure is a younger betta, but he will not produce a nest. My females (one blue an one white and maroon) do have eggs, and he does chase after them, but neither the males or females seem to be will to breed. I give them the foods, the water, I leave them in the tank. But there is nothing that seems to work. My male should be sexually mature. Any suggestions?

20090131122119AASPIWC	Pets;Dogs	My golden retriever is out of control. Help?	We got a golden retriever about 8 months ago. He is now fully grown (Very big for a golden) and he is so full of energy and always wants to play. You let him in from outside and he just dahes into the house, jumps on the furniture and other people, attacks the other dogs (playfully) and is just a total bull in a china cabinet. Whenever we pet him he just wants to wrestle and nibble on us, even when we tell him no biting he still has to get one last bite in every time. We tell him no when he starts getting rough with our pomeranians (He can really hurt them!) but everytime we pull him off he just goes right back at him no matter what we do.      Anyways we can get this beastie under control?

20090131125514AAC4lGh	Pets;Cats	I found 2 kittens in Cancun, Mexico ?	PLEASE READ THIS FIRST IT IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!      When I went to Cancun , Mexico I heard meow-ing in the bushes the first day I was there , (i was staying for 2 weeks ) i looked there and I saw kittens , i decided to leave them alone , there mom had to be somewhere around.      But I heard the same meow-ing in the bushes for 4 straight days , so i finally said "let me just check them out to see if there ok " so i picked them up and they were so skinny ! I could see there ribs !       So i was so sad because well , i'm a sucker for animals , and they were so small and hungry , one was a boy and the other was a girl , then i remembered that I had a blanket in my bag (i was heading for the beach ) so i put the blanket in the bushes and put the kittens on it , where they couldn't be seen. And I went out and bought some fish, chicken , corn beef , and water . They looked to be at least 2 months old . And when I gave it to them , uh , they ate and drank so fast ! They ate everything ! when they were done there stomachs looked like tennis balls .       After that they trusted me , they let me touch them , and they purred when I did it too . Then they took a nap . 2 hours later i went to check on them , they were up and hungry again , so i bought them what they ate last time , except while i was at the store I bought them some toys too . After they ate I played with them . I did this every 2 hours , except for at nights .       I have been doing this for the past 2 weeks and I have to leave Cancun in 2 days ! I don't want to leave them , i've become so attached to them ! And when I'm gone , who will feed them ? Play with them ? And pet them ?  (there not so skinny anymore by the way) I don't know what to do !      And then they will notice that i'm gone , and they will never trust humans again because of what i've done ! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME !!!!

20090131123459AAjt3nN	Pets;Horses	Kidney weakness in horses?	I was told today that my TB filly may have weak kidneys. The woman said that because she does drink a lot, does lots of urine that smells strong and is fed on a high sugar diet (pasture mix/unsoaked haylage), her kidneys may be quite weak. She is quite sensitive in that area so it makes sense. Although, me being me, I have totally forgotten what she told me to do and i dont have any contact details. I do remember her saying to soak the haylage, which i have done, and stop feeding pasture mix. She said it is quite common in TB's.       Theres one thing that she told me to do, which was to feed some kind of weed that grows around grass, but i really can't remember what it was. I think it began with C but I'm not sure. She said it would flush out the kidneys.      Does anyone know what the weed is? or anything that will help her out? shes only 3 years old.      any help really appreciated =]

20090131120558AAABL1X	Pets;Cats	What is one of the best canned foods that i could possibly feed my cats?	ok, so now i am 100% convinced that i want to switch my two babies from dry to canned food due to this neat little web site:     http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...    so my question is, whats the best food to buy? i suppose anything you get at walmart is probably not good enough (or is it?). i know how to read the labels and basically everything there has these "meal" or "by-products" in it and i want to avoid that if at all possible.    i have two cats, one is about 2 1/2 years old and the other one about 10 month. i want to switch both of them and i think that i'll be getting kitten food for one and something regular for the other.    the main reason why i want to switch is that my big one has gained a whole lot of weight. he is totally addicted to the dry food and will steal the little ones food whenever i turn my head. i have such a hard time to keep him away from the food, he is sneaky and even learned how to open the bucket that we keep the food in! i have tried to put him on a diet but i haven't seen any results yet.    so what are your experiences with certain brands? what would you recommend? by the way, my cats are not finicky eaters at all and i have plenty of dry food left to make the change slow and easy on them.     thanks for your help,    kat

20090131122259AAAdWwv	Pets;Dogs	Just a question about my Pug and the previous owner?	I was planning on buying a Pug last summer from this one woman, her name was possibly Brenda but can't totally remember.  She then calls me a few days later after we discussed everything, telling me that her daughter is going off to college and she had kept one of the Pugs from the previous batch.  She told me that the girl couldn't keep the Pug due to her living in a dorm so she was trying to find an owner for her. decide that I want this dog :).  So I pay $500 for this 4 month old Pug.  I get home and notice that he has a rather large chest. find out that this dog has a chest deformity so I call the lady and she says that the father has a chest deformity but it shouldn't effect his health.  FIRST OFF, why is the lady breeding unhealthy Pugs!  SECONDLY, why did she make me pay $500 for a deformed Pug? (although he is an amazing dog so I suppose he was worth that money)  She didn't even mention this deformity in her time that we had talked and that kind of upsets me.  So then a little later on, I find out that he has a hip problem and needs a $600-$800 surgery to fix it.  The vet told me that any small dog is at risk for this hip problem but she said that his deformity might have been a trigger, not really sure what that means though.  So I am confused.  Did the breeder totally rip me off and cause me a lot of future bills?      ALSO, she was training the dog on puppy pads which you should never do with a dog because the dog will likely have more trouble being potty trained and now he marks EVERYWHERE in the house and has trouble being potty trained, even after being fixed.      Give me your opinions on this please.

20090131112325AAQjOqm	Pets;Dogs	My dog is growling at me. How can I fix that?	She is a 2 year-old supposed bichon t'su. We think the store got it wrong, and we think she is a yorkie terrier. When she is really comfortable, and sleepy, and you lean in and try to kiss her, or just get your face close, she will growl at you. We at first thought that it was just a "please don't disturb me" growl, but yesterday when she did that, she bared her teeth too. We are worried that when she gets older, she is going to become grumpy and start biting. Anybody who has a dog like this, how do you suggest training them to stop? And anybody who had a dog like this and didn't do anything about it, what was the dog like when it got older? Thanks in advance!

I love my dogs. but another problem is that my newest adopted dog is a pit bull. He is so sweet but with the comon views on pits i'm afraid that this will make things more difficult. I need to find someone i can trust to board them for me while im gone. money isn't an issue since im not going to be needing it while im there. Please give me a real answer

20090131123142AAjAxuf	Pets;Dogs	What type of Dog Breed is this/ or what would he be mixed with?	I am about to adopt this dog from a shelter and they said he is about 6 years old and they say he is a Shih Tzu. However I own a Shih Tzu and they are very different looking. This new dog has the face of a Shih Tzu...however he is very, very dark browns and blacks. Very unusual for Shih Tzus. ALSO his hair is very course. The Shih Tzu we own has softer fluffy hair. This new one has short course hair. He doesn't seem to shed. But I highly doubt that he is full blood shih tzu. Does anyone have any ideas on what breed he really is or what he could be mixed with?? Thanks!!!

I have had my cat for about a year now, and just recently (about a couple months) he has started pooping on the floor. He only does it in the mornings and it is always in the same spot, which is right at the edge of my kitchen. My husband and I have tried everything. We scoop the litter everyday, change the litter to fresh litter all the time. I have steam cleaned the area that he poops to remove any scents. After steam cleaning, he stopped for 2 days, but started back. I don't know what to do, but if he doesn't stop, my husband is going to force me to get rid of him! :(      HELP PLEASE!!!

I saw this poor make betta with no tail or fins in one of those awful cups. Well opened the container and the smell of the water was rancid. Okay, not recommended thing to do but I grabbed a cup from their sink, put water from one of their tanks in it (couldn't find a worker as usual) and transferred him til I could get him home. Yes I paid for him :)      I have him in a five gallon til he gets better and he is swimming around but noticed he is blind. He bumps into the plants and sides of the tank, doesn't notice my hand right next to him unless I touch him and he doesn't notice the food I put in.       My questions are:    How can I get him to eat, do you think this was caused by the awful water and will it clear up?

20081006070801AAq1urJ	Pets;Dogs	Getting a puppy, need mill/breeder info?	We are studying Intensely on getting a puppy, we've concluded (husband especially) English Bulldog.  We know price, we know health issues; our schedules/lifestyle will match this type of dog.          Because they are a not so popular dog (like, lab, for example), they are hard to find.  So, we looked online & found a site that didn't seem to have the puppymill characteristics, now that I search other questions on here, I am wondering... I don't think puppy mills are good ideas, and I told my husband I hear they breed unhealthy pups.  My husbands response is, well, the younger they are the healthier they will be if we get one out of there sooner.  Is this a true thought?  If not, do they cross-breed dogs?  If they do crossbreeding, how do they offer you AKC (is that it?) papers for them w/ a pedigree not showing the crossbreeding?  Forge the documents?  Can you pick a puppy up from a mill, and then able to examine the living quarters to walk away if it looks too unsafe?  I will NEVER have a puppy shipped!!!     I read people saying never buy online, but I found a few sites that had pups for $4,500 and they only had a few (like from 1 liter), then others had about 3 dozen pup pics showing they are available on oct 17 and price was 1/2 of the other site...

20090131145540AAwBbV9	Pets;Dogs	Bonding with my Maltese- HELP!?	Hi everyone- Thanks for looking at this question. I have a 6 month old Maltese named Louie. I adopted him after my first dog Charlie (pom-poo mix) passed away. Charlie was an "easy" dog- We bonded right away, potty training was easy, he was completely trained for obedience and off-leash. He was truly my best friend.  Louie is a wonderful smart little guy- :) He is now 6 months old - But still have quite a few problems with house training i attribute some of this to the UTI he is being treated for, and our recent move (total change in routine)- It's not his fault, it's ours and we're working through that.   A lot of times i feel like the "bad guy" in Louie's eyes as my fiance leaves most of the training and discipline up to me...Which is fine- Louie is my dog- and we have different outlooks on training...  I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for strengthening our bond? I have been looking into obedience schools or off leash training etc that he may enjoy-   Also what is an appropriate way to correct a dog? Are spankings okay? I'll admit i've spanked him a few times and definitely feel like he remembers and hates me for it! So i haven't done that again.   Thanks!

20081024020338AAoTOaK	Pets;Dogs	How do i stop my dog from running away?	this may be long but bear with me.       no matter what i do if we try to let our dog out to go to toilet, day or night, he slips under the fence and runs off. we dont live in a place with loads of traffic but there are a LOT of cars and lorries that drive WAY too fast along the road. if you catch him early enough he comes back if not you have to go find him. just this morning he went out and ran away went out looking for him and he came back 2 hours later-wether it was because we called him, he followed us, or what. we have another dog that goes out with him, so he shouldnt get bored, he knows all the normal commands like: sit, stay, leave, lay down, bed, fetch and even fetches his lead if you drop it. please help im worried he will be run over or wont come back.

They lay eggs twice a year and before they used to lay them on the bottom of the cage because they were scared of the next box. They then got used to it after some perch readjusting and use to investigate inside. Last week she layed an egg and today there are three inside. She is sitting on the eggs a lot! and only see her for an hour everyday if that, as expected the male takes her place when she eats. If everything goes well, how long before they hatch?????

20090131081519AAwgM4R	Pets;Dogs	Colloidal Silver for dogs?	Alright, so I have had my dog for a total of 7 years, I adopted him when he was 2.  2 years after I got him he started to get ill...about 6 vets, 5 different diet changes and more than $6000 later, he is still sick.  I did some experimenting (since no one can seem to help him) and took him off all of the medications he was prescribed and he is doing so much better.  He has more energy, his eyes are brighter, his fur is growing back in and he actually gets out of his comfy bed to "socialize".  So, I'm thinking that it's an auto-immune issue or an over active oil gland issue (I have to bath him twice a week and his skin is almost greasy (and VERY stinky).  I was going to start with the first with all natural medications like Colloidal Silver (an immune system booster) and Olive leaf extract (a natural anti-biotic)  Now, I've taken it before because I used to have chronic bronchitis and colds and I've gotten so much better so I do believe that it works, the one thing that I can not find out from my vet or the doctor who suggested it to me is...Is it safe to give to my dog?  Does anyone know anything about this?  Thanks for any help!

She'll walk around fine, but much slower. She can't jump on our couch, she can't walk upstairs, and she also can't jump up onto my parent's bed. We've had to pick her up and set her up on the bed/couch.   We took her to the vet yesterday, and she couldn't find anything wrong with her. She thinks it might be a sore muscle or pre-mature arthritis.   She told us to get 80mg aspirin, and give her one tablet daily.   How long should it be before she starts to feel better [if it's, in fact, a sore muscle]? And what other symptoms might be present if it's pre-mature arthritis?      Thanks!

20070316005726AAjrtFx	Pets;Other - Pets	Please help me see Jackie!?	It all started like this:  I love horse riding so my mum found me a riding stable in Malaysia.  When I went there the riding instructor got me the quietest and most obedient horse.  He is called Jackie and is a retired racehorse.       The first time I saw him I felt the warmth of his breath, the twinkle in his eyes and he raised his head to look at me.  He was the most obedient and sweet horse I've ever rode.  He is patient and sometimes quite playful.     Once, I was outside his stable when it started raining.  He was afraid I would get wet so he sheltered me by putting his head on top of mine.     Now my mum just keeps on saying it's far and no one takes us there.  I really wanna see him but it's just impossible.....     Anyone have any ideas?  Or maybe you could find me a cheap riding school in Singapore if possible?  Please and thank you!

20070101154447AADhkHX	Pets;Dogs	Dog training problems....?	I have a 1 year old German Shepard in one of my training classes, but he is afraid to walk in the door. Nothing bad has ever happened to him in the store, or any store in fact. He is fine when he walks onto the carpet, but freezes before he will walk on the regular floor. The only way we can get him into the training ring is to carry or drag him, which we don't want. Once he gets into the ring, he is fine. I am sure it is the floor that bothers him. It is just like any other store floor. We have tried treats, coaxing, commands he already knows, distracting him, getting him all excited on the carpet, tossing balls, everything I could think of. We even tried steak! Any realistic ideas to help him? I have been a dog trainer for 3 years and never seen this problem this bad. Help!
20070320060715AAvn2Qi	Pets;Dogs	Mange Uncurable?	Our vet was treating our dog for mange.  He went was treated with Ivermectin twice.  The medicine seemed to help but I think he needed more than the standard two dose treatment because he never fully healed.  He is suffering so terribly and we are going to another vet this week, but I don't know what to do if they prescribe the same treatment.  What do we do if we can't get the mange to go away?  Someone told me the dog will have to be put down if we can't cure it and he continues to suffer.   We would hate to do that.  He's a nice dog and my kids first pet.   We are constantly shampooing carpets and cleaning so as not to spread the infection.  He sleeps in a crate at night and when we are not at home.  Thanks.

20090131081603AAPoGxB	Pets;Dogs	Has anyone heard of and/or used the services of a dog behavior modification program called "Bark Busters"?	Supposedly, in one session, the trainer is able to address & eliminate unwanted habits such as excessive barking, accidents in the house, jumping on people, etc.      They say they will follow up any time your dog, or you, have a relapse and offer a lifetime guarantee. I have 3 Toy Fox Terriers and the trainer wanted almost a month's mortgage payable (nonrefundable) at the first session. For this much, I would hope the minimum would be a lifetime guarantee although I feel more comfortable if the cost of the program was prorated as the dog progresses or not.      I have not found one person, other than the Bark Busters trainer, who has used this program. There are few ads and they claim not to use the clicker method.      Any information you have would be greatly appreciated!
20090131082513AAHN3F8	Pets;Dogs	Beagle Not Sleeping - please help. ?	We have a 10 year old beagle, Shiloh. He's always been a good sleeper, sleeping all night, but he has not really slept at all the past 4 days/nights. He has allergies and takes prednisone & benadryl when they are severe, so the vet started him back on this two days ago but it doesn't seem to be helping like it usually does.   He's going outside more often too, up to 4 times a night. I'm thinking that he's "hot" on the inside or something (if that makes sense) as the vet said before that dogs allergies can do that.  When he's inside, he will not stay in one place more than 2 minutes before he's up looking for somewhere else to lay. Or he'll just sit in the kitchen (cool hardwood flooring) staring at me.  He's fine when outside, still running and barking with as much energy as usual.       Our vet is closed today, so I can't take him in. I just want him to have some relief. He stares at me with those big eyes and  I know he has to be exhausted. He usually sleeps through the night, right under the covers with us. Any suggestions?

20090131105306AAaUSOq	Pets;Dogs	Do you agree or disagree that it would be beneficial to alter some breed's Breed Standards to a certain degree?	PLEASE READ FULL DETAILS BEFORE ANSWERING         Before I get accused; I am not one of these "experts", who watched a one-hour documentary and suddenly thinks I know everything. I am a Veterinary Nursing Student who has spent most of her life with her nose stuck in books about dogs, dogs and more dogs. I like to think I have a fairly decent knowledge.      My personal opinion is, that as long as the breed standard does not harm the animal, then they pose no problem for me. But this is precisely where I think it should be altered; where it causes harm.      Such as very brachycephalic breeds (short nosed) like the Boxer or Pekinese. These dogs have serious respiratory problems, usually from a very early age and right the way through their life. I think an alteration (not a complete change) which will allow a longer snout to be acceptable could only be viewed as beneficial in the long run.      There are quite a few more examples. Anyone with a basic knowledge of dogs in general will know them.      I just want to make this clear; I am NOT against dog showing. There are lots and lots of very high quality, wonderful breeders of pure bred dogs out there. I am only against the breeding of dogs which will on-purposely result in pups with such extreme features that it damages their health. I don't see how anyone could disagree with this statement, anyone who loves dogs at least.
