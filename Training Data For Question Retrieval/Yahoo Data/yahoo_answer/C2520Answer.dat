67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	Go get one of those little rubber bouncy balls out of a gumball machine that are about the diameter of a quarter. Drop it in the gas tank and it will bob up and down because of the backpumping of the fuel injection until it gets sucked over the gas line. The car will go dead as if it's out of gas...once it is shut down and the ball floats back to the top it will crank again. The sweet thing about this is that it doesn't get sucked up against the fuel line immediately every time. It might go dead after driving it a mile...it might go dead after a few feet...it won't damage the car but it is a royal thorn in the a** to fix, especially in cars where the gas tank is under the leaf springs or right behind the universal joint above the drive shaft. It takes a LOOONG time to pinpoint the problem as well....by the time they get around to taking the gas tank off, the ball will be dissolved.    Cracking the engine block is easy too. Just as the poster after me said; run the car until it's glowing a white hot (take the radiator cap off BEFORE warming up the car because I've seen the manner that flesh is literally blown off from opening one that is hot...it's nasty). Once your car is blazing hot, while it is still running, pour ice cold water down into the radiator.

RcAofGkIaa	Learning to be independent doesn't happen in one big jump, it's a process.  First: DO NOT buy a new car.  You will be paying a lot of money that will be gone with depreciation the second you drive off the lot.  Look in your local want ads for cars you might afford.  Try to get a make with a good reputation for reliability (hint: Honda).  Ask your parents for a loan for how much you are willing to go into debt.  Put it in writing WITH a date where you expect to have the loan payed off.  This isn't being overly formal, it's showing you are willing to take responsibility for your debts.  Once you find a USED car that you like, take it to a mechanic.  For a small fee (yes, I know MO money) they will look the car over and tell you if it has any major problems.  Don't go to a used-car lot.  Your youth and inexperience will show no matter how you try to hide it.  I've had many used cars, and was pleased with all of them.

mKVFIklaaa	I'm going to say the Hyundai, and I'll tell you why;  The Hyundai looks really nice, drives well, they have a fantastic reliability record, backed by a five year warranty, they have very high spec as standard, the only known issue was premature rear brake pipe corrosion that was sorted under warranty. And they're cheap.  The only downside is the snob factor of a Hyundai badge.  The Audi A3 is expensive - it's dearer than eith a VW Golf or Seat Leon, and they're all mechanically the same.  The A3 has a pretty poor reliability record (along with the Golf): Audi/VW fall well below Hyundai in customer satisfaction & reliability surveys.

If an owner pays 30-35 grand for a BMW or Merc he expects totally trouble free motoring  so if an inch of trim comes loose or a dashboard light blows he considers it a reportable fault in a survey.  If someone pays 10 grand for a Korean family size car and the same happens he is not too put out because after all it is a lot of car for a little money so you cannot expect Rolls Royce quality and he probably would not report it in a reliability survey, thus affecting the figures.    I am slightly surprised at your short list as they are really pretty different cars but to be honest, bearing in mind their age, i would go for the Audi as the one likely to last longer and retain value better. I have driven both and prefer the Audi handling but that is only a personal thing. Give it another 2 or 3 years and i think you will find the Audi is aging the better of the two.|`|RlzC8mKhaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

This is the most common cause of road shakes. Also, if you drive on muddy roads, make sure that there is no mud build-up on the wheels. This affects tire balance.

TJ8fgBpWaa	Several things to consider:    1: make sure that you are using the correct replacement bulb. The owner's manual should have that information; if not, a Chilton's Manual should have that info.     2: Contacts: make sure that the bulb is installed correctly, tight, etc. Also, if you are concerned about corrosion, first make sure that the key is NOT in the ignition and that the lights are OFF, then take a very fine sandpaper (like  2,000 or emery-cloth) and wrap some around the end of a pencil, then lightly 'scour' the inside portion of the contacts, then put a piece of cloth on the end of the pencil and and clean out any crud/sanding dust left behind. Also, make sure that the contacts are tight enough to ensure good contact, no jiggling, etc.     3: sometimes the fuse is loose in the holder, so make sure the fuse is the correct amperage and that it is properly seated in the receptacle.     4: wiring: sometimes there's a nick or break or corrosion, so check for that.     5: the switch: sometimes you'll get, over time, what are called 'dirty contacts.' AFTER you've tried all of the above, and IF none of that works, consider replacing the switch. If you're not comfortable doing that kind of work, have a competent mechanic do it. If you go that route, have them check the rest of your electrical while they're under the hood, especially the ground strap from the battery and any corrosion on the battery posts.    Good Luck.  ..|`|WPYjdsA4aa	try a diffrent bulb,|`|FjgLglhoaa	are you sure it in right push in and turn to lock in place|`|AA10789216	It could be the turn signal switch.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	the socket itself might be bad. or a ground that,s only working part of the time.

HUluAQM3aa	Historically this is worth fixing.  The head gasket help for a seal between 2 areas of the engine.  The head and the cylinders come together and a thin gasket is used to help prevent leakage.    If your head gasket has failed then coolant can escape into the area normally reserved for the gas and air mixture that is ignited by the sparkplug.  It is not good when the head gasket fails but it is not unheard of.    The oil in the spark plug holes is another issue and not related to the head gasket.  As you have 2 camshafts in the head of the engine, your spark plugs are located centrally.  These "tubes" or holes that they sit in have to be kept free of oil that gets splashed around under the valve cover.  These 4 holes have gaskets that go thru many heat cycles just like the valve cover gasket and occasionally do get weak allowing oil into this tube.  Not a big deal and they can be replaced when the head gasket has been taken care of.    Engine oil can NOT leak into the combustion chamber by passing past the spark plugs.  It will collect around the base of the spark plug,, nothing more.    This repair does take a bit of time but Honda engines are simple in design.    You will need to purchase your gaskets from Honda only as they are all critical and the minor savings from after market gasket suppliers is not worth it in my experiences.    The Honda parts dept. can help you with the items you will need for the repair and I'd say the cost should be less than $150.  I'd change,  Head gasket  Intake manifold gasket  Exhaust manifold gasket can be reused as it's thin aluminum only.  Valve cover gasket and spark plug tube gaskets, typically sold together.    ONE MORE THING:  Get a second opinion on the bad head gasket.  I would have all four spark plugs removed and checked for evidence of engine coolant being burned.  If you have a head gasket leak and coolant is getting into the combustion cylinder then one or more spark plugs will look very clean compared to a normal tan/darkish soot color.  You can also have a pressure test done on the cooling system.  This test involves hooking up a hand held pump to the radiator cap fitting and pressurizing the system.  If a leak exists then the pressure will drop indicating a leak.  Depending on the speed of the leak will usually point to a few possible causes.    A head gasket job is big and before I would have this done I'd get a second opinion as I suggested just to be sure.  Most small garages can do this for a small tip while in the parking lot with you at the same time.    Good luck.|`|EISS0OKZaa	get plenty of dianosis. ir one from a mechanic you TRUST. i say fix it, that is  amajor repair but when its fixed CORRECTLY it shouldnt happen again for a long time. 1200 now is a lot less than a new car. even if you have to spend it again on another repair. plus youll know whats been done to your car and what wont break again for a long time. Accords are good cars and cheap to maintain when considering longevity comparativly speaking anyway. i would say if you take good car of it, meaning reccomended maintenance, i wouldnt be surprised to see you get 200k or 250k miles out of it.    again, cheaper than a new car, and you know whats not goign to break for a while.    Head Gasket - 1. keeps the explosion of the compustion inside the cylinders. 2. keeps the coolant seperated from cylider and oil flow. 3 keeps oil seperate from teh coolant and cylinders. 4. maintains cylinder compression.    note: a suprise cost may be a decking of the block or machining of the head. this only happens if the surfaces arent flat, which you need for the head gasket to maintain a proper seal.|`|YKQZ5RlOaa	A mechanic once told my wife the Xterra needed a head gasket job. he said that was the reason for overheating!  He wanted $1500.00 for the job!  We have an additional car, so I started to take things apart in order to find out why it was overheating.  The very first thing to check to see if it needs a head gasket is to see if white smoke comes out of the tail pipe constantly.  when oil and coolant mix, the oil looks like a chocolate milkshake. so check the oil!  Is this car salvaged?  I have a 1990 Honda Civic with 255,000 miles and hasn't giving me any problems.  Check the thermostat.  check the water pump to see if it's leaking.  do a compression test on the radiator to see if it's leaking.  I did everything I mentioned above and it turned out it was the radiator that was clogged!  I took the radiator off the car and the radiator shop charged me $20 to clean it.  It might not be the same case for your car but, don't believe everything mechanics tell you!!!  go over the things I mentioned above and who knows, It might be something else that you can fix!!!  good luck!|`|1SnI86BIaa	if the headgasket is shot    then you will have coolant leaking into the oil  or oil leaking into the coolant..|`|AioBp16Eaa	Hi  The head gasket is to keep the three ports from each other. When there is a crack between the ports the fluids get mixed up therefore burning antifreeze or oil. The oil has to drain down through those ports to be sent through the oil pump again. Same with the antifreeze.  Hope that helps|`|AA10331789	Your car is 13 years old and not worth having major repairs done on it. Your goal should be to keep it running as long as you can while your looking for a replacement vehicle. Nissan Altima is currently ranked highly by http://www.consumerreports.org, but it will cost 20,000 dollars brand new.|`|HwxBL1B1aa	sell this car for like $800 and use the repair money and buy a decent car|`|C6d4ndMOaa	105,000 miles is somewhat low for a Honda to start having problems; I have a '99 with 136,000 miles that still runs pretty good.     Well, if you absolutely cannot afford something more and may not be able to afford something for a while, the best thing is to have it repaired the right way so it can last you longer giving you time to save up for a new(er) car.
j0ZsYrUJaa	Sounds to me that your amp will just be powering your subs, right? The new deck and the speakers arent going to take much more power than your stock ones.  The 300.1 amp will require considerable power, but still nothing THAT drastic.  My guess is that at night your headlights may dim with every beat when you've really got it bumping, but your battery wont die -=IF=- you hook the amp up right. (necessary that you find the switched power for it)   Oh, and don't do the Cap.  Worst case scenario, a heavy duty amp.|`|AA11318686	I've got a car with a 100 amp alternator and a sony amp that puts out almost 2x a zx300.1 and I don't have to worry about it draining the battery unless i play my system for a couple of hours without the car running|`|u2QhQAxzaa	My battery was drained in around 4 months with a brand new battery, so I would get a capacitor.

But under the age of 16 you are only allowed to drive a boat at 5 miles per hour.  After 16 you are fine to do whatever.  Just make sure to read up on the laws for your state pertaining to life jackets and where you can drive faster and where you have to slow down.    EDIT: BTW you can not drive a boat by yourself under the age of 12.|`|kMmyPDTLaa	Every state has its own boating rules, laws and regulations, and the boating class requirements for obtaining a boat license or safety certification will vary from state to state.     All persons born on or after July 1, 1972, must have in their possession a certificate of boating safety education to operate a numbered or documented vessel (including personal watercraft) legally on Marylands public waters.    The certificate of boating safety education is obtained by successfully completing a boating safety education course or passing an equivalency examination approved by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. The certificate is valid for the lifetime of the person to whom it is issued.    Persons required to have a certificate of boating safety education must have the certificate on board and available for inspection by an enforcement officer whenever operating a vessel on Maryland waters.    Those born after July 1, 1972, are exempted from the above requirements if they:     Are licensed by the U.S. Coast Guard to operate a commercial vessel or    Visit Maryland for 90 days or less in a vessel from a foreign country or    Are a resident of another state boating on Maryland waters for 60 days or less in a vessel properly registered in their home state and    Are at least 16 years of age or    Have proof that they have passed a boating safety education course approved by the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators.   No one under 16 years of age may legally operate a personal watercraft, even if the person possesses a certificate of boating safety education.    No one under 12 years of age may legally operate a vessel towing a person(s) on water skis, an aquaplane, a parasail, or a similar device.|`|RjUhISEIaa	You just got a ton of chitty responses on this subject, didn't you?    Virginia does not issue a license but sets out the guidelines on who can operate a vessel and at what age.     You may operate a jet ski from the age of 14 on. You must though have passed a boating safety course and carry your card with you while on the ski at 14 and 15.    Now, you asked about driving a boat. Believe it or not Virginia does not state at what minimum age one can pilot a vessel. You do though have to take a boating safety course and successfully complete it.    To learn more on the regulations go to    http://www.boatus.org/onlinecourse/state...    Remember too...if you are boating on the Potomac River you must also abide by the laws of Maryland and the District of Columbia.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	no you need a boat license...  and get it at your local DMV  and I'm not sure about age...but if you have a drivers licesne I'm sure you are old enough for a boat license.|`|ldI8DRu7aa	um i dont think so...you need liek lessons on a boat n stuff to get a license liek u got for the car...so no i dont htink you can drive a boat with ur license you need a deff one|`|IggGQ4GEaa	if I'm not mistaking, you need a boater safety course.

The requirements of age depend on what type of boat and it's power source.  A boat powered by oars or sail (less than 18 feet) do not have an age requirement.    Virginia boating laws can be found here:  http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/boating/    In Virginia, all boats propelled by mechanical propulsion (steam, internal combustion, electric) and all boats over 18 feet must be registered with the DGIF.

AA11908567	Read your insurance certificate, or for a definite answer phone your insurance company and ask them.    My last one insurance company let me as mentioned on my certificate, but my current doesn't allow this option.|`|AA12334360	no, you'd have to check the individual policy.

Teens must hold (and practice driving) their permit a MINIMUM of six months.  For adults (18 or older) it's either that additional information is required prior to taking a drive test OR the specific office is unable to accept new appts.    The solution is to call the DMV when it first opens.  Be sure to speak with a live clerk; do NOT use the automated system.

GLKeyUucaa	For a gasoline engine truck I would suggest the Toyota Tundra, a full sized, reliable pickup with a huge V8 with plenty of towing power.    I would recommend a Diesel truck for towing your 5th wheel.  My top recommendation is the Dodge Ram with the Cummins turbo deisel motor. This should tow your campe with ease.|`|5a17c1e159a1681eebe1f67713262a9faa	Any one ton dually would be your best choice for pulling safely. Now, choosing gas or diesel is a matter of opinion. However, the diesel will pull more sufficiently and efficiently|`|L9LkdThjaa	Diesel- Chevy or GMC Duramax Diesel    2. Dodge Cummins Diesel with the 6.7 liter turbo diesel|`|S9QyF6NQaa	any 3/4 ton would be plenty sufficient gas or diesel, depends on camper size, 4 wheel drive would help due its heavier duty suspension
ZGgh4yJ1aa	The 16 valve has more area for air to pass through, during normal driving you're limiting the amount of air that the engine can consume. At higher rpm the engine will benefit from the better flow. Aside from more area the valves in the 16 valve are lighter, requiring lighter springs, which helps them last better, and allows other internal pieces to be lighter as well.
dVQdswtTaa	You get a certain amount of power from a certain amount of fuel. Different injection systems can effect fuel consumption, but probably not greatly.     If you install a system that more efficiently burns the fuel, then you can either burn less fuel, or burn the same amount and get greater power.|`|ZGgh4yJ1aa	You have to burn fuel to make power, I bet the newer engines are more efficient per horsepower.|`|dh0nDXuSaa	it depends on the injection pressure. the higher the pressure the better and faster the burn. the newer injection systems can produce much more pressure than say the older injection pumps. computers have also helped diesels come along way, adjusting timeing, pressure ect to the driving conditions

And I will drive by, give them a wave and a toot of my horn, and be on my way slapping my thigh and laughing like a hyena.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Drivers of SUV's do that whether it is snowing or not.  That is just my experience, but all the more I do not like it.  The thing is many drivers of SUV's believe they are the kings of the road.  They feel that just because they have a large massive vehicle they can get that close to you and intimidate you based on their size.  Its not right, and it is a bad practice for driving.  What drivers should do is back off, give space and don't be immature as it relates to driving.  That is how accidents are caused especially in the snow.  When you drive that way when there isn't wintry weather there is a risk for an accident, but in snow the accident risk doubles because you are battling the elements.  Its a bad idea drive that way.|`|XYOYml59aa	Im mean, I will slow down, don't care how slow, I don't care if they get mad at me. I will slow down for a red light or a stop sign really slow. etc.     also don't say that about ever suv driver! I drive an suv and don't normally do that ever. Also its not just suvs, you probably just see more suvs because they are used for work a lot and when people get paid by the customer, they save time however they can. Also watch minivans, im not sure if it is just here,  but minivan people tend to be crazy!|`|slHUNl58aa	I sure wish it was SUV's only. I live in snow country and the long haul truckers are the worst here. They are just huge and don't give a flip about anything smaller than they are. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part the truckers and UPS drivers suck the worst here.|`|83b60f2fdd03f49375b7489077add40baa	They are ignorant to the fact that they have no idea how to handle their vehicle and how much more damage and injury they likely will cause than an average car.  But those of whom said they slow down intentionally are only causing more of a hazard and that is not wise or safe either.  Some people feel this need to go out in bad weather when their vehicles are not equipped anywhere near properly for those conditions, therefore they drive at an extremely slow pace and do become a nuisance and even a hazard to those of whom are properly equipped.  This can be as unsafe as the SUV driver who tailgates in comparison.  I'm not saying this is necessarily what you do.  I don't drive an SUV either, but my vehicle is properly equipped for winter conditions.  And for the one who commented on tractor-trailers, the trucks don't handle any better than cars, but it seems cars increase in making some very unsafe maneuvers around trucks in that sort of weather.  Trust me, the truck drivers don't want to be anywhere near you when you go sliding into the median because you're trying to send a text message about how much snow is out there, that is, if they even see you because most of you don't bother turning on your headlights either.
fhwzDoeoaa	I live in Florida, also. You must be 15 years old to get your permit. With your permit, you must drive 60 hours with someone who is 18 or older in the passenger seat, and 10 of those hours must be night driving. Once you turn 16 you may get your real license, but only after you have had your permit for at least a year. You would get your license at the DMV, Department of Motor Vehicles, and you can find your local DMV at http://www.flhsmv.gov/. Hope this helped!|`|mh0QRDE9aa	You probably have to be 16 yrs old.

If you can get an engine from a pick your part junk yard you will save even more.

It was supposed to start Feb 16th but a company GM uses for some parts is going bankrupt is is being a bunch of A-holes with returning GM's tool to make said parts.    Anyway, IF production doesn't get pushed back again you should start seeing some trickle into dealers by April.|`|AA12040660	The v6 is still more powerful than the pathetic 2010 V8 Mustang with only 315.

I think that it is a really good first car. In my opinion, at least the z24, looks descent with the stock sport body kits. It has enough power the accererate descently and has pretty good milage. One of the best things is that parts are really cheap. I replaced both rotars and pads for only a hundred bucks. Hope this helps.|`|4YzNH4sZaa	Honda Civic is always a nice choice. Very safe and reliable, plus the newer ones are pretty stylish.

First time drivers usually have much more expensive car insurance, and it depends from car. You should compare insurance rates while choosing the car - for example here - carinsurance.deep-ice.com
vF0botDuaa	Craigslist is a good place to start, for cheaper priced stereo equipment. Atleast you get to hear the system before you buy it. A few things to look for...1. check the gain on the amp. If it's turned all the way up, it's been played hard. Not a good thing. 2. Push lightly on the subs. If you hear scratching, DO NOT buy them. 3. Push on the subs one at a time, check for movement of the other sub. If it moves, it doesn't have a divider in the box. You won't get great bass response out of a box with no divider.    As far as speakers are concerned, go with a good name brand componet set ( polk, kicker, alpine). You can buy a good set for $150~ $175 new.      Choosing a sub depends on what kind of music you plan on listening to. For rap, I'd recomend a 12" sub. It is a well rounded sub that will provide a wide range of bass.     If you find something on CL and are unsure, e-mail me and I will be happy to give you more advice on quality and fair price to offer.

9496974db835ff1a0850895b0709efe8aa	Listen, skippy - it's NOT a 1969 Camaro. Those cars are more distinctive from the 1967-68 cars.    For one thing, this is a Camaro Super Sport, which can be seen due to the SS in the grille.    It's also equipped with the Rally Sport package, which included hidden headlights.     So which year is this? A '67 or a '68? Good question!    If it was an illustration of a stock car, it would be easy to tell. However, the stripes are incorrect - they were only available on the Z/28. The SS received different stripes, and they differed between 1967 and '68.    The grille also is slightly different for 1967-68, and this one makes me lean towards the '67.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	looks like a 69 camaero SS, start saving now and you will be able to afford one by the time your in your mid 20's|`|ndVtjPKYaa	It appears to be a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS.

A manual is not as easy to drive.    an automatic has p-park,d-drive,r-reverse,-n-neutral,1,2, and 3 or maybe L.    basic function is drive. drive position powers the car forward. reverse does the opposite.    there is a gas pedal and a brake.  the gas makes it go and the brake makes it stop.    use the blinker too. it should be on the left of the steering column.  buckle up for safety always.    pedal control is important. so is steering the wheel.  practice in an area where you know you cannot hit anything at all.
E0j6mhqhaa	Fuel injection has nothing to do with rebuilds.  Fuel injection and carbs do exactly the same thing, mix fuel and air in the proper amounts.  FI just does it more exacting, reducing emissions.  FI won't give any more power either but it may give slightly better fuel mileage.
dCeo0rkOaa	Here is a great website that has exactly what you are looking for. They are real stories from 1970 to present day. Here is an example of one of the stories.     29 January 1985; Galaxy Airlines Lockheed Electra; near Reno, NV: The aircraft was on a charter flight from Reno to Minneapolis. Shortly after takeoff, aicraft vibrabration caused the crew to reduce power and execute a return to the airport. Shortly after reducing power, the aircraft lost airspeed and entered a stall, crashing near the airport. All six crew and 64 of 65 passengers were killed. Three people initially survived the accident, but died within a month of the accident. The sole survivor was a 17-year old boy who was thrown from the wreckage.           Here is the site if you want to check it out.     http://www.airsafe.com/events/survivor.h...|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	I've never heard of a single passenger escaping the fate of his fellow travelers owing to a rail accident.    I do know of instances where a single crew member has escaped with his life.  There were at least six crewmen killed (members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen [BLET]) as a result of collision last year.  Two of whom burned to death, trapped in the flaming wreckage of what was a locomotive cab only a few moments before it became a crematorium.    Idiot motorists on grade crossings risk many more lives than their own and that number could reach into the many hundreds if their criminal act results in a major conflagration.      If you see someone go around the gates, get the license number and dial 911, the same as you would to report a drunk driver, who themselves are a menace to society.  I know the penalty varies from state to state, but here in the Golden State, if you get nailed for going around crossing protection, the penalty is nearly the same as a first time offender for drunk driving.|`|5O7op0oIaa	Presumably, single-engine Cessnas and the like, which only require a crew of one, have had their share of accidents leaving one survivor.

AA10286987	Yes the whole engine will just bolt into the place of your stock B18. If you have B18a (non-vtec), your good to go. You will have to use your old intake manifold and all its accessories, old distributor, engine harness, clutch assembly, and engine mounts, i think you have to swap the mount on the timing belt side also. and probably exhaust manifold, alternator and powersteering. Your going to use just the block and head assembly and reuse your old engine parts. Thats a good price, Good luck with the swap.
ndVtjPKYaa	As far as the color scheme goes I think it would be fine, but expect to pay anywhere from $2500-$5000 for a good paint job assuming there is not much body work to do on the vehicle.  You can find place to paint it for $500, but the job will look terrible and the paint will fade very fast.    By changing the color of the vehicle you also devalue it.|`|YVEt4wVxaa	yeah it would work
gFHTcIc8aa	Tranny mount missing a bolt????!!!!!  Damn right you'll get some vibration.  What happened to the bolt? Did it fail? Loosen and drop out?        You should get some sort of explanation.  Bolts just don't fall out of mounts.  It's a good thing that was disovered becasue loose mount bolts can result in serious secondary damage to rotating components.  It sounds like other mounts are already damaged as a result of 1 loose mount. I would get them repaired immediately.  The problem will only get worse.    Have mechanic show you damage and give a good explanation why they came loose.    Also, ask mechanic why he can't replace missing bolt and retorque (or replace) other bolts only (rather than the mounts)|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you can find out which 1 is bad. have a friend look at the engine mounts while you hold the brake and power block it. if the mounts are bad then the engine will raise up. having a bolt missing is enough for the engine to vibrate.|`|ndVtjPKYaa	It sounds like you should replace both the motor and transmission mounts.  I'm not saying that is the only thing causing the severe vibrations, but it will definately eliminate a few of them
fa030cbb4d523cc426cc52a20d628143aa	I have been researching the same.  I am very interested in the TDI's. Living in Europe we have been driving TDI's for a decade, the mileage is great and now the diesels of today are very clean.  I noticed that the price of diesel in the states was higher than gas, and I took this into consideration. Even with the higher price "Now" for me in the long run it would still be a worthwhile investment.  However what happened in Europe when the TDI first came out was that everyone started switching to TDI cars because they were so much more fuel efficient. This created more demand for diesel, and diesel went up in price. The government noticed a drop in revenue from gasoline sales and increase the taxes on diesel fuel. Then they said diesel pollute more, so another tax, know diesel pollute less so they are going to another tax.   2 years ago you almost had to special order a gasoline engine, because everyone wanted a diesel. Now the taxes are set up that it really does not matter. The cost and savings are from which vehicle is cheaper to maintain, and it's resale value. Diesel are stronger engines, so if I do allot of heavy hauling the life span is longer.     I would pick a diesel over a Hybrid any day. I do not see where adding a set of heavy batteries and a electric motor is going to be long term cost effective. Sooner or later the batteries will have to be replaced and sooner or later the electric motor will also need to be replaced.     Best of luck.|`|HZGao294aa	I'm not sure where you live, in the area of California where I live, diesel fuel sells about 10 cents more than premium fuel and based upon the financial breakdown that I did for 2004, a Jetta GLS with a 2.0 liter (non turbo motor, base gasolene engine) vs a TDI 1.9 GLS, the diesel had a lower operational cost advantage of 7% vs the GLS gas engine.   This however, did not take into account the depreciation factor, which for the diesel engine is a lot lower.  If one took depreciation into account, the cost per mile is about 22% less than the base gasolene engine (2.0 liter non turbo four) GLS.    This takes into account all factors: i.e., insurance, maintanance by the book, fuel cost differences (in the area that I live), milage differences, etc.  But, the figures would change greatly if diesel fuel costs $1.00 more than regular per gallon .  Keep in mind though, that the depreciation factor (in the past anyway!) has been much lower for the TDI than the same equiped model with the gasolene engine.    My guess is that, it would be close to a break even, however, it does not take into account the emissions warranty factor which in some states like California covers certain items for up to 10 years or 150,000 miles.  This may be enough to tip the cost per mile in favour of the diesel motor (assuming of course) if it were kept for the normal lifetime of the average consumer.|`|dilfbqz1aa	Better value? Not really. I drive an 06 Golf. The price difference over the base gas engine wasn't that great ($1500 or so), but the diesel will be worth much more over it's lifespan. Check the prices of used diesels vs 2.0 engined cars and you will see a big difference. But....    I live in PA and I've been tracking the price of fuel for about 1 year. For all of that time diesel has been more expensive, right now a gas car that gets approx 33mpg will equal my diesel 44mpg in $/mile. My friends Honda Civic gets 38mpg. Toyota Corollas, Hyundai Accents etc. will get close to that as well. As long as the gas/diesel cost ratio remains where it is any car that gets in the mid to high 30's will beat me.    However, there are some nice things about a diesel you may not be taking into account.  1) I only fill up every 600 miles.  2) I got the car chipped and it is way more fun and has more power  than ANY car  that gets decent mileage.  3) Diesel engines last a lot longer than most gasoline engines.  4) Resale value is much higher than 4 cyl gas engine models.    There are also some bad things.  1) Sometimes it's hard to find diesel stations - or diesel stations that have the smaller car-sized pump nozzles.  2) Maintenance - these cars are different! Not every mechanic knows how to work on them, in fact few do!    In short, diesel ownership may be best suited for people that are mechanically minded, otherwise the car and your wallet can suffer, who do a lot of highway driving and who like a car with some oomph when you press on the accelerator . That's me.    You can find a lot of TDi information on sites like   http://forums.tdiclub.com/

GF8OkaqXaa	Its so hard to say without actually seeing the car. A radiator is something or nothing to be replaced but it depends which part of the car chassis he means. If it is bent or twisted in anyway it should not really be driven but people don't always abide to that i know i don't. He may mean the slam panel (a big metal girder running behind the bumper) or he could mean subframe damage either way i personally would get it checked out.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i doubt it that the frame is bent. it might be out of alignment. change the radiator and take it to alignment center and they can tell if the frame is bent. he was probably talking about the radiator support was bent but you can straighten it out.|`|ndVtjPKYaa	I would be willing to bet that he is talking about the radiator support which is a welded on component that supports the radiator etc.   Depending on how bad it is, you might be able to just replace the radiator.  If the radiator support is severely damaged, then it must be replaced in order to replace the radiator.|`|ubj2hZWZaa	if the frame is bent up kissing the engine then the radiator won't fit 'cause the radiator goes in the front. if it ain't bent so far then your good but don't speed with a bent frame.|`|YVEt4wVxaa	Your daughter just cost you money because she sucks at driving.

It depends on which frame is bent, if the radiator can be supported and you should no have a problem. Depending on the car, radiators sit on some kind of a frame, I am guessing that is what he is talking about, but in most cases it can be fixed pretty easily, unless its broken. If its the body frame, it is not something that would bend easily I dont know if a snow bank would bend the frame. If posible get a second opinion especially if he is asking for alot of money.  http://www.surehandsusa.com|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	possibly but you would have nothing but problems|`|LnzxpeFgaa	You would most likely go through tires alot faster for the fact that it would be out of alignment|`|lHteMxSCaa	No, not safely.  Sure you could replace the radiator and drive it, but with the frame bent, it will drive really strange and be very dangerous. I wouldn't let my daughter drive it.     At the least, tires and other parts will wear out very quickly as they wont be aligned anymore, and the car will drive erratically.    At the worst, The damage may cause stress on vital parts like brake and fuel lines, causing them to fail suddenly, causing a flaming wreck. Flaming wrecks are cool in the movies. In real life, with your daughter driving, not so much.
LDcp1Wgraa	Your mechanic is trying to rip you off.  There are no such thing muffler bearings.  You would only need bearings in a part that had moving parts.  As mufflers don't have moving parts there is no need for bearings.  I would suggest reporting your mechanic to the local chapter of the Better Business Bureau.  Good Luck.|`|AA11914369	Muffler bearings are in the same category as blinker fluid and halogen headlight fluid, not to mention metric crescent wrenches and left handed money wrenches.

I do this on my big bike all the time on the open road.|`|LxRq2zYPaa	Has nothing to do with the engine. Basically when a car is moving, its pushing all the air in front of it out of the way. So this process actually slows the car down from the force, causing you to accelerate more to continue on the speed you wish. Drafting is when the car in front of you is pushing the air, but your close enough behind them that the air continues traveling from the exterior of their car, over the exterior of your car. Minimizing the force on YOUR car, from the air in front.    Heres a diagram, its hard to explain well. http://i.a.cnn.net/nascar/.element/img/2...|`|GF8OkaqXaa	Drafting is where you get so far up someones **** you have minimum wind resistance meaning your car has more power as nothing is pushing you back.

I have worked on too many sport type bikes owned by men under 20 shall I say that were beat to death by 12000 miles.  The valves are bent or broken, the main bearing scorched.  Why all this damage?  Because young men do not have patience.  They start a bike up then right away start either revving it up really high to impress their friends or take off right away and do 60 mph within the first few moments.  They never give the oil a chance to warm up and circulate.    I would say, LISTEN to the engine, if you hear any noises like knocks, or hisses then pass on the bike.  LOOK at the bike-are the fork seals leaking?  Easy fix if you are mechanically inclined but difficult without the proper tools and a shop will want $200 to replace the seals. Look at the gaskets and seals around the engine-this is not a Harley, so you should not see any fluids leaking anywhere on the bike.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	it all depends on how the bike has been taken care of|`|kyYztNoUaa	i would say around 5-10 years with proper matience i had a uncle who has one from 1993|`|Fr4pkogcaa	Both of those are great choices for first bikes.    The engine lifespan is going to be dependent on how well maintained it was. If the seller has service records it is a huge bonus. Oil changes should be at least every 3000-6000 miles for the ninja, slightly more often on the GS. If they are well cared for you can expect 50-60 thousand miles from either engine.    check out www.ninja250.org and www.gstwin.com for more info.     Dave ('05 GS500)|`|72ddVB2iaa	David D is probably pretty close on miles. With any luck, you could go twice that on a bigger bike, but I don't know about the high revving little Ninja.     As far as years, I find rubber parts and things like fork seals, intake seals, and fuel lines starting to become an ussue after maybe 7 years or so. I have has some really old bikes that were still going strong after 30 years with what looked to be original factory parts.     It's really hard to give you a straight answer.     If you learn to wrench, little things like that won't bother you, and you will also save a ton of money. A new clutch is going into my GSX-R1000 this winter. I will save hundreds and hundreds of dollars doing it myself.     Get a factory manual with whatever you buy. You won't regret it.
vA07XhcKaa	Auto mechanics are a dime a dozen. There are fewer cycle mechanics and since it is a more specialized field, you could potentially be in bigger demand. With auto dealerships closing down and mechanics competing for the same job, you would have an edge. Also, which do you like more, cars or cycles?

If you drive around with your rear brakes engaged it will wear out the rear brakes very quickly.

It can even start a fire because the rear brakes can get hot enough to ignite the brake fluid or rear tires.|`|TsJoADGPaa	yes, it causes your e-brake to wear out prematurely.

pcGMifL4aa	It completely depends on who the instructor is, and how he feels at the time. In some cases you will complete the written exam, then get someone who demands demonstration of several skills and a drive around the block. Sometimes the instructor just wants you to avoid running over some cones in the parking lot while driving forward and backward. When its a busy day he may just have you do a few quick maneuvers and then let you go with a good grade just to keep the line moving.|`|WEU6hrrzaa	You have to demonstrate basic skills.

Most people buying a new car already have a caar, and that insurance covers another car purchase for however many days the policy states.    When you buy a used car, the dealer might tack on the cost of insurance to the cost of the car. If he does this, he will tack on insurance for the term of the loan -- that means if it's a three year car loan, he will tack on 3 years insurance.

In most states you should transfer your auto insurance from your old vehicle before getting behind the wheel. If it's a new vehicle and you've never had insurance before you should get quotes from a variety of insurance agents before driving it off the lot. Make sure you have the vehicles information (make model mileage etc) before getting a quote.  Additional info, such as a clean driving record, may help you save on your premium.      If you're financing the car the finance company usually will requires several coverages before they will finance you.  Also ask about "gap coverage."

zotCYH89aa	Do you mean soldering an eye or spade terminal that you've crimped on the battery end (or frame for ground) or are you trying to "tin" the end before you insert it in the amp's clamp connection?   If it's the former you need a 60+ watt iron or a butane torch, and I highly recommend soldering crimped connectors. If it's the latter don't do it- tinning the ends makes it much harder for  the screw clamp to stay secure and you usually strip the threads. Leave the wire bare.   Hope you put a fuse on that battery end BTW.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Warm the wire and crimp joint with a soldering iron. Apply solder to the joint and keep the soldering iron on it until the solder flows into the wire and the joint. Solder can help to keep the joint tight, but if the crimp is good and tight, the solder won't improve the connection other than making sure it stays in place.
d9ECb7N8aa	It can't. There is no chance of that happening. It is like saying that your getting windshield washer fluid in your crankcase oil. The only way it could happen is if someone poured it in there.    How did you come to this conclusion?    The oil could have just been over-filled slightly, or you have another fluid mixing with your oil (coolant). I guess one possible way is if the radiator has a cooling coil for the transmission and the coil leaked tranny fluid in to the coolant, then the coolant is getting in to the crankcase oil...|`|5xxuKzXPaa	the two systems do not even pass each other at any point. a ford dipstick has been marked wrong since 1983, some read high and others read low. even the power steering fluid (which is also AFT does not pass close enough to do this. i could understand if your AFT or power steering fluid was mixing with the coolant but not the oil.    if you look at the path that the oil takes through out it cycle, and the AFT in its path, you will find that the mechanic was right.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The mechanics don't only "act as if this can't be happening" - they absolutely KNOW that this can't be happening.  Assuming that there is transmission fluid in the engine, the only explanation that makes sense is that someone put the transmission oil into the engine.|`|oiW7wZkuaa	I hate to answer a question with a question, but ....how do you know your crankcase is filling up with transmission fluid?    Like everyone else has said, and I'll say it too, it's impossible.    What I would do if you suspect contamination of your oil is to have it changed along with the filter.     What color is your oil? If on the chance you're getting *coolant* leaking into the oil (a definite possiblility), the oil will have a milky whitish or brownish color. Also, you may notice your coolant level going down for no apparent reason. To check for a leaking head or manifold gasket take your Explorer to a good, locally recommended shop and have them check the cooling system ...tell them you think you're getting coolant in the oil.

bB5ZPtvvaa	no,  basically a dress up package.  the 330's like most BMW's are decent handlers,  but generally not fast or performance oriented.  The 330 is rated at only 231hp at the crank (much less at the wheels) and is a relatively heavy car.  0-60 times are only so-so (at best in the range of 6.7 or 6.8 sec) and top speed is about 150mph.  Mid band (passing power) is fair.  From the get-go it is therefore slower than most Japanese sports sedans and American big 6 cyl. sports product.  Japanese and American sports product are all certainly much faster (and regretfully have higher dependability ratings than the BMW).  For proper performance most BMW's require a mild boost supercharger installation (there are bolt on installations available for most models) to make them the contenders they should be (vs. taillight chasers).    regards|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	SAME AS NOW SEEMS YOU HAVE MORE DOLLARS THAN SENSE|`|e81171eddde7606d000e3d0085a82ad0aa	sprot package does not affect preformance all it does is add nicer rims, a spoiler, and sport seats.

wqeAeSVYaa	It depends on who's repairing your car.      If it's a shop of your choice, yes, it is usually a check and a kiss goodbye.  Unless you request follow up for a specific reason, for example the shop is taking 30 days for a 7 day repair.      If it's a shop recommended by the insurance company, there tends to be a little bit more oversight on the repair process.    Ultimately, the most oversight should be done by YOU, since it's your car.  You can always discuss any unresolved problems with both the shop and the insurance company and they will both probably be happy to help you.|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Car or home.They generally will evaluate what the damage is worth and cut you a check.End of story.|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	Is a body shop does bad work they will steer away from it.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	If it's YOUR insurance company, they'll follow up.  If it's someone else's, they'll leave you alone, BUT, that claim payment gets recorded - so if you EVER total that car out, the adjuster will be able to know that there was prior damage, and how much you were paid - and it will be subtracted from the value of the car.

I suspect that you should get that level at least in the vicinity of the cold fill mark or you may be leaving tell tail puddles every where that you park for a short time.|`|skfHV92caa	If you have a simple overflow bottle. What will usually happen when that tank is overfilled is it will overflow onto the ground when your cooling system builds pressure.  It usually doesn't cause a problem, but if you want to remove some of the fluid you will have three options:  One: remove the two nuts the attach the bottle to the frame and pour out some fluid.  Two: take a siphon pump and remove fluid this way.  Or three:  just allow the tank to overflow when the cooling system builds pressure.  Hope this helps.

They took forever and put the wrong size on not even the size I paid for. Little bitty car tires on my truck. Also,  I specifically asked them to be sure to put my tire valve extensions back on so that I wouldn't have to pull the hubcap off every time I needed to check the air pressure, so of course they threw them away. And the tires were crap. (that another story)    I would have never let them do the job in the first place, but it was a saturday and I had to drive to the mountains that day. Next time i will just drive on the damned rims until i can get to a real tire store.

The engine must fit in the car, not all engines such as a mustang engine will not fit in a toyota camry or a honda civic won't fit in a galant. Go find someone reliable selling a car for around 3,000$, they are usually reliable, around 120,000 miles and will last you over 2 years. It will be a better deal for you, if you buy a crappy 500$ car, prepare to spend money in order to keep it running.

I"m actually in the same boat because my Nissan lease is almost up and I'm going to have to get another car. I've been looking into getting another Altima or possibly a Maxima. If you go on Nissan's website (www.nissanusa.com), you can look at the features that are available.    My Altima is a 2006, and I've put about 46k miles on it (I drive constantly), and have never had a problem with it. It also came fully loaded (6 disc Bose surround sound cd player, moonroof/sunroof, side impact air bags and front impact airbags, anti-lock breaks, steering wheel controls for radio and other features, all leather, and power everything, etc) all for under 30,000 (prices are for CT, some other states might be less for the same model). If you want to look up the model I have, it's called the Altima SL (they have a newer body style now too.. really cute... and they even have a hybrid i think!).     Nissans run very well, and you don't have to worry about them getting bailed out by the government. I loved the Altima, but I am actually going to look into the Maxima next time around because it is a bit sportier.     Good luck with your car shopping!!!!

EfejPjIMaa	If your V6 is only running on 4 cylinders, then it has something to do with your ignition system (spark plugs, spark plug wires, or coil).      The first thing you can do is make sure all of your spark plug wires are tight (don't come off easy).  If that is good, then the second thing you can do is take each plug wire off one by one and put it close to the spark plug, then start the car.  You should see a spark from the center of the plug wire to the spark plug.  If all have spark, then it is a spark plug problem.  If they don't all have spark, then it is a plug wire problem or coil problem.      At this point you can start switching plug wires to see if it is the wires.  If you do this and all plug wires are good, then it is in the coil(s).|`|39ixfEIraa	get a chevy.....94 mustang of my own, and between my car and everyone i know with fords, they are nothing but problems|`|w3EwRNYQaa	try new plugs or plug wire's.it might be in the coils.have it checked.|`|NaUesQ9caa	Check the firing order.

skfHV92caa	If it is a factory alarm, try using the key in the door to lock or unlock the door.  This usually will disable the alarm.If you have an aftermarket alarm system installed, you may want to look under the hood for an extra horn that is usually visible.  The horn will have two wires usually one black and one red.  You can cut the black wire to remove the ground circuit from the horn and the horn will stop blowing.  However, you may want to keep in mind that with an aftermarket alarm system, it may be connected with the starting system on the car.  So you may have problems there.  Disconnecting the horn will only affect the horn and not the rest of the system.    Hope this helps.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Unfortunately part of the alarm system detects when the battery has been removed.

It should turn off by pressing the door open button on the remote or by putting the key in the ignition and turning it to the on position.|`|ln6A3ITtaa	Hahaha my 94 Crown Vic used to do something similar every once in a while.

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	The tax credit is not new - it was signed into law with the Energy Policy Act of 2005.    The hybrid or alternative fueled vehicle has to have been purchased (or financed) new, and not used or previously owned. They cannot be leased (the leasing company is the owner so they get the credit, not you). Also, they have to be predominantly used in the US.    How much of a US Federal Income tax credit you'll get will depend on what model of hybrid you purchased, and the date of the purchase.    See:  http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...  http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...  http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax_hybri...  to see if your particular hybrid and its purchase date is eligible for a US Federal income tax credit.    (The hybrid vehicle income tax credit has a sunset/phaseout provision, based on the date after the calendar quarter that a manufacturer sells 60,000 hybrids since the start of the credit (Jan. 1, 2006). There is a letter-writing campaign to remove the sunset/phaseout provision on the hybrid vehicle tax credit:  https://secure3.convio.net/ucs/site/Advo... )    If you are an individual claiming the credit, you will need to fill out IRS Form 8910 Alternative Motor Vehicle Credit: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8910.pdf (You will also have to do an AMT calculation as well, which means that you'll also have to file Form 6251 Alternative Minimum Tax -- Individuals, http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f6251.pdf , and that may reduce or even eliminate this credit on you...) This will then go on your Form 1040.    If for a business, you will need IRS Form 3800, General Business Credit: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3800.pdf    You can only take the credit in the tax (calendar) year that you purchase the new hybrid. You cannot roll over any unused credit to another year.    Your individual state may also offer state tax credits or deductions as  well, so you should also check in with your individual state.  http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/progs/te...  http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incent...      Or are you asking for another country?  Canada:  http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/environment...|`|RVX5uALYaa	Hello!    Hybrid car tax incentives are not new!  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 replaced the clean-fuel burning deduction with a tax credit. A tax credit is subtracted directly from the total amount of federal tax owed, thus reducing or even eliminating the taxpayers tax obligation. The tax incentives for hybrid vehicles apply to vehicles purchased or placed in service on or after January 1, 2006.    Hybrid car tax credits are only available to the original purchaser of a new, qualifying vehicle. If a qualifying vehicle is leased to a consumer, the leasing company may claim the credit.    Not all hybrid cars are available for tax credit. For instance, the Toyota Prius.     You can find all the information on tax credit on http://www.hybridcarfreak.com/news/hybri... and http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...

All the cheap wire is not true to the awg it says it is. (ie; cheap 4awg wire is usually 8awg wire with a 4awg size insulation around it) You are mostly paying for copper which is at an all time high right now so the good wire is not cheap. Oxygen free wire does not conduct current any better than regular wire, it is less susceptible to corrosion due to the lack of oxygen inside the insulation but can still corrode where the copper is exposed at the terminals so use of an inhibitor is recommended.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	almost any kind that has oxygen free copper in it to allow for better electric flow in the power and the ground wires    go with either street wires or rockford wire kit, they both have oxygen free copper wires in all of their kits    check ebay for good deals.|`|zotCYH89aa	Almost all brands are the same, meaning cheesy, hyped and overpriced.

Not sure if they make 4 guage.   Try looking in your local yellow pages under electrical supplies, and look for a vendor that sells to end users/retail. Most of those places have the generic "amp king" brand, available in red or black. Half the price of the big boys and little difference.
c48nm70gaa	Samantha, First of all a new Moog pitman arm at any autoparts store or autopartswarehouse.com costs $65.00. With the aid of an inexpensive *pitman arm puller (free rental at Auto Zone) they're super easy to change yourself. You can purchase a pitman arm puller at any auto parts store too.      A private mechanic could slap a new one on in les than 1/2 hour. Save your hard earned money. Tell your Governer I voted for her!|`|i5lk5eN2aa	The Chilton labor guide manual lists 1.5 hrs labor to change the pitman arm on both the 1500 2WD and K1500 4WD 1998 GMC Sierra, which includes removal and reinstallation of the steering box. The close proximity of the steering box to the frame makes moving the steering box necessary for the pitman arm puller to get a secure bite on the pitman arm but most mechanics will change that pitman arm in 30 minutes or less by just removing 2 of the mounting bolts from the steering box and loosen the 3rd mounting bolt and then drive a wedge between the steering box and frame to rotate the steering box enough to attach the pitman arm puller. You would still be charged the full 1.5 hrs labor... but even so, that certainly does not account for the $700 you say that dealership in Alaska estimated to do that job.     The retail price of a new Genuine GM pitman arm for that truck would be about $100-$120 (plus tax) at a GM dealership and the hourly labor charge at most GM dealerships would be about $95 an hour. Even figuring the hourly labor charge on the high side at $110 per hour (times 1.5 hrs labor = $165) and the price of the pitman arm on the high side at $125, at most that job should cost no more than $290 plus tax. And add at most $65 if the toe on the truck needs adjustment or about $160 to do a front alignment on the truck. Even all that does not come close to the $700 you say that dealership in Alaska estimated to do that job.|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	Exactly as said above.  A $200 to $350 job (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hour job including the realignment).       Your car is out of warranty, why are you paying to get ripped off by the dealer.  Ask friends, neighbors or relatives who have or know of a good competent local automobile repair shop and go there.  Alaska is usually higher but OUCH!|`|YqjQMUB2aa	If your truck is a 4x4 the steering box may have to be unbolted from the frame (about a 2 hour job).

L4aLnz1haa	autoinsurance.hotusa.org - try this one. I have their car insurance and, as I know, they can provide such a service.|`|t5ToQzN3aa	Under FSA regulations you may cancel the policy within 14 days of inception or receiving the full policy wording (whichever is later).    In theory you are allowed a full refund but insurers are allowed to make a small charge to cover their expenses. Details are in the policy document (page 39) however you will have to look at the schedule as the policy document states    "? If you cancel within the 14 days of it starting or within 14 days  of receiving your documents (whichever occurs later), return  any premium you have paid less a cancellation fee. Please refer  to your Schedule for our current cancellation rates."    Personally I think that this breaches FSA rules about treating customers fairly as you have to buy the policy before you can find out the cancellation costs.    If you still have the car, of course, the fact that the car is no longer insured by Direct Line will be added to the MID (Motor Insurance Database) - and be replaced by the new insurer.

HFrsH9MRaa	There are only a couple of things that cause this problem. First of all, in really cold weather, it is possible that the thermostat has frozen and does not open at the right temperature. Also, if you have not been using genuine Toyota/Lexus coolant, you may be in for BIG trouble!! You cannot mix different engine coolants together, tragedy will result.  I have seen holes in Honda heads caused from using the "green" coolant, looks like Swiss cheese. Make sure that your anti-freeze mixture is at least 50% coolant. Also, check the space between the radiator and A/C condenser.  Road debris ALWAYS collects here and begins restricting proper air flow to both systems. If you are lucky, you may just have an "ice" spot somewhere inside your cooling system. You should bring the car to a heated garage. Overnight, the coolant should thaw out and someone can take a reading of the coolant to see how low it can go. This is probably a good time to have your cooling system flushed out. BUT USE ONLY GENUINE TOYOTA/LEXUS COOLANT!!!! Never believe that ther is a universal coolant or that all collants come from the same manufacturer.  This is totally wrong information, believe me. I have seen it ALL!!! Good Luck!!|`|GXrHjEgvaa	Get it in to your dealer right now or you'll have one of the most expensive brick anyone has ever had.|`|62cd15e7dc30e5e43a4f70a570fbd353aa	sounds like a cracked head,or blown head gasket. compression in the cylinder blowing back into the cooling system possibly.|`|YqjQMUB2aa	Your car IS overheating or maybe a head gasket problem|`|1T8kOC1waa	If you mean the water is backing up and bubbling from the coolant system, then you very likely have a head gasket (going or) gone.

H2H|`|de60565995a7f29e41d87d0421edb32eaa	When your engine gets hot the fluid expands and goes into the overflow container, as the engine cools down it is sucked back into the radiator.    The overflow container has an air hole and it sounds like it is plugged or something.    Maybe a head gasket problem where air is being forced into the coolant line.   That is something worth having a mechanic look at.|`|wP7do1RIaa	idk??? srry...

If you can't do the install yourself find a shop that specializes in nothing but car audio, not one that deals in computers, appliances, etc.
AA10698633	Assuming that the transmission is going to be fixed, then that should be the least of your worries.  The question is then, how is the rest of the van?

You are sadly right, the van with the new transmission will not be worth as much as the $3000 cash at trade in time.

ZWzcrdn0aa	Generally speaking, seats over the wing do experience a somewhat smoother ride.  Also, there is less of the "seesaw" up and down during climbs and decensts.  Structurally, the strongest part of the airframe runs through the area that connects the wings to the fuselage and to eachother.    Its true that seats over the wings will be near the center of the cabin.  If you have the opportunity, just ask the ticket agent for a seat over the wing.  They should know which ones those are.    Another hint is that there is often at least one emergency exit at the wing to facilitate exits.  The emergency exits are often marked on the seating charts.    You might also consider seats on the interior aisles so you'll have fewer visual cues and physical sensations that might be uncomfortable to you during turns.    Finally, do let the flight attendants know that this will be your first flight and that you're a bit skittish.  They are superbly trained and will know how to make you comfortable.    Keep in mind that the most dangerous part of your trip will be the car ride to and from the airport.    Here are a couple of little books you might find helpful if you have enough time before your flight:    Brown, Duane.  Flying Without Fear  Smith, Patrick.  Ask the Pilot    Have a good flight!    P.S.  Oh, by the way, you may notice that during the flight the wings will flex slightly up and down.  This is entirely normal; the wings are designed to do this.|`|fCOq04lNaa	Do you have a seat number? Check out:  http://www.seatguru.com    Traditionally seats on or near the wing tend to experience less turbulence than seats in front or behind the wing.     Also for fear of flying-Remember that you're far more likely to get killed in a car crash as opposed to a plane crash.
AA12338485	In this particular example, you likely have a lot of inherent speedo error in your car.  As previously mentioned, all speedo already come with some error in them already (up to 10%).  Given the speed you're going, I suspect you've also done some modifications to your car that affect speedo (e.g. change in tire size, gearing, etc).  Also, given the speed you're going, I suspect you were (more or less) driving in a straight line which would minimize the GPS errors.  So in this example, your GPS is more accurate.    You can use your GPS as a speedometer but you have to understand its limitations.    First, a little background on how most consumer GPS receivers take measurements and compute speed (I won't go into the technical details)... GPS receivers take measurements every second to compute your position. In order to compute velocity (i.e. speed), it'll need two positions and then difference those positions over time. So you'll need two position solutions to get velocity.    Now having said that, a lot can happen in that 1-second interval (e.g. twisty roads, quick stop/acceleration). So GPS works best as a speedometer when you are going in a straight line at a constant speed. Any other situation will have some lag and may take some time (on the order of seconds) to catch up.|`|jR6QWSfraa	the GPS gives you the exact speed, I drove truck from stat to stat and   I have 2 GPS in the truck the GPSs agree on the speed I say GPS from my experience, will let me prof it this way, if you take the GPS in your hand and walk with it  it's going show you the speed right way as soon as you start moving . but in the car if you see the speedometer and from stop start moving slowly you will see the car is moving and the speedometer dose not move right way.|`|lgjIwUftaa	a speedometer is usually off by an average of 10%  I drive a truck and have a mobious computer on the dash.it tells time of day date motor rpm's and speed. When I go thru speed trap trailers, the ones that tell you how fast you are going, the computer is dead on every time while the trucks speedometer is usually off 3-5 mph. I hope this helps you. Also I hope where you did your 106-125 mph, things were safe for all involved.

y93R1Na1aa	Approximately 36.5". They will be 255mm wide, or about 10" wide.    (TW)/(AR)R(RH)    TW - Tread Width  AR - Aspect Ratio  R - Radial Tire  RH - Rim Height    Height = TW*AR*2+RH    Once the tire is loaded, it has a different radius (smaller). Once you start rolling, it will get taller the faster you go.    To keep the same height and move to a 255mm width, you would need an aspect ratio of 45. Make sure you check the backspacing, or the tire will rub. You will dramatically change the way the vehicle handles, so you may want to research this more.    Try www.tirerack.com for advice, compatible wheels, and great prices. Even if you don't buy from them, you can find the required backspacing from the wheels that they recommend.|`|eefdd2d971d42ad1ee9556089354b3dfaa	Here's a good site for tires.. http://tirerack.com
y93R1Na1aa	Go to www.tirerack.com to get an idea of what different tires cost, and read reviews of how they perform. Sometimes your local tire dealer can get you a better price because they package the tire with the mounting and balancing.    The cheapest tire is usually cheapest for a reason (not that the most expensive tire is the best). Going to a junkyard or used tire dealer can be trouble because the tires don't balance well, and the wear isn't matched. It's also likely that you will not be able to find the same type of tire on your car. If you are strapped for cash, then you have to do what you have to do.    I highly recommend 4 matched tires. Rotate them so they wear evenly. Your car will stop faster, accelerate faster, be more stable at high speeds, corner predictably, and it will be less likely to spin out in bad weather.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	hundred and 1/2|`|k55p1pKraa	I believe you should be able to pick one up for around 85 to 100. bucks.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	That depends where you buy it.

HFrsH9MRaa	What kind and year of car is this??? In my neighborhood there is an alternator rebuild shop. There, they can press in and out new bearings. On a good day they charge me $50, but it depends on which alternator made by WHO! The good thing about this is that if this is a foreign car-maker, e.g. Bosch, I can purchase genuine Bosch bearings and have them installed together with a good cleaning. Good Luck!!|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Are you sure it's the bearing? I ask this because a shorted diode will often create a slip/skip type noise that mimics a bad bearing pretty closely.  Your most accurate estimate will come from an auto electrical repair shop in your area. You might as well count on new brushes and perhaps some commutator work as well.  Compare the estimate with the price of a rebuilt unit and then decide.|`|fO5JWKMlaa	you dont just change the bearing. you change the whole alternator. with a rebuilt one.    probably 100-150 with the core so youre looking at maybe 300|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Depends upon the alternator.

dQrBlk4qaa	UTI is a very good school for learning auto mechanics. You should look into the specific programs and see what inspires you. You can also look at the local technical colleges - they also are a good place for learning trade-work like you're discussing.    Additionally, there's nothing like ground experience - pick up a few books on performance tuning import engines, and pick up a fixer-upper to wrench on. Even if you go to school for it, there's nothing like a lump of steel at home to do some "homework" on. Most of my teeth-cutting was done on my college car - an 80 Datsun - I couldn't afford a mechanic to fix stuff, so I learned it all myself. The hard way. From there, I moved up, and picked up body work experience (first with Bondo, then with repairing the steel correctly).
Xea4tc3laa	Driver, I used to do the same thing for Gainey Transportation in Grand Rapids MI.    They didn't run me enough miles to keep up my cell phone, but they did subscribe to IdleAire. Just being able to talk to my wife and kids was enough to get me through the 4 weeks I had to spend out on the road. Something with an internet connection might be good, because then you can log on, and blog about what you've seen that day, and how stressed out you are. One more thing you might want to try, is to not drive for 3 weeks. Limit yourself to 2 weeks out, if you can. Good Luck.|`|AA11264416	well i don't know how common it is but its probably more normal than some people think, im sure you just have to get used to it and yes im sure getting a laptop will help because you can talk to your family and friends while sitting at a truck stop or rest area, you can get a laptop with a built in webcam or buy one that goes on top of the lid, i did try trucking but only real problem i had with it wasn't homesickness, it was more of the face that if im paying good money for things i want to be able to enjoy them more than 2-5 days a month if not less, i did local delivery where i delivered building materials to construction job sites and ya i was home everyday and wasn't to bad but wasn't great money

Previously I had to travel 20 miles to work (~30 minutes) and 20 miles home (~45mins to an hour in rush hour).

y93R1Na1aa	Buses get about 2-5 MPG, with an average of about 3MPG for a conventional bus and 4MPG for a hybrid bus. Assume 40 people, and that's about 120-160MPG per person. An empty bus just gets 4MPG. If there were no cars, the routes a bus would have to take and the time spent empty would offset some of those gains, so figure the additional inneficiencies and under-utilization would take mileage done a fair amount. Assuming it's a fraction of about 50%, you could say 70MPG per person on average. And it would be pretty safe, relative to everyone driving their own cars. The number of barrels of oil saved would be enormous.    Trains are even better because of their steel wheels and lower aerodynamics losses. A system that used trains between hubs and then buses to move people out to where they need to go locally would be optimal.    However, I'm not giving up my V8 without a fight. I favor cellulosic ethanol, which is essentially gas made from trash (plastics, food, paper, etc.). It's coming to a pump near you in a year or two for about $2 a gallon, and there is an endless supply of trash in this country.    BTW - GM is the leader in Hybrid buses, and saves more oil every year than all of the Prius's combined (assuming Prius owners bought a Camry).    Addendum: School buses get better mileage on average than the Greyhound types I was talking about. 7.4MPG on average. See the link.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Then the buses sure would be crowded and we'd need bigger buses.  Plus diesel prices would skyrocket, & bus fares would be more expensive than dining out.|`|kXUwDLgWaa	It would be a bustastrafee|`|wSq80V1xaa	It would be impossible for everyone to take a bus.|`|t4F59gf2aa	Who are you Al and fat Tippers unwanted spawn?

TxV2DRpNaa	Your Radiator is clogged!|`|HFrsH9MRaa	It is also possible that the radiator fins are clogged up from years of road debris, in which case a good thorough cleaning at a power wash should do the trick!! Also, I hope you have been using only genuine Nissan parts and NOT aftermarket. If you haven't you are begging for trouble.  Also, be sure to replace the engine temperature switch if it has one! The most common problem here is that unknowing people over time have mixed several different types of coolant and internal corrosion is the result.  After you have resolved your problem, USE ONLY GENUINE NISSAN COOLANT DESIGNED FOR YOUR VEHICLE!!!. Anything else may cause severe component corrosion and failure. There is NO such thing as a universal coolant. Never believe anyone who tells you otherwise, it is simply not so! Good Luck!!|`|ZgmuayXnaa	Take the radiator out and take it to a radiator shop.....most time it is just stopped up and they can clean it alot better than you can.

c48nm70gaa	The truth is chain brake shops see you coming. They find every possible reason to talk you into new junk off-shore brake rotors and charge you more than if you'd purchased a good American or British brand. You can't beat EBC (British) or Wagner or AC-Delco (American) brake rotors. Brake pads should be ceramic based to save the rotors from needless metallic pad grinding of the rotors and needless brake dust filth left behind.|`|TxV2DRpNaa	is a Quick fix really something you want for your BRAKES!!!|`|AA11404742	What town?  What state?  What country?    Try checking them out at cartalk.com's Mechanics Files listing.  The knuckleheads at the Cartalk radio show have a database on their website that lists mechanics that people have used, and that they recommend.  Plug in your zip code, and see who in your area has been recommended.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	It always depends on who engineered your car in the first place. Sometimes an aftermarket pad improves a car, but not very often. It is usually best to stick with the actual manufacturers pads and rotors, especially if it is Japanese or Euro. American is a little different. You might ask the shop if they will install your own parts. There are a lot of rip-offs out there, so be very careful!! Many shops these days are using rotors and pads made in China to save money.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, but I question the workmanship. Good Luck!!
y93R1Na1aa	If you have any plans to use a truck bed, get the Avalanche. It is an incredibly flexible vehicle, but better on the road than off it. If you had a house, and no other truck, then I would say get the Avalanche hands down. Don't underestimate the ability to haul stuff. If you have a dirt bike or 4 wheeler, get the Avalanche.    If you are thinking about turning your car into a serious off-roader, get the Wrangler. Also, you can get a manual in the Wrangler. I'd recommend it because they are cheaper, and they last way longer than any automatic Chrysler makes. I think the Wrangler looks better, too.    So: Avalanche if you need the bed, Wrangler otherwise.    Make sure and check the insurance, and factor than in too.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	The avalanche, it is a more stable vehicle|`|7b2RJq47aa	Jeep Wrangler would be more fun to drive.

RTBvQJHbaa	If you have a bad bearing on your alternator, there is going to be more damage to the bushing maybe the rotor and field coil.  As a tech your best be for length of service is to replace the alternator it's self and get a warranty,  being a certified  I can count how many times I've done that bearing swap on one finger, the problem is there's not going to be any protection if you mess it up....  It sounds like you have a little knowledge but the bearing should or at-least better come with the new one already to go, take belt off unplug negative battery cable, remove serp belt and anything that's interfering, then un-hook all electrical connections to the alternator a small flat head might be needed for clips on some of the newer ones. an engine size would help to next time.. past that its basically put the new one in and hook every thing back up, if you have a dvom make sure your getting 14v or a little better, there have been a couple of times I've go new ford alternators and had them bad out of the box. it should spin smooooooth and have no real noise out side or in..  good time to change serp belt and tentioner .|`|lcg1u1U7aa	It might be cheaper to just replace a bearing in an alternator but no one does that, you buy a remanufactured or new alternator.  You did not say how old your Mustang is so I don't know if it has a belt tensioner or not.  Unless it is a classic Mustang it will have a tensioner and you will need a 1/2 inch flex handle to detension the belt so you can remove it.  After that you just remove the wires from the alternator, unbolt it and take it out.  Be sure to check all of the pulleys to be sure they rotate freely without any bearing chatter.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	If you are going to do your own work and want to learn,pick up both the Haynes and Chilton repair manuels for your car.Haynes is for the driver and Chilton is for the mechanic.Between the 2 you can get most things done.

AA11607373	If someone is telling you about what happened during Pearl Harbor, they're old enough to remember when Japanese cars were small cars that were "affordable" which translates to "cheap." During those days the cars that were great were American muscle if you wanted fast and European cars if you wanted finesse.    The G37 is nowhere near the M3. I'm sorry but the comparison wouldn't fly anywhere. The G37 is comparable to the 330Ci, w/ its dual turbo 6 cylinder, but not the V8 powered M3.    People don't hate Japanese cars, they're more inclined to hate the things Japanese cars represent. People say the Asian auto manufacturers are taking money away from the American companies. In reality, Toyota and Honda both have American plants and produce vehicles here in the US. Those plants aren't closing either so they're keeping Americans in their jobs! People who say that they would not buy anything Japanese because of previous wars should not buy any TV's or any other electronics also because international trading has made it far easier to produce items, especially electronics. A lot of electronics have parts imported from non-American countries, including Japan.    I plan on getting a Korean vehicle once I graduate. I remember when no one dreamed of owning one... hahaha...|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Most people don't hate Japanese cars or they wouldn't be best sellers.Don't listen to other people,make up your own mind and buy what "you" like.I have a 91 Acura teggie and 2 pontiacs,the integra is my favorite cause it's fast,reliable and corners like a slot car.I live for corners.|`|AA10698633	This is a time warp ! 50 years ago people held bad opinions of Japanese products because of WWII,  but I have not heard any of this for the last 20 years.  On the other hand nobody but nobody says anything bad about Japanese cars (even those made in the USA.)  The biggest problem with Japanese Cars is that their prices are high.  (but most people say that is the price of quality)  Do not know about Japanese cars and chicks.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	They don't want their pride hurt simply because their country doesn't make as reliable and overall decent cars as Japan. Then you get the idiots that put fibreglass bodykits and carbon-fibre hoods and massive shopping trolley-style rear wings and all that jazz on their Jap cars...that's why they're hated. And an R34 or R35 GT-R will DEFINITELY pick up the chicks. Don't listen to those "haters" mate.    Critics will also put down Japanese cars over Euro cars simply because it's not as an involving drive. I completely disagree. In fact Nissan/Infiniti would make the most involving driver's cars in the world. Not to mention the Acura/Honda NSX and Integra, the NSX in particular went out of production some five years ago and still rips it up in motorsport, and the legendary GT-R "Godzillas"

bLjGM9yNaa	If you trust your mechanic, you really shouldn't need to ask      for your parts back. And that's what it all boils down to.        Yes, you have all the right in the world to ask for your parts back,             but basically, you've just insulted the shops integrity from the start.         Just my opinion here.|`|AA11264416	they don't have to give them back but if you ask for them then they should, but they're not obligated to give you the parts back if you don't ask fro them|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Any good shop will give you your old parts back.Always ask for them anyway.|`|ggpf6AZuaa	usually if you take your car into a shop they have you sign a contract and in fine print they will have a place for you to sign if you want any parts returned so if you dident specify then they are not obligated to return any parts|`|KRunjrzNaa	usaly they dont take the parts that work out|`|ece6164651e8c46ee0724690594ca683aa	In NY state they must return any parts if you request that, unless there is a core charge.

If any broken part is replaced, you can ask that they retain them for you to see/ dispose of, but as most parts now have to disposed of very carefully there is a duty of care here present to make sure that the old (sometimes dangerous parts) are disposed of correctly.    If you think that the work has not been done properly you should have that investigated. I for one do not pay anyone to remove working parts and replace them with duff ones!
AA11264416	yes you have to actually stop first, look and then go, you probably yielded and rolled through the light and thats why you got the ticket, not saying thats what you did im just assuming since thats the only real reason i can think of, but maybe it was a mistake also and it just thought you were running the light going straight, if there's a number you should call and say what happened|`|kXUwDLgWaa	You must stop 1st, then count to 10|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	1.

I'm sure that you made the turn safely and, let's face it, your ticket is the difference between "the letter of the law" and "the intent of the law."  Anyway, local and state municipalities are feeling the economic crunch and tickets are a pretty lucrative way to fatten up the coffers.

bB5ZPtvvaa	generally shop rates are at the top of the scale,  so basically   1 up to 2X the shop rates for American product,  and Japanese product.  Parts are similiarly very expensive.  The BMW is a decent car,  little weak on performance end but good handler, however dependability ratings are so-so,  therefore if the car you are considering is off warranty or this is a long term purchase there is no question maintenance and repairs will be much higher....and likely repairs more frequent.    regards|`|Run7dyraaa	Lots more expensive.

4vsYprP4aa	Yes you can still buy a car without a credit card or bank account. Although if you have no credit card or any bills, your cradit may not be good enough for them to give you a loan to get the car. What you need to do is go to the dealership and tlak to them, they will talk you through everything and let you know what you can and can't do. A piece of advice, I'd take someone with you who knows what they are doing, so you don't get a bad deal.

They cannot make a profit and they will answer all your questions including exactly how to get a loan. They are strictly regulated and will not rip you off like a dealer or a bank might.  If they say you are not credit worthy then DO NOT BUY ON CREDIT FROM ANYONE ELSE.  If the credit union will not lend to you then you are "sub prime" and will get ripped off by someone else.    Steady employment and a good salary are necessary for a car loan.  Everyone has a credit score if they've ever paid a bill or had a credit card.  You just don't know what it is.  The credit union will help you.  Do not go to a commercial bank or dealership.  DO NOT GO TO A DEALER.  Go to a credit union and buy the car through their broker.|`|KwY0EveSaa	yes you need a credit score. you need a good credit score. one of the steps to buying a car is for the salesman to check your credit. if you have bad credit, then you might be paying a whole lot more money than you have to for the car, or you might not be able to get the car at all.    if you don't have a credit score, then you might not be able to get a car until you get some good credit.

f5ibT3WNaa	Sounds like you've got the plug wires crossed up . If  it was running before you pulled the plug wires then you put them back in the wrong place.|`|cViFUALzaa	there are three possibilities, a burnt ignition switch, a burnt crankshaft positioning sensor, or a damages cap and rotor.    the first thing to check is the cap and rotor for cap and corrosion, new cables have a different resistance than your older ones, if the cap and rotor contacts are burnt or worn, you wont get any spark, get a spark detector and test that there is spark going to the distributor and to the plug connectors on the cap, if there is spark to the center plug but not the the individual cylinder plugs, the pick up coil inside the distributor is bad.    next check voltage to ignition coil. probe the positive lead to the coil, also prove the ground, you should be getting 12v to this plug when the ignition is on, if no voltage is found, the ignition switch, not to be confused by the ignition cylinder, is bad.    if there is voltage to the coil, check the coil for resistance, you should be able to find Ohm specs for your coil and test with a multimeter.    if none of this works, suspect the crank position sensor, you can test by finding out its resistance and testing with the multimeter.|`|09affeac55dbe7c8b68c339feb29879faa	If the firing order is correct. Remove the coil wire so it does not start. Then take off one plug boot at a time. Lay it against a metal part (exhaust manifold) so you don't get shocked. Have someone turn the engine over to verify a spark.  Then do that to all cylinders and you will eliminate the wires are connected or not.  Some times the boot is not connected or seated to plug or distributor cap correctly especially with new wires.  Some times the firing order gets turned around when looking at the book. Number one is always toward the front.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	because its a ford....sell it for a real truck....|`|FjgLglhoaa	yeah you dont have the cables on right should always do one at a time you can get photos and help here      http://autorepair.about.com/|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you said you left the ignition switch on overnight? you might have burned up the module.

d1b265ad147a9439b694bc5df27f6064aa	Firstly, to correct the person below a 2009 S40 comes with a 4 year 50,000 mile warranty.     Secondly, it might seem smart to some people to go to an independent shop to get your Volvo fixed. It seems they eventually get towed to my dealer after someone that is not familiar with a vehicle messes it up even more.    The S40 is a reliable car. All cars have their little gremlins. The car you are looking at has been out since late 2004. Majority of all the bugs I have seen with these cars have been worked out.    Volvo, just like BMW, Mercedes, Audi is a Luxury car. It does cost more money to maintain than an average Ford, Toyota, or Honda.    If you have any specific questions you can e-mail me     rwkiepura@yahoo.com|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Volvos are probably one of the most expensive cars to maintain. Parts are outrageous and the dealerships charge nearly twice the normal labor rate. Any Volvo built after the late 90s is junk. Things break on them that never break on other cars. The engines and transmissions will last forever, but the rest of the car will drain your wallet. If you like the car, buy it, but get rid of it after the warranty expires. Your wallet will thank you.|`|UKNmZsU5aa	The 2009 Volvo's are very reliable. They have come a long way since Ford took them over in 1999 or 2000. The S40 is a great car, really good gas mileage and has a nice luxury feel. The new Volvo's come with free scheduled maintenance for 3 years, so maintenance won't kill you. Also, it has a 3 year, 36000 mile warranty, which can be extended, so parts won't be a problem either.   Good luck, have fun and enjoy your car (if you buy it)    Edit: you shouldn't go to the dealer for maintenance. it's much smarter to go to an independent mechanic after the warranty expires. Parts don't cost much if you buy them from Ipd (ipdusa.com) tons of parts and really low prices. There are also lots of other sites like vlvworld.com.   Volvo's definitely are NOT junk now, they were in the early 00's. But Jaguars, Mercedes, BMW, etc. have expensive problems too. Every luxury car will cost money to maintain. Especially Jaguar, in the shop every single day. Volvo's aren't even close to that. They're very nice cars.|`|fiuMwrHHaa	If You Want Performance DONT BUY  But Its A Nice Ride I Have A 2007 S40 2.4  And Its So Slow But Other Than The Lacking Engine Great Car Two Thumbs Up  P.S Would Be Best To Buy Certified Pre-Owned,You Would Get It Way Cheaper I Saw A 2008 Volvo S40 T5 For 17999|`|t8oKrh8paa	they are very nice cars, i test drove some bu the back seat seemed to be to cramped, i test drove one with turbo and one with out, i would go for the turbo.

I have had Volvo's since the 1988, they are very reliable. 2 years ago my old 1994 840 turbo blew the transmission. with 200,000 + miles. Never had any major problems with it. The car can be quite expensive to maintain and repair, but i think its worth it.

HVQFVtelaa	Those 2 lights should always come on when your car dies. They just mean: no oil pressure, and the alternator isn't charging. When your cars stays on, they should go off.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	When your key is in the on postion, and your engine is not running, the alternator will not be producing voltage, and there will be no oil pressure.    If those lights are on when the engine IS running, then you may actualy have a problem.    The cause for the engine to stall is likely not related to those systems, it coudl be, but there is no reason to suggest they are just because those lights came on after the engine stalled since they will come on EVERYTIME your engine stalls.    Your car is probibly running rough because one or more sensors are not functioning correctly as they are now over ten years old.  You need to run diagnostics to figure why the check engien light is on, in the mean time try checkign the air filter to see if tis dirty and replace the fuel filter if you havnt in a while.|`|DolkCwxIaa	Last month I had the battery (volt) light come up.
