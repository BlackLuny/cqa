T94oeKvaaa	Hola amiga<br>  Primeramente lo que pienso sobre los ovulos anticonceptivos, es un metodo de control de la natalidad con un alto porcentaje de fallas, alrededor del 40%, en mi practica privada lo recomiendo en asociacion del condon, cuando la paciente tiene algunas limitaciones para el control natal mediante metodos hormonales (pildoras, ampollas parches etc.)<br>  <br>  Existen diversos tipos de estos ovulos, es evidente que el principio activo de los ovulos (siendo medios oleosos) pueden ocasionar molestias al disolverse en la vagina, pero siendo la finalidad, el control natal, no debe interesarte lo que piensen los demas cuando dices ( "se hace un cochinero") <br>  <br>  Cuando vas a tu Ginecologa, vas porque confias en ella, supongo que debe ser asi, porque te preocupa que ella se entere, es mas cuando una mujer tiene problemas de leucorrea (flujo de color y olor anormal) el especialista, al encontrar rezagos de estos fluidos en el fondo de tu vagina, permitira la orientacion del diagnostico, sin recurrir a analisis especializados y que a veces son dificultosos para la paciente.<br>  Sobre el sabor, lo mejor seria preguntarle a tu pareja si es que, le es incomodo que tu uses este metodo de control natal, la comunicacion con tu pareja debe estar por encima de los dimes y diretes.<br>  Si consideras que te ha servido mi respuesta, calificala.

Fumar es un vicio, y es muy dificil dejarlo, porque la nicotina que contiene te hace adiptivo a ella, la cual a la larga te producira el cancer de garganta, o los pulmones.<br>  Desde el punto de vista cientifico la marihuana no es nada sana al igual que el tabaco ambos son nocivos para el organizmo...la cosa es que la marihuan hace que la mielina que es esa capa blanca que recubre las neuronas y hace que se trasmita la electricisdad de neurona a neurona desaparezca por lo tanto perdes coneccion neuronal es decir te volves mas tontito....por algo se llaman estupefacientes dividi la palabra y te queda adicccion a la estupides ...por otro lado el cigarrillo hace que te falte oxigeno envejeces mas rapido por lo tanto te perjudicas igual solo que con uno ni te das cuenta porque te quedas con menos capacidad para razonor.y con el otro sos conciente de todo.  El estudio descubrió que el cannabis da?a tanto los conductos respiratorios superiores, como los peque?os conductos de los pulmones, encargados de transportar oxígeno. Es por eso, dice el estudio publicado en la revista Thorax, que los fumadores de marihuana a menudo tosen, estornudan o experimentan presión en el pecho. Tal como dijo a BBC Ciencia el doctor Carlos Luna, de la Asociación Latinoamericana del Tórax, "es un estudio novedoso, porque presenta datos con una precisión que no se conocía". "Pero también confirma datos que se conocen hace tiempo sobre la existencia de sustancias tóxicas en el humo de la marihuana, similares a los tóxicos del humo del tabaco", agrega el experto.|`|33b0466827df48ceb6f4168d96489931aa	Ciertamente, dejar el cigarrillo es uno de los retos más difíciles que jamás tendrá que enfrentar.

Romper un hábito de toda una vida requiere fuerza de voluntad y compromiso. Puede que no sea fácil pero sabemos que usted puede hacerlo.<br>  Ciertamente, dejar el cigarrillo es uno de los retos más difíciles que jamás tendrá que enfrentar. La nicotina es una sustancia sumamente adictiva. El simple acto de fumar puede ser, a la vez, reconfortante y difícil de romper. Romper un hábito de toda una vida requiere fuerza de voluntad y compromiso. Puede que no sea fácil pero sabemos que usted puede hacerlo.<br>  Acrilamida <br>  Acrila… ?qué? Es el nombre que los científicos han dado a un compuesto bastante peligroso responsable de una alarma alimentaria hace tiempo. Provocó tales protestas que los fabricantes de alimentos tuvieron que eliminarlo de sus productos.20<br>  Más adelante, se produjo una queja similar cuando se reveló que los trabajadores que estaban excavando un túnel de ferrocarril estaban expuestos a la misma sustancia simplemente por realizar su trabajo. El motivo era simple: la acrilamida es cancerígena. Provoca cáncer.21<br>  Qué lástima que nunca se haya armado un escándalo semejante por los niveles de acrilamida que se encuentran en el humo del tabaco. Está ahí 21 y tiene capacidad para destrozar la vida de millones de fumadores activos y pasivos. ?Pudiera ser que por ser sólo una de las cincuenta toxinas cancerígenas de cada cigarrillo, nunca haya estado en los titulares?<br>  Usted nunca había oído hablar de la acrilamida hasta que leyó esto. Pero es otra buenísima razón para alegrarse de dejar el cigarrillo. Y una razón incluso mejor para estar decidido a que esta vez, se mantendrá sin fumar.<br>  ácido prúsico<br>  ?Ha oído hablar del ácido prúsico?  A no ser que sea usted fan de Agatha Christie, el ácido prúsico (alias cianuro de hidrógeno) posiblemente sea todo un misterio para usted. Pero ?podría adivinar lo que pasa luego en esta novela? Sí, adivinó, el ácido prúsico no es sólo un veneno favorito de los criminales despiadados de las novelas policíacas, también acecha con intenciones mortíferas en el humo del tabaco.4<br>  Aunque no esté presente en enormes cantidades, es suficiente para paralizar los minúsculos pelos (denominados cilios) que recubren la garganta y pasar a los pulmones. Estos pelos microscópicos deben estar en constante movimiento para ayudar a atrapar las partículas no deseadas del aire que respira y expulsarlas de los pulmones. Forman parte del sistema de filtración de su cuerpo, purificando el aire que respira a medida que entra en sus vías respiratorias. Así que cuando fumaba los tenía inactivos por fumar y en parte es el motivo por el que tosía menos y sin despejar bien sus vías respiratorias. Gracias al ácido prúsico, las defensas de su organismo contra la contaminación estaban funcionando todo lo bien que podrían hacerlo.5<br>  Por esta razón, cuando era fumador, podía seguir fumando con pocas o ninguna de las protestas físicas que su cuerpo le manifestaría si pudiera. ?Las defensas de sus pulmones estaban paralizadas! No es hace falta decirlo, eso le ayudaba a fumar más cigarrillos y con más frecuencia, lo que le convenía al bolsillo de las tabacaleras.<br>  Ahora que ha dejado de fumar, sus cilios volverán a funcionar. Incluso puede tener una ligera tos que le demuestra que estas células están funcionando otra vez. Esta es una buena se?al, ya que significa que sus vías respiratorias se están limpiando. <br>  Arsénico: un veneno que todavía se usa para matar ratas (y por los aspirantes a asesinos en muchas novelas) <br>  Amoníaco: un compuesto corrosivo utilizado en muchos productos de limpieza <br>  Cadmio: un metal pesado tóxico que se usa para hacer baterías y pilas <br>  Metano: empleado como combustible de cohetes (y producido en grandes cantidades por las vacas flatulentas) <br>  Butano: otro gas inflamable, usado a menudo como combustible de encendedores <br>  Monóxido de carbono: un gas potencialmente mortal que se expulsa por los tubos de escape de los coches y que impide la oxigenación de su sangre. <br>  Alquitrán: recubre sus pulmones como el cochambre de la cocina y provoca cáncer. Un fumador de 20 cigarrillos al día podría llenar una copa (210 g) de alquitrán en un a?o9–11 <br>  <br>  <br>  Todo esto es parte y está extractado de una página del laboratorio Pfizer, del programa 100% libre de tabaco al cual tuve el gusto de acceder para dejar de fumar con un producto de ellos. Dediqué mi vida al cigarrillo desde los trece a?os y a los cuarenta y nueve puedo decir que lo he dejado, antes de que él me dejara a mí.|`|72fcf0440646d03c08492da719343b54aa	Siempre que hablemos del cigarro o mejor dicho de fumar cigarrillos nos quedaremos cortos,  en lo que se refiere al da?o que produce directa o indirectamente.<br>  <br>  Sobre la Cannabis, no te enga?es:  siempre que quemas una planta la combustión genera grandes cantidades de sustancias tóxicas,  así que sea marihuana o cigarrillos es el mismo impacto negativo a la salud.<br>  <br>  El uso medicinal al que te refieres de la Cannabis es externo no quemado o fumado que es igualmente perjudicial que cualquier otro tabaco.

qaaq27n2aa	Si que existen. Uno de ellos es la espirulina, que es un alga que se dice que puede ser el alimento del futuro, ya que contiene una cantidad balanceada de proteinas, hidratos y grasas saludables. Ademas aporta una gran cantidad de vitaminas y minerales, incluida la vitamina B12, que suele ser deficiente o nula en vegetales. Ademas su proteina es de alto valor biologico, esto quiere decir que contiene todos los aminoacidos esenciales.<br>  <br>  Otro alimento es la quinoa, que precisamente es el alimento de los astronautas debido a su riqueza en nutrientes. Si buscas sabor no te lo aconsejo, pero en cuanto a valores nutritivos es altamente recomendable. Se dice de la quinoa que se acerca mucho a lo que se denomina "alimento universal".<br>  <br>  Otro de ellos es el amaranto que tambien a llegado a ser alimento de astronautas. Es de valores nutritivos semejantes a la quinoa, solo que tal vez en menores porcentajes.<br>  <br>  A su vez y como cuarto alimento muy nutritivo esta la avena, alimento esencial de culturistas por su alto contenido nutritivo. Su sabor no es desagradable para mi gusto.<br>  <br>  Lo que puedes hacer es mezclar en un tazon 100 gr de avena junto con 2 cucharadas de quinoa y amaranto. Esto te da un alimento muy completo cuyo sabor queda enmascarado por el agradable sabor de la avena (para quien le guste).|`|7abb0855bccfa3d942c74d0b0a5386f6aa	no q yo sepa............|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No, que yo sepa no existe, porque se explota mucho la percepción de los sabores y un solo alimento no puede reunir todas esas sensaciones.|`|TNbWBYrsaa	Claro que existe en el mercado una gran gama de suplementos y complementos alimenticios, especiales para los humanos.

El hipocampo es un componente del sistema límbico del cerebro que es esencial para la memoria del aprendizaje, y la integración de experiencias sensoriales con emociones y motivaciones. Las investigaciones han demostrado que las neuronas del sistema de procesamiento de información del hipocampo y la actividad en las fibras nerviosas son reprimidas por el TCH. También, los científicos han encontrado un deterioro de los patrones de conducta aprendidos, también dependientes del hipocampo.<br>  <br>  Recientes investigaciones también se?alan que el uso prolongado de la marihuana produce cambios en el cerebro parecidos a los vistos después del largo uso de otras drogas que son frecuentemente abusadas.<br>  <br>  Consecuencias en los pulmones<br>  <br>  La persona adicta a la marihuana usualmente puede tener los mismos problemas respiratorios de los fumadores de tabaco. Estas personas pueden tener tos y flema a diario, síntomas de bronquitis crónica, y mayor frecuencia de catarros. El uso continuo de la marihuana puede llevar al funcionamiento anormal del tejido pulmonar, debido a su destrucción o trauma.<br>  <br>  Consecuencias en la frecuencia cardiaca y la tensión arterial<br>  <br>  Resultados recientes indican que fumar marihuana e inyectarse cocaína al mismo tiempo puede causar un marcado aumento de la frecuencia cardiaca y la tensión arterial. En un estudio, se dio marihuana sola, cocaína sola y luego una combinación de ambas a usuarios frecuentes de estas dos drogas. Cada droga sola produjo efectos cardiovasculares; al combinarlas, esos efectos se intensificaron y duraron más. La frecuencia cardiaca de los sujetos del estudio aumentó 29 latidos por minuto con marihuana sola y 32 latidos por minuto con cocaína sola. Al administrarlas juntas, la frecuencia cardiaca aumentó en 49 latidos por minuto, y ese aumento persistió por más tiempo. <br>  <br>  Las drogas se administraron a los sujetos mientras estaban en reposo. En condiciones normales, una persona puede fumar marihuana e inyectarse cocaína y luego hacer algo causante de estrés físico lo cual puede aumentar mucho el riesgo de sobrecarga del sistema cardiovascular.<br>  <br>  Consecuencias del uso constante de la marihuana en el aprendizaje y la conducta social<br>  <br>  Un estudio en estudiantes universitarios manifestó que algunas capacidades críticas relacionadas con la atención, la memoria y el aprendizaje están alteradas en aquellas personas que fuma esta droga con mucha frecuencia, aún después de descontinuar su uso por 24 horas. Los científicos compararon 65 "usuarios frecuentes" que habían fumado marihuana con una frecuencia media de 29 en los últimos 30 días, y 64 "usuarios menos frecuentes" quienes habían fumado con una frecuencia media de 1 en los últimos 30 días. Después de una abstinencia de 24 horas, estrictamente controlada, a la marihuana y otras drogas ilícitas y al alcohol, los estudiantes recibieron pruebas estandarizadas para medir aspectos de la atención, memoria y aprendizaje. <br>  <br>  Comparados con los usuarios poco frecuentes, las personas frecuentes de marihuana cometieron más errores y tuvieron mayor dificultad para mantener la atención, cambiar la atención en respuesta a las demandas del ambiente, y registrar, procesar y utilizar información. La investigación concluyó que el mayor impedimento por parte de los usuarios frecuentes está probablemente asociado con una alteración de la actividad cerebral producida por la marihuana.<br>  <br>  Según investigaciones en jóvenes pre-universitarios consumidores de marihuana, se?alan que los adictos tienen menor rendimiento que los no usuarios, mayor aceptación de comportamientos anormales, mayor comportamiento delincuente y agresión, mayor rebeldía, relaciones mas dificultosas con sus padres y mayores asociaciones con amigos delincuentes y que consumen drogas.<br>  <br>  Los estudios también muestran mayor propensión al enojo y comportamiento regresivo (chuparse el dedo y episodios de "rabietas") en los ni?os cuyos padres consumen marihuana que entre los ni?os de padres no usuarios.<br>  <br>  Consecuencias en el embarazo<br>  <br>  Algunas investigaciones han mostrado que los bebés de madres que usaron marihuana durante el embarazo tienden a ser más peque?os que los de las embarazadas que no utilizaron la droga. En general, los bebés de menor tama?o tienden a desarrollar problemas de salud.<br>  <br>  La madre lactante que usa marihuana pasa parte del TCH a su bebé a través de la leche materna. Las investigaciones han encontrado que el uso de la marihuana por parte de la madre durante el primer mes de lactancia puede impedir el desarrollo|`|PwVtRslVaa	de bueno relaja te ayuda a estudiar mas consentrado <br>  y de malo  sete nota y hueles a mariguano y empieza la indiferiencia de la gente|`|RlfJCr9uaa	la marihuana extri?e , relaja y lentamente mata :D|`|dCO6XzAUaa	algo bueno eh mmmmm...... `pues si tu te drogas para mi es bueno una persona menos es mas oxigeno para mi y mis hijos|`|hZg0i5NIaa	la marihuana con usos terapeuticos kita desde un dolor de cabeza...........<br>  <br>  pero sus consecuencias pueden ser la farmacodependencia ke ps es ya cuando no puedes dejar de usarla <br>  <br>  suerte|`|qCJ9nDZkaa	a mi parecer la marihuana no tiene nada de bueno porque la gente se vuelve adicta :S y en lo personal no veo que le ven de divertido las personas a fumar cigarrillos o marihuana...<br>  <br>  ahora... tiene su lado bueno porque ayuda a personas que tiene muchísimo dolor, durante sus terapias, les ayuda a controlar el dolor que le produce la enfermedad que dtengan....|`|129dd342f0f41c0e3681d45d8d8a2978aa	Consecuencias de la marihuana en el cerebro <br>  <br>  Los científicos han descubierto que el TCH transforma la manera como la información sensora llega y es procesada por el hipocampo.

También, los científicos han encontrado un deterioro de los patrones de conducta aprendidos, también dependientes del hipocampo.<br>  <br>  Recientes investigaciones también se?alan que el uso prolongado de la marihuana produce cambios en el cerebro parecidos a los vistos después del largo uso de otras drogas que son frecuentemente abusadas.<br>  <br>  Consecuencias en los pulmones<br>  <br>  La persona adicta a la marihuana usualmente puede tener los mismos problemas respiratorios de los fumadores de tabaco. Estas personas pueden tener tos y flema a diario, síntomas de bronquitis crónica, y mayor frecuencia de catarros. El uso continuo de la marihuana puede llevar al funcionamiento anormal del tejido pulmonar, debido a su destrucción o trauma.<br>  <br>  Consecuencias en la frecuencia cardiaca y la tensión arterial<br>  <br>  Resultados recientes indican que fumar marihuana e inyectarse cocaína al mismo tiempo puede causar un marcado aumento de la frecuencia cardiaca y la tensión arterial. En un estudio, se dio marihuana sola, cocaína sola y luego una combinación de ambas a usuarios frecuentes de estas dos drogas. Cada droga sola produjo efectos cardiovasculares; al combinarlas, esos efectos se intensificaron y duraron más. La frecuencia cardiaca de los sujetos del estudio aumentó 29 latidos por minuto con marihuana sola y 32 latidos por minuto con cocaína sola. Al administrarlas juntas, la frecuencia cardiaca aumentó en 49 latidos por minuto, y ese aumento persistió por más tiempo. <br>  <br>  Las drogas se administraron a los sujetos mientras estaban en reposo. En condiciones normales, una persona puede fumar marihuana e inyectarse cocaína y luego hacer algo causante de estrés físico lo cual puede aumentar mucho el riesgo de sobrecarga del sistema cardiovascular.<br>  <br>  Consecuencias del uso constante de la marihuana en el aprendizaje y la conducta social<br>  <br>  Un estudio en estudiantes universitarios manifestó que algunas capacidades críticas relacionadas con la atención, la memoria y el aprendizaje están alteradas en aquellas personas que fuma esta droga con mucha frecuencia, aún después de descontinuar su uso por 24 horas. Los científicos compararon 65 "usuarios frecuentes" que habían fumado marihuana con una frecuencia media de 29 en los últimos 30 días, y 64 "usuarios menos frecuentes" quienes habían fumado con una frecuencia media de 1 en los últimos 30 días. Después de una abstinencia de 24 horas, estrictamente controlada, a la marihuana y otras drogas ilícitas y al alcohol, los estudiantes recibieron pruebas estandarizadas para medir aspectos de la atención, memoria y aprendizaje. <br>  <br>  Comparados con los usuarios poco frecuentes, las personas frecuentes de marihuana cometieron más errores y tuvieron mayor dificultad para mantener la atención, cambiar la atención en respuesta a las demandas del ambiente, y registrar, procesar y utilizar información. La investigación concluyó que el mayor impedimento por parte de los usuarios frecuentes está probablemente asociado con una alteración de la actividad cerebral producida por la marihuana.<br>  <br>  Según investigaciones en jóvenes pre-universitarios consumidores de marihuana, se?alan que los adictos tienen menor rendimiento que los no usuarios, mayor aceptación de comportamientos anormales, mayor comportamiento delincuente y agresión, mayor rebeldía, relaciones mas dificultosas con sus padres y mayores asociaciones con amigos delincuentes y que consumen drogas.<br>  <br>  Los estudios también muestran mayor propensión al enojo y comportamiento regresivo (chuparse el dedo y episodios de "rabietas") en los ni?os cuyos padres consumen marihuana que entre los ni?os de padres no usuarios.<br>  <br>  Consecuencias en el embarazo<br>  <br>  Algunas investigaciones han mostrado que los bebés de madres que usaron marihuana durante el embarazo tienden a ser más peque?os que los de las embarazadas que no utilizaron la droga. En general, los bebés de menor tama?o tienden a desarrollar problemas de salud.<br>  <br>  La madre lactante que usa marihuana pasa parte del TCH a su bebé a través de la leche materna. Las investigaciones han encontrado que el uso de la marihuana por parte de la madre durante el primer mes de lactancia puede impedir el desarrollo motor (control del movimiento de los músculos) del bebé.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	La marihuana usada como droga puede provocar adicción, afecta algunos receptores neuronales y provoca como el tabaco cáncer, debido al humo que se tiene que inhalar cuando se consume. Por otro lado, usada como anestésico es una droga adecuada.

9v11XiqVaa	Hmm...Me resulta familiar este padecimiento tuyo. Creo que este tipo de cosas es mas común de lo que se cree. Sé a lo que te refieres, a esa cosa dura maloliente, a mi me pasa. Resulta que sí, en efecto ésto es una acumulacion de sucios en los huecos de las amigdalas, NO ES PUS ya que el pus produce dolor, pero lo extra?o de la situacion es que esa cosa amarillenta y maloliente no produce dolor. A mi por ejemplo me salian esas cosas malolientes en las amigdalas, pero en peque?as cantidades...Luego de una FARINGOAMIGDALITIS AGUDA me quedaron muchisimos huecos en las amigdalas. Resulta que dicha FARINGOAMIGDALITIS me perforo las amigdalas por medio de la infeccion tan grave que me causo, por lo tanto los pedacitos de la amigdala que fueron afectados por aquella infeccion, se me cayeron como si hubiese sido piel muerta...De ahí me quedaron varias endiduras lo suficientemente grandes como para que me salieran esas cosas malolientes de las que hablas. Sí producen mal aliento, pero eso pasa si mantienes la boca sucia. Veras, cuando los pedacitos de comida se quedan el los dientes y tú no los cepillas, ?que pasa?...Pues  las bacterias empiezan a hacer de las suyas y te da mal aliento. Lo mismo ocurre con los sucios que te entran a las amigdalas: Si no limpias tu boca con regularidad, le daras el chance a dichas bacterias de que hagan de las suyas dentro de tus amígdalas tambien. Preferiblemente usa enjuague bucal.<br>  <br>  Yo no he investigado acerca de eso, pero si te puedo asegurar que estas cositas malolientes te las puedes sacar periodicamente. Ahora mismo se me ha reducido la cantidad de sucio que me sacaba de las amigdalas, pero antes tenia que limpiarmelas semanalmente porque realmente se me llenaban de sucio a tal punto que cualquier clase de succion asi fuera para tragar saliba, hacia que algun sucio de esos saliera del agujero donde estaba metido y ?plup!, que asco!...me lo tragaba sin querer. Entonces, este sucio lo puedes sacar como si fuerar a extirpar una espinilla, o puedes ayudarte con un palillo. Si hay algun sucio de estos que no quiere salir aun con ayuda de un palillo, puedes ayudarte haciendo una simulacion de como si fueras a sacarte un catarro. ésto tambien produce una succion similar a cuando tragas saliba, pero es mas fuerte, lo suficientemente fuerte como para que dicho sucio asqueroso asome una puntita y puedas sacarlo. <br>  <br>  La otra opcion es que te mandes a cauterizar las amigdalas. Eso es lo unico que erradica el problema de raiz. Las amigdalas tardan una semana o dos en curarse y debes tener cuidados especiales. La operacio se hace con láser por lo tanto es las rápido el proceso de curación ya que el laser a medida que va cortando, de una vez sella la herida que produce el corte. Es como cuando quieres que un cordon no se deshile, ?que haces?, le quemas la puntica, y listo, la sellas de esa manera. <br>  <br>  Yo debí operarme de las amigdalas hace mucho tiempo, pero tambien me da un poco de miedo, ademas no ha habido el dinero para dicha operacion. De todos modos lo que siento mas conveniente para mí, es la operacion..Tengo un poco de temor, pero es mejor sufrir por una semana, que por el resto de la vida. Ademas, los cuidados que se deben tener para una operacion de esas tampoco son malos. A mi hermana la operaron de las amigdalas, y te cuento que lo que debia comer eran cosas asi: Gelatica,helado, yogurt, jugos NO ácidos, leche, etc. Y para remate no podia hacer ninguna clase de esfuerzos fisicos por lo tanto no movía un dedo para ayudar a hacer los quehaceres del hogar, no salía  para nungun lado (por lo menos hasta una o dos semanas despues de la operacion ) por lo que no iba al colegio...Ademas, se la pasaba era durmiendo...?QUE GRAN VIDA!....Delicioso andar no mas de peresozo uno en la casa, no ir al colegio y que ademas te lleven a la cama helado, gelatina, yogurt....?QUE RICO!....En fin. El punto es que eso de la operacion no es tan torturante como se cree. <br>  <br>  Bueno...Yo ya te dije lo que sabia cerca de tu problemilla, asi que en tus manos esta tomar la decision...(te recomiendo la operacion)....je je je je...Suerte entonces...Me cuentas como te fue, vale?...Bye y besos!|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Tienes que ir al otorrinolringólogo.|`|ef3905878b3f5c61e637b77f0620397baa	se llaman caseum esas bolitas que huelen mal y mejor no optes por la cirugia, puedes controlar ese problema que mucha gente tiene mira puedes quitarlas con unos cotonetes o isopos pero con cuidado para que no te vayas a lastimar y a continuacion has gargaras con agua y unas gotitas de limon o con bicarbonato de sodio y eso te quitara el problema. si quieres puedes investigar mas acerca del tema solo pon en google caseum suerte!!

Te dicen "las lentejas tienen mucho hierro"... lo cual es cierto. Pero el hierro de las lentejas no está en forma HEMO de modo que apenas absorbemos una peque?a parte. En cambio el hierro que hay en el hígado de vaca o de pollo tiene hierro y sí lo absorbemos más fácilmente por esa razón.|`|wIRXHxZDaa	La porfiria es una enfermedad del metabolismo del grupo HEM, el componente fundamental que capta el oxígeno en la hemoglobina, la cual forma parte de los hematíes. Este grupo HEM se sintetiza en el hígado y en la médula ósea fundamentalmente. <br>  <br>  Este hecho puede haber alimentado la creencia en los vampiros en épocas antiguas por la existencia de personas que no toleran la luz solar y necesitan desesperadamente sangre por medio de transfusiones para sobrevivir. El aspecto deforme por las quemaduras se agrava por la aparición de pelo en zonas donde no debería haberlo a causa de una disfunción cutánea lo que también parece haber contribuido al mito de los hombres lobo. Los enfermos de este tipo de porfiria también tienen los dientes de color rojo por el acúmulo de estos cuerpos porfíricos. <br>  <br>  Los enfermos de porfiria producen, debido a una malformación genética, una cantidad excesiva de porfirinas, el pigmento que le da a la sangre su color rojo. La hiperabundancia de porfirinas genera anemia, que explicaría la palidez típica de los vampiros, al mismo tiempo que colorea de rojo los ojos y los dientes, además de provocar una enorme fotofobia o sensibilidad a la luz. La luz solar lesiona la piel de los enfermos de porfiria, produciéndoles llagas que pueden mutilar los labios, haciendo que los dientes rojos parezcan más grandes, y las orejas, dándoles la forma puntiagudas. Además, hace que necesiten transfusiones de sangre, puede provocar la aparición de vello en el rostro (el mito del vampiro siempre ha estado muy vinculado al del hombre lobo) y hasta explicaría el odio al ajo típico del vampirismo, puesto que el ajo al parecer agrava la enfermedad.<br>  <br>  ?Es la porfiria el origen de las leyendas vampíricas?: Podría serlo en parte, pero es una enfermedad demasiado poco frecuente para haber dado origen a un mito que, sobre todo en el este de Europa, estuvo extremadamente extendido hasta el siglo XVIII, cuando el avance de la medicina y la Ilustración empezaron a hacer mella sobre tradiciones muy arraigadas. Probablemente la dificultad de la ciencia antigua en saber cuando alguien está realmente muerto (hasta no hace tanto tiempo la prueba habitual para diagnosticar la muerte era tan poco concluyente como colocar un cristal bajo la nariz del paciente y ver si se empa?aba) provocaría muchos casos de personas enterradas vivas que se retorcieran en sus ataudes; y no digamos en épocas de peste en las que los presuntos cadáveres se enterraban a toda prisa para evitar contagios. <br>  <br>  Espero que esta información te sirva de gran utilidad, hasta luego y buenas noches =D.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Las porfirias son un grupo heterogéneo de enfermedades metabólicas,  hereditarias, debidas a deficiencia en las enzimas que intervienen en la biosíntesis del grupo hemo (componente de la hemoglobina, parte esencial de los glóbulos rojos, que le da la coloración roja a la sangre).<br>  Se caracterizan por una sobreproducción y acúmulo de las llamadas porfirinas y de precursores como ALA (ácido delta aminolevulínico) y PBG (porfobilinógeno).<br>  Las porfirinas son los compuestos que hacen la hierba verde y la sangre roja.”<br>  Las principales fábricas de porfirinas del organismo son el hígado y la médula ósea. En ésta, se sintetizan altas cantidades de grupo hemo para producir suficiente hemoglobina, sustancia necesaria para el trasporte de oxígeno. En el hígado, el hemo se utiliza para formar otras sustancias que fundamentalmente sirven para desintoxicar.<br>  El término proviene del griego πορφ?ρα, porphura, significando "pigmento púrpura". Es probable que el nombre haya sido una referencia a la decoloración de algunos fluidos corporales durante un ataque.<br>  Probablemente debido a esto, a la disminución de la coloración roja de la sangre se pensaba que estas personas eran atacadas por un ser enigmático que las dejaba sin sangre.<br>  La hija de la escritora Isabel Allende, murió de esta enfermedad.<br>  Saludos!!!|`|6c7de472c0e86c4f9eba98cb476ba706aa	La porfiria o más comunmente llamada el mal de los vampiros ha estado presente en todas las épocas, ahora sabemos que es una enfermedad, pero intentar imaginar esta enfermedad en la edad media.

Inclusive se considera una enfermedad de aristocratas pues es mas comun en personas de alta sociedad.<br>  <br>  Supongo que todo esto llevaba al aislamiento de estas personas y bueno las muertes repentinas cerca de los castillos de los condes donde se encontraban a jovenes sin sangre y nada menos que con dos piquetes en el cuello probablemente de los cateteres que se llegaran a usar para extraerles la sangre.<br>  <br>  Pero  bueno es la prueba mas contundente de a donde te puede llevar la ignorancia.<br>  <br>  Lo de los feretros me da la impresion que los sirvientes y familiares los tenian  por precaucion  (alertas a la muerte) mas que por otra cosa.|`|jMobKCHlaa	ni idea no habia oido sobre eso lo unico que se me ocurre  es internete<br>  www.google.com o algun otro buscador coloques porfiria|`|0nhxZEHUaa	es un dato interesante|`|QvannC3xaa	Si, lo leí en un libro, solo la forma de porfiria conocida como CEP te daba los rasgos de vampiro: colmillos puntiagudos, sensibilidad a la luz, necesidad de sangre etc, se sabe solo de 90 casos.|`|Xk5ffh85aa	Si!

Luego es depositado en celdillas donde se lo va deshidratando, y cuando ya es miel en su punto justo, la abeja lo tapa (opercular).|`|488fb66d24bed7e0746d1bf7c0b7e8a9aa	alimento del cerebro y de la salud en general del cuerpo, calorias instantaneas, energía sexual, curación de heridas.<br>  etc|`|bZuVquhBaa	Beneficios de la miel.<br>  La miel, sin lugar a dudas, es el alimento energético por excelencia y un estupendo remedio para muchas enfermedades y dolencias como veremos más adelante. La espectacular acción positiva que ejerce sobre el organismo se debe a sus componentes, como los azúcares, oligoelementos orgánicos y minerales, las hormonas y las vitaminas, sustancias vivas que desempe?an un papel de poderosos catalizadores, capaces de liberar la energía contenida en potencia en otros elementos.<br>  <br>  La miel, producto natural, es un alimento incomparable para los lactantes, ni?os, ancianos y reconstituyente para los deportistas y personas que se sientan fatigados. Además la miel es un producto que entra a formar parte de numerosas recetas de cosmética y belleza natural.<br>  <br>  Se dice que el simple consumo regular de miel ejerce una acción positiva sobre los corazones castigados por el "stress" o el "surmenage". La miel es una fuente de ahorro para un corazón fatigado.

Las abejas del interior, dan inicio inmediatamente a un proceso de transformación del néctar en miel. Para ello alargan la trompa y sacan una gotita del líquido que llenaba su buche, la cual se desliza por la lengua estirada, aumentando así el proceso de evaporación del agua.<br>  <br>  Este proceso es realizado por muchas abejas en varios minutos, pasándose las gotitas del néctar (enriquecido con enzimas segregados por ellas mismas) de abeja en abeja, iniciando así el proceso de conversión de néctar a miel. A continuación el producto se concentra más todavía en el que la evaporación es indirecta originada por intensas corrientes de aire que provocan abejas ventiladoras. El producto se almacena en las celdillas, concentrándose aún más por medio del sistema de ventilación de la colmena. Posteriormente cada celdilla es cerrada herméticamente con cera con el fín de evitar que se reabsorba el agua del medio y no fermente. Hasta aquí el proceso de elaboración de la miel, la cual es extraida en los panales por los apicultores, que depositan en centrifugadoras una vez extraida la cera y otras sustancias como el propoleo. De la centrifugadora se extrae esta miel que pasa por un filtro y se envasa.|`|eootdnB3aa	-para :hacer mascarillas para el cutis <br>  _también comer una cucharadita diaria  fortalece la matris (claro esta... los q quieren ser madre es buenazo )<br>  _cuando están embarazadas también  es buenazo|`|Oft0ICUwaa	Es de gran valor energético, rica en sales minerales, hierro, fósforo, calcio y en vitaminas; por lo que ayuda al crecimiento y fortifica los huesos.

La miel es rica en vitamina B, C, D tiamina, niacina, riboflavina, así mismo contiene minerales esenciales como calcio, hierro, magnesio, fósforo, potasio, sodio y zinc. Debemos tomar en cuenta su color, ya que mientras más obscura sea, mas se eleva su valor nutricional, por un alto porcentaje de sales minerales.<br>  <br>  A comparación de otros endulsantes, la Miel de Abeja se puede digerir con mayor facilidad, no irrita las paredes internas del sistema digestivo y no da?a los ri?ones. Si bien la miel es asimilada perfectamente por la gran mayoría de las personas, también es cierto que podemos encontrar con algunos casos en que no sea así, como por ejemplo aquellos que son diabéticos o alérgicos a los productos derivados de la colmena.<br>  <br>  Existen algunas referencias históricas donde pueblos antiguos consideraban la miel como algo Sagrado, en la cultura Egipcia formaba parte de los elementos rituales utilizados para la momificación de aquellos tiempos. Los griegos, tomaban grandes cantidades durante sus olimpiadas por considerarla una gran proveedora de energía. Hipócrates, quien fue llamado Padre de la Medicina, al estudiar las propiedades de la miel la describía como diurética fortificante, cicatrizante de heridas, energética, milagrosa para curación de úlceras y auxiliar en la reproducción de glóbulos rojos.<br>  <br>  La miel se recomienda también, para vías respiratorias, buena digestión, insomnio, circulación, sistema nervioso y quemaduras.<br>  <br>  Remedios Caseros a Base de Miel de Abeja<br>  <br>  * En caso de insomnio, es excelente tomar una cucharada de miel antes de acostarse.<br>  <br>  * Aplícala en picaduras de insectos e hinchazones causadas por golpes y te aliviará todo malestar que puedas sentir.<br>  <br>  * Para prevenir enfermedades, toma diariamente una cucharada de miel diaria y así te sentirás bien de tu estómago y te proporcionará mucha energía.<br>  <br>  * En caso de que la persona tenga gripa, catarro o temperatura, se puede preparar miel con jugo de limón y sentirá rápido la mejoría.<br>  <br>  * En ayunas la miel es excelente para curar úlceras gástricas e intestinales.<br>  <br>  * Cuando la garganta se irrita, a causa de la gripa, o que se presenten ulceraciones en la boca, se recomienda diluir l cuchara de miel en ? vaso de agua tibia, y con esta mezcla hacer gargaras.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Ayuda en las infecciones de la garganta.

Cuando empieces a sentirte mejor puedes empezar a retirar los malos hábitos. Ir poco a poco es la clave, no te agobies si va un poco lento y de vez en cuando reconócete tus logros; mírate al espejo y dite que todo lo que estás haciendo es por tu bien y que tú te lo mereces. Sugerencias: <br>  <br>  Hay ciertos hábitos alimenticios y de Salud que nos pueden ayudar a mejorar esta condición:<br>  <br>      Hacer ejercicio aeróbico de bajo impacto al menos media hora al día (caminar, nadar, montar en bici…)<br>  <br>      Beber al menos 2 L de agua diarios<br>  Aumentar los alimentos con Vitaminas E, B12. Alimentos ricos en vitamina E: aceites vírgenes prensados en frío, germen de trigo, germen de maíz y de soja, semillas de algodón y girasol, cacahuetes, olivas e hígado de bacalao. Alimento ricos en vitamina B12: pescados grasos como el salmón o el atún, ternera, huevos, pollo, lecha de vaca, yogures, queso, alga espirulina, levadura de cerveza.<br>  <br>  Una copa de vino tinto de vez en cuando ayuda, pues el vino tinto contiene taninos que ayuda a reducir el colesterol y por tanto el bloqueo de las arterias.<br>  <br>  Descansar unos minutos después de comer es muy sano. Durante la digestión la sangre se concentra mayoritariamente en el Aparato Digestivo y ayuda el no tener que utilizar energía para otras cosas pues la digestión necesita mucha sangre.<br>  Empezar el día con un vaso grande de agua tibia con un poquito de limón.<br>  <br>  Terminar las duchas con agua fría para acelerar le circulación sanguínea.<br>  limentos que ayudan a mejorar la circulación sanguínea:<br>  <br>      Aceite de Oliva Virgen Extra (asegúrate de que es Extra y de que se extrae por presión en frío; de otra manera pierde sus propiedades): Contiene mucha vitamina E, pero si se usa para freir ésta desaparece. Contiene Vitamina K que ayuda en la coagulación de la sangre. No contiene colesterol malo.<br>  <br>      Nueces: Contienen aceites esenciales y óxido nítrico que actúa como vaso-dilatador.<br>  <br>      Miel: asegurarse de que es de buena calidad y de que está cruda, el calor hace que pierda parte de sus propiedades. La miel de Casta?o se recomienda especialmente. La miel es un buen sustitutivo del azúcar blanquilla que es muy mala desde el punto de vista nutritivo(favorece la dilatación anormal de los vasos sanguíneos).<br>  <br>      Frutas y Hortalizas: tomarlas sobre todo crudas pues contienen mucha fibra. Las frutas se deben tomar solas, fuera de las comidas para favorecer la absorción de las vitaminas y que la fibra pase por el cuerpo en una acción limpiadora.|`|Oft0ICUwaa	A veces no produce síntomas.

Sólo son un negocio más de los muchos que hay en el ámbito de la sanidad.<br>  Toda la prevención en cualquier enfermedad, virus o bacteria reside en el plato de la comida.<br>  Una alimentación vegetariana crudívora te aportará todos los nutrientes (minerales, vitaminas, enzimas, ácidos grasos esenciales) necesarios para recuperar la salud, además te desintoxicará el organismo para cualquier desarreglo que puedas tener.<br>  La proteína animal favorece la formación de fibrosidades, tumoraciones, calcificaciones, colesterol, etc. y no hay que olvidar que las vacunas son pura proteína además de un montón de química (antibióticos, bacterias o virus vivos, muertos o atenuados, metales pesados como conservantes, proteína animal o artificial como serum portador) que no ayudan precisamente a mantener la salud.

Es un reto, preguntate ?COMO ME GUSTARIA SER?  Empieza lógicamente desde tu realidad, visualiza los nuevos valores que serán la base de tu exito y proyectalos a través de buenos hábitos. Cada uno de nosotros sabe que cambios debemos  realizar para reinventar nuestras vidas.<br>  Te dire que la mente trabaja bajo dos paradigmas extremas: esperar lo mejor o esperar lo peor. El segundo es el más común, por que no exige nada. En contra parte, el autovisualizarse como truinfador requiere de un esfuerzo, de una energía vivificante que nos anime a la acción y que nos permita enfrentar cada obstaculo, no como una dificultad sino como un reto. VENCE TUS RETOS.<br>  ESPERA LO MEJOR, LO CUASL NOS OFRECE UNA VISIóN OPTIMISTA Y PRACTICA DE LA VIDA.

SDHvDNGJaa	La insulina contribuye a que el azúcar en la sangre pueda ser introducido a las células que forman los tejidos. No activa el colesterol, mas bien los altos niveles de azucar en la sangre alteran el metabolismo de los lípidos, lo que lleva a lipidemia y alto colesterol.

ABBbAXhXaa	Pues hasta donde yo sé, para la "masa" (que es lo que ustedes se refieren con lo que "pesan" porque en realidad, es bien sabido que peso es igual a masa por gravedad, y que el resultado ni son "kilos" -dicho sea de paso que aquí y en china un kilo y un kilogramo son LO MISMO-  sino que da en Newtons) sólo hay dos sistemas y es el métrico ( o SI) y el sistema inglés.<br>  Existen otros sistemas para medir la masa, claro, pero ninguna personas se mide en quilates.<br>  Así que en realidad especificar que son kilogramos o kilos es un poco inútil ya que el comentario de "marii" está completamente fuera de lugar.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a tu "peso", no debe de ser "10 menos" como dijo por ahí alguien, es mucho más complejo que eso, y es aún todavía más complejo que sólo sacar numeritos en las tablas del IMC, está comprobado que de hecho, las tablas de IMC no son precisas, y tienen un margen enorme de error.<br>  Mucho depende de la cantidad de grasa que tengas y en dónde, también depende de la genética, yo estoy según 12 kilos abajo de lo que "debería pesar", pero así es mi cuerpo, siempre ha sido así.<br>  So... mi consejo, no te acomplejes, si te sientes bien, y te ves bien, ?para qué hacer tanto show por un número?|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Estas un poco bajo de peso, pero si te sientes bien, no hay problema...<br>  Salu2 =)|`|ofPMd3Z9aa	segun tu edad y tu estatura estas excelente.<br>  tendrias que pesar 72 kilos <br>  porque son 10 de diferencia.<br>  depende de si tu peso esta en grasa o en masa muscular .. espero que sea masa muscular.|`|0391vAT0aa	1.82 aproximadamente 68 kilos|`|D74JCFP2aa	estás en tu peso ideál.. la estatura y peso no van ligados a la edad desde los 15 a?os, antes, si se le da un aproximado de estatura y peso a un ni?o pero después de los 15 a?os no se concidera. tu peso debe ser 10 kilos menor a los centimetros que te sobran del metro de estatura, si eres hombre y 15 kilos menor, si eres mujer.<br>  si mides 1.83 debes pesar 73 kilos.<br>  <br>  o sea, que según esto.. debes estar muy bien... y si no lo estás, come un poco más y haz un poco de  ejercicio.<br>  besos desde México.|`|q4jHbA8yaa	ayy! no seran KILOS? no kilogramos ni?o ?? si no ya estarias muerto,,,si estas super ben :D|`|uKg6oo9gaa	y cotlemaengas el probmo te csientes tu, al no ser que  teng o el problema as de anorexia o bulimia, cuidate y trata de alimentarte bien

M66A9Cqwaa	los unicos medicamentos aprobados para bajar el peso son la sibutramina(aderan, meridia,etc.) y el orlistat(xenical). siempre recomendados por un medico; he leido que todos los suplementos dietarios sea el que sea contienen diureticos, laxantes, y demas porquerias que solo afectan de manera agresiva al organismo, la furosemida(diureticos) elimina liquidos (es decir te seca)y tomada en forma deliberada te puede ocasionar problemas en los ri?ones de manera irreversible, los laxantes pueden traerte problemas como la perdida de la flora intestinal; que bajas es obvio ya que una te elimina todo el liquido, inclusive el que tu cuerpo necesita eliminando asi todo el potasio de tu cuerpo, ademas junto con los laxxantes te debilitan, quedas palida, floja por donde te mires, con calambres insoportables por la falta de potasio, problemas de estogamo, piel sumamente seca, un desastre. <br>  En cambio la sibutramina, tomandola como se debe tomar siempre y cuando estes bajo la vista de un medico y con un sobrepeso mayor de 20 kilos, ya que este medicamente esta indicado para personas con mucho sobrepeso.<br>  Te confieso que estoy bajo el tratamiento de la sibutramina porque me lo recomendo mi medico,tenia un sobrepeso de 30 kilos y en un mes y medio perdi 10 kilos!. pienso seguir con el tratamiento hasta conseguir el peso normal, mientras tanto tenes que ir consientisandote que las pastillas no hacen milagros, tenes que cuidarte, tenes que ejercitarte, tenes que beber mucho liquido(mucho es 3 litros) si o si. <br>  si te paseas por foros dicen que hasta muertes produjo estas pastillas; es cierto, pero etsas personas que consumian sibutramina no consultaron al medico, ni mucho menos leyeron las contraindicaciones, es que la obsecion por adelgazar hace que uno tome indiscriminadamente pastillas de todo tipo.<br>  estan contraindicadas en personas con alta tension arterial, ya que este medicamento aumenta la presion arterial!!!!<br>  no se pueden mezclar con otros medicamentos, mucho menos con pastillas para dormir, no ingerir alcohol, y otras cosas mas que tu medico te dira, ademas pedira un examen para poder ver si puedes tomarlas. comprendes!!<br>  otro error es que muchas veces dejamos de comer!!!!! nunca hay que dejar de comer!!!! capish!!! nunca!!!! sino cambiar el habito por comida sana, te confieso que no soy partidaria de las ensaladas, pero bueno la dieta me la armo yo, no sobrepaso las 1000 calorias y camino 1 hora diaria.<br>  porque la gente deja la comida de la cena a un lado???<br>  yo no se que pensaras, pero es el ultimo alimento que recibiras durante muchas horas, y no porque estes recostado tu cuerpo no trabaja, el sigue trabajando necesitando combustible(energia) para que tu organismo funcione.<br>  si tuve malestares por causa de esta pastilla?????<br>  si !! las tuve!!! pero soy realista, despues de dos a?os de vida sedentaria, de 9 meses de un embarazo en el cual estuve 4 meses en reposo, de comer a deshora, de no perderme ni un asado, es muyyyyyyyy pero muyyyyyyy seguro que mi organismo va a detectar un cambio!!! si se?ores!!! cambiar un estilo de vida produce un efecto en nuestro cuerpo, de consumir 4000 calorias diarias, dormir mucho, cero ejercicios, a consumir 900 a 1000 calorias, (deshacerme de la comida chatarra, grasa, snacks, cerveza, es decir energia que mi organismo obtenia sin ningun esfuerzo) caminar primero durante 30 minutos luego ir de a poco agregandole minutos hasta completar una hora diaria,y encima tomar una pastilla q me ayude a regular la ansiedad, es mucho cambio radical !!!! tenia fuertes dolores de cabeza! que no pude tomar pastillas nada porque no hay que mezclar medicamentos, boca seca, inmsomnio( fue un horror) porque me daba hambre a la noche!!!!! fueron disminuyendo dia a dia<br>  en una semana ya mi cuerpo estaba consientisandose si o si que tenia que empezar a trabajar si queria energia, los dolers de cabeza mermaron, boca seca tambien, bebiendo mucho liquido desaparecen estos malestares, y bueno el inmsonmio fue desapareciendo, ahora estoy bien, sigo mi plan alimenticio, ejercicio, abdominales para fortalecer y las pastis, eso si!!!!!!!!! ponete en la cabeza que lo mas dificil no es adelgazar! sino mantenerte luego de la perdida de peso, tenes que cambiar tu forma de alimentarte como lo hacias para adelgazar, no dejes el ejercicio, no comas de mas ni mucho menos cosas engordantes, siempre date el gusto un dia a la semana! sino es imposible seguir prohibiendote, va a llegar un momento en que te canses y tires tus sacrificios por la ventana, asi que disfruta de una buena porcion de pizza y cerveza, pero solo una vez por semana! recordalo!!!!! ahhhh cuando sepas que tienes que ir a una fiesta de lo que sea camina media hora mas de lo normal, y al dia siguiente lo mismo, asi no te sentiras culpalbe por haber comido demas.<br>  Es dificil pero no es imposible, espero que te ayude con lo que te escribi, y recorda!!!!!! no tomes cosas que lo unico que hacen es sacarte plata y no grasa!!!!!!<br>  siempre controlate con tu medico, personas con problemas de tiroides no pueden tomar sibutramina!! mucho menos adolecentes que estan en pleno crecimiento!!<br>  <br>  Tomate tu tiempo, ponete vos el dia que quieras empezar a adelgazar, no sigas esos tabues de el lunes, martes, mierc........... etc, es pura mentira yo empece un miercoles y todavia lo sigo. si algun alimento no te gusta cambialo no comas cosas que sabes que cuando acabes con la dieta jamas probaras!!!!!! hoy por hoy con un click tenes millonadas de paginas en donde te dicen las calorias vitaminas, proteinas etc contiene cada alimento, asi que no desesperes asi que arma tu propio menu!!! recorda que cada persona es unica, y si a fulana le fue bien la dieta de la manzana con crema tu cuerpo es diferente, la base es aprender a ingerir los alimentos que necesite tu cuerpo, que tengas exitos, bon apetit|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Ve con un nutriólogo para que te dise?e una dieta apropiada a tu edad, talla y complexión física...<br>  Salu2 =))|`|9u9Ca1rLaa	ve a correr unos 45 minutos todos los dias, trotando no hagas tanto velocidad solo resistencia cada vez trata de durar mas tiempo sin parar, y muy importante la comida ya que para bajar de paos importa tanto la comida como el ejercicio. trata de no comer tantas calorias, si tomas coca quitala por completa y trata de nocomer muchas harinas,<br>  por las ma?anas puedes desayunar cereales, huevo, atun, jugo de naranja o licuados.<br>  en la comida pollo, pescado, arroz.<br>  por la noche trata de comer poco puedes cenar atun, huevos cocidos, cerales, y pues la vdd no tiene nada de malo si algun dia comes un pco de carne roja solo que no sea por la noche intentalo 1 o 2 semanas y ve a pesarte y estoy seguro que vas a ver resultados<br>  suerte|`|CPTBmT1Baa	Sabrinit tiene toda la razón, es cuestión de ir poco a poco, asesorada por un nutriólogo y hacer ejercicio aeróbico y anaeróbico, acompa?ado de  muchos líquidos.<br>  Buena Suerte!|`|KBaelEkBaa	dejando de tragar i haciendo ejercio mija y no es tan rapido no todo cae del cielo|`|M2QXjpzaaa	sopa de tomates 3 dias. 4 veces por dia debes tomarla 3kilos. si la haces mas tiempo mas efecto de dara claro esta.|`|YX75IELMaa	Desintoxicando el colon.<br>  <br>  En mi concepto lo mejor es desintoxicar el colon.<br>  Y la mejor forma es con la sabila, algo totalmente natural.<br>  <br>  En Youtube hay unos videos interesantes, para saber de qué estoy hablando.<br>  Cuidate mucho.<br>  <br>  “Puede la muerte comenzar en el colon” 01 y 02<br>  <br>  lupitayroberto2006@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  <br>  La sibutramina puede provocar efectos secundarios.

vSmop8Vhaa	It was your period. Because you just started to have your period, it will be irregular. They'll be days you'll have your period for seven days, some for ten, and some for three.<br>  <br>  Your period won't be 'regular' and have a define pattern until you are in your 20s.
m3cf7vsAaa	You find a way to forgive.  I know it may sound like some b*llshit that some holy roller would get on here and say, but I assure you that ain't me.  I too suffered abuse amongst other horrible life altering things.  I witnessed murder amongst other awful things in my childhood.  And lived with depression, anxiety and what they called "bipolar" I took a bunch of meds that did worse things to me and even my mother didn't believe me.  She thought I wanted attention or something.  Point being, rage doesn't do anything good.  It only manifests in you and hurts you.  It doesn't fix the past or even reach those who f*cked your life up so much... they are all oblivious to your pain.  So my only cure all is to dismiss them all as unknowing or idiot's and forgive them for all the sh*t they put me through.  I tell myself I have the advantage because I know what I know and am stronger because  of it.  I'm a survivor! Not a victim.  And sounds to me like you are still surviving... so you too are a survivor.  You have to take it day by day, and go through the medication changes etc.  It ain't easy, but if you focus half as much energy on your dreams of a career in computers as you do on your rage, you will be amazed by how it pays.  Good luck sincerely, some days are going to be harder than others but the biggest thing is finding a way to believe that you can achieve the things you desire.<br>  <br>  p.s. Some people think bald men are sexy.  So don't sweat your hair or lack there of.  You have to find a way to be confident.  Half the battle is in finding a way to be at peace with yourself. The other half with the world.|`|Maho3P5kaa	You have to just realize life throws things at you to make you stronger. There's reasons for all the things that have happened to you in your past.

Whining about your problems and hoping someone will fix them for you (they won't, by the way) will get you nowhere.  So ask yourself if you want to get better, or if you want to stay the way you are forever.<br>  <br>  And yes, open up that drawer of Prozac and open wide, in the meantime.
Qj6Klxu8aa	I know how you feel. I work full time, attend college full time and I am planning my wedding. I have little to no time to work out.. to get me to exercise. i found a solution.. I decided to take a step aerobics class at school (my class is an hour and half before my next class giving me enough time to shower/Change).. This way.. i cant cheat and skip a day.. also..another tip is to try a group thing.. instead of hanging out with my friends at a local restaurant to catch up on gossip (because my schedule is too busy to constantly be up to date).. I plan classes we can go to.. for instance.. one of my friends' and I plan one saturday a month to skate to the beach (about a 20 mile skate) and we skate and talk.. another is that we plan yoga every saturday morning.. things like this will keep your body execising almost effortlessly.. i work out.. but it's already part of a fun routine.. I get my workout.. and since my excercising is early on saturday it gives me the rest of the day to do everything else (wedding planning!)<br>   It is a busy schedule.. but you get used to it!|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Im sure you have at least some time to watch tv or something like that. If you have time to watch tv, you have time to work out. <br>  <br>  First step is to stop making excuses and just do what you have to do. And dont get mad cuz i said to stop making excuses. I was the same way as you saying im too busy to exercise when in reality its utter bull. <br>  <br>  You can also try waking up an hour earlier and exercising then. When you exercise your sleep is much better in my exp. i wake up earlier than i used to.
l1suDI2aaa	I am 19 and I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) 2 weeks ago. It sounds scary, but with the right medical attention and treatment, you will be fine. The first thing you want to do is find either a family doctor or gynecologist. They will do blood tests on you and an ultrasound, to see the cysts. The blood tests will show abnormal hormone levels, which causes irreguler periods and hair. Once diagnosed, the doctor will put on you birth control, most likely Yazmin or another Pill that helps regulate your period. I was also put on Provera, a hormone pill. I was told that getting pregant will be difficult, but there is hope.Having PCOS puts you at a higher risk for heart attacks, Type 2 diabetes, and strokes.  There are also support groups you can go to for advice and support. Good Luck!

You should exercise daily for at least half an hour.. I would definately do some cardio.. <br>  <br>  Running, hiking, biking, walking, playing a sports.. Also you could do some squats, sit ups, push ups, chin ups.. <br>  <br>  I would start with that and weight yourself weekly...

vhTXHv3Eaa	Eat enough so that you feel energized like you used to before you were anorexic. Don't worry about the calories. You know you burned them when you're hungry and you've been doing active things. So eat more. If you find it hard to eat because your stomach is small, eat things that are literally small, but higher in calories and nutrients, such as nuts. Follow this idea, and you won't gain weight if you don't want to. Eat as needed, don't worry about your weight - that is part of anorexia. Good luck, be well.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	No your still starving yourself,, what is with the every other day not eating?  You know you need food to live right?  You need a nutritionists.  A professional.

WPzaF2osaa	Conduction refers to how fast signaling is going from cell to cell. If you slow the conduction you will decrease the heart rate. The signaling is going from cell to cell by depolarization which is the change on the chemical polarity from negative to positive. The dromotrope medication slow the signaling or depolarization, affecting conduction and slowing heart rate.<br>  Example: Digitalis.

QevBVANtaa	you've asked this question like 10 times! Seriously, you're 13... You will NOT gain weight.|`|onVUS2fGaa	Depends. Basically, if you take in more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. I think read somewhere that 1200 calories per day is the minimum an adult needs to subsist.<br>  Have you been losing weight with your restrictive diet? Were you maintaining your weight with your previous eating habits? If so, about how many calories did you used to take in a day?|`|ZUcotIz0aa	In order to get an accurate answer, you might want to state what you're eating, what you weigh, and what you want you're target weight to be. Or if you even need to lose weight. From my experience with my eating disorder, you're much safer eating at least 2000 calories of healthy, balanced food a day and exercising a reasonable amount. That way you'll lose fat, not muscle, if you need to. If you're trying to maintain weight, you need more calories than you think you do. I eat around 2300 a day and run varsity track and field, and lose weight despite my attempts to gain it. Whatever works for you, just don't starve yourself because that will backfire.

After a while your weight will start to change to suit your body. Be active. Not exercise crazy. Just active, and this will assist the change. Avoid soft drinks and the like and any sugary drinks. They will just slow down the process. At all times avoid anything deep fried or your efforts will be for nothing.|`|AA10356839	Should be right now.

For running, I run at a speed of 5.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, ligh|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Been there,done that and was successful. You seem to know everything you need to do to get the job done. All I really did was eat in moderation and I did cut back quite a bit with fast food especially and sweets like pastries. Drink a lot of water because it keeps you full. Eat healthy meals to keep you full and energized and don't step on the scale all the time because when you do and you don't see results right away you might get a little discouraged. I don't know if you have ever heard of the plateau which is when you start to lose weight and then for like 2 weeks or so your body doesn't really lose any more weight and that is just because your body has gotten used to the routine that you are on so in order to keep losing the weight you must switch up your excersises and or have a more intense workout. You could do that by walking more than usual or running more or adding different excersises. You will do fine!|`|AztCTaQlaa	the 2 major things that helped me was looking into the Glycemic Index (which I was looking up for other health reasons), and picking a specific exercise routine that targeted which section of the body I wanted to lose the weight in (I wanted to keep the big boobs but I wanted to lose the after-preggo belly underneath).|`|8808e091a57fb568a09a8ed8899d7902aa	Dear, I've lost 60 lb, with hard work and starving BUT, I stumbled on this book just about two weeks ago.

The book is called 'I CAN MAKE YOU THIN"  by Dr. Paul McKenna. If anything else, it is helping me to really have a good relationship with food and see it from a different perspective.

I realize that my body was my problem and I just didn't take care of. So I decided to change myself not for no one but for myself. I use to be 210 when I started my quest. I decided to start small that way my body would get the hang of what its not use too. So every other day I either went for a walk or roller bladed, things that I knew that would be fun to me..That's the key, Find that one thing that you enjoy and each time you do it, challenge yourself Little more each time. Look I am where your at right now, its really hard to want something that you want so bad, but I know where your coming from. Long story short I went down to 164lb and love every minute of it. But happiest lol happen and I gain 20 back. But I am willing to try my hardest to get back on the weight-loss again. Look I hope Im not going to sound weird, but I think that if we talk to each other on Messenger, I think we will be able to give each other the support that we need. That's one thing I need the most and I  not really getting here. You are just like me and I feel that if we help each other just by sating goals. We can do it. Do you watch biggest loser? cause we can do something like that. that's if you want too. Write back add me lil_Robinson85@yahoo.com. Thank.

fwWO14fIaa	yeah eggs are a very good source of protein as they contain most of the essential amino acids that are needed to build muscle, usually a medium sized egg will contain 7 - 8g of protein, so have them scrambled or boiled instead of fried in the morning. and yeah the body can only digest about 40g of protein every 2 - 3 hours, anything over that and it will be stored as fat.

ZTXRF7fuaa	I wanted to reduce fat in my breasts, as well as everywhere else. Cardio and watching what you eat are the best ways to lose fat. That's what my mother has told me forever (and mothers know best). I have been working out for almost 2 months now, on an elliptical (also a small amount of weight training). My breasts are becoming slightly smaller. They are shrinking in proportion to the rest of my body. <br>  <br>  Try drinking green tea and water before you work out, eating a good amount of fiber to keep the bowel movements coming, and stay away from sugar.<br>  <br>  If you're only looking to lose weight in your breasts and nowhere else, I don't know what to tell you.|`|pTrldx2maa	When I had a surgery that prevented me from doing sit-ups I gained TWO cup sizes.. so the best thing I can say - is do push ups..

It's not about doing hours and hours of excercise, it's about moving your body, accelerating your metabolism.<br>  With that, you will start burning fat faster.<br>  <br>  Another good tip to loose weight is distributing your meals. <br>  Instead of 3 large meals, maybe do 6 small meals, you will be eating the same amount of food, but in different intervals of the day.<br>  Fruit and vegetables are really important, because they will bring a good source of energy and minerals, but will not contribute to weight gain.<br>  <br>  Just try to eat healthy, don't starve yourself, that only makes loosing weight harder.<br>  <br>  130 pounds is not much for someone your height, just eat healthy and you will do alright.

BG8vMyZjaa	*  Exercise regularly. Physical exercise is an important element of optimum kidney health. This is especially important if you are living with a single kidney. Exercise helps to lower or control blood pressure and increases insulin sensitivity, helping to prevent against type II diabetes (adult onset diabetes). Both hypertension and diabetes are major underlying factors responsible for kidney failure, so it is important to guard against them. In addition to diet, exercise plays a key role in preventing and controlling these two serious conditions.<br>  <br>      There are many other benefits of exercising. When you engage in physical exercise, the blood and other substances are stirred and toxins and other waste products are eliminated more efficiently. It also help to improve circulation and other metabolic functions. This allows oxygen and essential nutrients to be transported more efficiently around the body, resulting in better overall health.<br>  <br>      It is advisable to check with your doctor before starting any program of exercise. Start slowly, then gradually increase intensity. Whether you have one kidney or not, regular exercise should become a lifestyle habit.

9OyIL8P9aa	I am so sorry to hear about your loss. I know how you feel. I had a miscarriage Dec.18/08. It is a painful thing to have to experience. <br>  But you are taking the first step in recovery by sharing your story with us. Life can be so unfair at times. I like you was about 7 week when my little "peanut" grew wings and left. It is hard as hell.<br>  You will notice that some days are good and some are so hard. But the more that you are able to share with others about how you are doing and feeling, it helps. <br>  This might be something that you might want to consider doing, get a candle with some ribbon  wrapped around it , as a way to remember. <br>  That is what I have done, and I keep it at my bedside. <br>  There are some really great support groups on line that you can also join. One of them that really helped me was www.ivillage.com.<br>  There is no way to ever get over the pain. But talking, sharing does help you come to terms with it all.<br>  IF you ever need to talk or just share please feel free to email me and I will get back to you asap.<br>  leblancr16@yahoo.com<br>  Take things day by day, and remember your little angle is always with you. <br>  Hope this helps. Wish you all the best.|`|AA12074512	you  will never get over it.. you just have to go on..with your life.|`|fMilDRgLaa	Talking about it is a good step.  It helps to share your story with others that can empathize with you.  You will always have that void in your heart, but it does get easier.  I had a miscarriage in Nov. 2002 and two successful pregnancies since then.  I would be lying if I said that I still don't get teary-eyed at times, but I can honestly say I don't think about it every single day now.  Take Care. Time is a healer.
Rwf8D5toaa	If you're walking thirty to forty-five minutes a day and have a fairly active job, that's a good amount of activity; congrats! But remember that your body needs more energy just to live when you weigh more. As you lose weight, you will need to reduce how much you eat, but twelve hundred calories a day is very low.<br>  <br>  As an example...<br>  If you are female, 200 lbs., 5'6" tall, and 30 years old, you need almost 1700 calories just to function! That's if you stayed in bed all day! (That's called your BMR, or Basal Metabolic Rate.)<br>  <br>  Add in your activity level, and you'll see it. Right now, your body thinks you are starving, and it is going to fight to hold on to every bit of fat it can!<br>  <br>  On a personal note, I had always been very slender but then gained weight during a couple of tough semesters of school during my late twenties. I can relate to the shock of not being slender anymore! But I did it, and so can you. Good luck!|`|HlD9dRF2aa	It sounds like your body has gone into starvation mode and is trying to store everything you're consuming.  Your metabolism has slowed down and your mindset has changed to that of a 'dieter'.<br>  <br>  Start swimming or cycling and start thinking like an athlete again.  Sign up for an event and start training and eating like the athlete you were before.<br>  <br>  Remember, low intensity and add distance at a rate of 10% per week. Slow easy workouts burn fat.|`|1tjJPHpMaa	you don't eat enough. you messed up your metabolism and hit a plateau. you need to add calories to your diet.

ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,<br>  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower<br>  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and<br>  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have<br>  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone<br>  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.<br>  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.<br>  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and<br>  the environment can be strong factors.<br>  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around<br>  more,<br>  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability<br>  to gain weight may signal a condition<br>  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing<br>  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or<br>  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy. <br>  Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the<br>  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good<br>  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,<br>  stroke, and<br>  cancer. <br>  If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you<br>  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy<br>  weight loss, takes time and<br>  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.<br>  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight<br>  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the<br>  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,<br>  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann<br>  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,<br>  and a small amount of fat. <br>  Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to<br>  higher in fat or sugar. <br>  Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may<br>  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and<br>  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk<br>  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes. <br>  If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or<br>  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins<br>  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices<br>  versus the whole mango). <br>  Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal. <br>  Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to<br>  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake. <br>  With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as<br>  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). <br>  Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good<br>  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you<br>  will enjoy. <br>  Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter<br>  sandwich.|`|p0Xw8hLZaa	Don't always eat junk food.  it's very bad for your health!<br>  Try some lean meats and protein, like take a turkey sandwich to eat at lunch and some ham or roast beef for dinner.

3DqNexwkaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was   <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|FI9mYCQ1aa	You have made a good choice by looking into Acai. <br>  <br>  Acai berries have far more antioxidants than any other fruit. Even more than blueberries! Besides that, the nutrients in acai berry supplements help many other diseases and maladies, from diabetes to arthritis to blood clotting. It really is a worthwhile supplement to add to your daily nutrition.<br>  <br>  Acai has great anti-aging benefits, will cleanse and detoxify you, and has destroyed cancer cells in recent studies. You really can't go wrong by adding an acai supplement to your daily vitamin regimen. So far it's working for me by helping my digestion, curbing my appetite, and by giving me more energy each day... I don't even get sleepy around 3pm anymore.<br>  <br>  Acai berries are a great weight loss aid. The berry’s natural concoction of essential fatty acids, fiber, phytosterols and amino acids work together to help your body burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly and shed the unwanted pounds that you’d like to lose.<br>  <br>  The fatty acids and amino acids aid in both muscle development and proper digestion, both of which are essential to fat loss. The fiber helps your body to move food out of your system quicker and also to help you feel full, as do fatty acids. Phytosterols help fortify your digestive tract, moving waste materials out and absorbing nutrients more efficiently.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you what I recommend, and then I'll tell you why...<br>  <br>  I recommend you get a free trial of Acai Power from <a href="http://barbiefood.com/acai-free-trial.html" rel="nofollow">http://barbiefood.com/acai-free-trial.ht...</a> <br>  This is the product I use, and honestly I feel better every day. If you don't like it, just don't reorder it... but you'll like it. =)<br>  <br>  I attempted this past weekend to find a good acai supplement at GNC, Vitamin World, Hannafords, and Shaws, but I was unable to find something that was cheap, high quality, and not filled with sugar and other fillers. I am going to keep getting Acai Power for now.|`|LzNzgU8Faa	i dont think so

B4YESGmwaa	One way of dealing with our own problem is to share the fine details with someone else-like why we started, how it go worse, negative consequeces from it and what we would like to do in order to get better. By helping someone else by telling our own story we can help ourselves.Express the concern you have for her and any negatives you can already see happening to her. tell her you appreciate the concern but putting herself in harms way only causes you more stress.<br>  Then the two of you might benefit from going to a self help group. If all that is not helping Both of you ne to get into counseling. God Bless Reggie|`|Xc7lzWUraa	Maybe you and her cld try sitting down together to  talk to someone you both trust, and explain you situation, and explain how your friend is trying to help.

uJKTR4d2aa	Hell im an adult and i still eat kids things like that.
HwcXuzSSaa	Actually, you don't have to diet as such to lose weight, the one thing which clearly worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it was reported in Reader's Digest and CNN. I worked off twenty pounds, it clearly does produce success!
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|lYr1zmQeaa	i think its unlikely that you'll lose that much that fast but i'd suggest doing it anyway and then the next time you see them you'll get a lot of positive feedback and it will probably make yourself feel better, plus can you say shopping spree for clothes that fit better once you've lost 10-15 lbs?(at least one jean size am i right?)
dpgXzMenaa	FAT????<br>  <br>  You're quite a lot *thinner* than average, even for a young girl... but your weight is perfectly healthy.   You don't need to lose an ounce, and gaining 5 or even 15 pounds would do you no harm at all.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kidsnutrition.org/bodycomp/bmiz2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidsnutrition.org/bodycomp/bm...</a><br>  A 62-inch tall, 90-pound, 13-year-old girl has a body mass index (BMI) of 16.5, which is at the 17th percentile for age.

I'm a 25 year old male. I started out on 20mg. the side effects were fairly minimal for me. common side effects are insomnia(little sleep) or hypersomnia(sleeping alot), fatigue, drowsiness, weight gain, and delayed ejaculation in males. I had some delayed ejaculation but that's good for the ladies.<br>  <br>  Since you are 21 you are in the age category of 16-24 year olds, where a study of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) showed a possible increase in suicidal ideations(thoughts) and a worsening of depression symptoms in some subjects taking SSRIs. This does not mean that it will happen to you but it's something to be aware of to tell your doctor in case it does happen.<br>  <br>  After nearly a year on 20mg I started having some suicidal thoughts and was feeling really fatigued/drowsy all the time so I switched to 40mg. I have been on that new dose for 4 weeks. I still feel drowsy alot but have less suicidal thoughts. I'm thinking about talking to my doctor to switch my medicine. You may find that the medicine works great initially but after a while that you need to increase the dose or switch to something else.<br>  <br>  Of course, your results will vary but I hope that my story will help you.

I then was switched to citalopram (sp?) and it clashed with my epilepsy med, landing me in hospital...so I've not had the best recent experience with meds.<br>  Then again, those badd experiences can also be due to the fact that I'm on medication to control my epilepsy, and as is always said, everyone is different.<br>  Hope I helped and didn't scare you, thats just my own exp with the drugs-yours could be completely different.<br>  Midge|`|UAk6LyD3aa	I've been on fluoxetine after trying to do myself in.<br>  First I took them, at a very low dose and I did often skipped tablets.

It got so bad that i was in a even worse depression than i was before.  The same thing happend to my brother when he was younger. He tried that medicine and it worked for a while, but then it just got really bad.  So then i switched to a different kind and i felt a lot better... but i guess it's different fo everybody. I mean, why not give it a try? Even though it didn't work for us, it could JUST the thing you need to feel better!<br>  I hope you feel better REALLY soon! :)

There are lots of temptations in the big wide world don't you think?! The sole method which really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today.

fZGcufB7aa	You wanted to start your period?  Well me too! I wanted to start ever since I was 10. At 11 I started. And don't worry it seems like your going to start very soon. You don't need to bring pads to school with you. At my school they have pads in the office. 12 is the normal age to start. And yes a headache also means that you are going to start. I was one of the first girls to start my period actually. And believe me after you start you want won't want to have them. They are discusting! I hate them. I have had mine for about 9 months and it's terrible. Discharges def meant that you are going to start your period. I have them all the time. And to helps with discharges you can just put a pantie liner on. My boobs always hurt when I will start too. <br>  <br>  When I first started I didn't have any discharges or headaches so that's a good thing that you do. <br>  <br>  This month I have been late and I don't know why. I just asked a question about why I am late.<br>  <br>  Well good luck with mother nature!|`|hZWup7xXaa	most girls usually do start around the time their mother did. i don't understand why so many girls want to have it, it sucks, its no fun what so ever, the day you get it is the day you will regret wanting it! anyways to answer your question the biggest sign that you will have it soon is a reddish/brown discharge, when you get this your period should start soon, but can take up to a year. not all girls get this discharge though, some skip it, if you do get this discharge just use panty liners and ask your mom for pads so you will be ready for when it does start. a purse to keep them in is a great idea. hope this helps hun :)|`|015535497f0d21404dcec4c6c6068ab1aa	Yeah, you're getting there.  Be prepared, as your Mom has advised you.

Note that every girl is different and starts out never the same with puberty and their period. If it eases your mind bring a little makeup bag to school with a pad or two. You will learn that you will forever be doing this from now on too. Just relax and go with the flow. You don't have to feel weird that others started before you or anything. Just think of it as in one less year you have to! Ha ha. There will be plently of times you wish you never had it once you get it. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you........

You most likely have a little cold. nothing to worry about. Just soothe your throat with some cough drops and some water, or hot cocoa. A lot of people get sore throats when they wake up because your throat has been dry the whole night! so that might also be a reason. i don't think a sore throat has to do with puberty though..anywayss, i hope you get better soon </3|`|2eztcCO0aa	My guess is that you're snoring at night.  Your mouth is hanging open and your throat is drying out.  <br>  <br>  Do you sleep on your back?  Learn to sleep on your side.<br>  Are you overweight?  You might lose some and see if that helps.<br>  Are you drinking alcohol and going to bed drunk?  Stop.<br>  Do you wake up exhausted?  You may have sleep apnea.  You will need the help of a doctor to correct this, because if you let it go you could actually die of it.

KFMQepJtaa	I don't know about methotrexate, however I do take Plaquenil for lupus and it says right on the pharmacy handout that antacids reduce the effectiveness of plaquenil.  Which is a bummer because plaquenil causes some heartburn and stomach upset.  I wouldn't worry too much about the retinopathy.  Just be sure to get the eye exams done every 6 months or year and they should catch any problems before they become a problem.

Check out your BMI at BMI for Kids, <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/weight/bmi.html," rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/weigh...</a> to see if your weight is in the healthy range.  Enter your information to calculate the BMI, then go to the graph for girls to see what range it fits into.  If it's in the safe/healthy range, just accept your body for what it is right now, you'll probably fill out in a few more years.  If it's in the underweight range, you might want to see a doctor to get some tests done, such as your thyroid function.  Make sure you're eating a healthy, balanced diet, including some fat.  Girls are supposed to carry a higher percentage of body fat than boys, that is normal and healthy, and it will help to fill in the spaces a bit more than your muscles will.  Don't overdo the weight training, get into aerobic exercising as well, not so much to burn calories as just to stay healthy.

There is no real quick way to lose that fat- you must use a combination of regular moderately intense aerobic exercise along with a diet that is high in fiber.  There is some evidence that monounsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, avocados) can help reduce body fat, but not without exercise.  You can also add some green tea to your diet- catechins in tea may help.|`|xktBgoKFaa	Fish with omega-3 fatty acids helps to reduce belly fat, according to research.

2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Oh sweet thing - it's okay.  If it makes you feel any better, I'm supposed to be a grown up and I have ****** things up for years.  It's so confusing when we can't do things right and it doesn't seem to matter how hard we try when things just don't go our way.  One thing I've learned is that it is our mistakes that give us the best experiences and we learn the most from them.  And it's awful when we think the worst about ourselves - and there's something you need to know and it's that everyone at some time feels awful about themselves.  I do promise you one thing and it's that if you do die you never get a chance to find things out about yourself, you never get a chance to make things right and you never get a chance to see what may come.  Your age is one of the hardest times in your early life - so many things are changing, so many new experiences are happening with your body, your social world is different, and you are almost an adult but still very much a child.  Of course you will feel confused and like you don't belong here - your body is in the process of finding it's way in the world.  I like to think of this time as vegetable soup - when you first start to make the soup it's just a bunch of chopped up ingredients that are sitting in a pot of water without much flavor.  It's not till after hours of cooking, stirring, adding seasoning that it begins to have some taste and flavor.  It takes cooking to make it something good.  and that is what life is like - it takes cooking to make something good.  Please don't give up on yourself, please think about talking to a friend, a teacher or counselor, a minister or someone you trust who would listen to you -parents often don't want to hear their child's hard feelings and want to fix it immediately, so it is good to talk to a friend.  Life is full of good things, and there are a lot of hard things as well.  We have to learn to really appreciate the good things when they come, we need to learn what really is good and remember those times because when it gets hard we need to have those memories.  You are not as alone as you think - there a lot of us out here who share pain, who share life, who'd be willing to share a moment and talk to ease your pain.  Remember that.|`|7YTiooX5aa	Okay first of all get a grip.....second of all dude you are only 13 and if your only worry is that you lie and are worried about messing up stop for a minute and remember you are only 13 it is your job is to mess up that way you can learn from it. suicide is never the answer to anything that is just the easy way out. look if you really need someone to talk to try your school counselor if that's no help try your parents and then friends and if none of that  works then go to a complete stranger ( email me if you want ) and see if they can help|`|GfG6wupTaa	Everyone has the right to live. Since you said you are on the verge of being overweight, have you had your thyroid checked? It is hereditary. Or talk to a doctor about depression. These feelings can be fixed if you ask for help. You couldn't always feel like this. Think of how you felt before, don't you want to be like that again???????|`|tCmwFJn5aa	You are not a loser.  Take walks and take up Taekwondo or something to relieve your stress.  Stay focussed and do not think about the past.  Make a new future for yourself.  You have to pull yourself together.

Do not kill yourself please, you're still so young and have so much to live for. Your life is just beginning. Drugs don't solve anything, don't do them. Do not try bulimia or anorexia either, they are both very unhealthy for you. I know you may feel like you want to die now, but you really don't. You are a special person and your parents, family and friends all love you and would be so sorry if anything happened to you. Someone out there cares for you, don't let that person down. You control whether or not you're happy, so try to be happy. Live your life.|`|xsixZlUAaa	Things will get better I promise you. And keep avoiding doing anything bad to yourself. And god is real! I now because I have a religion to and I always ell myself everything will get better and I now it. And always keep an open circle with your parents. And never try to starve yourself or anything close to that. And also drugs are NOT the answer to any thing! Always remember god is the answer to all of your problems and HE can help through anything! But always remember, you have to love yourself before you can love anyone else and always remember you can love yourself!
hi4MYjicaa	Well, you should do some type of exercise. There are plenty of things you can do in your own home like running up stairs, sit ups, push ups, buy some yoga tapes, etc. Besides that, here are some tips I have for you. <br>  . Don’t eat too late<br>  . Drink plenty of water<br>  . Eat breakfast! Have something high in fiber <br>  . Don’t eat or snack while playing on  the computer, watching T.V, sitting on the couch, eat your meal at the table.<br>  . If you’re eating a snack like chips, don’t just eat them from the bag pour some in bowl so you wont be tempted to overeat. <br>  . Buy smaller plates and dishes, you can trick your mind by thinking the portions are larger than they really are by using smaller dishes.<br>  . Drink a big glass of water before and after each meal and before snacking.<br>  . You don’t have to give up chocolate completely, in fact it could mess up your diet by doing so. A small  piece of chocolate (preferably dark) wont hurt your diet.|`|xPoenaMpaa	think of it as a healthy lifestyle! eat lots of fruits and vegetables and make sure you at least get aliitle bit of excercise everyday... and if you sign up for a gym use tredmills, weights, and go swimming, that really is a good form of excercise and it builds up youre muscles too! good luck :P
Wo4Gxtduaa	it can be anything, here let me help,  check the following: <br>  <br>  Implantation Bleeding:<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>   Delay/Difference in Menstruation:<br>  <br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  <br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>   Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  <br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  <br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  <br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  <br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  <br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  <br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  <br>  still even lets say you have all of this then, it cant guarentee yoru preganancy ask a doctor or take a "first response" test.<br>  <br>  if you are pregnant congrats ^_^|`|8arOL9Jdaa	make sure you take an at home test with your first pee of the day that is when the pregnancy hormone is most abundant, and it is still possible if it is early enough in your pregnancy the hormone may not be noticeable, five days is usually not long enough for a test to be positive.

Arnold Schwarzenegger himself admits that he started weight lifting at a young age and has grown to be 6"2 and Lou Ferrigno ( The Incredible Hulk) started working out at the age of 14 at the height of 5"2 and grew to a height of 6"2 aswell, so no i don't believe that weight training stunts growth, In fact, weight training is good for your musculoskeletal system, so just carry on doing what your doing you will be fine.

naUnne6jaa	Congrats on the wedding to start. I have just recently lost 32 lbs after being told that my cholesterol was to high I weighed 195 and am now down to 163. I started my diet by taking a cleansing tea and completely cleansing my whole system to start fresh and then I eat a limited diet. I also work two jobs and I have no time to even breather lead alone get to  a gym I walk and exercises whenever I can I try to constantly keep moving and not slow down I do Ab exercises at my desk. My meal usually contains Canadian bacon in the morning with a very light lunch usually a 100 calorie pack popcorn and then I eat at dinner as usual I switched all my foods though I only eat whole grain bread and switched from regular sugar to only splenda and I also drink atleast a gallon to two of water. I always take my weekends and go off my diet though and splurge that way I do not feel like I am restricting myself and it keeps me motivated..<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on the wedding once again|`|fHBdg6Vbaa	I lost my 20lbs, by one thing...eating what i wanted BUT less of it, instead of a whole bag of chips have a few ...bowl of ice cream then a few spoonfuls  just eat what u want but less.

sG80JKvtaa	This is because you are revving up your metabolism.  When you don't eat your body goes into survival mode and slows down your metabolism (which can actually lead to weight gain).  So when you do eat your body reacts by speeding up your metabolism and burning the calories.<br>  <br>  Another reason may be your food choices.  Certain foods will make you feel hungry faster.  You want to focus on foods like veggies, fruits, lean proteins that will help you feel full and stay full longer.<br>  <br>  Below is a link to some useful tips on eating healthy.  With these healthier foods you will hopefully feel less hungry after eating.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|ckvj9EMQaa	I Find Just Doing 20 Sit ups a Day and jogging a small distance each day helped me! :-)
bvt9kvS8aa	Diet Plan:<br>  Breakfast - Oats or porragie<br>  Lunch - sandwich or soup<br>  Dinner - mash, veggies, and some fish or chicken ( grilled ) or some spinach and brown rice<br>  Snacks - try to only snack on stuff like Fruits, raisins, low<br>  sugar popsicles ect..<br>  <br>  & Heres a few weight lose tips:<br>  - No sugar or sweet stuff.. sugar turns straight to fat<br>  <br>  - Buy Low fat salt, low fat sugar or no salt or sugar would be even better.<br>  <br>  - only drink water and green tea, green tea is great its known to speed up the metabolism. Drink NO sodas.. not even diet ones they still can give you gas and bloating<br>  <br>  - Switch to brown! That means trade white brea, white rice, white paste t brown pasta, bread and rice.<br>  <br>  - Use no oil in cooking, oven cook everything<br>  <br>  - become more active.. move around a lot more.. for example don't ask someone to pass you the remote get up and get it your self.. run, swim, play wii ( standing up ) do what ever you can to burn calories..<br>  <br>  - Make your meals smaller, half them from your original size..<br>  <br>  - Avoid alllll fast foods.. its terrible for you its full of oil and salt and its the reason why over 50% over Americans are overweight.<br>  <br>  - Go organic or Vegetarian.. When i went vegetarian a few -pounds dropped in weeks without me even trying.<br>  <br>  - Sleep More - The more sleep you get the more your body burns fat.. when your sleeping your body prepares its self.<br>  <br>  - Bring a notebook and pen around with you and write everything you eat, it reallly helps<br>  <br>  - Be determined and motivated without having belief you will never get to where you want to be.. push yourself until you feel happy with your body.<br>  <br>  - Do not eat boxed foods ( ready made mac and cheese and stuff like that ) these foods contains loads of salt and are really bad for you.<br>  <br>  - Get low fat everything ! when you go grocery shopping buy low fat cheese, mayonnaise, ketchups ect..<br>  <br>  - Do not eat two hours before you go to bed.. if you eat and then go straight to sleep, your body will convert the food you ate into fat rather than using it right away as fuel. Ultimately, you'll gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  Any sort of potato chips, even the low-fat ones.<br>  All candy.<br>  All soda, including Diet soda, because it retains water.<br>  Bananas (in excess) They are high in calories.<br>  Butter (in excess)<br>  Oil (in excess) (Try to boil most foods, it REALLY shaves off a lot of fats in your food!)<br>  Nuts (in excess) High in calories.<br>  Bread<br>  Pasta<br>  Rice<br>  Meats (excluding fish, because fish is very healthy)<br>  <br>  Eat lots of:<br>  Fruits, specifically apples and oranges, because they are great-tasting and very low in calories.<br>  Vegetables, especially the following: Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Onion, Hot Peppers. These veggies are called "Negative Calorie" because it takes more calories to digest them than the amount of calories it has in them to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way I got rid of belly fat was doing 50 push ups a night, and 50 sit ups. and doing the hula hoop. i lost loads of belly fat and toned up and the best thing was i started to notice results just in the first week or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Remember to drink LOTS of water, as it helps with digestion and helps to flush away toxins and bacteria that could cause your body to retain fat.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	don't eat before bed.  eat breakfast instead, you'll burn off breakfast calories.|`|mlaLgoaSaa	1. Change your diet. Try and obtain most of your calories from complex carbohydrates (this will give you energy and keep you feeling full). Remember, you lose fat by burning more calories each day than you consume. Example: If you burn 2000 calories each day just by existing, and burn 300 more through exercise, eat less that 2300 calories. Never skip breakfast. Snacks are fine as long as they are healthy. Examples: fresh fruit and veggies, rice crisps, peanuts, yogurt, etc...) Also, little things will help tons! Like, switch to skim milk, eat low fat yogurt, use cooking spray instead of oils, opt for the low fat foods, eat whole grain bread... All these things will help a lot. <br>  <br>  2. Drink AT LEAST 8 (8oz) glasses of water each day. The more water you drink the better. Especially if you are working out.<br>  <br>  3. Try and do 20-40 minutes of continuous cardio exercise (jogging, speed walking, elliptical, biking) every day, at least 3 times per week (the more days you can do this, the better).<br>  <br>  4. Create a weight training schedule. Try to do some general strength training exercises at least 3 times per week. Remember, muscle burns fat. So, the more lean muscle tissue that is on your body, the faster you will burn fat.<br>  <br>  5. Stretch! This will help to lengthen and tone your muscles. Some studies even show that it can help to prevent injury. It also feels awesome!<br>  <br>  It sometimes takes about 8-12 weeks after starting a weight loss regime to see results (depending on the intensity of your fitness plan). So be patient, and keep with it! It will pay off.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|4BX3w4Wqaa	Okay, losing weight requires actual work and power-of-will, which most young Americans lack. First, good foods that REALLY help losing weight are lettuce***, tomatoes**, cauliflower**(cooked), garlic**, onions** , pretty much the majority of vegetables, start eating your favorites out of them little by little, no rush. And do your very best to limit your dairy food sources, they increase fat heavily if consumed repeatably, everyday, non-stop. Watch out for a lot of sweets as well, limit those too. I was always told that your allowed to eat ANYTHING as long as you put it into a limit. DO NOT EVER STARVE YOURSELF ! many people i have known and know have and ended up with almost fatal* results; be smart. Also, exercises of course should be part of your daily routine. Buy a waste trimming belt from modell's or any other sports store, wrap it around your waist only when your working out (especially jogging, sit ups, squats, etc..)   Work out about 15 to 30 minutes before eating and maybe two to three hours after eating. You will do great, just believe in yourself. Get your headphones+ipod or whatever you have and go out for a light jog once in a while, if you can try sprinting (running as fast as possible) for a limited distance and time. Never be shy to work out, indoors or outdoors just because people might be present, you are trying to reach a goal and no one has the right to get in your way. You can care-less about what people think of you. Also under no circumstances become a vegetarian, eat well cooked meat, but also to a limit, meat helps a lot. Don't forget fruits (all of them are good and burn fat especially kiwis, pineapples, lemons, and grapefruit). Use no weight losing supplements (they will cause harm), do everything* naturally. If you hopefully follow my advice i can almost guarantee great results, just put your heart and mind into it, build discipline. Best of luck.|`|4unEXytPaa	Targetted weight loss is quite difficult, many people would declare impossible, however the one method that really worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today.

Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example).

Plus, it will give you the 'me time' that you really need - especially when you are dealing with taking care of a sick little one. But if you are feeling really tired, you should rest and try to keep your next gym appointment. You don't want to risk getting yourself sick too!<br>  <br>  Hope that your baby feels better quick!!!
RvddYKqjaa	Your "pink flappy" was very sore? Well, that could be serious. Anything that hurts there could be serious. I don't know what your 'flappy' has to do with pee, but if that's where you hold it, I guess it could be that. Or you had rough sex last night? Or you have an infection of the flappy. I'm not trying to rude, but I would think that a person old enough to have sex would know a more mature term for her body parts. I don't think it will cause anything.  Hope everything feels better by now.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Lol, pink flappy?<br>  <br>  It was probably an allergic reaction.

Stomach ulcers are another known factor from stress as is hypertension, atherosclerosis and stroke.

ZCe0DfFTaa	Try running a bit more than what your used to. Your body is has probably coped with this so it doesnt burn anything. Try running a bit more, maybe 10-20 minutes more.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	You try, does that mean you sometimes dont go every 3 days? And no more than 5, does that mean some days you'll do one mile while others you'll do 3?<br>  <br>  you have to be consistant. Make it possible to do 3 days minimum and go to 5 days when you feel ready. Instead of 2 or 4 or 5 miles go for an hour of jogging/walking. <br>  <br>  Also if your eating the same your not going to lose weight very well at all. If your trying to lose weight you need to consume around 1500 calories|`|VqFRIJ44aa	This is a huge common misconception amongst people. What you need to realise is by doing all this running, you are actually improving your cardiovascular system, but not really burning fat.<br>  <br>  To get in the fat burning zone you need to raise your metabolism. This is when your body starts to burn fat, throughout the day after exercise. So you in actual fact need to cut down on the amount of cardio you are doing but make it much more intense!<br>  <br>  Take a look at the difference in physique from long distance runners and sprinters. A long distance runner is skinny, gaunt and almost looks ill. However a sprinter, carries a muscular, lean physique with almost zero body fat.<br>  <br>  Slow, boring cardio will have an effect for a while, but you will lose most of the benefits once your body adjusts to this. By doing much more intense bursts of cardio, your body will thank you in the long run.<br>  <br>  Something that i do a couple of times a week (and takes me no longer than 20-25 minutes at a time) is hill sprints. Find a hill that will take you anywhere from 10-15 seconds to sprint up and give it 100% all out effort. Once you get to the top, turn around and walk back down. Repeat this process 8 - 10 times. Just doing a 20 minute session like this will burn the same amount of calories as a 40 minute run, but will raise your fat burning capabilities by nearly 300%. Even running on a normal flat surface, throw in a 10 second sprint every 2 minutes.<br>  <br>  I also note you have not mentioned any resistance training. People shy away from and are scared of doing weights, because they wrongly believe it will bulk them up. You can quite easily do a circuit-training session of weights, that will give you a lean, muscular physique, but because you are doing one exercise after another without any rest, you will find you are also using "cardio", which will have the effect of burning fat! The benefits for raising your metabolism and burning fat by doing weights will far outweigh the benefits of straight cardio.<br>  <br>  I have seen people write here that you need to be doing more cardio.. WRONG! where does it all stop? If you work out this way, does that mean in 5 years time because you are much fitter, that you have to train for 10 hours a day? Get real! You need to work out smarter, not more thats all! <br>  <br>  I have included access below to a great circuit-training session that will blast away body fat and also please give the sprint/jog type of training a go.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|UvG0vP1jaa	Pete,<br>  There is a lot of good technical info from other answerers here but in my opinion, you will find a simple answer if you have three things -- patience, faith and a running log.  First of all you ARE burning calories during and after your 5 mile runs.  Whether you are burning free carbs or stored fat doesn't really matter, so keep it up!  Record your daily mileage and weight and total them up at the end of the week.  Look for a trend in your weekly mileage with respect to your weekly average weight over two or so months.  (This is the patience part.)  Of course keep in mind what the other answers are saying about energy burned versus taken in and the type (high-fat versus healthy choices) of calories you are taking in.  Have FAITH that it will work.  It will. If your fat is not burning as quickly as you like, increase your WEEKLY mileage by 10% per week, either by longer sessions or more running days per week.  Then you will know how much longer to have to run to get the results you want.  Every body is different and in general the older you are the more patience you will need.  GOOD LUCK!!|`|i4bjQbPcaa	To burn fat you need to make sure that you are not eating more calories than what you use when you are exercising.<br>  <br>  Make sure that when you are running you are getting your heart rate up as this is when the fat burning starts.

FoEWvYEsaa	If you are the type of person who ate badly and never worked out the pounds are going to come off very fast in the beginning.

Most of thos 12 lbs were likely water weight with some fat loss however I suggest you track your loss by inches instead of lbs.

D0INurhZaa	i am not a doctor, but i am pretty sure a menstrual blood clot will not go to your brain or heart, i think they are referring to blood clots that form in your organs or veins.  but i am 25 and every month my period is slightly different, one month i get cramps and another month i wont have cramps but a huge headache, and as far as the bleeding and clotting, i wouldnt worry about it unless you develop other symptoms or severe pain, if you are that worried make an appointment for the obgyn, if you havent been yet you are getting close to the age to go for the first time.

1021f7b7dd4b55793a7f4d6f9e547c85aa	First off, DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED! I am on Weight Watchers as well, so I have some experience with the program. A good amount to lose on a weekly basis is 1-2 pounds (typically your first week you lose more). Anything more is typically unhealthy.<br>  <br>       Next, be certain that you are properly assigning your points. Make sure your portions correlate exactly with point value. For example, if I make a HUGE turkey sandwich and look at the Weight Watchers point assignment it says 6 points. Realistically, you want to look at the ingredients individually so that you can be sure that you are assigning the proper amount of points for the portion (i.e. 8 ounces of turkey, mayo, cheese, all of these condiments add up, and some people on the diet don't even realize it!) This sandwich could very well be a 14 point sandwich. Be very precise in your point calculations. That is the key to Weight Watchers being effective (I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!)<br>  <br>       GOOD LUCK!|`|BlMNm9Ccaa	My wife and a friend joined WW together. My wife was successful, losing about 50 lbs in 6 months and keeping it off for 2 years now. Her friend  was not so successful and ending up dropping out. They were both doing the same exercise routines. The only outward difference was that my wife ate all of her daily points while her friend would some days eat less and others she would go over and use up her weekly bonus. I think that eating consistently the same amount of points helped my wife in the long run. Good luck and don't get discouraged!|`|RvqpJRFYaa	Ok, I'm eighteen and was pushing one fifty at five three. I joined weight watcher 8 weeks ago and now weigh 135. It WORKS!! The most important thing is the you write EVERYTHING down.. Its not easy.. and it has to be something that you want. Go at it with all you work. And if you still continue to not lose talk to your leader. There will be weeks you lose nothing. Or in my case you lose .4 lbs. You will lose all of the weight you want you just have to stick with it. Also try adding some exercise in there. It will Burn those lbs off FAST!!|`|b39d8b3912f4b38c8141efa2a212423eaa	Don't stress. You're probably not plateauing. :-)<br>  <br>  If you're doing everything right, then the weight *will* come off. Just don't focus on the scale as being the only indicator of how well you're doing. Get the tape out and measure yourself. Write it down and do it once a month. If you use the scale as the only means to watch your body change, you'll miss how fast you lose those inches.<br>  <br>  Be sure also to check portion size. Weigh everything until you get a hang of how much you should be serving yourself. (After years in a society where everything is large and supersized, it's hard to remember sometimes how big a portion size should be.)<br>  <br>  It sounds like you've been working yourself hard, too. Good on you.^^ But are you making sure to eat all your points? Sometimes, it seems we can lose it faster if we exercise more and cut out more food, but all you end up doing is throwing your body into a "panic mode". So if you exercise a lot, make sure you do eat all your allocated points because it'll really help keep your metabolism up.  <br>  <br>  You won't always have a loss every week. And that's okay. All it means is that the fat is transitioning to muscle in your body - which is setting you up for an increased metabolism, better tone, and faster fat loss. Just keep at it. You'll get there.^^
HcS8vzNCaa	Working as a cashier is considered light office work.  This activity will burn more calories than sitting on the couch watching television, but less calories than unloading trucks to stock the shelves where you work.  <br>  <br>  From the calorie counting websites I have cited below, taking an average of what they indicate, I come up  with a figure of approximately 500 calories burned.  Your calorie expenditure would be around the same amount you'd burn for slow walking for the same period of time.<br>  <br>  If it gets very busy  for a couple of hours, with longer lines and more people buying merchandise, it won't effect your calorie expenditure by much.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking to burn more calories, you should focus on more intense physical activities after work.  According to the calorie counting websites I researched, activities like climbing stairs--real ones or machines--at a quick pace, without holding onto the rails, or running or bicycling briskly, will burn many times what you burn as a cashier.<br>  <br>  Still, you are right to include your cashier work in your calories burned inventory, if you are looking to balance calorie intake and expenditure to maintain a healthy weight.  You burn calories even when you sleep, even though the number may be minimal.<br>  <br>  Fitness is only possible when you monitor your activities closely, taking the time to analyze what you eat and how you exercise, so you are to be commended for that.  I wish you a long, healthy life.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	not many at all|`|BG8vMyZjaa	You need around 2000 calories to maintain your present weight

AA10988719	Well, I don't know that any FAST way to lose weight is considered healthy.  <br>  <br>  What I can tell you about yoga is it is beneficial to a healthy mind, body and soul.  Benefits of yoga include: improves strength, flexibility, coordination and range of motion, improves circulation, improves cardiovascular health, and benefits, digestive, nervous and respiratory system.  The yoga positions are designed to tone and exercise the muscles and eliminate fat.  Yoga is also in beneficial in the art of relaxation and if you are someone that meditates, this is an ideal time to do it.  I started yoga just last month with the New Year and all, but I find it to be a welcomed addition to my life.  <br>  <br>  here are two links I refer to for yoga info
wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers!

i3pn4jNcaa	you can drop up to about 10 lbs. just make sure your hydrated. and dont make it a habit.|`|bQTWX32taa	well when u stop eating completely your body compensates for that by conserving energy and slowing your metabolism so that's not really a good idea..  although if you have some water weight you may lose some maybe 2 or 3 lbs.  I recommend to eat small meals during the day like small salads  and drink water to keep you feeling full and the weight will come off faster than not eating at all.|`|Q4NFFBizaa	you will not lose any weight by not eating. This is not the answer to your problems. Just go run like 2 miles every day, eat less then a 1000 calories a day and you should be good to go!|`|ksItnuQ8aa	Idk, but that's definitely not healthy. You at least need to eat a little.|`|olopisx7aa	No eating=your metabolism shuts down. You'll hardly lose anything. You might lose a pound or 2,  but your body would go into "starvation mode" and your metabolism will shut down. So when you start eating again you will gain a lot of weight. Bad idea, unless you are trying to gain weight. Best idea is just eat foods low in calories and you'll lose weight and your metabolism won't shut down. By the end of the week-the most you'll lose is probably 2 pounds. You could lose a little more in water weight. Just exercise and eat lots of vegetables and something like baked fish which is good for health and weight loss.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	LOL Blink you make me laugh. 10 pounds just from not eating? yeah right. <br>  <br>  Anyways, you will lose 3  pounds of water weight at the most.

We need to learn three things: the volume of calories in our food, the volume of calories a specific activity uses up hourly, and finally our own personal daily limit of calories.

4BX3w4Wqaa	Listen up kid, not telling your parents/gardians and a doctor about this was your biggest mistake. You should get your ankle X-rayed immediately ! before its too late. If a broken bone is left un-treated, theres a good chance of arthritis to appear in your later years. Why take the chance of not not seeing a professional about this ? Trust me, you'll still want to run and skateboard in the future and this unfortunately may get in the way SEVERELY. Broken bones are serious problems that are never to be ignored. For the time being ... comsume as much calcium as possible, milk, cheeses, cottage cheese, fish and especially cooked pigs feet are almost the BEST food source that helps heal broken bones and the injured joints, fractures etc.. Cooked pigs sound as if they would taste bad but personally i think they are pretty damn good so maybe you'll like it and have it as a healing source. But most importantly, don't be afraid of anything, go and get your ankle checked as soon as possible ! Take no chances. Best of luck, be well.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	You have a chance of the bones dying (necrosis) and having pain forever and you CAN develop arthritis.

Before it's too late!|`|tPrKN6f5aa	Hi.<br>  I twisted my ankle about a year ago while I was playing soccer, and  I went online and did some research about what to do.. <br>  I found a great article that help me. I read it all and and that is how I discover I just had a sprain.<br>  In other to know how to heal your ankle you first must know how to cure it because it could be serious so instead of making you look for the article I posted here its a little bit long but read it and hope it helps!<br>  <br>   What is an Ankle Fracture?<br>  A fracture is a partial or complete break in a bone. In the ankle, fractures can range from the less serious avulsion injuries (small pieces of bone that have been pulled off) to severe shattering-type breaks of the tibia, fibula or both.<br>  <br>  Ankle fractures are common injuries that are most often caused by the ankle rolling inward or outward. Many people mistake an ankle fracture for an ankle sprain, but they are quite different and therefore require an accurate and early diagnosis. Both can occur simultaneously.<br>  <br>  Signs and Symptoms<br>  An ankle fracture is accompanied by one or all of these signs and symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Pain at the site of the fracture, which in some cases can extend from the foot to the knee. <br>      * Significant swelling, which may occur along the length of the leg or may be more localized.<br>      * Blisters may occur over the fracture site. These should be promptly treated by your surgeon.<br>      * Bruising, which develops soon after the injury.<br>      * Inability to walk—however, it is possible to walk with less severe breaks, so never rely on walking as a test of whether a bone has been fractured.<br>      * Change in the appearance of the ankle so that it differs from the other ankle.  <br>      * Bone protruding through the skin—a sign that immediate care is needed! Fractures that pierce the skin require urgent attention because they can lead to severe infection and prolonged recovery. <br>  <br>  What to Do<br>  Following an ankle injury it is important to have the ankle evaluated by a foot and ankle surgeon for proper diagnosis and treatment. If you are unable to do so right away, go to the emergency room and then follow up with a foot and ankle surgeon as soon as possible for a more thorough assessment.<br>  <br>  Until you are able to be examined by a doctor, the “R.I.C.E.” method should be followed. This involves: <br>  <br>      * Rest. It is crucial to stay off the injured foot, since walking can cause further damage.<br>      * Ice. To reduce swelling and pain, apply a bag of ice over a thin towel to the affected area for 20 minutes of each waking hour. Do not put ice directly against the skin.<br>      * Compression. Wrap the ankle in an elastic bandage or wear a compression stocking to prevent further swelling.<br>      * Elevation. Keep the foot elevated to reduce the swelling. It should be even with or slightly above the hip level.  <br>  <br>  Diagnosis<br>  The foot and ankle surgeon will examine the affected limb, touching specific areas to evaluate the injury. In addition, the surgeon may order x-rays and other imaging studies, as necessary.<br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment<br>  Treatment of ankle fractures depends upon the type and severity of the injury. Options include:<br>  <br>      * Immobilization. Certain fractures are treated by protecting and restricting the ankle and foot in a cast or splint. This allows the bone to heal.<br>      * Prescription medications. To help relieve the pain, the foot and ankle surgeon may prescribe pain medications or anti-inflammatory drugs.<br>      * Surgery. For some injuries, surgery is needed to repair the fracture and other related injuries, if present. The foot and ankle surgeon will select the procedure that is appropriate for your injury. <br>  <br>  Follow-Up Care<br>  It is important to follow your foot and ankle surgeon’s instructions after treatment. Failure to do so can lead to infection, deformity, arthritis and chronic pain.

bvt9kvS8aa	I would highly recommend Yoga as those are isometric exercises and so you will be using your own body weight as resistance and won't hurt yourself. It also stretches and flexes the spaces between your bones and makes them very flexible and in the process reduces pain and strengthens it too. In yoga, you do not push yourself too much. It is a gradual process which takes some time but is absolutely effective. Believe me, patience pays.<br>  I seriously suggest not to go with weight training and such things as you have pain. It may lead to a permanent injury or you may even end up having surgery.<br>  I also agree with the previous answerer, that body weight management also plays a very important role.

Also lemon is a metabolism booster, so the lemon flavor of crystal light is the best (also the taste!), also if it's cold it helps too because when drinking cold beverages you burn more calories than you drink because your body is burning calories trying to keeps itself warm.

dpgXzMenaa	Having vaginal sex alone isn't a very effective way to have orgasms for most women, because the vagina isn't the place where women's most direct sexual pleasure comes from.   The clitoris is.<br>  <br>  It might interest you to know that by the age of 12, 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that by age 15, it's 2/3 of them doing it *regularly* (many of them more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse.<br>  <br>  ... or that the very first thing sex therapists teach women who've never had an orgasm is how to masturbate - because that's the *only* sure fire way for a woman to learn how her body responds sexually and what will bring her to orgasm.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. <br>  <br>  Once you can have orgasms dependably when you masturbate, you can have them dependably whenever you have sex with a partner... either by giving them to yourself during sex or by teaching your partner what works for you so *he* can give them to you.<br>  <br>  Seriously. If you don't have orgasms alone... it's time you learned: how's your man gonna know how to get the work together with you if *you* don't even know what the job is?<br>  <br>  One thing you can do to find out is check out <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  and<br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>   to read up on lots of ways you can improve things.  (Actually, the entire section is incredibly valuable reading, but there's an awful lot of it to digest in one gulp.)<br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm in one or more of these ways, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  You will *definitely* know when you have an orgasm. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm... both of these are unusual but normal, and anything in between is just fine.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it might happen that there'll be no interruption at all between orgasms, and it can feel like one single orgasm that lasts anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|vVHYO9rzaa	you've been having sex for over a YEAR! WOW!|`|7WbehQZjaa	Try playing with your clitoris while having sex. Do you know where your G-spot is? If you don't, then he won't either. Try putting a finger or two into your vagina and feel around. Most women's G-spot is only 2 inches inside and is usually on the top inside. When you feel the difference between the smooth skin and then a part that's bumpy, kind of like the roof of your mouth, that's your G-spot. Try touching it to see if you become aroused. Try going slow first and figure out what you like. Maybe you enjoy your G-spot and clitoris being touched at the same time. The more you know about yourself, the easier getting off is during sex because you can tell your partner what you like. Women take A LOT longer than men to become sexually aroused.|`|joGBEnjRaa	only 4% out of 100 women can orgasm while having sex without playing with there clit?most women fake it make there body shake etc,and for any men reading this im sorry but its true!women never tell there men they cant come with them.i told mine i cant! ive NEVER come with a guy?but i can make myself come playing with my clit?why dont you secretly get yourself a vibrator and play with your clit on your own and experience that first.what turns you on? try and relax,dont start thinking its rubbish etc as that can almost put you off?|`|4d452fd4e90487fa14f08b3966abca8eaa	maybe u could try some lubricant 4 a start, this should make it less painful. <br>  there could also be psychological issues arond this, maybe u dont feel comfortable enough to let yourself go around him. u could try really making it special, candle lit meal, rose petals around the bed etc n see if that relaxes u. and remember the more u want it the less likely u r to come, try pushing it to the back of your mind & enjoy the closeness.|`|w29tsXLUaa	You could be tense.

X9QOHRLFaa	hello roja, well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in

1oBilGHuaa	It is hard because these professional relationships we have sooner or later do end.  I am sure you will miss Anette because you have seen her every week since June.  This is why it is so important to have friends and other people in our lives besides therapists, caseworkers, and CRS workers.  The good news is that you were able to feel comfortable with Anette so this means you will be able to feel comfortable again.  I hope you will be able to work well with your new caseworker and that you will have more people who love and support you in your life.  Best Wishes.|`|AA11788494	Well I didn't like starting over with a new one either.  However, it worked out well.  If you can't see your regular counselor at her new place then the new one may be just a good.  She will have your chart and get to know you.  It may be a blessing.  If you don't like her though, then you can see someone else.

6YzqVkr6aa	They're the same thing. Look up Gastroesophogeal Reflux Disease, or GERD. That's what it's called when you get it daily. Heartburn or acid indigestion is known as acid reflux.<br>  Many people who have GERD take a daily pill for it, called a proton-pump inhibiter, that helps decrease the amount of acid the stomach produces.<br>  Other preventions include not eating anything spicy or too acidic, like tomatoes. You can also sleep with the head of your bed elevated.<br>  Some people think that GERD is actually caused by an allergy to a certain food. They say if you eliminate the allergen, i.e. stop eating what you're allergic to, the GERD will go away.<br>  Sometimes GERD is caused by a hiatal hernia. This means part of the stomach squishes out where it's not supposed to, so the acids don't stay put like they're supposed to. This is sometimes corrected with surgery.<br>  To treat occasional acid reflux, some Tums or other antacid work fine. If you haven't got any of these, and you've got bad heartburn, take a Tb of baking soda and mix it into a small cup of water. Then drink this. It's revolting, but it really works. You'll have a bunch of burps because the baking soda neutralizes the acid and releases gas.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|W380tuKiaa	You might try looking under "REFLUX DISEASE"

BPvtbMGPaa	Hi Mike, <br>  <br>  There are several variables that will determine the results you achieve.  In general, a healthy diet and a consistent exercise program which includes cardiovascular and strength training will yield positive results.  <br>  <br>  The first thing you must do is decide what type of change you are make (ie - set goals).  After you have set your goals, you need to do an assessment of where you currently are and what you need to do to meet your target.  For example, if you want to maintain your current weight but reduce fat and gain muscle, you will need to orient your exercise routine and diet towards those objectives.  Alternatively, if you want to reduce fat and gain 10 additional pounds of muscle, your workout and diet will need to be structured to meet those goals.<br>  <br>  In both cases, the fundamentals of your workout regimen will be the same but your caloric intake will need to be adjusted as well as the composition of your workout (ie - if you want to gain muscle mass, your routine will include more heavy weights and compound movements than if you were trying to lose weight).<br>  <br>  Setting your goals and assessing where you currently are will be significant inputs into the program you implement.  The extent that you implement your program and adhere to your diet...will directly drive the results you see.|`|fwWO14fIaa	it will take around 2 - 4 before you start noticing change of look of your body, but it will take a couple of months of strict eating and good weight training till your body looks like a beach body lol.
Dghr9r3vaa	You do not sound bad at all considering your weight and height. You are right where you should be. But maybe you need to work a little harder, maybe your body is used to your workout. Switch it up, try a different machine or workout. Don't deprive yourself either though because your body can go into starvation mode even if you are getting the right amount of calories, it may not be enough fat. Try lean meats like chicken and stuff and get plenty of calcium and fiber.|`|jAL8GTDaaa	Cardio works wonders, but if you do cardio workout then individual spot exercises that should do wonders. You don't seem like you need to lost weight, just tone up. Dieting and exercise is better to do with a friend. Moral support and such. Good luck.|`|mlaLgoaSaa	Sounds like you hit a "plateau". Its common that the first half comes off easily and the last half is a lot tougher. To beat this plateau, you need to change your work out routine drastically. Shock your body back onto track. Change intensity and/or frequency of work outs, join an aerobics class, if you usually jog, try out an elliptical instead. Here are some other pointers:<br>  <br>  1. Change your diet. Try and obtain most of your calories from complex carbohydrates (this will give you energy and keep you feeling full). Remember, you lose fat by burning more calories each day than you consume. Example: If you burn 2000 calories each day just by existing, and burn 300 more through exercise, eat less that 2300 calories. Never skip breakfast. Snacks are fine as long as they are healthy. Examples: fresh fruit and veggies, rice crisps, peanuts, yogurt, etc...) Also, little things will help tons! Like, switch to skim milk, eat low fat yogurt, use cooking spray instead of oils, opt for the low fat foods, eat whole grain bread... All these things will help a lot. <br>  <br>  2. Drink AT LEAST 8 (8oz) glasses of water each day. The more water you drink the better. Especially if you are working out.<br>  <br>  3. Try and do 20-40 minutes of continuous cardio exercise (jogging, speed walking, elliptical, biking) every day, at least 3 times per week (the more days you can do this, the better).<br>  <br>  4. Create a weight training schedule. Try to do some general strength training exercises at least 3 times per week. Remember, muscle burns fat. So, the more lean muscle tissue that is on your body, the faster you will burn fat.<br>  <br>  5. Stretch! This will help to lengthen and tone your muscles. Some studies even show that it can help to prevent injury. It also feels awesome!<br>  <br>  It sometimes takes about 8-12 weeks after starting a weight loss regime to see results (depending on the intensity of your fitness plan). So be patient, and keep with it! It will pay off.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, best of luck.
9pLdhuBnaa	I would recommend getting another opinion from a different Podiatrist compared to the ones that you already saw (the reason is because sometimes it takes going to yet another one to try and find an answer) as well as consulting with an orthopedic surgeon that specializes in treating foot and ankle problems.<br>  <br>  Going to the Orthopedic surgeon does not necessarily mean that surgery will be necessary but they may have additional recommendations for non-surgical options to help your foot including something like physical therapy.

5d0506fe6f86fded69f53c9e28c5f779aa	In the blogs, forums and website I've seen Invisalign seems to work very well and are really invisible!

I suggest you talk to your orthodontist immediately. <br>  I 100% support Invisalign, make sure you put them back on after eating though :) <br>  <br>  They are amazing, not noticeable (good for pictures) and you can simply pop them out whenever you feel like it. They are much better and relaxing then braces and a lot less painful! Not only does Invisalign work as well as braces, it gives you a lot more freedom and the cost is basically the same for both anyway.<br>  <br>  Goodluck

WPzaF2osaa	Cleansing products are  nothing but laxatives. Nothing will clean your system except for a healthy diet. It implies to decrease animal protein and fat, eat more organics, more fruit, vegetables, nuts, decrease sugar intake, sodas, quit cigarette smoking, exercise at least 2-3 times per week. Also to have fiber supplementation every day. You can be regular just by adding 1 scoop of soluble fiber to water or orange juice, 1 glass every morning. If you eat 3 portions of vegetables and fruit per day you will not need any cleansing teas.

8uCjC3GYaa	What these other answerers have said is wrong. Let me explain some science here:<br>  <br>  When you work out, your muscles need oxygen. Blood is the main transporter of oxygen to your muscles. So you definitely need as much blood as you can for your muscles when you work out. Ie: The more blood, the better quality the work out.<br>  <br>  When you eat food, blood goes to your stomach because your stomach is the muscle that needs oxygen to get its work done at that time. <br>  <br>  SO if you eat right before working out, all the blood will be more concentrated around your stomach area, which means a lower quality work our for you. If you eat right after working out, all your blood will be rushing away from your muscles that need oxygen, which isn't the healthiest thing in the world.<br>  <br>  So the conclusion is that you can eat before or after, but make sure it's at least an hour away from your work out time. Good Luck|`|ns1F0p8Laa	before b/c if you eat after you work out you're only going to add the fat you lost back on depending on how much you eat and what you eat.|`|nC92yqx7aa	You should always eat after you are done working out. Its better for the body and it helps build muscle.|`|nvhCAIKgaa	I think it would be better after. Because if you eat, you have the energy to work out and the calories to burn. If you do it before, you might not have the energy and you'll get tierd faster because...all your losing is water...and you'll just be hungry and yay...back to square one, gaining calories without exercise.

This is why it is normally best to work out in the mornings before you have eaten because it has 3 times the effect in losing weight and building up muscle.<br>  <br>  However, if you want to work out it is important that you eat plenty so that you have enough energy and protein for that muscle build up.|`|8c0a18d5b570f3538bca5640bec4656daa	depend what you eat and what kind of working out you're doing.  Carbs give you energy to burn so if you're gonna do something like cardio, you should eat before; something like pasta at least one hour just so you can digest the food and not throw up on the tredmill.  If you're gonna do some muscle work than I would hold off and have lots of protein, after your workout.  Maybe a protein shake or lots of chicken and tuna.|`|mlaLgoaSaa	working out ANYTIME is beneficial to overall fitness and weight loss. no matter when you work out, you will be burning calories. the only thing is, wait at least 2 hours after you eat to work out. if you work out too soon after eating, you can get "food cramps" causing you to have to cut your work out short due to the discomfort. <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|rN3gJwg1aa	before.<br>  working out increases the rate of your metabolism so that when you do eat afterwards your body will burn it off faster<br>  <br>  also, if you eat before you probably wont excersize to your full capacity, or throw up..|`|v7eQjSAkaa	Having some protein, in the form of a bar, or shake are the best for after and before workouts.|`|5BDGLCAuaa	after<br>  koz if you eat before you get stitches and cramps n stuff<br>  maybe before a yogurt or protein drink.
Ok55QNSiaa	Yes water does help when you want to lose weight and what you want to do is drink at least 6-8 bottles a day because since most of our bodies are made of water the water helps cleanse the body by taking toxins that sit there as fat and gets rid of alot of waste.

YjxZYbL5aa	Low BP is different from high BP.<br>  The "average" good BP is 120/80, so if you're higher than that, bad things can happen. But lower... lower is fine, unless it is too low for your body.<br>  What I mean by that is that if you start to have problems such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting, ESPECIALLY when going from a sitting/lying position to standing, then it is too low for you. Otherwise, you're probably fine. If you are bothered by it, it could never hurt to ask your doctor. But I'd say that if it isn't causing you problems, then you are fine.|`|HbQmDGb6aa	nah dude you're fine. that's still within average range (120/80), bit lower because you're an athelete. lower is better than too high for sure. though not too low...my bp is 80/40! thats pushing it|`|NXBmcEz7aa	It is always a lot better to be a little lower than the average 120/80 than to be higher.

No.<br>  <br>  However, a person that is 5' 10 and weighs 220 pounds (assuming they are not muscular) is overweight enough to request a Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD) from a dietitian or nutritionist.

The question you should be asking yourself is if the weight is muscle mass or fat.  It is also natural to be more hungry, especially during growth "spurts", your body requires a lot of energy to grow!  You should be looking at the types of food you at, and also your level of activity.  If you are not active and are eating junk food all the time, yes this will equal obesity.  But if you eat a lot of vegetables, essential carbs and nutrient dense foods but are very active, then you will gain more weight in muscle and wont have to worry as much about fat.  My advice:  if you are not active, get active in some way (sports or recreational activities) and eat healthy if you are not already doing so.  Most of all, enjoy growing up!  It is an exciting time of your life where everyday you are different from the last.|`|huVZPnyvaa	Your body is growing and therefore needs more fuel (food). <br>  <br>  Teenage years should be active part of your life<br>  <br>  Unless you become active all the food that you eat will become fat<br>  <br>  My advice would be the more you eat the more you need to exercise.

But i'm not really sure on the pelvic exam. <br>  During the pelvic part of the exam, the doctor will ask you to move down so your behind is at the end of the table. You'll bend your knees and rest your feet in two stirrups, which are metal triangular loops that stick out from the end of the table. These might look a little scary, but they're just there to rest your feet in and keep you more comfortable. The doctor will ask you to relax your knees out to the sides as far as they will go. It might feel a little funny to be lying with your legs opened like this, but everyone feels that way at first.<br>  <br>  The doctor will put on gloves and examine the outside of your vagina to make sure that there are no sores or swelling and that everything looks OK on the outside.<br>  <br>  Next, the doctor will want to look at the inside of your vagina and will do so with the help of a speculum|`|osbS3KsNaa	You will only need a pelvic exam if you are "sexually active" and i hate that term because i'm not sure whether it means if you have sex or includes the other things besides sex... but when i was 17 i got on the pill and told her i wasn't having sex so i didn't need the pelvic exam. <br>  <br>  I just recently got it and it was very awkward. they make you strip down and put on a paper gown and then make conversation with you while they check your breasts and then do the pap smear test.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you are not sexually active i'm sure you won't need the pelvic exam! good luck and birth control is a life savor. My cramps were so horrible that i would be stuck in bed for days. hope all is well!
AA11065140	By "eating like that", you're likely to lose weight.<br>  <br>  2,000 calories is a "normal" diet (on the low end for Americans, but that's because we're special that way).  Your body needs more than 1,000 calories a day just to keep your heart and lungs pumping.  I'm honestly surprised that you have the energy to type this post, with so little for your body to run on.  <br>  <br>  What's been happening is that because you're getting so few nutrients, your body is holding on to every ounce of food that it can store.  The problem is that our bodies really haven't advanced along with our brains.  You know, logically, that you're dieting.  Unfortunately, your body can't apply that logic, and it believes that you're on the verge of starving to death.  In an attempt to get you through to more abundant times, it's storing up...Just like we do with wheat to get us through the winter!<br>  <br>  There's no reason to increase slowly...one day won't make much difference.  Because of the learning curve that your body is going to have to go through, there is a chance that you'll temporarily gain some weight.  But your body will naturally drop it off, once it figures out the new input routine.  Additionally, if you're working out an hour a day, anything that might stick, won't stick for long.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you'd go to the trouble of seeing a Nutritionist, and then just discard the helpful, professional recommendations they've given you.  When she said it, she meant it, for your health and well being.  Did you mention that you're also exercising?  It might be important for her to know that, in case you haven't.|`|WqkOI7RDaa	You will probably gain.<br>  You will probably gain 30 lbs over the next three years. <br>  If you don't there is something WRONG. <br>  <br>  Put it this way: If you hold your weight, you will never get taller, or have hips, or boobs. If you hold your weight by starving yourself (and that's what 1000 calories a day is) you will either continue to look the way you are now until you're 50, or (more likely) you will turn into a slightly taller, completely emaciated teenager. Not skinny. Emaciated. There's a difference. <br>  Listen to your nutritionist. She has a degree. You're in middle school.

I got worked up before the procedure because of her comments.  After the surgery was over, as it turned out all that worrying was for nothing and I didn't experience any problems at all.  It all worked out very well.  I learned from that - - never listen to anyone's scare stories - - everyone is different.  You'll do fine.

If you are that scared then the doc will put you to sleep and you won't feel a thing.  They tell you to count backward from 99 and then you are out.  The next thing you wake up and you are fine.  They will give you good pain meds to ease the pain.  You will be fine.|`|PztDZBW1aa	i had to have 7 teeth out because of the same reason. it doesn't really hurt. just feels a bit uncomfortable. just make sure that when you get the injection, the dentist leaves it long enough before taking the teeth out, so that you are sure that you can't feel anything at all. don't worry it'll be fine. i am the biggest wimp ever, so if i can manage 7 then you will be fine with 3. good luck. :)|`|UM9LlPWDaa	I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed before they broke through my gums.

They might just put you to rest while they take your teeth out.  It's nothing REALLY REALLY bad.  Just close your eyes and think about something really happy.  something similar to your situation is that I had to get a mole removed from my leg or else I would get an even worse case of skin cancer, they put a numbing shot in, I couldn't do gym for about 3 weeks, and I was left with a big ugly scar.  So if I did something like that, you can do it :) <br>  <br>  (maybe the friend that said it hurt was exaggerating it just a little.)<br>  <br>  just be brave.|`|OxYKmYIRaa	lol, dont sweat it, ive been there, had to get my canines taken out since my adult teeth were comin and the first ones just didnt wanna go, lol. ya, the though of gettin your teeth yanked out will make most if not all people anxious, but trust me, its not that bad, what i had happen was they rubbed the gums around the area of the tooth with a numbing gel to, ofcourse, numb it, before getting a needle and injecting the gums with some numbing fluid, the only time during the whole ordeal that i felt any kinda pain was with a lil pressure from the fluid they put in the gums, other than that, it just feels weird, lol, dont sweat, you'll be fine, hell, if you dont, you could always take a tray, beat them upside their head, put them in the chair and tie em down and take some plyers and start yanking their teeth out while yellin "DONT FEEL SO GOOD NOW DOES IT!", lol. if it helps, during the whole thing just think of somethin you look forward to doin afterwards and think of the whole trip to the dentist office as a hinder to those plans and dont think to yourself "is it gonna hurt? am i gonna feel it?", just think to yourself "oh my god! can you guys hurry up, i got better things to do then wait here for you to do somethin that should only take 2 seconds". and if that dont work, daydream, lol, trust me, gets your mind off of everything botherin you and it passes the time quickly. seriously hoped that theres somethin in all this you can use, i would tell you good luck, but you dont need it, you gonna be fine, but if it helps any, then good luck!

01Mu3wUeaa	If you had food poisoning, you would still be sick and would stay sick for a few more days - a week.<br>  <br>  You had a stomach bug (more than likely Norwalk virus)<br>  <br>  <br>  Prevention:<br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|qmWmGOLzaa	possible. food poisoning can take anywhere from an hour to a few days to set in. depends on symptoms and what you ate as to type of food posioning and incubation period and symptoms.

You'll need to record what you eat and the calories you take in, and then use a treadmill or other device with a calorie burn counter to help determine your daily burn.<br>  <br>  Generally, people burn 1.3 calories per minute at rest, so you can get an estimate of your burn during sleep or watching TV, etc.  Google other activities to get estimates of per hour or minute burns for the other types of activity you engage in.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	there are many factors that go into how many calories to eat in a day.  to be simple in your case, take what you are eating and reduce your intake by 10% every couple of days untill you see a decrease in weight|`|y4eTE1Ihaa	Calories is a big topic when it comes to weight loss. We need to understand three things: the number of calories in our food, the number of calories a specific physical action burns every 60 minutes, and last but not least our own personal daily allowance of calories.

I melted away thrity pounds, it clearly does work!|`|mlaLgoaSaa	there is no way for any stranger to determine this precisely. if you need an accurate answer, you need to see a nutritionist. Caloric intake for weight loss depends on many factors, such as: activity level, diet, BMR (basal metabolic rate), and many other things... In order to determine how many calories you should eat to lose weight, we must first know how many calories your body uses just existing (sedentary). every answer you get is going to be a very rough estimate. sorry we cant help you more.

Then he sticks a long qtip in there and swabs the cervix so he can collect some cells to send to the lab to be analyzed for a possible problem.<br>  It is not exactly a "painful" procedure, but can be very uncomfortable. <br>  If the doc sees something abnormal to the naked eye however, then he might do a biopsy which is when he inserts a little curved needle like an ice cream scoop, to take out a chunk of flesh from the cervix... this is again sent to a lab for analysis.<br>  Tell your friend she can take a couple of Tylenol or Ibuprofen beforehand if she is afraid of pain.|`|9HAuyoSYaa	A Pap smear does not hurt, but at the same time it is not painless. <br>  I think the whole ordeal is more an awkward situation than anything else.

I don't know anyting about clipping or 3 tests. Basically the take this little plastic thing to scrap some tissue off of your cervix and that's it.

af2b8cb22a1ed77dda9500aaea60bf51aa	So, you are trying to "oil" your joints. Likely will not work and tastes terrible. A guess is that you are in a growth spurt -are you? The long bones of the body growing fast put pressure on the tendons and ligaments and muscles of the body.  These are called "growing pains." While the actual cause is up for debate -- some folks do not believe in the pressure-on-the-tendons theory -- it still hurts. Warm baths, stretching exercises, and Tylenol help.  Some people think that 16 is old for growing pains, but not if you are getting a growth spurt at that age.<br>  <br>  If these things do not work in time, ask a doctor about it as it may be arthritus or fibromyalgia -- both treatable.
Fg5tymz1aa	I had it in my late 20's.  I believe the doctor said to apply calamine lotion.  It eventually cleared in a month or so.  Do not engage in any activity that will.  Tense feelings are not helpful.  I would ask your doctor about tanning.  It should eventually clear.

But, Anal fissures and hemorrhoids cause pain, have you had any? Especially when you wipe? <br>  <br>  Otherwise, you may be starting your period. Have you had any dull pains in your stomach or been feeling moody? When you wiped if the blood was a darkish colour it's most likely the beginning of your period.
tMGdsPCQaa	Sweetie I have big hips. I am not fat in any way and I know that. Some people are just born with big hip bones. Im not kidding.

mlaLgoaSaa	do not run with shin splints! you can cause serious damage to your bones and ligaments. give yourself 2-3 weeks to heal (depending on severity). here are some other things you can do in the future:<br>  <br>  -get Icy Hot for before and after you run.<br>  -ice your shins after running and keep them elevated for at least 10 minutes.<br>  -never take ibuprofen before exercising, but it helps a lot to take it after running. only ibuprofen though (because its an anti-inflammatory)<br>  -look up some exercises you can do to stretch your calves.<br>  -determine if the splints are caused by your running technique or plan over usage.<br>  -always stop running if you feel abnormal pain. dont try to run through the pain.<br>  <br>  hope this helps. feel better soon.|`|b2b6690ceff0950e402d8cb1842e3afdaa	Maybe get new shoes|`|hp35U4xiaa	if you run it will hurt and most likely make them worse.

M3b25kRYaa	To ease your mind, no, just sitting on someones lap, or hugging will not get you pregnant. Sperm actually have a difficult time making it to where they need to be even when the man ejaculates straight into a woman's vagina. The environment is acidic, they have a long way to travel, and many of the little guys just don't have enough energy to make it... So, even if you hugged a man with an erect penis, it is doubtful that he was ejaculating while you were hugging him, even if he were, the ejaculatory fluid containing the sperm would have been stopped by his underwear, pants, your pants, and your underwear long before they could reach the internal vagina. And as for sitting on his lap, same goes, unless he was erect and you were both naked and he was ejaculating. There is a slight chance of impregnation if the ejaculate happens to get on the outside of your vagina (i.e. naked, but not penetrated) but if your question is true, then I think you're safe. Here's some links with some helpful advice on some of the myths about how a woman can get pregnant <a href="http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/sex-intimacy/sex-tips-advice/sex-myths-girlfriend-get-pregnant-from-taking-a-bath-together-video/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/sex-int...</a> and <a href="http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/sex-intimacy/sex-tips-advice/girlfriend-get-pregnant-sex-myths-from-taking-a-steamy-bath-together/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/sex-int...</a> I think you'll find them entertaining and educational.|`|VDg4R7SIaa	No you cannot get pregnant from sitting on someone's lap.

But not impossible. I mean you won't get pregnant from hugging or sitting on someones lab. But there is a small chance if semen gets on or in your vagina...let's just say your friend's boyfriend somehow got semen on his hand from receiving a handjob or oral and he fingers her or something...then it is somewhat possible, very unlikely though.|`|Sq6HpgSVaa	No, it's not possible.

XTqpWDXPaa	Reagent strips are not drug tests, they are used to screen for potential health problems.

After you dip the strip in urine a line will usually appear if it detects drugs.|`|mhvb9eFkaa	Doubt you are going to be able to buy the right test from a drug store.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - <a href="http://www.straightabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightabs.com</a>

A5mdpGiUaa	There are a few easy ones that I did when I was young. The first is a forearm curl where you sit down and hold a weight in your hand (palm up) and flex your hand up and down (you should be able to do at least 20-30 reps), do this for 3 or four sets. Another option is a "farmer's walk", carry heavy objects (dumbells, cinder blocks, weight plates etc..) for a set period of time (1-2 minutes at a time), do 4-5 sets of this. A very easy but very effective forearm exercise is to sit at a table and lay down a page of newspaper, place your hand flat in the center of the paper and without lifting either your palm or fingers, slowly work the newspaper until the whole page is a ball in your hand (do this with 10-15 pages, sounds easy but your forearms will be sore after). A good rule of thumb is anything that works your grip will work your forearms. Good luck.|`|297lqUUjaa	lol are you trying to impress? <br>  well the best thing for you would probably be<br>  1.)push ups.<br>  2.)pull ups.<br>  3.)planks-where you go into sit up position, only you rest on your elbows, and hold that position(quite hard, actually...)<br>  i don't really know what else to help you with but...<br>  good luck!<br>  :)|`|GtRtHWeXaa	how about to do jumping exercises or running exercises .Like jogging running or maybe riding a bike or a scooter.Or you could jump on a trampoline or you could do push ups or jumping jacks.|`|gucSKASmaa	push ups|`|7pkxOc6Raa	Deadlifts.|`|jWFFKCcKaa	forearm curls:) they work tremendously!<br>  their like bicep curls only with your forearms.<br>  maybe put something under your elbow to achieve 100% affect.<br>  hope i helped!<br>  could you answer mine please? its about muscles:)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApEzcc5ebw1NviL1Y2oB6ibsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223140418AAbnwPq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
zWo03iLNaa	Cheerleading requires lots of jumps and kicks and you need to have a lot of endurance. Do A LOT of ab workouts because you need good abs to be able to jump high . You are going to have to be pretty flexible to do any stunting or kicking so make sure you stretch a lot. <br>  When I cheered and we had conditioning days we would do...<br>  wall sits<br>  sit ups<br>  practice jumps ( look up how to do them online if you dont know how )<br>  Jump up and try to hit a high spot on the wall<br>  Run up and down bleachers<br>  Just run run run<br>  Find a sturdy chair and jump off and onto it <br>  Good luck at your try outs! Remember to keep a natural smile, have lots of confidence, and work on memorization for the dance/cheer whatever they teach you. Good luck! Cheer is a lot of fun, but lots of work and trust me you WILL probably get a 6 pack if you work hard enough. At least I sure did. :)|`|7pkxOc6Raa	How cute, you want a defined six pack in a couple of weeks. It's not like it requires hard work and dedication, the second you do a couple of crunches you will have a perfectly "toned" body. That's why everyone walks around with six-packs, right?|`|9085d5e62eea0b47f788548bcb282266aa	The secret is, you cannot tone abs by doing spot reduction workouts, like crunches alone. You tone your abs by first of all having a great nutrition plan, doing lots of cardio, and getting your body fat percentage to 10% or less. Then you will tone your abs.
ZMdrNzYcaa	This sounds just like my best friend. She experiences these pains a lot but she had PID. I would rather go into the doctors and get a test there. I know everyone always says well got to the doctors but what I think is it could be your having ains from not stretching and usually  a lot of girls get those. But if you really do think you could be pregnant either take your at home test or get a free one at a pregnancy resource center. Also maybe wait until your period. You should know about a week afeter when it's suppsoed to come if you don;t get it.

UAF8Zxzaaa	According to multiple sites, you should be at least 106 pounds, at the very minimum. So it probably not a good idea to lose any weight, because you don't need to. I think it also depends on your age. Some answers vary but you definitely should never weight under 100 pounds, according to all sites I've found. You can weigh up to 120 or 130 and still be perfectly healthy. <br>  <br>  If you want to lose a little weight or be healthier, cut out soda/pop entirely, stop eating white bread (replace with whole-wheat), eat lots of fruits and veggies. Drink water more than other things. When you eat things like chips (if you can't remove them completely), pour them into a small bowl so you do not eat more than you should. Also, exercise!  Take a 20 minute or 30 minute walk every day. That helps.|`|AA12325261	3 Pounds will hardly make a difference, you can easily lose it by drinking a lot of water can cutting out soda and sweets.<br>  <br>  And some light exercise like taking walks can help.|`|hpadhXUiaa	Blood is magical.

uVMlNvLoaa	Yeah, you probably haven't started it because of that. Low body fat means not enough fat to trigger the production of estrogen, and the high stress of dancing definitely makes an inhospitable place for a normal menstrual cycle.

You have apparently realized that approval from others is (and should be) of secondary or tertiary value.  Don't smile until you feel like smiling.  <br>  <br>  There is a value to human interaction.  However, in this fast paced society, most have forgotten the value of solitude.  Most of us are not left alone long enough to figure out what we really want and how to obtain it.  <br>  <br>  Take your time and consider the possibilities.|`|v852MqtIaa	your depressed|`|OXqLsFYxaa	MMMMM you could have depression, i sometimes feel the same, but as long as you can get out of bed everyday and function, then i dont think that it is in anyway abnormal, everyone feels like being alone sometimes, me-time. <br>  I did go through a week of staying in bed, not going to work etc, i went to my doctor, and whilst he did take me seriously, he told me to keep a diary when i feel down and see if i have triggers that cause these depressions, i have since found that the diary has been a great source of info for me, i have identified my triggers, now i avoid certain things that may make me feel down. So if you are worried, start a diary, see if you have triggers, go from there GOOD LUCK X
DSMaUGQYaa	I flush mine. I do not use ones with applicators, but if I did I would throw those in the trash.<br>  They are cotton and biodegradable... it says right on the package that you can do that. <br>  You cannot flush pads, however. That is why you see signs saying "do not flush sanitary napkins" in public restrooms, but you don't see the same sign for tampons. <br>  When I use pads, which is rare, I also wrap them in toilet paper and put them in the garbage.<br>  If you are concerned about leaving your tampon in throughout the night because of TSS, then just wear a pad at night!|`|IN1X1CVGaa	i flush them!<br>  THEY DO NOT CLOG! THEY DISSOLVE! :D|`|6qsocyK3aa	I do the same as you.<br>  <br>  Well, you either get up in the night and change it or, more sensibly, use pads. I don't think it's a good idea to use tampons 24 hours a day anyway so night time should be a good time for pads.<br>  <br>  DO NOT LEAVE ONE IN FOR MORE THAN 6-8 HOURS UNLESS YOU WISH TO BE 6FT UNDER (OR VERY VERY ILL)!|`|S1jddreQaa	I just flush them.<br>  <br>  I put in a tampon RIGHT before I go to sleep and then take it out RIGHT when I wake up.

And idk because I just got my period yesterday and I havent used tampons!!

AA10332420	ok, how did your hymen break? if it's with a vibrator or a tampon, etc. then it technically didn't break. the human body will only really let a penis break the hymen. so, unless you've had sex before, then it's not broken, and will hurt, but only for a few seconds at first.<br>  <br>  now, if you HAVE had sex before, then, depending on how large the opening to your vagina is, and how large his penis is, then it can hurt, but sadly, this does not go away in a few seconds, it will take SEVERAL times until you become used to it. but, if there are any concerns. just use/buy some lubrication [not oil based, or it will break the condom, the oil breaks down the latex] and have him finger you, and gradually use more fingers, so it won't hurt so bad. <br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|EEVx7gKeaa	The breaking of the hymen is not what hurts, it's the stretching of the vaginal walls.

gSo4dR7oaa	If neither of you have any STDs, you can't catch any STDs from each other. However, the problem is that many STDs, including HIV, have no symptoms anytime soon after infection, so you can't tell that someone has an infection just by looking at them, and someone could be infected without even realizing that they have an infection. (It could take many years for someone to develop symptoms of HIV.)<br>  <br>  Remember, people don't always tell the truth about their history.  The safest thing to do is use condoms and get tested.|`|8jBGhsWPaa	You dont nesicerally have to sleep around to catch a STD or STI. You can be born with them! If either one of your parents had an STD or STI when they concived you then chances are you will be born with the same disease. Both have a test to see if your clean until then use a condom with plenty of lube to stop irratation and pain.|`|4MtR8MLpaa	the problem is you never know about they other guy. he may even not know he has something so using a condom is the only reasonable thing to do.|`|5rUn1fpGaa	hey :) <br>  i've found you a website that covers all the info you need to know.. just remember that safe sex is the best sex! :) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sexhealth.org/safersex/safety.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexhealth.org/safersex/safety...</a>|`|PgqXGvxAaa	no,<br>  just use a condom lol
OsT64mqMaa	Okay, a female is a female. Doesn't matter what their size is. And also, you could get pregnant your first time. It's just a matter of how safe you are.|`|QmvYGkNJaa	It's different for everyone. Getting pregnant depends on the following factors -<br>  <br>  * Chance<br>  * Birth control<br>  * Weight<br>  * Stress<br>  * Time of the month<br>  * Sperm motility<br>  * Your fertility<br>  * Your physical / mental / emotional health<br>  * Your partner's health<br>  <br>  Weight can be an issue, from the point that perhaps your periods have stopped. In that case youmight need to lose some weight and wait for them to return before you can try to get pregnant. <br>  <br>  Also weight might be affected if you have a poor diet. Poor diet also means that your body is a less-welcoming place for a baby to develop. If you don'thave the essential nutrients needed to grow a baby, you won't carry full-term. <br>  <br>  There are so many reasons you might not get pregnant straight away, and also you could fall pregnant the first time. There is no saying. If you are trying to have a baby, you should speak to your doctor to see what you can do to help.|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	It does have an effect, like a lot of factors (mentioned above)  when it comes to getting pregnant.<br>  To have the best chance of becoming pregnant have sex at the time of ovulation, you can visit your doctor and calculate what dates these will be.|`|soCH3ycWaa	Something to consider if you're over weight and wanting to get pregnant: women who are obese are more likely to have miscarriages and/or children with asthma or physical abnormalities.
7z2ZDtTXaa	Calories is a major subject when it comes to weight loss. We need to learn three things: the number of calories in our food, the number of calories a specific activity expends hourly, and last but not least our own personal daily limit of calories. The one thing which definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off 20 pounds, it definitely does produce results!
JbKerMCkaa	Hi sweetie,<br>  <br>  First off (without being a perv!) I find "saggy" breasts extremely attractive.  Its natural and what they are suppose to do.  I would much rather kiss, touch and stoke "saggy" breasts than some silicon or fake things...yuck!<br>  <br>  I am 30, and honestly I am extremely turned on by a pretty mom who has nice natural breasts and big nipples from having children.  From a purely guy-point of view, you can hold those breasts easier and they feel wonderful VS. some fake Barbie dall ones that are not natural.|`|8shR5rCcaa	it takes time, lol. i know exactly what you mean.  i breastfed BOTH of my kids and they were the saddest looking things youve ever seen.  but after 2 years they were back to normal ....for the most part... just eat healthy.|`|0lCCuBxfaa	Actually, doing push ups makes your pectorals stronger, and therefore lifts your boobs a little. Not as much as surgery can do, obviously, but there is a noticeable difference...<br>  and you'll have nicely toned arms! ;-)|`|HZKsNwbeaa	Once you become a mother, your breasts sag due to the massive body changes. Only way to fix it is breast augmentation. Don't worry about your body, your husband should love you for who you are and being the Mother of his children,.|`|YkzPfyp2aa	All women eventually get saggy breasts due to breastfeeding and age.<br>  There are exercises that you can do make them more perky.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	they may come back but yes, breast augmentation is the only way to make them come all the way back to that natural position.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	they may shrink back some, but not totally one of the downfalls of having children|`|9mQC5Vihaa	thank god I wasn't born with that other x chromosome|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	The only thing that I have heard other than surgery is to work your pectoral muscles. Just get a good bra and don't worry about it! When I breastfed, I went from a D to an E...then shrunk back down to a D. You can probably imagine what they looked like :( The actually perked back up a bit when I started working out more, but still look nothing like they did before.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Breast augmentation is the only way.|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	Try this: Lie on your back with your head, shouders and arms dangling backwards over the edge of your bed.<br>  <br>   don't hang too far over the edge other wise you'll get vertigo.<br>  <br>  swing your arms up and over your head and crunch up, hands forward, then roll back down again. This is just like an extreme crunch (over the side or foot of the bed) using your arms as leverage. <br>  <br>  do this as many times as you want. <br>  It will firm everything from your abs to your chin.|`|QmvYGkNJaa	There's no way to do it naturally, only surgery. <br>  <br>  You're lucky; mine are saggy and I'm only 24, and I've no children to show for it. Just have big boobs and the weight pulls them down. <br>  <br>  None of that matters though if you have a man that loves you; and in your case a beautiful baby. There's more to life than what your boobs look like.|`|MGGuYmAHaa	I know and it is a sad fact of being a mother.  I suggest that you begin doing some exercises that will work some of that area, of course not a lot because it will also increase your upper body.  Also invest in a good bra, this will help to make things not sag as bad.  You could also try a good vitamen E cream this is good for softening up the skin and healing.  <br>  <br>  Sadly it is the laws of motherhood and gravity.  I miss mine!!|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	sorry it happen to all mothers..

I'm so very sorry you are going through this, it's a terrible thing that shouldn't be experienced when young.  Know that your friends will never understand, can't understand, and forgive them for that.  Don't waste your breath trying to explain, either, it does no good.  Just regulate how much you do, and be hopeful.  I have since learned that where I live affects my arthritis,  and in certain climates my arthritis is improved.  there is hope, see a doctor and get a prescription for pain pills, they do help.

3DqNexwkaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry. I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight. So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously. I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.) The site was <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> - All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold, I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss. This kicked it up a bunch.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.
WPzaF2osaa	The answer is yes. Nuclear medicine was initially created to treat illnesses on the 1900s, but because of the poor knowledge and the side effects it was abandoned. Now days with more advance, Nuclear medicine is used as a tool for diagnosis in the x-ray department, by the cardiologist to study heart fitness. Nuclear medicine is used as a small seed implant for prostate cancer treatment. Radiation treatments are based on a high beam of radiation. In later developments the addition of radioactive labeled medications and markers to the cancer cells, make them an easy target during radiation treatments and also for detection of tumors, which are invisible to other studies.

Diagonal crunch—tones and trims your abdominals and obliques.<br>  How to do it: Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat. Clasp your hands behind your head. Raise your head and shoulders 3 inches off the floor and hold for one second. Rotate your shoulder so that it points to the opposite knee and hold for one second. Lower your back down to the floor, and repeat on the other side.<br>  <br>  2. Knee push-up—strengthens and tones the chest, triceps, and shoulders.<br>  How to do it: Place your hands on the floor, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. On your knees, slowly bend your arms and lower your body until your elbows are at least at a 90-degree angle. Straighten arms and push up without locking your elbows. Keep your body aligned and your abs tight. If this is still too difficult, instead of placing your hands on the floor, place them on the edge of the couch or coffee table.<br>  <br>  3. Chair squat—shapes your hips, buttocks, and thighs.<br>  How to do it: Stand with your feet hip-width apart with your back to a chair. Squat down, keeping your back straight, and extend your arms out for balance. Don't let your knees move forward beyond your toes. Stop just enough so that your backside is lightly touching the chair and stand back up.<br>  <br>  4. Calf raise—tones calves and strengthens ankles.<br>  How to do it: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Rise up so you're standing on your toes, hold, and then slowly lower down. To make this exercise more advanced, you can hold weights in your hands.<br>  <br>  5. Front-lying chest lift—strengthens your lower back muscles.<br>  How to do it: Lie facedown on the floor with your chin resting on your hands. All together, lift your head, chest, and arms 5 inches off the floor and hold for at least three seconds, then lower. If this is too difficult, place your hands on the floor to the side of your chest, and use your arms to help support yourself as you lift up.<br>  <br>  6. Shoulder pinch—strengthens the middle and upper back, stretches the chest, and helps train your shoulders to stay back and not slouch.<br>  How to do it: Stand or sit with your shoulders relaxed. Keeping your elbows bent, raise your arms out to your sides. Pinch your shoulder blades together by moving your elbows together as far back as you can.

kNVLWmwUaa	well you should ideally eat a meal at least 2 hours before exercise as it will just come up on you if u eat too soon to exercising. and in the morning i prefer just to get up and have like a bit of banana or sopmething then go to the gym so i have a we bit of foood in my system for energy but not much as the less carbs you have in you too work the faster your body will start burning the fat stored...therefore losing weight.<br>  and when yyou come home you should really weight a while like at least an hour before eating again to keep your body burning that fat and then by eating you can keep you metabolism going and you will be hungry, but remember not to eat everything! eat slowly and enjoy little bits of what you want.<br>  <br>  i would reccomend going for a stroll on the running machine first and move the pace up a bit once you get into your stride to what you can cope wioth for like 10 mins maybe as a warm up, then stretch all your muscles and body that you intende to work. then use bike, x-cross trainer and rower if you like cardio work outs, or if not a more muscle strength/tone workout by using the weight machines and free weights. - light weights with many reps for toning. heavy weights with low reps for strength building.<br>  and also if your gym has a power plate i would recomend that as it gives you a good shake haha and you can feel it! usually has instructions beside it or at mine it does =)<br>  and then a cool down with maybe anothe rwalk and strecthing.<br>  <br>  as for sauna prob no longer than 10-15mins, see what you can take<br>  <br>  this was as brief as i could make it lol with some detail too as dont want to be here all night. =)|`|Rf65wT1Xaa	well you should always eat in the morning when you wake up. but if you work out in the morning make sure you don't eat to much keep it light then after you are done with your  work out  just have a health snack about 10 to 15 mins. after. <br>   I  do not know your case with your asthma so i would tell you to go light tell you feel like you can do more.

Q3dVyWpEaa	You're not masturbating too much.  A males sexual desire and frequency of masturbation are tightly correlated with their testosterone, and similarly youth.  Be thankful you're in your sexual prime right now!  One day you'll miss it.<br>  <br>  Unless you are masturbating so much that it's affecting your daily lifestyle, believe me, you're not doing it too much.  To be blunt, if you refrain from masturbating, your sexual desire will only grow to unbearable limits anyways, and you'll probably end up masturbating regardless.  It is possible your body simply has more testosterone right now, and abstinence will only increase your testosterone levels, and can lead to nocturnal emissions (wet dreams), so in hindsight it will likely seem like a waste to refrain at all.<br>  <br>  If you must cut down, avoid sexual stimulation, like pornography.  The second your mind is stimulated, primal instincts will kick in and your priorities will seem out of place.  Another method is to simply promise yourself you will refrain for a certain amount of time, if you're like me, your word to yourself is unbreakable and you won't break it for any purpose, regardless of the desire.<br>  <br>  If you plan on doing some exercise, a great connection I found in bodybuilding and sex drive is, the more sexual desire you have, the more your animal instincts will show, go turn your desire into weightlifting and you'll have some of the best workouts in your entire life.  Just a heads up though, exercise, especially weightlifting, will sky rocket your testosterone even more.  Likely a self defeating endeavour, if there ever was one.<br>  <br>  My advice?

It won't hurt you -- more than once a day is average, and you aren't taking any damage for it.  If you make it sore, reduce once a day -- otherwise, do it as much as your body wants and stop feeling guilty.  There is no reason at all to feel guilty or bad.

qb5yJcimaa	I have the same problem/ do the same thing. I know that I'm depressed even though I've never been diagnosed by a doctor. I don't take any pills and never have, because the emotional up and down caused by the drug might be harder to handle than just being depressed. The best way that I can describe my situation is that I don't allow myself to think it as an option.<br>  <br>  I don't want to put too much, but if you want to talk about it more you can E-mail me through YA.|`|hrT2Zs88aa	i used to do the same thing. i've stopped now though and overall i feel happier!|`|AtTh9Vawaa	I think you may have a type of depression...

Stay strong!|`|XHrTJXwlaa	I think you may be slightly depressed, but it may just be a passing fascination, I think its harmless unless you feel like you are sad alot or you think about killing/want to kill yourself.

This gooey stuff is what happends around the time of your period.|`|Xf9QGTBraa	It won't go away until you have your period<br>  you're 13, so you'll be getting it soon<br>  it's just your body's way of getting ready to "mature"<br>  i know, it's weird and gross but it will pass, i promise.<br>  and if it doesn't after your period, consult a doctor|`|AC3MA4IDaa	Normal.

I dont think there's anything you can do for now, to make it go away, but maybe your ob/gyn can give you some advice on that.|`|UWK2ZERDaa	completely normal<br>  buy some liners or something to get rid of the discomfort.<br>  your period will come, dont worry.

Just another wonderful part of being female.|`|qTqjlHDtaa	you could wear panty liners but it won't go away. the reason there is vaginal discharge is because your vagina is cleaning itself to prepare for your period.  it could come this month, 6 months from now, maybe in a year from now. you can't tell sometimes. goodluck:]|`|Pef0ZbLZaa	there's no way to get rid of it sweetie<br>  its normal, just put a pantie liner in.<br>  it doesn't mean for defiant you'll start your period soon and even when you do, a lot of people still have dischargee after.|`|uZo5cLscaa	yes, that means that your period is coming soon|`|dT8tbGrLaa	you should ask a teacher someone in the anonymous box asked this<br>  and the teacher said it was completely normal|`|pi3UAJgKaa	not as bad as an actual period!!!<br>  theres this one website for girls around your age to ask questions like this.. i forget what its called... sorry<br>  good luck =]|`|z4COdGaAaa	its normal...|`|dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.
uDSXv5Fbaa	they grow until like your early 20s unofficially because if you get heavier even by the slightest your boobs will grow. but developmentally wise they stop by your ealy 20s|`|QmvYGkNJaa	Boobs NEVER stop growing. I know others will tell you they stop growing when you're 16, 18, 21 or whatever, but they carry on. <br>  <br>  Take this advice from a 24 year old whose boobs have continued to grow since the age of 12.<br>  <br>  When I was 16 I was a 34B<br>  When I was 20 I was a 36C<br>  When I was 24 I was a 36F<br>  <br>  ...and I'm still growing. <br>  <br>  Your boobs will fluctuate throughout your life, maybe a lot (like mine), or maybe a little, which is why a lot of women asume they've stopped growing. But think about this; when you menstruate, they get bigger, when you're pregnant, they get bigger. <br>  <br>  There is no age at which they stop growing, no matter how much I wish they did.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Donald S - I'll remember to tell my fiance that the next time he's got his head nestled between mine!|`|DkFoX4pHaa	Let's hope not.  Big boobs are ugly as sin.   Small breasted women are the most beautiful to see.   Your breasts will get weaker and hang down farther each year and those who have small breasts look a lot nicer when they get older than those with biggies that hang down to their navels.   Bigger is badder.   Smaller is sexier.

MhpccWpmaa	Sounds like you have a yeast infection.  The main symptoms are extreme itchiness and white-chunky--cottage cheese like discharge.  Go to the doctors to be properly diagnosed since you've never had one before, they will treat you with a pill called Diflucan that takes about a week to fully knock the infection out of you.  If you don't want to go to the doctor, try purchasing Monistat over the counter yeast infection medicine and see if this clears it up|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	Probably thrush and you dont have to of had sex to get this. You should either go to your doctors or the chemist and get canasten duo :)|`|dYGLyVpzaa	Yep, I had the same in the summer and it turned out to be thrush. Go to your doctor and ask, they can check for you and give you some cream. If you're too embarrassed you can get some over the counter in any pharmacy though. It could be to do with shaving but it sounds more like thrush to me! Don't be embarrassed it happens to most of us at some time :)|`|GGjjtHmHaa	it might be an infection. if you have shaved recently, that might happen. maybe you just need to douche. it doesnt sound too serious, i would douche first but if it keeps on you might want to go to the gyno.|`|UOybpxsfaa	Could be eczema  I have had it there horrid go to doctors and get some cream|`|Bs6uodSCaa	Thrush <br>  <br>  get some camsten duo :)|`|dcb0c032d3b6c037f3cfdb4dac72663eaa	It could be a yeast infection.  This can happen even without sex. It can occur from having taken antibiotics, or a number of other factors.  You could also be having an allergic reaction from a new bath soap or even perfumed toilet paper. It does not mean that you have a sexually transmitted disease.  There are over-the-counter medicines for yeast infections (you get them without a prescription) but since you haven't had this before it would be best to go to a doctor to make sure what it is and how to cure it.  Don't worry that the doctor will judge you in any way. They have seen everything.
ULo8Cwdfaa	Yes you're supposed to take it up to 72 hours afterwards.|`|hswTS1jVaa	Yes.|`|6qsocyK3aa	People who do not know these fundamentals should not be having sex!

mr540I3iaa	You're being silly and completley worrying about nothing which is a relief for you i guess! :)<br>  He didn't even ejaculate, so there would be no way of you getting pregnant, and you are on your second month of the pill so if he did ejaculate, you probably would of been fully covered, as i was when i was into my second month.<br>  So you're fine :)|`|OMYgUs1Saa	There really isn't much of a chance of you being pregnant i wouldn't have thought. However if you are worried try contacting your doctor or local family planning centre and they may provide some help or advice that should put your mind at rest. You can explain the situation and they won't judge you at all, they are there to help with these sorts of things.|`|dYGLyVpzaa	If you've been taking the pill correctly you have nothing to worry about!

GSEslPnTaa	nothing is going to happen if you only take one and then stop, but make sure that you are not having unprotected sex and think that this one pill is going to stop you from getting pregnant. I would talk to my doctor about getting on a different type of pill or alternative birth control source.|`|QmvYGkNJaa	If you only took one, and threw up 6 hours later, it will have entered your system. But if it's just the one, it's not going to have a lasting effect on your body. <br>  <br>  But I don't think it was the pill that made you sick. I would recommend taking it again to be sure, and if you're sick again, then go back to your doctor. You could have just had a short bug.|`|EEVx7gKeaa	I think you will be fine, usually the first week of pills is placebo anyway so they don't really have anything in them. Just decide now what you are going to do now, before you take any more. Also maybe you should eat a meal with the pills while your body is getting used to them, this helps.|`|OMYgUs1Saa	One pill doesn't really effect you in any way and so won't stop you from becoming pregnant. However if the pill is making you ill then you should stop taking it and contact your doctor, remember there are other forms of contraception and more than one type of the pill.|`|I1ZzNNpiaa	if your thinking pregnancy wise, you will get pregnant if you dont take anymore, obviously haha, but on the other hand things should be normal if you stop takin em<br>  x|`|D18cv2xBaa	nothing will happen. you wont be protected against pregnancy. if the pill made you sick you should definitely stop taking it.|`|AA12316174	You need to continue taking them fir at least 1 pack the nausea will ease up and the vomiting may just be coincidental. Take the pill at least 45 min prior  going to bed.  I am currently on desogen the name brand of Apri and love it had minor nausea. One month they had to give me Apri instead which is the generic brand and I too felt sick so try the name brand instead|`|hswTS1jVaa	Nothing.  With one pill there is not enough hormone in you to do anything to you. <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor about finding a different pill that won't make you sick.

tkSXjqhuaa	Ask your gyno.|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	Hey there. I would visit the gyno or your GP to discuss your concerns.|`|ZzbjeoMyaa	Well I'd say you have come to the right place, there seems to me like you have a lot going on :( Well I think you should definitley tell your husband the truth about why you don't like having sex, and why you can't get your problem fixed because you don't have insurance. I think once you tell him EVERYTHING, he will understand and get you some help.
MhpccWpmaa	When this happened to me the doctor told me to keep taking the pills as scheduled so I ended up bleeding for three weeks straight.  She swtiched me to a new one once the pack was done and I haven't had problems since.  Even though it's your second pack into the pill and you didn't experience this at first, your body is still adjusting to the new levels of hormones and such in the pill.  You can either switch again to see if that helps or keep taking this brand and wait it out to see if your body adjusts to them|`|ximWtKVuaa	Go see your doctor ... something obviously isn't working correctly and it's best not to play around with birth control just on the off chance it means it's not effective.|`|kc68BXwTaa	I'd stop and call your doctor.<br>  <br>  Your body may be adjusting to the hormones, but if you've been bleeding heavily to moderately for a week and a half, stop. If it's just a little bit of blood, it's called 'breakthrough bleeding'.
uVMlNvLoaa	Unfortunately, the only instantaneous period-delayer would be Depo-provera, and that still makes you spot for a while afterwards.<br>  <br>  You would have to start a pack of pills at the beginning of your last period, or at the first sunday after the end of your last period, so there's no go with the pills either.<br>  <br>  The morning after pill will not help in this case either, it'll just make your cycle more unpredictable and is fairly expensive on top of that (40 bucks for two pills, geez).<br>  <br>  Sorry hun, but you'll just need to suck it up. Should've been a little more forethinking. :(|`|ximWtKVuaa	Oooh really don't do that.  The pill won't actually move your period that much unless you start taking it well in advance.|`|1AWywas5aa	Ugh, that's an unhealthy way to try and do it - and I don't even think it'd work that well.|`|C0gLpe3jaa	if u see ur GP they can give u something that delays ur period, not sure what its called but it is safe to use as long as its not often|`|GGjjtHmHaa	no way, you have to take bc for about 3 months for it to work anywho

I'm 17 and started puberty early, so I've been through quite a bit.|`|D18cv2xBaa	the red line going up the middle of it is probably where you got circumcised. <br>  <br>  i don't know what "prinkly" means. it's not in the dictionary. is it some kind of slang? you should maybe go to the doctor about this.<br>  <br>  the uneven hair is normal - it'll even out.|`|Q3eTFtijaa	absolutely completely normal. when i was 12, and i went to the doctor, i had the same thing, and he didnt mention anything|`|d6d529942568e28c35ea74a1add8b085aa	Its all perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  One thing to remember now though is to keep your penis head clean. rinse with warm water ( no soap! ) and keep it dry down there.<br>  <br>  Other than that.<br>  All normal.|`|c6b25fb5027410b81b9d72ec8af133f8aa	That's all perfectly normal.

u8CFwtyMaa	Hi there, I just answered your other question about this, and the same applies here.<br>  Don't worry about it, you still have some growing to do.<br>  My penis was about the same size as yours at 16, and I'm in the average adult size range now. It stopped growing at about 18, but as the rate of growth slows down at the end of puberty, it's hard to tell when it stops.<br>  Hope this helps|`|TyK4r4iUaa	The best advice i can give you is to not leave your computer logged in to yahoo answers.

xnZi0i8saa	Yes they can help BUT they are not a cure all. You still need your meds and therapy. Meditation can help with anxiety and racing thoughts and fish oil is known to help depression. However, like I said, do not consider it a cure.....|`|4NiRJZkAaa	No see your doctor !|`|ParFJxnSaa	Yes; proficiency in meditation enables a greater ability to psychologically centre oneself, and a way of avoiding the depressive mode for a while. A previous answer follows: See section 10, on bipolar disorder, at ezy build, below, and take the quiz, if unsure, and if the results are positive, ensure you get an expert diagnosis from a mental health professional, not doctors, who are much better dealing with physical ailments, and don't diagnose complex disorders like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder often enough to develop any real expertise. Bipolar disorder usually involves major mood swings, which occur without apparent cause, and often over many months, or a matter of years, rather than days, as with most people (unless rapid cycling). Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. More about this on page R, in section 2.<br>  <br>           If you decide to use allopathy, (modern Western medicine) I recommend trying Lithium Carbonate, or Lithium Citrate. (regular tests are necessary, for these) before trying the other mood stabilisers, but if you aren't good at taking medications regularly, drinking adequate water, and keeping up your salt intake, something else, such as  Lamictal,  or Depakote, may suit you better.

Personally, if I wasn't bipolar type 1, and didn't experience hallucinations, or serious delusional states, I know I'd first try the orthomolecular, and Omega 3 fish oil supplements, vitamins, minerals; a herbal remedy, and a mostly raw food diet, for several months. Note: St. John's wort, and also antidepressants, may trigger mania, or hypomania, in people with bipolar disorder. I'd aso eat in accordance with my "nutritional type".

If you have bipolar type 1, an antipsychotic medication will probably be required.

There are various types, and degrees of severity with bipolar disorder, and although many people with the milder versions can get by without medication, using the alternative treatments, those whose disorder in more serious, really would benefit from taking it.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Yes on the medication and the word is still out about fish oil. But my husband's psychiatrists suggested I take it because Alzheimer runs in my family and he said it sure wouldn't hurt to take it. Sorry, I though you said medication, not meditation.

The coil creates a magnetic field facilitating the absorption of the Panda dung and ground rhinoceros horn into the tissues of the penis.<br>  <br>  While the smell is bad for some time, the penis grows and stays grown with monthly applications up to twice its erect length and up to 3 times its girth. This technology was developed from the discovery of the effects of natural ferro magnetic fields in iron ore deposits struck by lightning on Panda penis size by a royal Prince in what is now Vientiane in the 16th Century. The rhinoceros horn is a concession to Chinese natural and herbal medicine.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you can get tattoos and piercings that make it look bigger.|`|MpoZ8ySuaa	Where the hell is the question in there ??

Usually, it works like this: The insurance company provides a list of health-care providers who are in its network. If you use one of them, you pay a nominal co-payment, much as you would with an HMO. The doctor agrees to accept whatever the insurance company gives him (or her). If you go OUTSIDE the network, however, you will have to pay a co-insurance, usually a percentage of the doctor's fee, subject to deductibles. So, if you go outside the network and the doctor or lab charges you $1000 and you have a 20-percent co-insurance, you're going to pay $200, assuming you've already met your deductible."<br>  <br>  <br>  [not me]|`|qM7rfwD9aa	the 2nd one has an E and the first doesn't<br>  <br>  idk<br>  <br>  google it
QVs4ZRx4aa	Ask your doctor to do a CT scan. My mom went through those same symptoms for months and her doctor kept telling her it was gas, bloating, being out of shape. One day, she couldn't even stand up due to her abdominal swelling and pain and her doctor was off duty, so she saw another one. This one happened to recognize the symptoms and sent her to get a CT scan. It turned out to be stage 3C ovarian cancer. i'm not trying to scare you, but it's OFTEN misdiagnosed by doctors and that's why it's often not found until late stages. So tell your doctor you want a CT scan as soon as possible. My mom is only 34 so yes, it is rare to happen in younger women, but it does happen.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Ovarian cancer in women of reproductive age is very rare indeed. Ovarian cancer usually occurs in women aged 50+ Are you experiencing these symptoms all the time? Your symptoms are non specific symptoms and may not be all related. Although a bloated feeling in the abdomen is a symptoms of ovarian cancer, it is also a PMS symptom that many women get. <br>  <br>  Your Doctor would have examined you and if your ovaries were enlarged this would have been a cause for concern. I presume this was not the case. A blood test is another way of detecting the most common type of ovarian cancer. It detects a protein called CA-125. The level of CA-125 is high in most women with ovarian cancer. Other non-cancerous conditions can also cause levels to be high, so this test does not 100% diagnose or rule out O/cancer.<br>  <br>  Your Doctor has likely done all these tests and as you have been given a follow up appointment it means that the initial tests you have do not indicate cancer. They will likely do another scan on your follow up appointment and if the cyst has grown they may do further tests. It is HIGHLY unlikely that you have cancer. Cysts on the ovaries are indeed very common. Try not to worry.<br>  <br>  See your GP regarding your lack of appetite and other pain.|`|abf07479de4ab77cd5c06e91a7b34722aa	So rare at your age.

I'm sure if there were any signs of ovarian cancer you would have been given further investigations in december. <br>   However it is true that the symptoms of ovarian cancer can be explained away as constipation, age-related bladder problems, over-weight etc, so we would do well to be on our guard and make sure we have any necessary investigations. <br>  I'm sure if there was any reason to suspect ovarian cancer in yourself further tests would have been carried out.  Please express your worries when you have your follow up appointment so that they can reassure you.|`|A8bFosCsaa	i guess the symptoms you havent mentioned was pain during sex? bleeding after sex or during? <br>  my brothers girlfriens had your symptoms and it turned out to be polycystic ovarian syndrom. research on that but nothing your appointment, or you could go to a different doctor.

Balance the 2 out so your daily routine has half fat loss exercises and half Muscluar strength. For fat loss, jog, run, get active; or if you're at a gym jump onto a cardio-vascular machine.<br>  Then start to tone your muscles. The best one I know of for abs is easy and very effective. You have to lie on your back, have your knees in the air at a 90 degree angle. Put your hands behind your head and "cycle" your legs touching shoulder-to-knee with each turn.

Gw1LLzDgaa	Hey Nick,<br>  <br>  If you are not bleeding, I strongly suspect that it will correct without difficulty.  It hurts now because things were stretched that normally are not.<br>  <br>  You don't need to tell your parents about this at all.  If you are bleeding, or the hurt does not go away in the next few days -- ask to go to the doctor.  Probably if it still hurts it is infected -- and anti-biotics will cure it.  The symptoms probably sound like Urinary Tract Infection -- so that's what you will be given.   <br>  <br>  Now, there is NO REASON to regret doing it.<br>  <br>  Right now you regret it because it hurts and because you are afraid *hug* -- but I think it will be absolutely fine, one way or another -- and you did not do anything wrong.  Being curious about your penis and wanting to experience everything with it you can is normal.  Don't regret it -- just learn from it.<br>  <br>  Your penis is wonderful, (other than your g/f or b/f's tongue) should not be stuck in it.  Other holes are better for sticking things (GENTLY) in.<br>  <br>  I knew a number of boys who, when we were young, experimented by sticking things in the end.  They all have working, happy, normal penises now. The only one that ever needed help was one who lost a pin inside (I am not making that up) and had it go up inside his body.<br>  <br>  You were smarter than him.  There is nothing to regret.  It will be ok.<br>  <br>  Kindest thoughts and a hug,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|e4QW4xvOaa	Now why the hell would you go around doing that? You probably infected it and HAVE to tell your parents.

W4whHKmxaa	There are three different types of blood tests that the doctors do to test the liver:<br>  (1) the liver enzymes will show if there is<br>  damage to the liver cells (2) the liver function<br>  tests will show how well the cells are<br>  functioning to do the job of keeping the body<br>  healthy and (3) viral testing, to see if you have<br>  contacted a virus.  <br>  <br>  Liver problems can occur because of more<br>  reasons than just being alcohol related:<br>  medication toxification, chemical exposure,<br>  viral infections such as Hepatitis A,B,C...,<br>  biliary problems, hereditary problems, <br>  fatty liver disease, auto immune disease and<br>  there are others.  <br>  <br>  No one blood test is 100% accurate.  Your <br>  doctor may do more than one blood testing<br>  to be sure of these results.  Your body <br>  chemistry is also continually changing.  <br>  Also, if someone in the lab did not quite<br>  follow procedures or a patient exercised or<br>  ate something before the test was done...<br>  it could change the results.  Therefore,<br>  this is the reason to be sure about the <br>  results.<br>  <br>  The doctor may give you an<br>  examination where he will feel the upper<br>  right hand portion of your abdomen, just<br>  under the rib cage to see if he can feel<br>  and enlargement in your liver.  <br>  If the liver is enlarged, that means that<br>  there might be inflammation there.  He<br>  will find out the cause of this and then<br>  treat the inflammation so the liver cells<br>  can heal.  Considering he doesn't want<br>  you to see him for a month, maybe that<br>  he is waiting now to see you and do more<br>  testings before diagnosing you.  Some<br>  people's level do return to normal during<br>  certain time periods.  <br>  <br>  I know it is hard to wait for a determination<br>  to be made...I would try to stay calm about <br>  this.  If you find out that it is a liver problem,<br>  ask to see a gastroenterologist.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, do not take any medications<br>  that are not prescribed or approved of by <br>  your doctor.  That is because most all<br>  medications go through the liver first to<br>  be broken down before going to the rest of<br>  the body.  Another thing is to try to stay as<br>  well as possible...limiting being with others<br>  who are sick and washing your hands often<br>  and using a bacterial cleaner on your hands,<br>  like purell, in between times.  If you do happen<br>  to have a liver problem...you don't want to<br>  become ill and end up taking more medications<br>  or weakening your body healing the liver.<br>  Try to stay away from open salad bars and<br>  wash all fruits and vegetables that come from<br>  the grocery store where people have their<br>  hands on them. <br>  It is very important to eat a well balanced diet...<br>  reduce things with alot of salt or preservatives.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you and I hope your tests<br>  go back into normal range.  For some people<br>  their above readings on these tests are<br>  normal for them even though they may not<br>  be for another person... <br>  <br>  You could call the doctor's office back and<br>  ask them if they have any cancelations, to<br>  see if they can get you worked in to see the<br>  doctor sooner...many people do this. <br>  Best wishes to you.
W4whHKmxaa	Usually, it isn't the colon, it is the small <br>  intestines.  Mostly, because of the bile coming down from the liver to the small intestines to<br>  help in the digestion of fats we eat.  Also,<br>  because the carbohydrates, fats, sugars, and<br>  protein we eat are also absorbed from the small<br>  intestine and the bile is also reabsorbed and<br>  goes back to the liver.    <br>  The colon is the large intestines.  Usually,<br>  here is where the fluid is reabsorbed back<br>  into the body....however, when someone has<br>  a problem with the liver...it is known that some<br>  of them also can develop either Crohns...<br>  which involves the small intestines...or<br>  Ulcerative colitiis which involves the entire<br>  Colon or large intestines.  Both these diseases<br>  are rare and they are yet to find out the<br>  connection between having liver disease and<br>  also having one of these diseases, though,<br>  they believe there is one.  <br>  <br>  This is the best I can do to explain any<br>  connections.  Hope this is of help to you.

Bend down and rest your ear against your kneecap.  Press down, so that your entire ear canal is covered by your knee.  You should feel a slight pressure.  Keep doing it (but don't press too hard too fast or it'll hurt) and rock your head from side to side a little.  Your ear should pop back to normal.<br>  <br>  -Sit on an armchair lie down on a bed and press your ear against the arm or a thick pillow.  Really press it in quite hard, and that should pop it back because the pressures change.<br>  <br>  -Either run a bath or go to a swimming pool. Get in, hold your nose and go underwater.  Then try to exhale through your nose while still holding it.  Being underwater maximises the difference in pressure so that can often help.<br>  <br>  I totally appreciate what you are going through, and I hope one of those suggestions is able to help!  Something else that worked was sucking really hard on boiled sweets.|`|8260dca222ad20609347892ad4629cdeaa	Go to a chiropracter and get an adjustment on your head.This will really help. Also,you may have a chunk of a large ear plug(wax) that's blocking the passage way.Try some hot compresses on the ear and neck just below the ear. Also putting hot compresses on the sinus passage thats near that ear to help open it up.You can also fill a pot with hot steaming water and put your face over it to breathe in the steam.You'll need a towel to put around your face and the pot to hold the steam in.This will open up all sinus passages in the vicinity og your ear.WE do something called ear candling at home and this really opens up our ears when they feel plugged up.Some health resorts  and massage therapy places offer this service for around $35 bucks. Good luck.|`|lSm3UxUKaa	plug in some ear buds (headphones) and play them really loud|`|PcPswmv5aa	Take a decongestant.  It is what I do before scuba diving..

y4SUDnpaaa	My experience after being prescribed Prozac was nightly, vivid, in color nightmares. They were  horrendous. My doctor said it was one of the side effects of Prozac and put me on a different antidepressant. That was just my experience, that might not be the cause of your nightmares. You should see or call your doctor and tell him about the nightmares if they continue.|`|FyF2r7wraa	It can be.  I took Prozac for many years not for depression but to treat cataplexy which is muscle weakness associated with narcolepsy.  I was having the very vivid dreams increasing; because of that and nervousness I switched to Lexapro which is not as good for the cataplexy but relieves the dreaming and the anxiety.|`|vqtpF1Q5aa	I have depression as well but I don't have nightmares..............<br>  I have taken Prozac in the past as well.<br>  <br>  I would say that it's a side effect of being on and off the med and it will pass....IF it doesnt then definately contact your doctor BUT if it is really bothering  you then contact them now......<br>  <br>  I do have a girlfriend that has is taking Prozac and she was at 40mg and when they increased her to 60mg she is now talking in her sleep and her husband says she is literally carrying on conversations...lol...it's been a side effect for her with the increase --- so in all honesty I would say it's the med's change not the depression but once you are back on a regular schedule you will be ok....<br>  <br>  - Hope this helps...

iK3YYRaTaa	You sure can. Might help diabetes. <br>  <br>  Both black tea and green tea are good for diabetes, a rat study shows. They also prevent diabetic animals from developing cataracts.<br>  <br>  The findings appear in the May 4 issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.<br>  <br>  "Black and green tea represent a potentially inexpensive, nontoxic, and, in fact, pleasurable [blood-sugar-lowering] agent," the researchers write. "Tea may be a simple, inexpensive means of preventing or retarding human diabetes and the ensuing complications."<br>  <br>  In the study, the researchers gave green and black teas to diabetic rats for three months.<br>  <br>  They found both kinds of tea inhibited diabetic cataracts. The teas also had a blood-sugar-lowering effect.<br>  <br>  To get the same dose of tea given to the rats, a 143-pound person would have to drink 4.5 8-ounce cups of tea every day.<br>  <br>  The researchers recommend that tea -- black and green -- should be studied for an antidiabetes effect in humans.<br>  <br>   Kewl. Try it you may like it.

O5aSTFGRaa	First of all, you shouldn't want to lose 15lbs. That would put you right on the border of underweight and normal. And since you're an athlete, you shouldn't be near that line. Since you're a soccer player, a good portion of your weight is coming from the muscles in your legs, which you don't want to lose if you plan on playing next year.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, if you're only running 1.5 miles a day, you're not doing much for your cardiovascular system. You probably run more than that in one practice. Plus with practice you're doing other physical activities that are burning calories (diving, kicking, jumping, etc...). You need to get your heart rate up if you want to see any improvement. You would need to figure out your own personal target heart rate zone, but I would say try to stay above 160 while running.<br>  <br>  Try increasing your distance. Run as far as you can in 30 minutes, then the next week aim for 33 minutes. Keep going up gradually.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Cause you eat too much.|`|ltMbMIPlaa	you are still growing and it will take to put some weight on. also muscle is much heavier than fat. so you run, you build muscle which weights more.|`|uE6RQtQWaa	How long does that run take? You need to get your heart rate up and keep it up for 45 min.<br>  And you might want to re-think your goal -110 lbs sounds kind of low for an athlete. Remember muscle weighs more than fat. In doing your running you may have lost fat but gained muscle. So you will be smaller even though the scales didn't move. Take your measurements - you might be closer to you gaol than you think.|`|l2ma3RYraa	Count your calories for one week.<br>  Break the count down into protein, carbs, and fat.<br>  Take a look at yourself, if you are gaining muscle mass from playing soccer and running then you cannot do much about.<br>  Are you getting fatter?<br>  Weight is relative it is how you look and feel.<br>  <br>  Lift some weights.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	You may be gaining weight because you keep gaining muscle.  Muscle weighs more than fat, so the more you run and more muscle you get on your legs and stomach- the more weight you're going to gain.  Which isn't a bad thing at all, since it is muscle!|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	watch what your are eating you could be eating more calories than you think|`|L4YGtpeLaa	Have you done a daily log of the foods you eat, their amounts and calories? Maybe your ingesting more than you realize.<br>  <br>  Do you weigh 1st thing in morning? This seems to be a normalizing time.<br>  <br>  If you truly can't figure out the weight gain, you probably should see a doc and take your food journal/log. You may have a thyroid or other problem. (Also- could it be pregnancy?)|`|B4nujMnlaa	Sorry to say this, but you might need to go on a diet. But before we even think about that, 1.5 miles isn't that much for a 15 year old. I run 3 miles every day without stop and I'm 14. Try running longer distances. Also, you may think of starting running track.|`|BCzrcwKFaa	it's all calories in vs. calories out.  you need a larger deficit than running is getting you.  you need a 3500 calorie deficit to lose a pound.  try eating fewer calories and continue running.|`|mlaLgoaSaa	It usually takes about 8-12 weeks to see results after starting a fitness regime. Keep it up and you will see improvement.|`|h3Ll1qxhaa	your eating more than your burning off. eat less. i ate one meal a day (small one 2) and ran a mile a day lost 25lbs|`|ovf7pLvyaa	hmmm really...are you eating within your calories...cut out junk food and sodas completely...remember veggie are free food...make sure you're drinking 8-10 once cups of water daily...or more!|`|v852MqtIaa	if u have ever smoked before or now it that can be problem|`|rBlw2Kecaa	Hi Alicia,<br>  I agree with jenwis, 15 lbs sounds like too much weight for you to lose for your height. For everyone saying that you're eating too many calories, I'd not just focus on the # of calories but the quality of food you're eating.  Popcorn for lunch is not a good idea.  Eat more fresh fruits and veggies, whole grain bread, lean protein (chicken, tuna fish), and even a small amount of fat. I don't think you need to go on a diet, just be mindful of portion control. <br>  I also think that the closer you are to your body's ideal weight, the harder it will be for you to lose the pounds.|`|Bm7u0bJ0aa	probally cus ur gaining more muscle then u are with fat,<br>  fat weighs less then muscle
FU4TyghIaa	dude, i'm 5'4 and a half.  I call it 5'5" but that's an old habit.  I spent years riding a bicycle and got enormously fit.  Trying to get big can be a bit of a lost cause.  Well it was for me.  The downside with trying to get big and all that can cultivate feelings of macho and aggression.  You don't want that.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking you might be concerned about how members of the opposite will view you and will you be attractive etc.  Truth is, chicks who go for guys because they're big and strong tend to be air heads anyway.  And really, decent relationships aren't based on that kind of thing.  If you do seek that kind of superficial insincerity, you might want to get a big car or motorcycle?  I'm joking, but it's after the same deal. <br>  <br>  No you're not too small.  There's nothing wrong with working out, but don't expect it to fix what you're trying to do.  Find other things to concentrate your energies on that can yield rewards, cause short, little guys who get 'built' and act tough just look stupid and sad.  In this i mean to be creative and stuff.  It works for me.  People like me for my crazy out there ideas.  Plenty of people don't like me, but that's the way of the world.  Plenty of people are never liked by some people, too bad there are more fish in the sea.<br>  <br>  Feeling good about yourself can be really hard, but too being reflective and inwards has its place when feeling good can in some cases be seen as arrogant.<br>  <br>  Reminds me of Randy Newman's song, short people.<br>  Like I think of randy, mate, I'd rather be short than ugly.  Deal with it Randy you sad ugly pig.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, but i understand if it doesn't.  No-one can tell you what only life can teach you.<br>  <br>  Good luck friend.|`|byquASIgaa	yeah ur to small, im a 14 year old girl and im taller then u... and so is evryone else in my grade.. how tall are your parents? sorry for the mean answer, but when you ask a question, you gotta be prepared for the answer.|`|UmFPEv5Jaa	ur pretty short, and small, and weights wont do anything for height. but they are good for muscles so keep doin the good work!!|`|STr40rGlaa	dude! im almost sixtee(1 more month) 5'7 and 103 pounds! <br>  <br>  well maybe u are a little on the short side...|`|4puOUmLTaa	You're a little on the smaller side, but remember that guys don't stop growing until 21.

ZLt8TwOiaa	By eating the amount of calories your BMR says for your ideal weight you can get there and stay there.
wqRSMSlLaa	Yes.  Your body cannot tell the difference whether you delivered a full term baby or whether you aborted after 3 weeks.  All your body knows is that the pregnancy ended.  Although your hormones weren't at the level they'd be at after 9 months, they were still building up for a few weeks and dropped when the abortion took place.  There were still biochemical changes in your body.  I am not diagnosing you and saying you have postpartum depression, but you asked if it were possible, and the answer is yes.<br>  <br>  Dr. Shoshana Bennett|`|RGvNRH8Iaa	It would not technically be postpartum depression because at 3 weeks, you do not have all the same hormones that you would if you had carried a baby full-term.  But yes, depression after an abortion is absolutely normal, probably partly due to hormones and partly due to mental and physical stress.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	ABORTION IS WRONG!!|`|DSMaUGQYaa	No, that is a different kind of depression altogether. <br>  Post partum depression is, by definition, caused by a sudden change in hormones AFTER a woman has already given birth to a full-term baby. It is not directly caused by anything the woman did, whereas what you're describing  seems to be a result of depression caused by feelings of sadness or guilt over having the abortion.<br>  Either way, it's important to seek guidance and support... it's not always easy to deal with depression and losing a baby, in any capacity, can often be devastating to a woman.|`|ei9jnZEeaa	It is called post abortion trauma. I had it.  You just have heal in the way that is right for you.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	i would have depression for life if i had a abortion.......|`|2yepHQ1daa	I'm not sure if they call it postpardum depresion. I have had 2 abortions , the first was about three years ago and the second was almost one year ago. I still feel sad everyday for both of them, I have nighmares and about nine months after the second one I started wetting my bed. I really hope you don't go through all of this but if you need someone to talk to you can contact me at anytime.
tUeH8HDdaa	No definitely file a complaint.<br>  <br>  That nurse could end up killing someone.<br>  <br>  There are mentally ill nurses about who give overdoses on purpose.<br>  <br>  It's a control thing.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Used for sedation. Many medicines are used in other ways under dr discretion.|`|CBmizuGwaa	...the Nurse only gives the patient what the DOCTOR orders...  check with the doctor.|`|l8xUSZiQaa	well, the nurse was following docs orders, so you have to take it up with the doc.|`|BCzrcwKFaa	was the nurse arguing with the doctor?  i think your misinformed.  did your niece get an iv or an injection?  intramuscular lorasepam IS an injection... into a muscle.  doctors prescribed drugs for other things than they are prescribed all the time.  the fact that it's for people 12 and over means it has been tested on people 12 and over, not that it will necessarily harm people under 12.|`|7KMOLdcNaa	shouldnt you have asked this before they gave it.  Im just saying?????|`|piI1aWOdaa	if there is no harm done.. you have nothing to compensate for.. and its very normal and regulalr practice to sedate children for scans etc.. so I hope if you sue they countersue you for wasting time|`|SnTuaKcJaa	they are the same thing. The nurse was only doing what the doctor ordered. As long as nothing happened to her you have no case against them.
iHna2K7Gaa	Some people just have a higher metabolism than others. Whatever you do, don't think that trying to starve yourself or anything will help because it won't. It only slows down your metabolism even more and can lead to eating disorders (trust me, I went through that phase at your age).<br>  <br>  If you're really serious about losing weight AND KEEPING IT OFF, this is what you need to do.<br>  <br>  1. Eat breakfast. I know it's hard because you probably feel you don't have time to, but eat it anyway. Even if you don't feel hungry, when you wake up eat breakfast. Even if it's just a piece of fruit or something. Eating a healthy and filling breakfast is what will speed your metabolism up so that you're burning more calories throughout the day. My suggestion is a cup of Special K or Cheerio's with reduced fat or skim milk. Try to drink a glass or two of reduced fat or skim milk if you can as well. Milk fills you up fast, plus it's good for you.<br>  <br>  2. Pack some fruit with you WHEREVER YOU GO. Even if it's just a bag of grapes, throw some fruit in your purse or backback so that whenever you're hungry you have something to snack on throughout the day. If you're body is telling you to eat, don't deny it food, just make sure it's something healthy. I especially love bananas because they really fill you up. Even if you're just going to run errands, it's good to have a piece of fruit with you, especially if you get tempted easily to stop at fast food restaurants on the way home.<br>  <br>  3. Drink lots of water. In fact, like the fruit, carry a bottle of water with you EVERYWHERE. Don't drink soda, even if it's diet. It's not healthy. Drink water as often as you can because it keeps you feeling full, and it's also very good for your complexion. I always keep in on top of or beside my desk, so I always remember to drink it, even when I'm not that thirsty. If you run out of water, go buy another bottle or stop by a water fountain and refill it.<br>  <br>  4. Eat healthy! This is important. If you're really serious about losing weight, you need to watch what you eat. You're young so I'm not going to tell you to completely remove junk food from your diet, but at least limit yourself. Try to stay away from soda, candy, fast food, fried foods, starches, etc. Eat fruits and vegetables as often as you can. If you must have a starch like potatoes or rice, only eat a serving about the size of your fist. Make sure you have plenty of protein in your diet (meat, eggs, nuts, etc.), but opt for grilled meat. Grilled chicken is tasty and healthy, and it has a lot less calories than breaded or fried chicken. Opt for boiled eggs over fried eggs as well. Nuts are very good to keep around to snack on, like fruit. If you feel that it will help you, keep a journal of what you eat and how many calories it has. Even if you go to a restaurant, you can often find the calories on the package or online (check out McDonald's website and see just how many calories an order of medium fries has!).<br>  <br>  5. Exercise! I know it's hard, and I can tell you that I know how it is trying to find time to exercise. It really isn't, though. If you're like me, you probably feel that you actually need to set aside time to exercise - NOT SO! If you get up early in the morning and have a half-hour to spare, go outside and go for a run. Or before you go to bed, take about 10 minutes to do some pushups and situps. What a lot of kids at my high school did was after they got out of class, before they drove home, they'd stop over by the school track and run a couple of laps. It only takes like 10 minutes. Don't feel like you have to go out and run five miles. Five miles is great if you have the time and energy, but even a little bit is better than NOTHING. Think of it this way - all of those calories you wrote in that journal from all the food you ate? That all needs to be burned off. It came in when you ate it, and now it needs to go back out. The best way to do that is EXERCISE. Those calories aren't going to burn themselves.<br>  <br>  I know it's tough, but this is the best way to do it. I hope this helps, and good luck! Feel free to message me if you have ANY questions or if you would like me to help you develop a workout plan. :)|`|dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) No.1 This is called peer pressure!!, it is the emotional & psychological pressure felt by young girls of your age to conform the what is considered to be most attractive size, or weight at that age i.e. at 15-16years old.<br>  <br>  No.2 Society and boys and the wider culture (TV, films, adverts, porn etc) also add to this pressure to look & be a certain way.<br>  <br>  No.3 Please understand this, loosing weight fast is NOT a healthy option.

Rather than going into an extreme diet and exercise regimen, I recommend some sort of aerobic workout 3 to 4 times a week like swimming, running, biking, etc. Cut your meals up into smaller half meals that you eat through out the day, and make sure breakfast is the largest meal and also don't eat after 9 p.m. unless you're planning on doing something active after that. <br>  <br>  The girls in your school aren't you, so don't expect to be able to eat the same things they do and not face some sort of consequences.

Good luck! :)|`|b2b6690ceff0950e402d8cb1842e3afdaa	You have to be consistent with losing weight. Losing more than 2 pounds a week isn't healthy.

9HAuyoSYaa	I was in the same position as you during my pregnancy. It took to almost my 6th month before I was showing and then it was like I exploded. A lot of it is water weight I believe. I never did ask my doctor and my son was only 6 lb 11 oz, not very big at all. During the whole pregnancy they told me he was gonna be a small child so when I was gaining all that weight towards the end I was a little freaked out. I know the doctor says your body changes in preparation for the baby, like it stores more fat and stuff so that you have something to draw from when breast feeding. I wouldn't worry too much about it though. I was able to loose all that weight afterwords although I did breast feed for 4 months.|`|mnkZ6VS9aa	I'm neither pregnant nor had experiences with pregnancy, but I know people. Those I know have gained a considerable amount of weight, but I personally think your doctor is the one to judge in terms of if it's healthy or not. One of my friends was recently pregnant and went up a pants size as well. The weight gain is of course mostly due to the hormonal changes in your body. If you think you're gaining too much, speak to your doctor about it. There's also no harm in exercising while you're pregnant, if you ever feel the need to - and its definitely good for you and baby :) <br>  <br>  Also, congrats!|`|T333jPUTaa	that usually is the amt they recommend for the total pregnancy, you need to talk to your doc bout your concerns, so you don't get sugar diabetes. you also cud have twins, or just gaining Weight on other places.

vEGkSHMsaa	Pullups will not help your height, Thats based on your genetics. Being 5'8 isnt all bad. Being that tall it will be easy for you to put on muscle and bulk up. Getting stronger should be easier for you as well vs. taller people. Get started on the starting strength program. Its great for beginners. It will make you stronger quick. How big your muscles get depends on how much your eating.<br>  <br>  Read:<a href="http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ" rel="nofollow">http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/F...</a><br>  <br>  Concentrate on your form and progress up in weight slowly.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: To the post above:<br>  <br>  Wouldn't a 3 or 4-day split work better than this? NO<br>  <br>  A 3 or 4-day split won't work better for a novice.<br>  It might work better for an intermediate, but probably not.<br>  It probably would work better for an advanced trainee.<br>  It definitely would work better for a bodybuilder preparing for a competition.<br>  <br>  Let's look at a typical 4-day split.<br>  <br>  <br>  Day 1 - Chest/triceps<br>  Day 2 - Back/biceps<br>  Day 3 - Delts/traps/forearms<br>  Day 4 - Legs<br>  Day 5 - off<br>  <br>  So in the course of a 15-day period of time, using a 4-day split you would train 12 days, rest 3 days, and squat, bench, pull-up, and deadlift 3x. Using the Rippetoe novice program, you would train 6 days, rest 8 days, squat 6 times, and bench, powerclean/pull-up and deadlift 3x.<br>  <br>  So you end up training 2x as many days, So you squat half as often and you bench, powerclean/pull-up, and deadlift the same number of times. Yet you end up training 2x as many days (12 versus 6) and you rest less than 1/2 as often (8 days versus 3).<br>  <br>  As a novice, you will need the extra rest times for recovery, especially if you are to maintain consistent progress on the benchmark exercises. Someone more experienced and better conditioned with a barbell will have much greater success with a split-type program than the novice.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well u will need to train all your muscles once per week..<br>  and all your muscles<br>  <br>  u will need to do<br>  40 - 60 mins on each workout.. doing reps of 6 - 8, and 3 - 4 sets per exercise 3 - 4 different exercises per muscle<br>  <br>  mon chest<br>  tue biceps triceps<br>  wed back <br>  thur shoulders<br>  fri legs<br>  <br>  abs everyother day.<br>  <br>  cardio twice a week for 25 mins<br>  <br>  no sorry pullups do not help the height.. only your genetics to grow
P1CSaXheaa	If it happens again without any reason i.e your upset about something than I wouldn't down play it. Go see your primary care Doc. let him decide. You may need him to refer you to a neurologist also for further evaluation. The last thing you wanna do is fill yourself up with OTC drugs. But if it is an isolated incident than i hope whatever made u cry is better now.|`|h6YdTiyUaa	Well a classical migraine involves an aura in one eye, pain on the opposite side of the head, and then usually nausea and vomiting until you fall asleep...you might just have a really bad headache but if it persists then you might want to go see a doctor...
YpN50jFDaa	I think that the easiest and quickest way to see if the flowers are affecting your sleeping habits would be to remove the flowers from your room and see if you are able to sleep.  In the event that you are, in fact able to sleep AFTER the flowers have been taken out of your room...it might be safe to assume that they were the cause of your sleep disturbance.  If you aren't able to sleep without the flowers there, perhaps there is another reason for what you are feeling
oiNkygNtaa	if your asking if it will kill him no it will not, it is a good thing that he is vomiting (his body is trying to get rid of the pills) the only thing that it will do is make him feel sleepy, dizzy, it may make his heart race a little (depending on body weight) and it could make it a little hard to breath. normally when an overdose occurs they urge the person not to go to sleep, cause if enough is taken they could go into a coma and die but this will not be something you have to worry about cause no matter what his weight is i assure you he didn't take enough pills for that to happen (15 is more the amount that would cause that problem)|`|AA11280073	Call 911. The sooner he gets treatment the less the damage to him will be.|`|B66jynMzaa	Take him to the emergency room NOW!!!  He'll probably need to get his stomach pumped...

Is that because of the way you behave towards them? Maybe you're imagining it cos you have some issue with women from your past? Or because you have low self-esteem? Either way, only a therapist of some kind can help you to make sense of it.|`|AA11280073	You need therapy.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Mix honey and freshly minced raw garlic together and take a throughout the day a spoonful at a time. The garlic is a anti-viral, antibiotic and anti-fungal.

IvZo21kEaa	Very rarely it is possible to be aware of seizures. I suggest going to the doctor.

I've had seizures before, generally when I haven't eaten much or just eat junk food with very few nutrients over several days.<br>  Feels like:<br>  entire body gets sweaty/clammy.<br>  hearing a sound like steam that gets louder and louder.<br>  vision starts to go, then everything shuts down. <br>  <br>  It's been maybe ten years since my last episode, but you never forget that feeling.<br>  Note to all reading: IF YOU START TO FEEL LIKE ABOVE, LAY DOWN IMMEDIATELY AND TAKE SLOW DEEP BREATHS.<br>  See a doctor, if you can.

Your genes will decide everything. Find out the height of your grandparents. A lot of the time genes will skip a generation. As for when a growth spurt will happen, don't be expecting a huge ins crease in height, you grow slowly over time and can get 1-2 inches taller per year at most usually. Just wait, that is all you can do. Height is not a very important thing. Hope that you will either be short or really tall, you get too tall and you are just like everyone else. People tend to like and remember the people who are a little bit different.|`|BpQsurXhaa	what you eat, and your relatives really have nothing to do with how tall you will be.

You MUST watch your diet -- NO SUGARS (colas, sports drinks, energy drinks, processed fruit juices, canned fruits, cookies, candies, cakes pies).  You must REDUCE the amount of starches you e at (breads, crackers, pastas, rice, corn, potatoes).

8260dca222ad20609347892ad4629cdeaa	Drink it in moderation unless you have a very hardy constitution. It's powerful stuff but I see that you have noticed that, huh! I think once a day  should be ok but don't brew it too long as it becomes quite strong. When it's brewed too dark & strong our family has found that it causes diareah and stomach distress.Don't buy that crap by Arizona company in the bottle. Make your own tea this way you can find a brew thats best for your individual body type. We like Bigelow peach green tea with a bit of  honey. I have found most teas too be to powerful on the kidneys so I'll also drink two cups of water to cup of tea or coffee just to be on the safe side.This makes it easier for your body to eliminate what it doesn't need from the tea.|`|NFyQWFoGaa	I believe they recommend one at breakfast is best, and if you want, one after dinner/before bed.|`|MJMZF5LEaa	1 cup in the morning per day should suffice

Luckily, he took a plea bargain and I didn't have to testify.  It takes a very strong person to be able to do that.  Just try to remind yourself that you are doing the right thing, and you're stopping him from hurting someone else.  You can do it if you've come this far already, you don't have much more to go...it's almost over.  Good luck!|`|cRdeb0T1aa	I suggest you ask if it's possible for you to testify remotely, or without them in the room.  They can use the reasoning of the damage it will cause you emotionally to face your abusers.  It is possible not to make you be in the room with them, but instead, only their lawyers.|`|pIqDeiUqaa	ive been through a similar problem. trust the fact that everything will eventually be okay, because it truly will. yeah, you'll be nervous during court and councilling, but theres no way to stop that. just accept the situation, once you do that  you will slowely heal yourself<br>  time heals everyything :] <br>  hope i helped!|`|vqtpF1Q5aa	I am sorry you have experienced this in your life.<br>  I too was raped and I was 12 but it was a neighborhood boy....<br>  <br>  With it being so close to the trial date my suggestion is you get IN with a counselor as soon as possible. Maybe the one over the phone session will help for them to see that you really need to physically face to face talk to someone.............There are anxiety medications that can help you as well that you won't necessarily have to take for the rest of your life but it certainly will help to calm your nerves through this process....<br>  <br>  There are 2 short acting ones - Klonopin that usually lasts 6 hours for someone in their system and also Xanax which lasts about 4 hours. It will calm your nerves and help bring your anxiety inside of your body down so you don't have the shakes or the nausea that you will experience up on the stand.<br>  <br>  Please tell whom ever you speak to and or a lawyer you are working with about this and tell them that you are seriously scared about this entire process.....**Hopefully** they can get you in to be seen so they can get you some medication to get through this. It IS going to be extremely difficult for you and seeing someone for talking this out and or getting medication is VERY important -- and very important to do -- now....<br>  <br>  -- I wish you all the best through this it's going to be hard but you are a strong person for going through it in the first place -- always remember that you are doing the right thing......

It'll be hard but they can support you. And help you figure out  and stop cutting. It'll be with you forever scars never fade.|`|tdqD9DcSaa	Some friendly words of advice is that if you think telling your parents would be scary, try having them find out on there own. My parents went off the deep end and started yelling at me but latter it turned to why didn't you come and tell us. In the process they ripped my room apart looking for razors and made my stay in there eye sight at all possible times for the next week including sleeping in the living room. Unfortunately, when they found out I was cutting I was 15 or 16, but the sad truth was that I started self-injuring when I was 4. From the day I started I can tell you that it will only get worse and worse. You start off in control but as you go along you lose your control and something bad may happen (also speaking from see experience). Best thing you can do right now is tell your parents because it has been 2 years over due anyways. Also try not to cut your wrist because of the fact that legs are easier to hid scars then hiding your wrist plus some people my get the wrong impression that you are suicidal or attempted suicide. Good Luck!|`|OUbNSXjJaa	O! God! Hurry. Tell them. Tell through your mouth, use your tongue and words.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	The first person to tell is the person you trust the most, then you talk to your doctor.

I cut my arms for a year and would hide under long sleeve shirts. Eventually my parents saw the scars and cuts. They sat down with me and talked about it and they took it well. I would recommend that you either sit down and explain why you do it and how it makes you feel, or stop hiding your arms at home and it will eventually come up. There's a good chance your parents already know and don't know how to deal with it. There's also a good chance they will take you to a professional counselor or psychologist to help you reduce the urge to cut. ( Trust me... it's worth it in order to be free).<br>  <br>  Best of Luck :)|`|qQrsi8koaa	After that long, I'm sure its just as much an addiction as a coping behavior. If you have a good relationship with your parents, just sit them down and tell them that you need to talk to them. They will not take it will, but if they love you, they will come around and try their best to help you. If you dont have a good relationship with them, I would recommend talking to a school guidance counselor or even a teacher.|`|cCXGEZxaaa	If you can't tell them just be careless with what you wear.

WoI3Hichaa	Well, masturbation will remove testosterone from the body, so it is actually bad. You need that testosterone to get all your hair. If you can't resist then don't, you will get your hair eventually, and besides, everyone besides the owner of the hair thinks it is gross. So don't be all bummed out about not having a hairy chest, because a hairy nasty back and butt hole is soon to follow.

Everything will be fine. I know that you feel really depressed and hopeless and it probably feels like things will never get better. but they will. I know how you feel. I am very depressed too, but there is so much to live for out there, you don't want to die yet. Your so young, you have so much ahead of you. I would talk to your parents about how you feel, maybe they could get you into counseling or something. Your not crazy, and people won't think that just because you are depressed and need to talk to someone. Actually talking to a counselor isn't really that bad. Its nice cuz you can tell them whatever you want and get out all your feelings. and they don't judge you. Im thinking of doing that soon, start talking to someone. Life is very hard sometimes, but you gotta try to make the best of it, and do things in life that make you happy. If you want also, you could give your phone to your parents for a little while, if you don't want it around, you probably don't want to break it though, you may want it back someday when you feel better. If you think u may be pregnant also, take a test soon to find out for sure. and don't let guys use you anymore. Im sure you are a  great, wonderful person and you don't deserve that. good luck hon. Everything will work out.|`|KyAjmaOyaa	I'm sorry to hear your story, but I am going to help you solve this problem. There has to be a cause for such suffering to occur, and everyone has difficulties in suffering problems similar to your own.<br>  While I was at a younger age, I felt the same way as you. I had no friends, everyone did not like me, and I was lonely... I wanted to do the same, but I found God. My life turned around like a miracle and I did have friends and everyone did like me. I know you may not like my answer, but I want you to start going to Church and I promise you will start feeling better. In time, you will know what I am talking about.<br>  Go to church every sunday and have confessions... maybe having a lack of faith is causing all this suffering?.. It is quite possible since I have been in the same situation. You are right about your parents, they really are the best people in your life. If you have any problems, don't be afraid to go to them, because they have gone through pretty much the same things in life. They can give you advice based on the experiences and thoughts they have had. I suspect you are in school?<br>  This is the most important part of life.. your education. Don't let other people ruin your dream in life. Stand up tall and avoid distractions. You are not a loser, people who try to bring you down are losers.<br>  You shouldn't break your phone, just keep it aside or just use for emergencies. I will pray for you friend!.. God Bless.|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	Hey there. I'm really sorry about your situation...sounds like you're stuck in the gutter. Listen, first of all, it's great that you have your parents to count on. And that you have a good relationship with them.  That's a big step in the right direction...because your parents are the ones that can help you the most. Second of all, you're not a loser. No matter how "low" you think you are, there are many other people in your same exact position. So don't worry, you're not alone. Okay so... This guy sounds like an a**hole. If he treated you bad then move on, he doesn't deserve you anyway. Yeah, I don't blame you for being mad at him (and your best friend.) They shouldn't be talking behind your back. THEY are losers, not you. Try to move on, you don't need those negative people bringing you down. <br>  <br>  Okay listen, if it makes you feel better to break your phone, go for it. If you really want to, then you honestly should. Just break it and let all your anger/frustration go out the window. Trust me, your life is much more important than a stupid phone. And the same applies to the Facebook. Get rid of it if it's causing too much drama in your life. And if you're pregnant...try not to freak out. (It's a big decision to make, but either way, you'll be fine.) Good luck and best wishes! :)|`|e3AvZLZWaa	Don't worry about the "i want to die thing". I often feel like that too, but not for the same reason as you. I have 2 best friends whom i love very much but I get irritated and angry very quickly. Sometimes I feel so guilty because i direct my bottled up anger towards them and others. <br>  Do what I do: write poems or songs. They help express my feelings and i post them on the internet too (mibba.com)|`|Y7q0UyWPaa	I would go see a doctor! Get anti-depressant pills. And talk to your parents about it.
1aJjFrUCaa	some ppl are born with STD's. and you have them and dont even no it.<br>  you can also get std's by fingering or oral.|`|GiYVrmI3aa	If you give someone oral or they finger you and they have something you can get it from them.|`|OleVPkJgaa	if you have oral sex, then yes you can get an std.|`|IKakoOfyaa	Yes, there are STDs that can be transmitted without vaginal penetration, such as herpes.|`|pbPe614Raa	only if you were born with an std as a child,otherwise its impossible.<br>  <br>  but for oral sex its possible to get stds.|`|FxLKs5Vbaa	Yes. skin to skin contact, oral sex, ect

7HxJvbjMaa	Apple cider vinegar, Blackstrap mollasses, and ginger.<br>  Go to earthclinic.com for some fantastic holistic cures.<br>  Also, it hurts more at night because you don't have the distractions of the day to take your mind off it. It's just you and your thoughts so every pain will be magnified.|`|ixOE0onnaa	it spreads more each night.|`|8260dca222ad20609347892ad4629cdeaa	I hear ya about it hurting worse at night and early in the morning too. My advice is to be aware of your diet first. Try and minimize all foods from the nightshade family such as potatoes, peppers and tomatoes.Theres a chemical in them called solanine and it can make arthritis feel much worse.Some people have found citrus and acid fruits to make arthritis worse also.Red meat can sometimes aggravate symptoms more and that might be because of the hormones and acid in the protein.You might want to buy a cheap notbook and keep a food diary for a month or so. Write what your eating down and how you feel after wards. You'll probably be surprised at what patterns are established and with certain foods. Theres a an am radio show called " Duke and the Doctor". See if you can find it as it's nationally syndicated.These two are geniuses when it comes to healthy supplements and advice for medical conditions.You might want to incorporate some alternative health care into your plan to deal with this condition.Acupuncture and food allergy testing would be a huge help, if you can only do one get the acupuncture.A good traditional Chinese medicine doctor will also have herbs that you can take  to balance your body and make the pain lessen.Some people have found gentle massage and spirtitually gentle  styles of  massage such as Reiki to be helpful with aches and pains.Make sure that you are wearing either gel insoles or really good support shoes.Your body needs all the support that it can get starting with your feet.I bought a pair of 55 dollar Nikes with a bouncy sole and added a pair of gel inserts and my leg & foot pain virtually vanished.Theres no one simple answer but theres a ton of things that you can do including fish oil capsulesI found that they made my hair too oily and did nothing for my stiffness but others swear by them. Hope this helps. Good luck!|`|9lbJBwM9aa	Doctors and experts have suggested perfect answers to face this problem…check it out here…
yKJt455Baa	lotion, chapstick, Vick's might work, and cut ointment.<br>  <br>  But I think this is because of your allergies, so either blow your nose more(don't sniff it back in) or buy another brand of tissues. If you can't afford more then use a hand towels (moist), but make sure to wash it.|`|DO2CHqvXaa	Use face lotion.<br>  Or even better for noses, Vaseline
vEGkSHMsaa	I dont think it would make that big of a difference. If it makes you nauseous, take it with something else. Mix it with your protein shake as soon as your finished working out. You wont even know its in there + thats the best time to take it.|`|AA11331783	Creatine is best used as a pre-load so it does not matter how fast you drink it just that you have finished it at least thirty minutes before your workout but you also do not want to wait much longer than an hour to begin your workout.  What would probably work best is to drink the creatine at a slower pace but not to wait the full hour to begin your workout.|`|whPDfaiEaa	It is a possibility to lose weight quickly but you should be realistic and comprehend that if you lose weight fast then you will inevitably put it all back on again just as fast. The sole diet which clearly worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away thrity pounds, it clearly does produce success!
BRDqfAy3aa	see below - First Time Sex - Safer Sex - Dual Contraception|`|mnkZ6VS9aa	No, but it's recommended. Condoms aren't 100% effective, and neither are other forms of birth control - but its always a good idea to use at least two methods total to be safe. :)|`|VDg4R7SIaa	No you don't have to but it would be good in case the condom breaks. they are not 100% effective.|`|h1e6TvFpaa	you dont have top bacause they are both used to prevent perggercy but condums are pron to leak maybe|`|giBfNMX6aa	Well, it's a good idea, as condoms have been known to break or leak.|`|t8gYx9LIaa	No you dont have to be, though its a safer way not to get pregnant.
losqMUiGaa	Okay first of all it takes about 30 days to get weed out of your system.  I used to be a habitual smoker and would have to take piss test.  I have found that you can go to head shops and ask for the best body toxin remover.  Some of them are not cheap.  I have done the tabs and the liquid.  I actually preferred the liquid but it had to be cold.  You have to follow the directions to the letter or you have a chance of messing up the results.  Some of the toxin removers have a money back guarantee.  You just give them the failed test and the receipt and they will refund your money.  I know that won't help with your job but at least you get your money back.|`|RHOiO24Gaa	If you are not going to stop doing drugs then you get what your deserve. Have a nice and stupid life,idiot.|`|85gJHDbNaa	I have no idea where you heard that weed leaves your system in 3 days. It takes about a month. If you're that worried about it, you can<br>  a) stop smoking<br>  b) buy a whizzinator from ebay<br>  c) do a complete detox (THIS IS UNRELIABLE however it can work in some situations)<br>  This would involve drinking so many fluids your penis is glued to the toilet, mostly herbal teas and detox teas you can buy at an organic market, and staying as far away from marijuana smoke as possible.|`|c9fd9858a55bd84164a363314546a804aa	i don't have a specific annswer but you could read some toxicology books/ websites and methods of detection. read forensic toxicology methods because drugs are metabolised by body and tests usually look for the metabolites but the level (concentration of these) is lowered by time so eventually will not be detectable apart from a hair sample which is not usually used. so look around and maybe reconsider your drug use.|`|41J8D3A4aa	I had a friends that did this once and she drank ALOT of water. It helped. If not get someone elses pee.
OUbNSXjJaa	You should recover on your own. See how other failures are handling. Have self motivation. Gain confidence. Next time you will be able to do better. Do hard work and study well.
eXiSIaQcaa	yeah herpes and if you give oral you can give genital herpes to Your partner then when you have intercourse  you will get genital herpes as well!!!|`|pbPe614Raa	only herpes which are curable of course|`|24T71hYjaa	yes.|`|pnMjJ3s1aa	he%$ yeah its sexually|`|OMYd6p3gaa	You could get herpes (like cold sores)<br>  <br>  But thats about it.|`|ksFuO9Xsaa	umm no
mnkZ6VS9aa	That's normal. I'm not exactly sure why your period starts/ends with brown blood, but it happens to me, too.|`|oJAu1T8caa	Yes, its normal. It happens at the end because its old blood. It happens to probably every woman .|`|u6BNPURKaa	Coagulation. The blood thickens and loses oxygen. The oxygen in blood when it is fresh, is what makes it red. So probably the little bit of blood from the last period that didnt make it all the way out... the fresh blood.. then the blood stops flowing, but still  has to finish coming out.<br>  <br>  This is my guess.
T77593TLaa	It depends on which type of diabetes your dad has. If he has to give himself insulin, they have an insulin pump that you dont have to poke and check every time. If he doesnt have to give insulin, I dont think I have ever seen anything that allows him to check his blood without a needle|`|R3yUkaCSaa	put the needle on a lower setting so it doesnt go as far into yourfinger.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	No, you have to do blood testing, but you can use a site that hurts less.  Use sides of the fingers not the front, and if the glucometer allows for forearm testing, that barely hurts at all!
UOZP4Ma5aa	No it would be number 7
AA11476749	Men who over use porn tend to be less satisfied with their real partner.  Lay off the porn for a while, and you'll find it's back to normal.<br>  <br>  An excerpt:<br>  <br>  Other causes of erectile failure<br>  <br>  Arousal has two components - physical and mental. As men get older, they require more physical stimulation for their penis to get hard. But some men learn early on in life to rely mostly on mental fantasy and stimulation to get horny - for example, watching porn, or watching their partner undressing, or thinking about what they'd like to do to whom: and this can become a problem later in life as they become more and more detached from their bodies as a source of arousal.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Erections are caused by brain activity which can be affected by stress or anxiety, chill, relax, don't worry and you will be hard.<br>  Worrying about it will just make it worse!|`|sHTaKbexaa	Mike ur a meanie.

You will need to be patient but you will need to leave the artificial nails off. If your nails are inflamed then you need to go see a doctor.

IYJkaQvIaa	While most cases of acne are related to teenage hormonal changes, it is not uncommon for adults to have acne. These cases tend to occur in relation to menstrual periods, pregnancy, birth control pills, food intolerance, certain pharmaceutical drugs, pollution and stress.<br>  <br>  Acne is caused by an infection of the propionibacterium in glands usually found in hair-covered areas of the face and upper body. An increased risk of infection can develop when pores become blocked and rupture from within creating inflammation.<br>  <br>  Conventional treatment often consists of aggressive prescription drugs and ointments that may have unpleasant side effects. As an alternative, clinical experience has shown that long-term treatment with specific nutritional supplements is very effective, safe and has no side effects.<br>  <br>  Nutrients that reduce the tendency of acne include: N-acetylcysteine, tocotrienols, alpha-lipoic acid, grape seed extract, chondroitin, vitamins C, E and B3, zinc, selenium and chromium.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	If you have an oily skin wash your face twice a day in warm salty water.
