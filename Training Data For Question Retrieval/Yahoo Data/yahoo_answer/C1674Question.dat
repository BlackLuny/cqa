This sounds weird, but its so small, so does it have highways and main roads? do people have cars on Malé? Does Malé have any land wildlife?   It really interests me, it looks facinateing, almost as if its going to sink into the ground if anything else gets build, i can imagine the whole island getting covered with water when big waves come or it rains, does it flood a lot in Malé??      I know i can google it, wikipedia it or yahoo it, but those answers aren't the same as first hand experiences of people that have lived in the city.

I have a website for students at my university to read and its extremely popular and i'm complimented on it all the time. In 2008 it receved 59,000 hits, which i was proud of considering i do it on my own. The format is similar to askmen.com, which gives you an idea of my writing style.   So does anyone have any suggestions or advice on how to possibly go about achieving this dream? Something in the back of my mind tells me that i have to take a chance and live life instead of just taking the easy way out and becoming a boring,rich lawyer (like my dad). Thanks for reading!

20090130184410AAmUs5W	Travel;Asia Pacific;China	Would i pass a mandarin test even tho i have an accent (sichuan accent)?	when i speak ch almost always = c and sh always = s. the only word where i pronounce ch as ch is taichi. also on the syllables zhi, zhen, and zhou i prounce zi zen and zou. also for some words like lian, lan, and lao ( lao ONLY as in lao that means old) = n and nuo mi as in stiky rice is luo. i am not that heavily accented its def noticable if  have a full lenght convo with some1 and if i speek a sentance most of the time its harder to find my accent. its understandable tho. the reason why i ask htis is because i heard there is a test that u must pass by2010 of your mandarin skills and VERY HEAVY accented ppl could lose marks on the test. the test is so you can communicate with pppl who dont speek ur dialect. i dont consider me a heavy accented mandarin speeker just lightly.

20090130182318AAHGsd4	Travel;Caribbean;Bahamas	Has anyone used www.bahamagetaways.net ?	My fiance and I won 4 nights at the Bell Channel Inn in the Bahamas from a drawing we entered. Has anyone ever stayed there? It looks nice, and quiet. Their regular rate is only $85 per night. They also offer a cruise to and from the Bahamas from Ft. Lauderdale for only $100 per person, and you are able to use your hotel vouchers for your stay on the island. If you do not purchase the cruise, they require a $25 per night deposit for your hotel stay which is then refunded. They specifically state that we are required for all of our travel arrangements, port taxes, etc. Is this a legit offer?
