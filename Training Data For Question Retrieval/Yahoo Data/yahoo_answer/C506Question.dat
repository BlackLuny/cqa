20090220170228AAZFxq2	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	What is wrong with my throat?	Ok, it all started two weeks ago when I had a fever of 103 and it lasted for a couple days. A couple days after that I started developing a sore throat, which I have had since. It's been about a week now but it is getting unbearably painful. I went to the doctor's a couple days ago, they did a strep test, which tested negative and she thought I might have Tonsillitis. I was prescribed a 5 day pack of Azithromycin. It is the third day and it hasn't really helped at all. The soreness isn't really where you can see it, it's way deeper in the throat and when I swallow water or any fluid, it stings and almost feels like I have blisters. I even drank NyQuil and it felt like I was putting salt in a wound or something. I'm not sure if it is an ear infection or anything because I noticed a pain today in my ears that's more obvious. If anyone might know what's going on, please let me know. Thank you so much.

20090220173031AAlQsL2	Health;Mental Health	Do you think it's possible to never get over somebody?	I've liked this guy for more than 5 years before my "friend" told the guy. (I know I was stupid for telling her). She completely denied spreading rumours ever and even joked about it in public. I felt completely embarassed because I had tried to flirt with him on one occasion, even though he was soo out of my league. We did actually used to be friends when I first met him (but he became friends with the "cool" people a few years back). I'd go red and sweaty whenever I thought about it.   It didn't help that my swim coach would tease me about it: "I know a lot more than you think I know!" - she would say if I wasn't paying attention in her sessions. I kept thinking I would never be good enough for this guy (he's a straight A student as well as by far the best looking guy in any room and he knew it). After being depressed for so long I was introduced to his ex-girlfriend of 8 months (she was friends with a male friend of mine) and I couldn't believe my crush actually used to be with her.

20090220171837AAZUbxi	Health;Diet & Fitness	I want to lose weight but I don't know how much I should lose to be healthy at the same time as looking good?	Okay, so I want to lose weight for all the really superficial reasons; to look good, feel hot, etc etc. It's only partially about being healthy to me, what I really want is to look HOT because I've struggled with self esteem all my life and I'm sick of it.      I'm 5'5", and weigh 63 kilos which is about 128 pounds. Yes, I've been told I'm in a good weight range but it's the way I look that I have a problem with because I have at least five pounds that I'm willing to donate.      What I'm asking is, should I aim to lose ten pounds or twenty?      I know I could lose ten and then see if I want to lose ten more but I want to know wat YOU think.

20090220171659AARNqXE	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Getting dizzy from water?	I'm 18 and I began to notice that I'm starting to get dizzy after drinking water now.      See, a few weeks ago I went to the doctor because I had stomach aches. After a test, the doctor revealed that I had a bladder infection and that I was dehydrated so along with the pills, she recommended that I drink water.  So after two weeks, the infection healed and I began drinking more water (maybe a bottle or two a day during different times) but recently, when I drink water via it be from a dispenser (those gallon dispenser thingies you have to fill up) or store bought water, I begin to get dizzy.  Last night I drank some bottled water and I got so dizzy I had to lie down (it could have also been because I was working on a school project in the dark).      When I drink water, I drink it slow. I drink it between meals sometimes, during meals, I have a sip here, a sip there.  A while ago, I also cut off junk food and soda from my diet (I ate a lot of junk food when I was younger and soda was like water to me) but it's been months and I feel great without them.        I tried looking for an answer online but the only thing I found was 'water intoxication' which I doubt I have because I don't get nauseated, get body aches or anything like that.  I don't have any prior ear infections and am not prone to them.  I walk almost every day (and jump a fence) because I'm a college student with no car but I would like a simple explanation for it.  Before this, I never really drank water. I use to drink a lot of soda, tea, milk, anything that wasn't water.  Could it be my body is adjusting to actually being hydrated for once? Or is there something in the water that's making me off? When I drink other things I feel fine, it's just water.  I think this has been going on for two weeks?      Thank you!

I've already had 6 teeth bonded where the gums are receding around them.  It's painful and I don't know what to do!!  I've gone to the dentist and he's just like "we can either bond or do skin grafts" and he doesn't tell me what the problem is.  Is it genetic, because my 28 year old brother has the same thing, but my parents don't.  Is it from brushing teeth too much or too hard?  Is it something to do with chewing gum all the time or the types of food I eat?  Please help!  I don't want to have to get my teeth bonded again or start getting skin grafts!  I brush my teeth usually 3 times a day.  I floss and use ACT mouthwash every night.  I chew sugarless gum all the time.  But I still get cavities and I still get receding gums.  I am scared of losing my teeth!

After she gave birth to her first (girl), her tummy went back to normal. When her daughter was about 3, her tummy started "blowing up" as if she was 6 months pregnant. The doctors didn't find anything abnormal(!!?) and said it was probably psychological, since she wanted a second child. Then she did get pregnant and had her son. Now he is one year old, and she still has her tummy as if she didn't give birth ! Her doc says "everything is fine" and she should just do crunches !!?!?!! They don't have much money and I think her doc is really lousy and doesn't care less. How can he say everything is fine when her stomach is round as a balloon ??? Are there any doctors / nurses or anyone who can help or have heard of this before?

20070417072828AAmkokJ	Health;Diet & Fitness	Suggestions for websites/books of Yoga routines that increase control, flexibility, and toning?	I’m trying to get fit after several years of being a potato. I’m dieting & having lots of success, but now I want to tackle my overall fitness. Some of the areas I want to target are my flexibility, strength, toning, and muscle control, which are all embarrassingly awful, due to breaking bones in my back a few years ago and not completing PT. I'm looking to ease myself into a toning, strength, muscle control, and flexibility routine that is low-impact, so I’m thinking Yoga.       Of course, we have no Yoga classes closer than 1 hr away, so I’m on my own. I was hoping somebody could suggest a book or website, (no videos or DVDs!) of several great Yoga routines that focus on strength, control, flexibility, and toning that is good for beginners, but allow for further development. I’m already doing the Sun Salutation, and I’d like to add to that, to create a daily routine that lasts at least 30 min.       Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

I'm 5'4" and 115 pounds....I am always thinking "if I could only lose 10 pounds, 7 pounds, etc.."  I hate my body; I think my thighs and knees and stomach and pretty much EVERYTHING is fat.  Then I thought "maybe I just need to tone up...then I'll feel better about my body", so I started running on the treadmill every day...THEN I blew my knee out doing that, and I couldn't exercise for a week and gained back the 3 pounds I had lost.  Now I'm doing the elliptical machine (which I HATE, but it's better than nothing), and I'm trying to eat like 1200 calories per day.  I just feel like I will never be thin like I want to be....I feel like I will always feel fat and be ashamed of my body.  I eat nothing but low-calorie healthy foods, I exercise 6 days a week, but my fat thighs are always always always there, every time I look down.  What should I do?  I want to be really thin, but I don't want to starve myself because I know that I will just be "skinny fat" if I do that.

Once in a while I get these dreams where it feels like something bad is visiting me. Sometimes it makes me float around the room against my will. Sometimes it makes me very disoriented and afraid..like I'll be in my house (in my dream) and I don't recognize it..or I'll leave one room and appear in another room at the opposite end of the house. What ever this thing is (most likely my imagination) it definitely feels like it's toying with me..everytime I have a dream where I feel its presence I try hard to wake up, and everytime it makes me think I've woken up (several times in a row sometimes) and will keep making weird stuff happen. I never had nightmares as a child, and these dreams feel SO real, I can't explain it..I always can tell when I'm dreaming except when I dream these type of dreams. Has anyone had a similar experience? I mean I'm too old to be having nightmares, I'm in my 20's. Does anyone know what could be happening to me? The dreams make me VERY paranoid..   well thanks...

This is a far cry from when I was in my early 20's and even a year ago. We (me and my wife) used to go at it a min of 3 times a week and I would masterbate almost daily. What would cause this loss of drive. My wife is begining to think I don't love her or want her becuse I don't want sex very often.       A little information about my enviroment, I recently started a new job (6 mo) that comparied to my last job is very inactive, I sit most of the day and have gained a few pounds. My new job is also a little more streesful then my last job. My wife is also 6 mo pregnant (and still just as beautiful), but could the added stress of having another child be causing this. I believe it's related to the added stress but what do you have to say?

20070725103908AAWm1Ah	Health;Mental Health	Ou dois-je m'adresser pour apporter de l'aide à ma voisine qui est en difficulté?	Une jeune femme habite l'appartement en dessous du mien, je la connais très peu et un soir vers 23h elle a frappé à ma porte pour me demander de garder son chat, car selon ses dires elle n'était pas apte à s'en occuper présentement . Elle m'a semblée très perturbée. Elle est revenu cherché son chat 4jours plus tard, elle était méconnaissable et fortement incohérente, elle m'a dit qu'elle prendrait ses médicaments et que cela irait.  Deux jours plus tard je l'ai vue qui fouillait les ordures à la recherche de nourriture, j'ai attendu un peu et je suis descendue pour lui parler, elle m'a avoué que cela faisait 6 jours qu'elle n'avait pas mangé. Je lui ai donné de l'argent et des cigarettes, elle ne cessait de me dire merci, elle a voulu se diriger vers un dep. au coin de la rue mais elle est tombée tellement elle était faible. Je lui ai apporter de la nourriture et je lui ai tenue compagnie un petit moment, elle dévorait tout.   Cette jeune femme est malade et n'a personne pour l'aider.
20070725142221AARGMr0	Health;Diet & Fitness	Est-ce-que le riz est incompatible avec le poisson?	Du moins est-ce un mauvais mélange?   Car j'ai lu de nbreuses fois que les céréales et les protéines étaient une mauvaise association.    [Déjà je trouve ?a assez bizarre pcq on entend aussi tout le temps que céréales + protéines végétales (légumineuses...) est une très bonne association].   Je n'en a pas lu plus, mais je crois que le problème serait (?) que la viande (j'en mange pas) ou le poisson ne doivent pas rester trop longtemps à être digérées sinon il y a des fermentations nuisibles. Alors que c'est le contraire pour les céréales c'est bien qu'elles soient digérées longtemps.   Il vaudrait donc mieux manger du poisson avec seulement des légumes cuits?   En fait j'ai l'habitude de mettre dans un poêle huile+ poisson+ p-de-terre+ chou (ou oignon)+ courgette+ herbes+ un peu de fromage parfois ou un oeuf etc...(tout bio). Mais je voudrais remplacer les pdt par du riz si possible pcq je crois q le riz est un meilleur aliment et l'indice glycémique des pdt n'est pas terrible à ce qu'il semble.

I lost 26 pounds in five months, and currently weigh 107 pounds. Despite this progress, I am concerned. I am not loosing much weight anymore, if not, none at all. I fear that my metabolism has adapted to my diet and I will have to stick to this diet just to maintain my weight. This is very disconcerting because even though I have changed my eating habits, I still don't want to remain on such a strict diet forever. I don't know what I should do. I have seen a doctor and he says I am healthy. I plan to get a membership at the ymca to develop strength, but I don't know what I am going to do about my diet. I want to weigh 103 or so. How can I achieve this weight and later get off my diet?

20090203082219AAEOrZj	Health;Women's Health	I stop breathing in my sleep- wake up gasping- 36 weeks pregnant?	I don't know what to do about this anymore. I see the OB/GYN in 2 days so I'm going to talk to her, I just wanted to know if anybody had any perspective.     I stop breathing in my sleep. The reason is that my nose is constantly plugged due to being pregnant (OB/GYN says this happens sometimes.) I have a very hard time breathing through my nose during the day, and at night it's completely plugged so I have to breathe through my mouth. I sleep on my side and I will wake up GASPING for breath. It feels like my throat just fell closed. I literally just gulp in the air because I feel like I've been holding my breath or like I've been suffocated. This can happen 10 to 20 times a night. Add to that getting up 5x a night to pee, my husband's chronic snoring, the cat meowing, and sciatica- I'm having a really rough time here. I woke up this morning just bawling for no reason- I think because it's been weeks of bad sleep and my body has had enough.     What can I do?    Thanks

I used to have actuall spots but now, the treatments have took all the spots away and im just left with loads of red marks and a couple of little pin hole. I have a smooth face but the red marks are there. I know the red marks will eventually go but im worried about the little pin holes. Will they go becuase the doctor said they are on top of my skin so they will go. Also im 15 so ill get facial hair soon so will that cover them up IF i end up getting scared a bit?

Last night in the ER, I had the most miserable experience(they put a catheter up my penis up to the bladder). Now it feels like I can urinate, but whenever I try, I get extreme pain on the tip of the penis where the catheter was resting.

20090203084050AADcN0l	Health;Diet & Fitness	Can anyone recommend a good diet and work out plan?	I am looking for a very genral diet / workout plan  that maybe gives me a couple options, so I am not doing the same thing every day. As far as a work out plan, it can be as vague as just indicating how much cardio, or how much weight training to do (no so much as specific excercises).  If you have any specific recipes or exercises I'd be happy to try them.      I am not really trying to lose weight, but more tone and strengthen, maybe just lose a little belly flab but thats it, and also looking for an over all healthy diet that is on the lower side on calories and sugar.    Also, something that is easy to prepare for the fulltime student.       thanks.

20090203083800AAv6nUC	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	What are the chances of cancer recurrence?	I was diagnosed last year with Low grade Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of the salivary gland.  It was in an unusual place though, located on the pallet of my mouth.  I had oral surgery to remove the pallet and the margins were clear.  Now that my mouth has healed quite drastically (leaving only a small fistula) and is somewhat normal I noticed that another growth has reappeared.  I am just curious, what are the chances, with it being low grade and all, of recurrence.

I am a 27 and have over the last year been experiencing really bad pains in my knees but I've tried to ignore it.  Last year October I went to doctors and I went for blood tests and there was nothing wrong.  My doctor offered to prescribe me antiinflammatory tablets but I wanted to try something unprescribed first so she advised me to take glucosamine and chondrition which I have been for just over three months but there's been no change.  I'm going back to doctors next week and have very little faith in her to be honest.  Is there anything anyone on here can advise apart from changing my doctor.
