First off im 19 and live with my gf of a 11/2 yr.  Lately its been hard for me to keep a job because  I get a lil lazy from time to time or loose my job . Recently my family has moved away and I am left her with my gf and her family. Living with them is decent but it aint the best. I want to go to college but im kinda not sure if I can with my current situation. Im considering joining the navy but im not sure if thats the right move for me. My gf wants to move out because she's fed up with living at home, I want to go to college but don't think ill be able to afford it tryna move out, pay for school, and my expensive car payment (500$ pe month). My plan is to join the navy to get away from everything and be self reliant. I feel like I always gotta depend on somebody to get by. I wanna be a man but I gotta admit...Its getting hard. Any advice could help what should I do. Go to the navy or start working and going to school in the civilian world? Housing is becoming a problem too

Prima avevamo una moneta debole e la gente acquistava in italia perche' comprava di piu' causa cambio favorevole ora non ci comprano quasi nulla perche' sono prodotti costosi (e fatti quasi sempre in cina), resto sempre piu' convinto che ci dovevamo tenere le lire.

I do not owe the debt they are claiming. I have disputed it many many times and it keeps getting validated. Not only that but the account was supposedly opened in 2004 (as per their statement) but just within the last few weeks was reported. They are claiming that experian is telling them not to use the opened date but the reported date. So now  I  have a very recent collection account on my report which is really screwing things up for me and I can't seem to get any help.      This is not my debt and it's only for $60.00 because it is not mine I really dont want to pay it BUT I don't know what else to do.      ANy thoughts?

I wrote to a few of the lenders who were supposedly referred by others here and I believe they are not real people who truly are looking to help.  I have a mortgage to pay which of course is very high and I barely make it every month and that was hard enough but now  my daughters son died this past month 7 days old.  Due to medical funeral ETC.  I am facing not having the funds to pay my mortgage on the 31st which is the latest and I cannot refinance until Ive held the loan for at least 6 months this will be my sixth payment.  I only needed this mortgage till my wrongful death lawsuit is settled the lawyers asked me to be patient so as to get the amount they felt I was entitled to so I took out the mortgage I planned to be able to repay as soon as the 1 year prepayment penalty was up but now I just don't know what to do. I need to at least make this payment asap for this months mortgage for them to consider the refinancing of my mortgage. IF anyone knows of either a company that will refinance me or an honest lender who is just an ordinary person when  I receive my settlement I am willing to return 100% of what Borrow plus equal the amount in other words double.      don't reply unless your an honest person.

It's a large one- 800 pages +   I want only 2-3 copies but I want it actually published, printed, hardcover, the whole shebang.

20090223005426AAOhd3i	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Financial Services	How should I handle these two at my job?	Guy #1-Asks about me through other people, for example,through my immediate co-worker George, and,through another manager-he asks"So how are you guys doing over there",he says that everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else for that matter.He's also called up to my job three times,blocking out his number, asking for my whereabouts and told my co-worker that he wanted to meet me, but he never showed.so i called him to chat, we talked for over two hours, and he Told me I can definetly call him anytime. And Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there which was weird   Guy#2   Mostly talks to me over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that, you'll get me in trouble". He Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me in person, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.The thing is that I've asked this guy if Guy #1 was single or married, so he knows that I sort of have a thing for Guy #1, because they are good friends.So when I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers, or he will not answer my text message.   So The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and he asked him, if he wanted to talk to me, so when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.so it was weird because hes married with kids, and he knows I like Guy #1...so I don't know if he has a thing for me, or Guy #1 does

I did not place the freeze, and was never aware of this taking place.   I've never needed or used credit until recently in January when I went to purchase a car.  My father co-signed for the loan, so I still got the car, I'm just not getting any credit for making the payments.      The 3 credit reporting bureaus all have the the same information on me, and all have the same time that the freeze was placed on my credit.   Of course, I have to have a 10 digit PIN number, which I do not have, and was never given.      I've tried all the phone numbers, and I absolutely cannot get on the line with a real person.    Please, if anyone has dealt with this, and/or has any information on how I can remove the freeze, please let me know.   Thanks

20090223001540AAAUVQa	Business & Finance;Credit	Not paying my Yellow Page bill...?	Ok, Im in Canada and I ran into a tough year and didn't pay my YP bill. It is around 11k and they have turned it over to a collection agency      One thing I was mad about is they slightly made a mistake, I told them to use one web address and they used the other one (essentially I was forwarding one site domain, to another - it went to the same destination, I just wanted a certain domain over the other)       Anyways, back to what I am saying, Im a sole proprietorship and owe them money I dont have. They haven't reported it to the bureau yet - but fear they might. I have been taken to a collection agency before for something which I did not pay (because I felt I was ripped off) and it was only for $500. Its been two years and never was reported, I was called and mailed, but that was it - I never responded and it never went to my credit report.      Can they report to my credit bureau if its not paid - afterall, this isn't money I borrowed, it was a service with a business. To boot, I dont have the contract that I signed handy, seems to get lost when I moved.      I could try to get them to set a payment plan - what kind of payment plan could I set up with them....ie. how many months etc....      What could happen IF they sue me IF I wasn't to pay...      Remember, this is Canada - not sure if it is the same 'laws' etc in USA

I was fired a week ago for poor performance reasons I was given a failing    grade on my review or more like a D-. After my review was given to me   he asked me if I had any questions or concerns and I said no. I should   of defended myself but I didn't. Then the DM informed me that I was being   let go for poor performance reasons. I never argued the termination or asked if there was anything I could do to change his mind. I just accepted it. Then my manager said "If you loved working here then maybe we can save your job."  I told him I did not love working at his   company. And so I turned in my keys and I left. Did my boss try to give me another chance to keep working for him. The truth is I did not   enjoy working for the company mainly due to personal difference with   some of the staff. I thought they were immature. They swore at work made crude sexual remarks about certain female employees and customers. And horseplay and at one time showing their privates in    the backroom to one another. I worked at a Hockey store by the way. I am also a manager and told my bosses about their behavior and they did nothing to them but fired me. I also did not know anything about hockey and I did not show any interest in my training. Do you think that they may ask for me to come back because of my managers comments. Thank You

20090223024059AAg3oxe	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	UK: Help with taking time off at work please?	Hello! I work in an office and I am planning to hand my four weeks notice on May 1st as I am off to join the Navy.       I was thinking of taking my holiday entitlement (not all of it but a fair chunk) between now and May just to have some time off. It really is an awful job but luckily it was only ever going to be temporary whilst I waiting for my Navy application to go through.      A friend told me recently, however, that if you take a certain % of your entitlement earlier in the year that this can effect your wages should you hand your notice in; holiday must be spread out over the whole 12 months.       Is there any truth to this? Thanks.

What are some "high yield" investment strategies?      I am not currently employed so I have some time to devote to this task. I would ideally like to create a snowball effect of earning on this $8000 and continue to make money investing rather than working a 9-5.      Any suggestions? please explain the strategy, its return on investment, and its risks.      Thank you.
20090223023848AAgopGQ	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	THE BANKS WERE BAILED OUT TO RECOVER THE LOST ASSETS?	If the banks were bailed out to recover the lost assets from non payment of mortgages lent to people who could not afford to pay back.   So in theory the banks will recover the assets from the people who get reposssesed, leaving that person out of pocket by perhaps thousands, and the lenders still getting there assets back through the property reposession. SO WHY BAIL THEM OUT is it just so the bankers can get their bonuses? Why not wait until they get there assets back. After all it was the banks that agree on the property value before they give the mortgage. the only looser in this game is mr joe blogs with a mortgage to pay
20090223022734AAaJ1u6	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Housing Benefit, Difficult Situation, Stupid Agent and Landlord Authorisation..?	Dear all,      I have applied for housing benefit as I was considered redundant a few months ago. At the moment, I'm living in a room near Canary Wharf, sharing with another guy. The room is managed by an agent, and the only information I have regarding my landlord is his 'full' name.      The local borough responded to me, asking for further information:      "... I wrote to you recently requesting information in support of your claim for benefit. I have checked our records and found that you have only returned some of the information. Thank you for providing your Tenancy Agreement, however I require confirmation of the Name of your Landlord and your Landlord's residential address. Your tenancy Agreement only states the name of your Landlord's Agent and thei address. As you have an Agent acting on behalf of your landlord, I require written authorisation from your landlord confirming this. Please return the information by 10.03.2009 ..."      However, the agent is not the most flexible person in the world; I have requested for many maintenance services and nothing happened; let alone help me in this difficult situation. Also, I prefer not to disclose that I was laid out, because the other day he said: 'What Happened? Credit crunch.com? Hahaha' and he left...      Could you please help me with some ideas please? Thank you so much. I'd really appreciate it.

20090223021454AAYSOqH	Business & Finance;Corporations	How to complain about wrong information and being charged for it, please.?	We have had trouble with Symantec (a subsidiary of Dell) whom we consulted last week when our computer crashed. After four days we contacted Symantec who said it would cost ￡57+ for their assistance. Then followed two and a half hours of instruction (duly followed) to put us back online, and of course we paid for it.       It didn't work, and we lost several files and essential contacts. Twice we've tried to establish some contact, and come up against a brick wall.      Fortunately a trouble-shooter managed to put us back online yesterday.      Today I asked for a name and address to file a formal complaint but was fobbed off with various excuses, and a promise to return our call, which I don't trust as twice before this has been stated and not honoured.      To summarize: They have taken our money and succeeded in utter incompetence.  Does anyone know how best to complain, and to whom?  I would be so grateful for any help with this very frustrating problem. Thank you.
