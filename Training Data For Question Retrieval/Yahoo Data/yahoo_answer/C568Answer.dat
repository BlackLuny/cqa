AUOp1j5Saa	Honestly, it could be either or.<br>  The only way to be sure is to take a pregnancy test.<br>  These symptoms could be indicative of a period or pregnancy, it all depends on the circumstances. If you've had unprotected sex, then you should suspect pregnancy over a period, but if you have not then it honestly could be either one.<br>  <br>  Actually, pink and brown very light spotting a week or so before your period IS indicative of pregnancy as it can be implantation bleeding.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	period - just a bit different, that's all|`|1LNURVSkaa	Get some sleep. Eat better. Try one of those pregnancy tests from the pharmacy. If you are really worried, go see your family doctor or gyno. Dizzyness and tiredness go hand in hand with sleep and nutrition. However, thay can be symptomatic of other heatlh issues besides pregnancy. Spotting is normal..mostly. Many women have periods that are almost nothing. But, like I said, if you are worried, please go to a doctor.|`|ae48bd27dbcb18bf91ed40a73df27a35aa	Period. The brown and pink are just the old "stuff" from previous month that your body retained. Generally if you were pregnant you would not have ANY period at all.
VlIFf0staa	some people have limbs that often fall asleep because they just have poor blood flow which can be due to peripheral vascular disease or diabetes, among other things. but anyone's limbs can fall asleep while in certain positions. just think of it like you are kind of pinching off your blood vessels and not allowing adequate blood to get through|`|45wIxLXOaa	cut off of blood circulation momentarily
HSt3y5yWaa	If it's not affecting the rest of your social life it's not the only thing you think about I wouldn't worry it's natural.|`|OBwqjS8maa	Why??? As long as it's not interfering with your life, it's perfectly healthy. It's better than having sex with a random stranger and getting an STD, isn't it? Once or twice a day is NOT too much!<br>  <br>  In re: to your added detail, I think that's probably true. My boyfriend tends to ejaculate a lot more when we've gone awhile without sex than he does if we do it every day.|`|FU4TyghIaa	okay, first lets look at the deal where a girlfriend will solve your situation.<br>  Masturbation is a solitary sexual release.<br>  Making love to your girlfriend is quite different in many respects, because you're making love to her, and you are giving her sexual pleasure.  You're not worried about just getting your release.  It's emotions, intimacy, trust, a whole lot more than doing yourself, like i say.  So, if you merely supplement your solitary satisfaction with love making to a girl, then you're letting the girl down and not experiencing the full pleasure of an intimate relationship.<br>  <br>  That being said, when it comes to wanking, like you get the message, it's an okay thing to do.<br>  When it becomes a problem is where you  find yourself thinking about it all the time, or agonising and feeling it is wrong.<br>  See it for what it is and something you don't need to punish yourself for or feel bad about.  At the same time, try not to focus on it or give undue emphasis to it in your life.<br>  Frankly, it will be better if you can hold off a bit.  Allow the load to build before you let it fly.  Then physically and psychologically, the experience will be more rewarding, but not like sex.  That's different.  But like you say in your additional details, you do build up a bigger load of ejaculate if you hold off, and that improves the experience.<br>  <br>  As for doing this, for keeping your mind off the deed, you need to find something else about yourself that you can indulge in.  Eating is not a good idea, drugs, tv, alcohol, all bad ideas.  Hobbies and creative pursuits are the fulfillment you're probably looking for.  Maybe some guys restore cars (i cringe) or play music or read or write stories or do creative art and craft or better still, go for some exercise regime like going to the gym or riding a bicycle.  Physical exertion in other ways can help to relieve the tension.  Yeah, exercise is a good outlet for this pent up tension that your release in this pursuit.|`|94ITHKFTaa	you just stop cold turkey and start havin sex with a girl.|`|POY6yjBBaa	once or twice a day is fine as long as it dosnt interfere with your social life or work|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Get yourself a girlfriend.

lGS54cfxaa	It sounds like he needs some help and support because he's suffering from either anxiety or depression, and has been before you broke up, most likely. You just need to be there for him. If he's the one that broke things up, then that right there is a sign of something that isn't right. <br>  <br>  Since I don't fully understand this, I'm not sure if this will help very well or not, so if it hasn't, feel free to email and explain a bit more.|`|ff318d9a55b6992dbacee440ab496803aa	you are what? 14? 13? <br>  <br>  forget your whiny bf.

Help him get a therapist and an SSRI.|`|J0vZ51gSaa	I have ended relationships due to depression, at the time I felt like I was dragging everyone down and thought I was doing them a favour by leaving them and distancing myself. I had really low self esteem and couldn't see why anyone would want to be with me (maybe that is the case with him? he's trying to save you from himself?).<br>  <br>  maybe you can talk about this with him and if it is the case reassure him that even though he has low self esteem due to his depression, you still hold i'm in high esteem and why, and that you still see him as the same wonderful man you got with etc etc. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Depressed people often withdraw, socially. A previous answer follows; print, refer, or show him. (When he recovers from depression, he may realise that letting you go was a mistake, but you can't rely on that): Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. <br>  <br>  A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. <br>  <br>  The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes of exercise, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly in daytime, outside. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, (a free E course in it is at: <a href="http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome" rel="nofollow">http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome</a> ) or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.|`|sS4lX3L1aa	i think he needs you now more than ever, not as a girlfriend, but as a friend! :)

IMPvzBk1aa	You don't want it to dry out.  What you have been doing is fine.  Your body fluids are what liquified the ointment.  The new skin underneath needs to be protected and kept supple with either the antibacterial ointment you are using, or you can purchase vaseline gauze to cover it, and then bandage over that.  Buy some sterile saline, 0.9% and use it to cleanse the burn when you change bandages.  Continue this until you have good healing and sensation in the burned areas.  The goal is to prevent infection, and to prevent dessication (drying) of the tissue.|`|rSIF5jtSaa	DO NOT cover up your burns. That is the first mistake. It holds in the moisture noti giving time for your burns to heal. You just need to leave it alone and let it scab over. Unfortunately, it will leave a scar but, they fade over time.|`|AA10415431	I would leave it alone at this point. You need to let it dry out. Once it heals( scab falls off) put a little vitamin E oil on it ( daily), no bandaid.
AA10911150	Not wishing to offend anyone but most people who would take steroids probably wouldn't fall under the category of "genius". Seriously though, while everyone has the idea that steroids will automatically make you huge, that is not necessarily the case. Just look at pro cycling. A good number of competitors have been busted for using them but I've yet to see a 300 pound muscleman compete in the Tour de France. Another example is retired tennis pro Petr Korda. He was banned from the tour for steroid use and the guy was built like a toothpick. In general, most athletes who get in trouble for using them are doing so to increase their resistance to injury rather than to get huge. While they can increase muscle-mass, there is no necessary corelation.|`|nLLjlQcGaa	Your right, if one was to take steroids, they should properly educate themselves on how to train to get the desired goal. Its all based on how u train. Strength, size or even leaning out. Steroids can get u to that goal. one just has to have the information and apply it correctly. But no, not all who take it will end up looking like Jay or Ronnie|`|JN6LWA6Oaa	Becuase people are idiots, the first guy has a point too|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Most people on steroids are airheads to begin with or they wouldn't be on them.

Your hormones may still be a little off as you are still recovering from this procedure. <br>  I had an abortion in July of last year and I think about it all the time. You really need to be at peace with your decision. You have to know that you did what was best for you at that time. It isn't something you can take back or change. You made the decision and you can't go back. It was hard on me even now even 8 months later to not regret the decision. <br>  It is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, but it has made me stronger and have learned to be content with the decision I made...<br>  Try some relaxation exercises and take some time for yourself to just think. Just sit in your bedroom with the lights off and time 10 minutes for you to just sit there and think. That is what I did.<br>  Also, make an appointment with your doctor and let him know about how you have been feeling. I had some really weird symptoms after my abortion, was then diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The hormone imbalance made me really depressed along with other physical symptoms. <br>  You will be ok, I promise! Make light of the situation, don't let anyone else tell you how to feel. You make decisions that are right for YOU, not everyone else. And even if you do feel bad about the abortion, you will learn to live with the decision and that it was best for you at the time you made the choice!<br>  Good luck! <br>  If you need anyone to talk to I'm at kassy_chick@yahoo.com|`|HB3fDXeMaa	I just had one and I feel the exact same way......today, to help me cope I have just committed myself to sponsoring an impoverished child in a 3rd world country, so that I can at least give someone else a chance at life.

I've talked about my regret with my bf and close friend and they don't see me as a terrible person and they said that they forgive me but it doesn't seem to matter when you can't forgive yourself.....I don't know how or when I'll be able to do this.....perhaps we both need a counselor to help us in this process.|`|wwwiWaK8aa	You have post abortion syndrome and it's normal after what you have been through.

We just talked about it and she stayed over and just had like a girls night at my house. After a while she just started feeling better and told me i helped her a lot. so i would just say to go talk to one of your friends and ask around for help because i know its hard but remember the reasons you got the abortion and they were the right thing to do at the time for you.<br>  <br>  Just take a deep breathe and be calm, call your friend and tell her how your feeling. good luck girl! be strong|`|bR4BgFLlaa	Its natural to feel down and upset. You've been through an ordeal. Especially since you didn't deal with your feelings immediately. It will get better though, don't listen those who give you grief about it.

I know that with mine the feeling went away and came back a few times. Your hormones are a little messed up right now. I don't know if you are in high school or not, but if you are, you should go speak with your guidance counselor about it. Either that, or talk to another adult that you trust. You are not a horrible person for doing what you did, especially since you sound remorseful for your actions.|`|T0pkW783aa	Please stop beating yourself up.  You made a choice and there is no turning back now.  You are feeling guilt, shame and whatever else comes with it.  I am not sure that it will go away completely but time will help to heal the pain you are suffering now.  I know people who have had the same experience and it is normal for you to feel the anguish you are now feeling.  My friends who have gone through with an abortion (several) have come to realize that this was a poor choice for them.  They are now anti-abortion and speak to those who are contemplating going through with one.  Go for some counseling to help you get through the loss you are feeling.
fk9AvB25aa	If you haven't had sex then I would say it's not but since you did...Well if there were no sings of sores on her mouth or down south then you would have only a slight risk of getting herpes. Herpes is more contagious when there is any signs of an out break. But while there are no signs there is a very slight chance that you could get herpes.<br>  Herpes can take 2-14 days to show symptoms, and it can be as mild as just a couple of bumps and or some burning, tingling or itching symptoms. <br>  You may actually want to wait for the two weeks. If the bump goes away by then you can have a blood test done. If you have a blood test done too soon then you may get some false negatives if there are not enough antibodies of herpes to test for in your blood.

It's possible but herpes can be deadly to new borns, or they could have some problems with. they could become blind or have some brain damage.<br>  There are things that can be done to prevent herpes from being passed on when the mother gives birth. Such as having a c-section if there is an out break at the time of delivery.|`|JR96pECgaa	No you can not be born with genital herpes, genital herpes is a STD skin on skin contact with someone who haves the disease, look out because sometimes people can spread genital herpes without having an outbreak.
24vZfnF3aa	Blood in your urine is often a sign of infection, I'm guessing your GP then arranged a lab test for micro-culture & sensitivity. This shows what organisms(bacteria) have caused the infection & what medication would be best to treat it. If you have already been given a treatment, it may not be effective, & your GP may well have recalled you to change it.<br>   There is not a generally used test that would show that you were sexually active or masturbated. Even if there were, why do you think your doctor would be interested? All your GP wants is information that is relevant to your health.<br>   If you think that you might have a vaginal infection, discuss this with your doctor, as it will need treatment. Your GP is there to treat you , not to judge you. Take care|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	It's probably just a urinary tract infection....but see below.<br>  <br>  The only thing sex related that a urine test could show is an STD or pregnancy. <br>  <br>   Relax...you will get some antibiotics and be fine!<br>  <br>  Causes<br>  <br>  <br>  The urinary tract is made up of your bladder, your two kidneys and ureters, and the urethra. The kidneys remove waste and excess fluid from your blood and convert it to urine. The urine then flows through two hollow tubes (ureters) — one from each kidney — to your bladder, where urine is stored until it passes out of your body through the urethra.<br>  <br>  In hematuria, your kidneys — or other parts of your urinary tract — allow blood cells to leak into urine. A number of problems can cause this leakage, including:<br>  <br>      * Urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections are particularly common in women, though men also get them. They occur when bacteria enter your body through the urethra and begin to multiply in your bladder. The infections sometimes, though not always, develop after sexual activity. Symptoms can include a persistent urge to urinate, pain and burning with urination, and extremely strong-smelling urine. For some people, especially older adults, the only sign of illness may be microscopic blood. About 30 percent of people with a urinary tract infection have visible bleeding.<br>      * Other urinary tract infections. Kidney infections (pyelonephritis) can occur when bacteria enter your kidneys from your bloodstream or move from up from your ureters to your kidney(s). Signs and symptoms are often similar to bladder infections, though kidney infections are more likely to cause fever and flank pain.<br>      * A bladder or kidney stone. The minerals in concentrated urine sometimes precipitate out, forming crystals on the walls of your kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can turn into small, hard stones. The stones are generally painless, and you probably won't know you have them unless they cause a blockage or are being passed. Then, there's no mistaking the symptoms — kidney stones can cause excruciating pain. They can also cause both gross and microscopic bleeding.<br>      * Enlarged prostate. This is one of the leading causes of visible urinary blood in men older than 50. The prostate gland — located just below the bladder and surrounding the top part of the urethra — often begins growing as men approach middle age. When the gland enlarges, it compresses the urethra, partially blocking urine flow. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hypertrophy or BPH) include difficulty urinating, an urgent or persistent need to urinate, and either gross or microscopic bleeding. Infection of the prostate (prostatitis) can cause the same signs and symptoms.<br>      * Kidney disease. Microscopic urinary bleeding is a common symptom of glomerulonephritis, which causes inflammation of the kidneys' filtering system. Glomerulonephritis may be part of a systemic disease such as diabetes, or it can occur on its own. It can be triggered by viral or strep infections, blood vessel diseases (vasculitis), and immune problems such as IgA nephropathy, which affects the small capillaries that filter blood in the kidneys (glomeruli).<br>      * Cancer. Visible urinary bleeding is often the first sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. Unfortunately, you may not have signs or symptoms in the early stages, when these cancers are more treatable.<br>      * Inherited disorders. Sickle cell anemia — a chronic shortage of red blood cells — can be the cause of blood in urine, both gross and microscopic hematuria. So can Alport syndrome, which affects the filtering membranes in the glomeruli of the kidneys.<br>      * Kidney injury. A blow or other injury to your kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood in your urine that you can see.<br>      * Medications. Common drugs that can cause visible urinary blood include aspirin, penicillin, the blood thinners warfarin and heparin, and the anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan).<br>      * Strenuous exercise. It's not quite clear why exercise causes gross hematuria. It may be trauma to the bladder, dehydration or the breakdown of red blood cells that occurs with sustained aerobic exercise. Runners are most often affected, although almost any athlete can develop visible urinary bleeding after an intense workout.|`|qxrr69bnaa	Sex, masturbation, and a vaginal infection will not show up in a urine specimen.

OnDIrxNEaa	Be sure to wear all-cotton underwear.  Also, do not use pantiliners or pads if possible, they trap moisture & create bacteria.  Don't take bubble baths, take plain ones or take a shower.  Try to make sure when you wash, that no soap actually goes inside your vagina.  <br>  I have had BV off and on since I was 16 & a virgin, now I'm 24.

h3HjLZ4daa	Many people are simply sensitive to soap products when used on mucous membranes like within the lips of the vagina.  That irritation can lead to a yeast infection.  If you don't get yeast infections then it's ok to use it there, but if you do consider backing off to just water.  Seriously, you don't need soap there!  Just rinsing, and perhaps wiping with a wet washcloth is all you need.<br>  <br>  A lot of girls and women get relief from a yeast infection when they get their period - as to do with a shift in pH I believe.  In some cases it will go away on its own, in other cases though it'll return gangbusters.<br>  <br>  To cope with the itching and irritation there are over the counter creams, but why cope?  There are also medications on the shelf that will cure most yeast infections.<br>  <br>  If you get a lot of infections (say more than 3 months running, even 2) you really should check with your doctor.  And do give up the things that can make you more susceptible: washing down there with soap, using scented tampons, nylon panties, bubble bath, scented toilet tissue, and a few others.<br>  <br>  If the over the counter stuff doesn't do it you really must see the doctor - there is the off chance it isn't a yeast infection, and if it is there is a lovely pill that you take once that will clear it up in a day or two.|`|uxq33y1maa	You can use soap to clean the outside of your privates, as long as you dont wipe it inside your vagina or urethra. you should just use warm water for the inner parts. your vagina cleans itself, there's never a reason to use soap or douching to clean it out. it only makes things worse.
AA11790910	It depends on how far along you are.  If you're early in the pregnancy (<12 weeks), you'll have to drink about 16 oz although some will make you take 32 oz to ensure there is enough in your bladder.

You can do that with fruits and vegetables, and reducing the amount of fat and red meat you eat.<br>  <br>  Also, though it sounds like the opposite of what you want to do, make sure you drink a lot of water. It will convince your body it doesn't need to hang on to as much.

i6RlYFo7aa	no<br>  <br>  there are other alternatives, you can see a doctor so he can prescribe you a steroid cream and look up foreskin stretching excercises on the net so that the skin loosens up and retracts all the way<br>  <br>  worse comes to worse you can get a dorsal slit, but stretching with the steroid cream usually works so i doubt you'll need a dorsal slit|`|SltEwVX7aa	might need a little stretching.  do it in the shower when things are good and warmed up.  You can either pull back the foreskin as far as you can (letting pain be your guide) and hold it there for a few seconds, or get a finger from each finger into the opening of the foreskin and pull outwards.  A couple weeks of this, and you should see results.<br>  <br>  One other possibility is that the frenulum won't allow the foreskin to retract.  That can also be dealt with by stretching.  If all else fails, a trip to the doc, a little local anesthetic, a quick snip, a week to heal, and problem solved.<br>  <br>  A foreskin should be nice and loose in either erect or flaccid state.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No. Circumcision is almost never needed. Only about half of intact guys have the foreskin roll back automatically on erection. The other half have the foreskin still covering the head. As long as it can be pulled back manually, it's fine. If it can't be pulled back manually, stretching and a cream will fix it, not circumcision.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Most likely....|`|nQkH90n6aa	I agree with 'e w'. You do not need nor should you want a circumcision.<br>  <br>  Can you roll it back when it's not erect?<br>  <br>  Before you see a doctor, spend about 2 months having a bath every night, doesn't have to be a deep bath, and just try very gently stretching it. Stop pulling when it starts to get painful or uncomfortable. You should find over time you can do more and more without pain. Don't worry about how to stretch or which way to pull, any pulling will help. Only if you see absolutely no change go and see your doctor, but I think you will see change, and if you stick at it you'll have no problems.<br>  <br>  I worked with school nurses who had loads of cases like this, and not one of those boys didn't manage to sort the problem themselves.<br>  <br>  By the way, how old are you? Because if you're under 15 then there's a chance that your foreskin is still attached like a fingernail to a finger. It'll sort itself out if you're a late developer so don't panic!<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|aAcjC22gaa	Most people don't know what they are talking about because they don't have foreskin. I do so take it from me. What you are describing is called phimosis.  If you can get an erection and urinate without pain you are ok.

This pressure damages the delicate spongy arteries and so they do not fill up with blood as well and stretch the skin from the inside out.<br>  <br>  Masturbate by lightly griping the shaft and moving the skin up and down - like what would happen in sexual intercourse.<br>  <br>  By giving the masturbation a rest you give your body the chance to repair the penis.  Then on resuming masturbation, do it the correct way and don't put too much pressure on the penis.<br>  <br>  Once the penis is repaired it will stretch the skin normally and force the head through.<br>  <br>  You don't want to  lose the foreskin.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability to masturbate easily as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.

Hope so. <br>  <br>  Cheers from Barrie O.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	Not always , there is a medical procedure short of circumcision which is quite common as many young guys have this issue and get it resolved in late teens|`|aBCVFc3Kaa	NO CIRCUMCISION IS NEEDED AND DON'T LISTEN TO ANY OF THE RELIGIOUS FRIEKS!!!<br>  It just needs a bit of stretching every day.|`|40STiGmvaa	In some cases but get a professional opinion from your doctor.|`|e8WVidSsaa	Not necessarily.|`|JwIg9u7Haa	I don't think so.<br>  Mine doesn't so I'm guessing we're in the same boat.<br>  I'm trying to stretch mine when I have erections and I plan to ask my doctor about it.|`|tofDtzQnaa	i probably does because sex can be painfull..circumcision is quite a painfull op but,its worth it..i had it done 2 yrs ago,|`|TsjqzanQaa	Circumcision is NEVER necessary or desirable.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is male genital mutilation that always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity.     There are many adverse effects and complications that result from circumcision that the doctors do not disclose and in fact suppress.<br>  <br>  It isn't quite clear what you mean by "does not roll back."<br>  <br>  Did you mean automatically retracting on erection, or that you can't retract it when erect?<br>  <br>  The foreskin of all males doesn't automatically retract on erection; some are longer than others and continue to cover the glans, but they will retract and move normally during actual sex.<br>  <br>  If your foreskin is tight, and you can't manually retract it, usually some gentle, gradual stretching can facilitate normal retraction/mobility of the foreskin.<br>  <br>  When erect, gently pull back until moderate discomfort is felt, not pain.       Do not use too much force or try to rush it; it can damage the penis and cause scarring.<br>  <br>  When flaccid, insert both index fingers into the foreskin opening (with the foreskin covering the glans completely) and gently pull in opposite directions, to gently stretch the foreskin opening wider.     Do this a couple of times per day, for 5-15 minutes or so, and after a couple of months you should see progress.<br>  <br>  If stretching doesn't work, then you may want to consider a preputioplasty, or dorsal slit, which is a small surgical incision in the foreskin to allow normal retraction.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone talk you into circumcision, there are always other treatments for the foreskin, which can, like any body part, have a problem.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|K4zsztkRaa	Absolutly not.<br>  It might not pull back on it's own. but if you mean that the skin is too tight then you need to stretch it out. Just pull it back as far as you can WITHOUT pain and hold there for 5 mins and do that 3 times a day or more. If it doesn't work after 2-3 weeks then talk to a doctor about getting a steroid cream. Circumcisions are VERY rarly ever needed<br>  <br>  -Connor
IMPvzBk1aa	Dr. Scholls has all kinds of heel protectors, or you can just get the moleskin padding and cut it to fit any way you prefer.|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	You most definitely need better-fitting shoes. You don't say if the bleeding is from blisters, or from some other source, but anything that causes bleeding can cause even more serious injuries to your feet and that would be WORSE than buying better shoes!  You risk infection and tendinitis by allowing your heels to slide up and down inside your shoes.<br>  <br>  There are products you can use to make the heels of shoes fit your feet better--lambs' wool that sticks in the sides of the shoes, (and provides nice cushioning,) insoles that raise the heel a bit higher--and provide running cushioning too, and moleskin. If I were you I would visit a podiatrist and ask what you can do and how to do it.|`|3PzVT6RNaa	I would suggest wrapping your foot with some cling wrap (kind of like an ace bandage, but its cotton, mesh like and clings together) maybe put some gauze on the areas that bleed before wrapping.<br>  If that doesn't work, I would just get different shoes.|`|NQq8i7gsaa	get something called "mole skin" you can find it at most stores like walgreens and its designed to stop shoes from rubing against sores or patches of skin|`|hJCbZpCLaa	vaseline and a bandaid?|`|h2rFVIpIaa	try a bandaid or a bandage to the area.

ORUAtr0kaa	Ovulating is when one 'egg' comes out of your ovum, and travels down to your uterus where if it has been met by sperm, it will grow into a baby, if not, you have your period. :)<br>  If you want more information you can go to a website or something, or look it up, but not on yahoo answers.|`|s5Wi7yYwaa	ovulating is when a girl is ready to get pregnant.<br>  often, white mucuos sticky discharge will come when a girl is ovulating|`|c6uxzsnpaa	its like when you are able to get pregnant<br>  I'm not really sure the scientific definition of it but yaaa lol|`|lOXqBBOwaa	It's when you start to develop eggs during your menstrual.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from the ovary, pushed down the fallopian tube, and is available to be fertilized. The lining of the uterus has thickened to prepare for a fertilized egg. If no conception occurs, the uterine lining as well as blood will be shed. The shedding of an unfertilized egg and the uterine wall is the time of menstruation.<br>  <br>  (they are different things - the answer above was wrong)|`|L9WeTmzuaa	ovulating is when the egg is released and moving thru the fallopian tubes and uterus. most ppl ovulate in the middle of their cycle. that's the time when most ppl can become pregnant. <br>  <br>  here's a website that might explain it better.<br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/understandingovulation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/getting...</a>|`|bRE26RDvaa	ovulatingggggggggg doesn't have a definition but<br>  ovulating-produce and discharge eggs "a womans period"|`|GYsWOb5faa	Ovulation is the process of the egg moving into the uterus and becoming ready for fertilization.|`|GnOKExBhaa	when your egg are moving through your tubes|`|ubukt8WWaa	Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary.  It then enters the fallopian tubes and travels down to the uterus.  That takes a few days.  During this time, it can be fertilized by sperm.<br>  <br>  Ovulation happens roughly once a month.  Menstruation (period) happens a couple of weeks later (give or take a few days), unless the egg is fertilized and implants in the uterus lining (pregnancy)|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Starting at puberty, females produce an egg (sometimes 2) about every 28 days. If it is left unfertilized from sexual intercourse, if flows out with mensrual discharge (period).
1ylpCN3yaa	Sometimes females can have "blood in the urine" but its not accurate as it has come from your period. But they will be able to differentiate between blood from the kidney and blood from the uterus. If you showed positive for leukocytes then you could have an infection, ie. Urinary tract infection, but you would also have symptoms like pain and frequent urination. But your doctor needs to interpret the sample as a whole. If you have an UTI your doctor will prescribe the right antibiotic you don't need to see a gyn unless you have frequent infections.|`|lPO4D8PLaa	Your lab results are consistent with a urinary tract infection.  UTIs are very common (especially in women).  You will just need antibiotics prescribed.  You don't have to go to the gyn doctor.|`|SKtQSElAaa	most likely you have a uti or cystitis.  both are treated with antibiotics.  no, you don't have to go to your gyne.  both uti's and cystitis are very common in women.
AA11488649	with all the skin problems we have, its actually very hard to say what kind you have without seeing it. so i suggest u go to another dermatologist, to have a second opinion. and don't forget to tell him/her what your first derma told u. and if u can't remember the name of the cream, better just bring it with you during ur consultation

AxmjNRVaaa	The reason contact Lens Rx are only for a year is to make sure the contacts aren't adversely affecting your eyes. Just because your eyes "feel ok" doesn't mean that there may not be a problem with the curvature or microorganisms on your eyes that can only be detected via an exam. Also, people like myself with astigmatism (or other conditions), need to be monitored to make sure that the problem is not getting worse and that the contacts are effective. Overall, the contact actually sits on your eyeball so it's understandable that it would be more closely monitored. Eyes are delicate. Hope this helps.|`|xvey8ixPaa	Glasses sit outside your body and your over all body health is not affected by it. Contact lenses are medical devices that you insert in to your eye and sit on very sensitive parts of your anatomy that can affect your over all body health. Misuse of contact lenses has been known in many many cases to lead to complications that cause blindness. Doctors who prescribe contacts are responsible to carry out the rules and regulations set forth by the FDA. I know no doctor willing to risk his license just because someone did not want to get their contact lens exam. We have many people every week that call and are mad because we will not extend a contact lens prescription by another year.  We really can not do it, and the doctor I work for is not going to risk his education and livelihood just because some contact lens wearer got irate because they do not want to follow the rules. It is something that is always in controversy, but the reality is that we see problems all day every day caused by contacts that are not being used correctly (over worn, not cleaned, slept in etc...) and we NEVER see complications due to eyeglass wear. So, there ya have it! education in a bottle.|`|8f88988d153997a17a65bb17a47f9839aa	basically with contact lenses damage may have occurred to your eye which you cant see also your eyes become less sensitive hence the contact lens assessment is there to check the health of the eye. Spec prescription is 2 years because you don't stick anything in your eye that might cause damage.<br>  <br>  also its the law... that would be the easiest way to explain your question.|`|Bb9k6XI1aa	so the dr. can check to see if the contacts have caused any damage to the inside of your eye. glasses fit on the face so there for do not damage your eye  ball.|`|NuvKPl3naa	well it depends on your insurance. most insurances pay for glasses every other year and contacts every year. also the dr wants to make sure the contacts are ok with your eyes, infections etc.... being its something you put on your eye the dr needs to check more often,|`|pLD3pYsuaa	I don't understand that either but i still change my prescription every year, even if i have to pay one year and the next year i don't have to pay.|`|cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	It is because the eye may change shape or contacts could do things to the eye.  Two things they look out for are protein deposits and adverse changes to the cornea.  If the cornea is pitted, warped, infected, etc., then you need to go without wearing them.  Plus there are possible changes in what you need.  Contacts actually touch the eye and can cause the shape to vary, and there may be constant rubbing.  Glasses do not touch the eyes and do not interact with the eyes in a way which could cause changes to the surface of the eye.|`|5qVJtRGSaa	Glasses cause no damage to the eyes, while contacts can cause numerous injuries.<br>  <br>  The doctor wants to see you again before writing a new script for contacts.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Actually the prescription for glasses needs checked yearly also.|`|dd6rgtL7aa	The contact lens people got with the prescription givers and devised a wicked plan to make more money! Its a conspiracy I tell you!
ZSW2X8mhaa	Ok this one has baffled me a bit.<br>  <br>  I can imagine just how much that is worrying.<br>  <br>  In some cases a man doesn't "fully" empty his tract after ejaculation. So if it's short and sudden, probably so. <br>  <br>  But your best bet, no matter how embarrassing, it's a pee sample to the doctor. If it IS skin, then perhaps he might have some sort of infection.<br>  <br>  If he has any piercings down there I would certainly get it checked.<br>  <br>  I know it's not much, but my best advice is the medical avenue.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it, I'm sure it won't be too much to worry about.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	UTI - urinary tract infection - see a doc asap|`|EJSdI25Naa	I have never heard of such a thing.

dNtJ9Ob9aa	Look keep doing your weightlifting regimen.  Cause what you don't use you'll lose simple as that.  Keep protein high at every feeding.  To help preserve muscle.  <br>  <br>  Use <a href="http://www.fitday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fitday.com</a> a website I reccommend to everyone.  Calculate how much cals u burn in a day and you will need to about that many cals spread out across 4-6 meals.  You then do your cardio and weightlifting to put you in a negative calorie loss.  So say you burned 2800 calories today. You would have to burn about 3100-3300 cals to get your body to use some fat for fuel.<br>  <br>  High protein high good fat and low/moderate complex carb diet should work fine.  Adjust accordingly to how your body responds to carbs and so forth.<br>  <br>  good luck.  it's a trial and error thing. but hope i helped

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|bUTlzjk1aa	u have probably sprained ur leg...|`|hBcdkgzqaa	Sounds like muscle faciitis. Which is spasms in the legs.

wOecmtrzaa	Yup, sounds like your wisdom teeth need comin out.<br>  <br>  Its really easy for your DDS to see if you need them out, he just needs to take a panoramic radiograph.  <br>  <br>  And actually, I think most people get their wisdom teeth taken out at around your age-- all people are different, but a general range is probably about 14-19 years old.<br>  <br>  I think years ago people did wait till they were older, just because they didn't really want to do the surgery when the teeth were still under the gums.

Ive tried eating healthier to gain energy but it just isnt working.. i recently went to the doctors and they prescribed me some depression medication.. havent noticed a change yet. It is weird everyone tells me how perfect my life is and i am grateful for what i do have but it still doesnt take this feeling away. Maybe you should see a doctor and try some depression medication.. it takes a while to feel the full effect.. i hope you can get some help and that i could be more of a help but im going through the same thing so just know you arent alone!!<br>  also i have a question.. is your name really cailie bailey??? only reason i ask is my daughters name is kaylee and i got married and my last name is bailey and people are telling me im evil if i give her my new married name...|`|ZMyABA8caa	OMG, i thought i was the only 1 feeling this way. To be honest, I have been doing and feeling, word-to-word for what you said except the crying part (im mentally strong). I have those exact feelings and do EXACT things, like EVERYTHING is same..If you want u can add me at msn omer_the_best2005@hotmail.com to talk n share stuff....Advice i would give you here is, what i do is, no matter how hard things get and how badly fucked u think you are..Just focus your mind on something enjoying and dont take so much stress, let the time pass, perhaps its a stage in life we r suppose to be like this.|`|FZfCou1qaa	You sound like you are depressed sweety.  Go and see your dr.  Tell him exactly how you are feeling and dont let them brush you off.  Depression is very common, but that doesnt make it less painfull or easier to deal with.  It can be very serious.  See your Dr. as soon as possible.  you will feel better soon, I promise.  The best thing about our feelings is that they are always changing. So you can guarantee that you will feel different soon.<br>  Good Luck!

g6ybOqnuaa	Asbestos is not a chemical. It is a mineral that has been mined and found to even have been used by ancient Egyptians in woven cloth. It was mined and used in building materials because it resists the effects of heat, water, electricity, and cold which made it an excellent use for insulation materials especially in boiler rooms. It had many uses but it is known to cause many types of cancer so it has been banned in the US and there are now special procedures for abatement and maintenance for materials that contain asbestos. Search "Libby Montana, World Trade Center, and asbestos." That should help with ideas for the report.|`|AA10097817	It used to be used in insulation.|`|zLpsu8GBaa	It was placed in many construction materials of the 1950s and 1960s, especially insulation, roofing, and siding. It still exists in many homes and businesses today. Undisturbed, it is non-toxic and will last forever.The roof on my grandmother's old house is made up of it. It has never been replaced, only patched occasionally, and was actually placed there in 1959.<br>  <br>  The problem with asbestos is when it must be removed during a remodel or during deconstruction. As it is broken up, it breaks into small particulates, which, if inhaled, can cause numerous ailments including cancer and respiratory problems.
AxmjNRVaaa	You can go to any lens store and get them. A prescription is not necessary. You can try on different colors and decide which ones you like. The only thing is that you may the same price as if you had prescription (unlike glasses where the prescription lenses cost more). I have blue and green ones from Fresh Look and love them. My natural eye color is brown and no I don't see blue or green, they are totally comfortable and a great accessory. Why not give yourself that extra ooomp factor?|`|NuvKPl3naa	all you need to do is go to your eye dr and they can give you colored contacts without the rx.
g3h42biwaa	Your cycle can take quite a while to become regular (for some it never does) if there's no possibility of pregnancy than just wait it out and you'll be fine...To my knowledge, masturbating in any form will not prevent the red flag from waving it's colors, I do however wish I could get off with water alone, sounds fun...lol.|`|5Hfxu3Kcaa	1-No<br>  2- If it's only you third period that is completley normal!|`|bRE26RDvaa	most womens periods are irregular and do not become regular until they hit their 20s. <br>  and absolutely not. its impossible. <br>  and using water in place of fingers is probably a more healthier way of masturbating.|`|GnOKExBhaa	i masturbate with water but i don;t know about the period being late. mine isn't late.|`|yRd3ixmmaa	HOW THA HELL KAN U MASTERBATE IN THE WATER??<br>  TELL ME KUZ I WANNA KNOW KUZ IM A LIL TIRED OF MASTERBATIN OLD FASHION!!!<br>  I DONT THINK THAT KAN HAPPEN  THO!
PfE6bg5iaa	Are your periods just irregular, or do you have cramps that are keeping you home from school? 15 is still kind of young, so it's common for your cycle to still be irregular.<br>  <br>  Birth control is a prescription medication and should only be taken under advice from a medical doctor who DOES NOT work for a non-profit (ie planned parenthood). Planned Parenthood has often been exposed for poor practices and should only be used if you need BC to prevent getting pregnant and don't have the financial means to do so. If you have a dad that can pay for your medicine, it's silly to go somewhere to get it for free.<br>  <br>  Birth control has many dangerous side effects including blood clots, stroke, and heart attack. I'm 21 and birth control gave me blood clots last year which almost killed me. So it's important to remember that, like any medication, there are real risks associated with birth control. You need to know your complete family medical history (grandparents, aunts and uncles, etc) to protect yourself. And your dad needs to be aware of what meds you are on in case anything were to happen to you. <br>  <br>  I know it might be difficult, but what if you just told your dad that you have some "girl problems" and would like to see a doctor. He probably won't push you to tell him more. Then, you can tell the doctor what your problems are and they can make suggestions. This way, the doctor will suggest birth control to your dad and you won't have to!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OBwqjS8maa	You might be able to get it from Planned Parenthood, but I'm not sure if they have age restrictions there. You might call your local office and ask. Is there a trusted female adult you can talk to? Mom? Aunt? Friend?|`|L9WeTmzuaa	you should check into your local planned parenthood. since you are only 15 tho, if you are still on your dad's insurance you might need to tell your father. just talk to him and tell him you are doing it b/c of irregular periods and not because of having sex. (if you don't have insurance, sometimes it can be very expensive.)<br>  <br>   i got on the pill at 14. i had severe cramps w/ my periods (including vomiting) and irregular periods. but i talked to my mom about it. good luck! oh...and i also don't have insurance now b/c my job doesn't offer it yet, but i spend about 35-40 a month on birthcontrol. good luck!!|`|PgYWSUeEaa	i would ask him to make you a dr. app. go to the doctor and talk to them about it then have her bring it up to your dad. or you could try plan parenthood.|`|b4Ha48Avaa	i've never heard of nonprescription birthcontrol pills.<br>  <br>  try getting an aunt or grandma or something to bring you and get some pillls.|`|a5Ui7Ryhaa	Go to your local planned parenthood.  They have a privacy clause and they won't tell your parents.|`|1MAnrffsaa	You have to have an adult with you to get birth control. <br>  It will be difficult to ask your dad, but I did, and it all worked out okay. If you just can't seem to do it, ask another adult to do it for you.|`|QtYaRjYDaa	ask doctor|`|bRE26RDvaa	jeez he'll understand.... <br>  its a part of raising a girl!!
pZ9eA5rYaa	He's addicted to porn. He will get worse.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	You need to try to understand that porn to most guys is very erotic and makes us easily aroused. The girls in porn are like a fantasy, sexual beings that we imagine ourselves being with sexually - not emotionally or intimately. <br>  <br>  Him masturbating to porn has nothing to do with you. And whether you want him to or not, he'll probably masturbate regardless. If you try to get him to stop, he'll probably just do it behind your back. <br>  <br>  You've been together for awhile so maybe you should try to spice up your sex life, if you haven't already. Maybe incorporate porn into your sex life with your boyfriend. By watching it with him, you might find it arousing for yourself and your boyfriend will definitely get aroused himself. And, just as a suggestion, maybe make your own home made porn. I'll bet that would turn him on a lot as well. Maybe get into with some fantasy role playing too. Fantasies involving doctors/nurses, teachers, cops, baby sitters and maids are probably the most common. <br>  <br>  Regardless if you involve a camera, rekindling your sex life would help and understand it is normal for guys to masturbate and if he has access to porn he'll most likely masturbate to that.|`|EcCbforQaa	You won't change it, he started masturbating  long before he met you and he will always do it. It has nothing to do With you and It doesn't mean he loves you any less but he will always masturbate. it's just something we do. You either leave him, if you can't accept it, or accept it as a fact of life and leave him alone. As long as it does not become compulsive and he continues to lead a productive life it's not a problem. You have to know that he is not replacing you, it's not your fault and you are not less a woman. Try joining him, you may find it a turn on yourself.|`|EJSdI25Naa	You stop being so paranoiac about the whole matter. He is just normal.<br>  Your making issues out of imagined things is a real turn off. Yu can do as he suggests and get yourself into things. Try a tarty look, just at home for him. Super high heels that you cannot walk on but wear while lieing on the bed. Net stockings. Bright red lipstick. Sexy undies -- an adult store seciality. That's enough.<br>  <br>  Have a happy love life.  --  Barrie O.|`|SltEwVX7aa	he wants fantasy in his sex;  you want romance.  you're not gonna change him.<br>  <br>  decision time.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	he is getting bored...spice things up for him and he will be back.|`|y0E40eDbaa	Dont stress, My man masturbates as well. It is totally normal. Maybe you can find out if there is a certain kind of porn that he is looking at. Maybe its something that he would love for you to do eg dress up  or use toys or diff positions. Try and spice things up.|`|Ov8jbP1Taa	he'll eventually get bored with porn that happened to me... just spice things up and make him like you more than porn, go visit him on a sexy maid costume|`|RyFCRcIUaa	why not manually help him with his "hobby"?!|`|1neMZoRLaa	he's the problem.|`|JwIg9u7Haa	it's not you. sometimes he probably just wants to do it his own way.|`|fwS1yctBaa	ok just to let you know its normal for guys to masturbate. we do it all the time. and when he looks at porn, its not that he dosent think you are beutiful, its just harder to imagine somthing when you can see it normaly. you are not doing anything rong, we, as guy, just have a strong urge for sex. sorry to say but idk bout the whole bawls bs. but its very hard if you look at porn everyday to just stop. trust me i know. but what you could do is have him take pictures... or videos and atleast that way hes still seeing somthing with his eyes and not looken at other girls. i hope it help!!!<br>  <br>  PS im dislexic so sorry about the spelling

iAv9P3HTaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  I was suffering from panic attacks for 14 years.<br>  I did a lots of research and reading on the subject.<br>  <br>  Here is a six-step approach to self-control when dealing with an  anxiety attack:<br>  <br>  1.ACCEPT--Recognize that you are feeling anxious.Accept your body feelings as a symptom of your anxiety and a sign that something is bothering you.<br>  <br>  2.PERMISSION--Give yourself permission to feel anxious about whatever it is that is bothering you."Of course I feel anxious because.... and it is okay to have anxiety.I know what this is and why I feel this way."<br>  <br>  3.BREATHE-- First, inhale through your nose slowly for two-seconds,mentally counting one, one-thousand, two ,one- thousand.then exhale through your mouth to mental count of four-second-again by one-thousands.Do this for at least 60-seconds.<br>  <br>  4.INNER DIALOGUE--Use truthful, positive dialogue to talk yourself through  the anxious time.It WILL pass. Examples of dialogue might be,"It's just anxiety.It will go away. I will not lose control.<br>  I can still go about my business feeling spaced-out.It won't hurt me."<br>  <br>  5.DISTRACT--Get busy.Do something to release some of this self-induced stimulation.Your body is like a car in high gear with the brakes on .Don't just sit there! Walk,jog, clean closets -but do something.Distract yourself from the way you are feeling.<br>  <br>  6.LET TIME PASS-- and try to see a little humor in the way you feel.You may feel weird ,you don't look weird.Give yourself permission to feel weird for a little while. It is no big deal.Try to figure out what is really bothering you. Is it some type of conflict that you don't want to deal with?Is it a scary thought? Is it a ridiculous expectation you have about yourself? How about the television program you watched  last night?What is bothering  you?<br>  <br>  <br>  It takes time and lots and lots of practice.But the only way to stop fearing panic and anxiety attacks is to experience them .Then, work your way through them and begin to see that they won't hurt you.<br>  <br>  There is no need to avoid of fight <br>  <br>  YOU are your safe place and your safe person .<br>  YOU can make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  Feel good!|`|NuvKPl3naa	i have had panic attacks for years off and on. the last one i had was in 2002 and i cant seem to shake it off. what you need to do is see a dr and keep looking until you find on that can listen to you and help. i will get better and then worse. for the last 7 months it has been bad. i could hardly leave the house. but my new dr put me on cymbalta and i am driving around town and feeling much better. try to get exercise and eat healthy. you can purchase cd's for self help or books. do a lot of self talk. try to stay focused on life and things you like. live each day the best you can. even if you feel a little better thats good, maybe the next will be even better than the first. you can get out of this i promise it just takes time and help. good luck|`|ToILKl6waa	The first panic attack is always paralyzing. But you must realize anxiety is physically harmless and a normal response from your body triggered by stress. <br>  <br>  Don't let panic control your life. Accept the panic attack and let go of any grief you are holding onto. Let yourself be free again - you are always in power. Whatever is causing you anxiety try to keep gathering your courage to confront. The more you do this, the more comfortable you'll feel. When you feel anxious, welcome the panicky feeling instead of opposing it. It's inferior against your free will. <br>  <br>  Make sure you get an adequate amount of sleep and nutrition and otherwise go about with your life and do not revolve all your actions around the panic attack. What happened happened and it was natural. Your mind tends to exaggerate with irrational lies and give you a fake reality. Don't give into these negative thoughts. Stay in touch with the nature around you and keep facing the anxiety. It's just a feeling. A feeling does not define who you are as a person.|`|16NYiltUaa	i can totally relate. there are times when i constantly have feelings of derealization. and it sucks. i can definitely feel your pain :(

HetjZkdmaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

6e8a2562119ae10db7789da7710dfe93aa	I'm really sorry you have to deal with the emotional fallout of the molestation/sexual assault.I really hope that you get some help moving on through counselling. If you can/don't want to get formal counselling from a qualified counsellor/therapist, at least think about talking to others who have been through the same thing. Sadly I think you'll find there are plenty. Ask your local YWCA, health authorities, or even public library where you might find such a group.<br>  <br>  I suspect that your fear of HIV is more rooted in the trauma than in reality. After getting tested at 3 plus months, the test would have been approximately 90% accurate- that is 100% accurate in about 90% of cases. A compromised/stressed immune system would more likely have shown a positive sooner, rather than later.* A test again at the 6 month point or later  would be considered 100% accurate.*<br>  <br>  If you want that small, nagging doubt removed- I know you do- just get another test. It's easy and will give you peace of mind on this point at least. The doctors/nurse/lab tech do not need to know, do not care how you may or may not have contracted HIV. (Which,I don't believe you have)A fake name is not necessary, though in some places you can get anonymous testing. (Personally I think getting an HIV test is simply being a responsible person and I believe those doing the testing would think that too) <br>  <br>  I wish you luck in going forward and I hope that you will be able to enjoy sex with a trustworthy person. A counsellor can help you enjoy that normal pat of normal life again. Best of luck.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	Go to www.hivtest.org and you can find locations where you can test for free. HIV testing is confidential so they will not look at your past. I would say you are 99.6% sure of being HIV negative, but I would suggest retesting for you peace of mind. Good Luck.

AA11185595	A suicidal person will DO IT regardless of drugs if they really want to , I have looked everyday for a pain free method for months regardless of drugs and i'm on many and can probably speak for many, drugs only tone a person to a level where reality comes back , only problem , the doctors reality and the person being prescribed are worlds apart and its the doctor who prescribes, sorry but its the truth.

AA11020187	They would use radiological guidance. Even with sold tumors they do not rely on feeling the tumor usually a clip or needle is inserted into the tumor before surgery to make easier to find and to help insure good margins. However, this cannot be done in your situation. You should be scheduled for a mammogram, a breast MRI and an appointment with a breast surgeon. Ask them how many of these surgeries they have done and have them explain how they will do it. Then get at least one other opinion.

1ylpCN3yaa	It depends on the brain injury, type and severity. If you have a bang to the head. ie someone hits you on the head with a hammer, that's one type. If you have a collision impact in a moving vehicle for eg you get 2 impacts one when your brain collides with the skull and one when your head hits the windshield or other object.You can also suffer brain injury from strokes and brain hemorrhage. The 4th type is form loss of oxygen to the brain ie drug overdose. the 4th type has very poor recovery rate in terms of regaining use of limbs and reasoning.  <br>  <br>  To recover from a brain injury caused by trauma or stroke/bleeding takes time (lots) and the outcome depends on the original severity of the injury, the time it took to get your emergency medical help, and the quality of the rehabilitation available to you.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately it is often the case that the girlfriend/boyfriend leaves the victim after the injury. However I have noticed that married partners tent to be much more faithful to the victim.<br>  <br>  100 % recovery is possible for mild head injuries or near enough to 100%<br>  <br>  If you worry about this never climb a ladder, go horse rideing, motor bike riding, or trail bike riding, and don't drink and drive or speed.<br>  <br>  To prevent stroke don't smoke or drink, and eat a low cholesterol diet. And control stress levels. And don't do drugs!

You would be surprised what stress can do to a person, if you do have a disorder the only one I can think of is anxiety which is very common and it can cause you to become distracted and unable to focus, and it is very frustrating.

94NYYq5Haa	It sounds like you have some significant anxiety and gender issues, as you said.  <br>  <br>  However, given what you are saying here, I would call the Asperger's a misdiagnosis. It doesn't fit with your explanation. Autism spectrum disorders are becoming more over-diagnosed and less understood by the public all the time.  <br>  <br>  I think you should see a therapist about the anxiety first.|`|RIZpDdNgaa	As I have given you advice before, you know what i have said about the anxiety and OCD.  Those two things you are going to have to work at for them to get better, you have to put a stop to those thoughts and make sure that they don't get to you.  Everyone does have unwanted thoughts, if everyone let them get to them they would all be freaking out as well.  But people with OCD just have the repition which gets very hard to manage.  I have told you the stop technique and the one where you just think about the topic so much you eventually get sick of it and stop.  Everything you are describing is a part of OCD, especially the unwanted thoughts and the need for a strict schedule, you need to start breaking those habits and you feel so much better.
q5n2Zuq9aa	There's a couple things wrong with that question.<br>  <br>  First, your uterus doesn't have nerves to detect any real feeling. Your uterus can feel pressure, but no pain or pleasure.<br>  <br>  Second, you'd have to go through your cervix to get to your uterus. No penis (or anything else, besides sperm) can get through your cervix because it is closed all the time except for a few occasions.<br>  <br>  Those occasions in which your cervix is open are you period and while giving birth. During your period, it's only open enough to allow a trickle of fluid. I don't think I have to explain birth, lol. Obviously, there's a baby occupying that space.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Your uterus has no feeling...|`|94ITHKFTaa	wtf....<br>  <br>  didn't know there was any such thing

So if you put in a size TOO big, It'll soak up TOO much causing you to be dehydrated and what not. at least that's how i was told.|`|htBHCNDtaa	You don't get Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) from putting a tampon in wrong, you get it from leaving it in too long. The bacteria tends to build up in the vagina which then leads to some kind of shock.|`|uxe4Hroxaa	Yes you can get it from tampons. You get it because if you leave it in for too long bacteria starts to build up which causes toxic shock.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_shock_syndrome" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_shock...</a>|`|3PzVT6RNaa	It is believed that tampons can cause toxic shock because they provide a warm, moist environment where bacteria can thrive. In order to reduce the chances of TSS, it is important to wash your hands before and after inserting a tampon, change tampons frequently (every four to six hours), alternate between pads and tampons if possible and use the lowest absorbency possible for your flow.<br>  There are two kinds of toxic shock syndrome: the most common is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria that usually lives inside the nose, but can be found anywhere on the human body.|`|6mrczOO4aa	it has nothing to do with putting it in wrong, but if you don't insert it properly, it can be slightly uncomfortable.<br>   toxic shock comes from bacteria from the blood absorbed by the tampon. that's why women have to change a tampon, at most, every 8 hours. also toxic shock happens more with the SUPER absorbant.<br>  so try and use normal.|`|a2O4qDpnaa	it happens when you accidentally stick it up your butt.

bvW10BU6aa	I have had many ovarian cysts. i have had two that have required emergency laproscopic surgery. Ovarian cysts can be very painful and the pain can worsen during intercourse or anything stimulating that cause hormones and pheremones to be released. I dont think your g/f could be pregnant from dry sex with clothes on. Intercourse or rubbing your genitals against each other bare yes that could lead to pregnancy. She should definently see a OB/GYN and have a ultrasound. They are'nt painfuland they can spot exactly where the cyst is how large and how deadly. She should really get checked out . In some cases cysts can burst causing extreme severe pain. The womens ovaries are the equivilant of a mans balls. So could you imagine the pain. In some instances the burst can cause so much damage that it could lead to infertilty and the loss of an ovary. But for the most part they go away on their own. I also highly recomend birth control pills they help lesser lighter periods and less ovarian cysts. A warm pack and hot bath and anti inflammatories can help. If the pain persists see a doctor right away! Emergency room ect. Good luck to you and her. : )|`|NF2nBRF8aa	the person who wrote all the **** is a flippin idiot...but anyways no there isnt a chance of being pregnant.

It's actually really painful. I wouldn't think the dry sex would cause her cyst to act up, but the hormones could affect it. Maybe go into a medical forum and ask about that.

When I eat a weed brownie, my entire body  feels like it's flying and isn't focused in my head.|`|XJlD2kPsaa	not really, it would affect you i think it was slower? im not entirely sure, but its either faster or slower because its going into your blood differently, and your ingesting the weed instead of inhaling. But really just taking the drug isnt good for you|`|JPFPzKWmaa	The effects are much stronger.  There is a different body buzz which is much more pleasurable/euphoric, and a different mental buzz which is generally stronger and more ...sort of confusing and dreamlike.  I find the mental buzz to be too strong for me unless I take a very small bite or the brownie is weak.   Also it lasts a lot longer.   If you are considering eating it for the first time take it really slow.  The effects take a couple hours to peak and it's easy to overdo it.|`|uUvV7eadaa	in the same category, sort of, but the high is different. eating a brownie will relax your muscles, it won't effect your brain.
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi twist,<br>  <br>  Are you sure your doctor said hypo and not hyper?<br>  <br>  Either way it doesn't sound as though you have much of a problem. however it would be a good idea to get another test done firstly to tell you whether there is a problem or not, and secondly to get it recorded on your medical records for future reference.<br>  <br>  love mel.X|`|7OXsLMcKaa	well i would say that since fluctuations in the blood due to different amounts of certain vitamins in various foods do sometimes cause minor fluctuations in the thyroid, u were probably misdiagnosed.
H05PGfcDaa	Hi,<br>  Your experience sounds the same as something I had once and believe it or not I know about 7 other people who have experienced it too... I don't KNOW what it is but I think it has something to do with your brain and body waking up at different times causing a hallucination...<br>  everyone who tells me about it insists that it is a ghost scaring them and paralyzing their body while the mind is in a vulnerable half sleeping state but your mind plays tricks on you... and it's all part of the hallucination.<br>  As for how often it happens... well most people I've spoken to have only ever had it happen once... and it will most likely never happen again in there lifetimes... I think... then there's my brother who went through a stage where it happened often... but don't worry I'm sure it won't happen to you again and if it does just remember that you know what it is and it can't hurt you and it will end quickly.<br>  <br>  It's not supernatural just a weird hillucination of the half sleep and always goes away leaving no damage- nothing to worry about!<br>  <br>  hope that makes you feel better =]|`|s3MwmnKkaa	Sleep paralysis. Are you stressed out over anything lately? You might think you are not stressed, when in reality you might be. I used to get panic attacks, and still sometimes do, so if you think it's not sleep paralysis, try to calm down.<br>  Sometimes dreams get too vivid, and you end up with it. There's nothing you can do really, except maybe loosen up and relax after it's over, and, better yet, before you go to bed.|`|5aJYBKJ4aa	Happened to me to.

V8GrFx0jaa	CF has many possible genotypes. There are currently about 100 markers that are most likely to result in the disease, but there are actually even more than that.

Eating healthy means you'll be eating less and probably more green- and there isn't too much energy to be found in lettuce. You may want to keep it at this amount instead of increasing, because you'll get tired. However, you're endurance may increase as well, so it all depends.<br>  <br>  This will make you loose weight over time, but I encourage you to get in a habit instead of a loose weight quick scheme. You sound like you have the right idea. Perservere!

VT1HouZwaa	Whether your vision is perfect or you need a prescription, you'll need to visit a doctor to get your eyes examined. That way, the doctor can determine the base curve and diameter of the contacts so they'll fit your eyes.<br>  <br>  Colored contact lenses really vary in realism. It depends on your natural eye color and the way the colors are shown on the lenses. Acuvue, FreshLook, DuraSoft, Expressions, and ClearlyColors are popular brands. I've used FreshLook ColorBlends contacts in green and they appear natural on my light brown eyes, making them look olive-green.<br>  <br>  If you've got your heart set on blue eyes, I'd recommend getting "color-blend" contacts. They're not just one shade of the color (which tends to look artificial) but include two or three colors shaded like a natural iris.<br>  <br>  So, visit your local opthamologist and ask about colored contacts. You'll probably be able to try contacts on at the office so you can choose which brands and colors you like the most. Good luck!|`|xvey8ixPaa	You still need an eye exam and a fitting for contacts and a prescription to order them. Even if you have no correction. They are considered a medical device and have to have an RX. In my opinion, ALL colored contacts look fake. I sell them all day. Kids your age love them. But you can tell that they are not real. Sorry, kid. Just the facts.

f8mLpPXlaa	I don't know how old you are but it'd good for you to see a doctor because it sounds like strep throat. If you develop a rash and/or a fever and have swollen glands it's almost sure to be strep<br>  Since you didn't complain about cold symptoms this is typical of strep. Get started on treatment ASAP. In the meantime gargle with salt water(1/2 tsp in 8oz water)[no stronger] and ,make it warm. use Cepacol lozenges to ease the pain. You can take tylenol or advil also.<br>  Yeah, I know the pills will hurt to swallow but take them with yogurt or ice cream and they'll slide right down.<br>  God bless.|`|AA11327222	It sounds like either Mono or Strep Throat.

Put your mouth on the piece or j or whatever you're smoking and just take the biggest breath you can possibly take and don't exhale right away hold it in for like 10 seconds. The longer you wait to exhale the higher you get so even if you take a small hit you'll feel it. The reason people don't get high the first time is because they don't know how to smoke it.|`|RyM0V39aaa	My first time I thought I was inhaling right too but really it takes a little while to get a "good" hit.

Bad weed aka garbage weed<br>  2. You didn't inhale correct, inhale and hold it for 3-4 seconds<br>  <br>  Those are the only reasons why you didnt feel anything,FYI is the weed is brown it's bad weed,and if it's really green its great weed. If you do find your self smoking bad weed you need to hit it more times to get the effect.|`|uUvV7eadaa	its normal for people not to get high the first time. just smoke again in the next week and you'll get high.<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers!<br>  legalize.

pX1hfQnfaa	One of the first things is to make sure you're getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep pales skin, making dark circles more prominent, whereas having a healthy sleep pattern restores the luster in skin.<br>  Also, be sure to drink plenty of water. Fluids help improve circulation and also gives skin a natural "glow".<br>  I've also found it helpful to put cool, moist tea bags on your eyes. Be sure, though, that they are not citrus- it can be irritating and sting the eyes. Also be sure, before using tea bags, that you are not allergic to any of the ingredients. <br>  If your concealer is the only option, experts say that a yellow-tinted concealer works best because it neutralizes the dark color of the circles.|`|00sn8G9paa	Don't party on weekdays.|`|FyEYarmqaa	I heard cucumbers work.

HcoYZdy1aa	I forget what ingredients are on Nyquil but I believe it has an antihistamine as one of the ingredients<br>  <br>  Check the bottle and if it does, benadryl is also an antihistamine so it is not recommended to take both because you are doubling up the antihistamine<br>  <br>  If the Nyquil has no antihistamine in it then you can take both and you most likely will sleep very well|`|SYQo7Oqbaa	i woundnt think so because usually benadryl makes people drousy and nyquil can make people drunk and if u double downers that is nooooottttt good|`|qnDk8xjPaa	No! Both of those products can really knock you out as it is.  I wouldn't mix them.|`|Tq8B6zF8aa	no.<br>  <br>  dont do it.|`|bFKjV7U5aa	1. You shouldn't take products containing acetaminophen (such as NyQuil) only to help you sleep. They are bad for your liver.<br>  <br>  2. You should avoid long term sedative use unless you are being supervised by a doctor. You can become tolerant or dependent and then you REALLY won't be able to sleep even with larger doses.<br>  <br>  3. With those things in mind, for short term help I recommend you take 50mg of Benadryl. See your doctor to treat long-term insomnia. <br>  <br>  Do not take both as the Nyquil contains doxylamine, which is also a sedative.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	I wouldn't, you don't know how your body will react to both of them at the same time. If you want to sleep now, I would just take one of them, not both.

It doesn't mean that you have a problem or you are a monster. Watch your parents, are they tall?? ask your parents how tall they were at your age. Also, for your comfort, I met a girl that being 14 years old she was 6'03''....but that is just extreme XD

nrTVlo8Eaa	Ear lobes are not as prone to getting infected as ear cartilage piercings, but the same aftercare should be shown for both.<br>  <br>  Buy some H2Ocean sea salt spray, and spray the new piercings 4 to 6 times a day. Try as hard as you can to avoid holding dirty telephone receivers to your ear, and NEVER touch a new piercing with dirty fingers. Keep your hair off the piercings when you can, and keep your pillow case clean.<br>  <br>  Read <a href="http://www.bmezine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmezine.com</a> for wonderful after care advice.|`|UTumb3Ssaa	Put ketchup on your ears before getting it pierced.
1vaqtRI2aa	Try playing with your clit as opposed to fingering yourself. Several women often can't achieve orgasm through fingering alone as easily as when you play with your clit. Watch some porn while you do it, read an erotic novel or short story.. Whatever floats your boat.<br>  <br>  When you're in the shower, try using your showerhead (a detachable one of course) or the tub faucet (lower yourself so you're laying on the floor and let the water gush onto your clit) or try a vibrator. But you should always know how to pleasure yourself with your hand BEFORE you buy a vibe.<br>  And always buy from <a href="http://www.smittenkitten.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.smittenkitten.com</a> or <a href="http://www.babeland.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babeland.com</a> so you know you won't get a toxic jelly vibrator as opposed to a safe silicone one.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|W8UZebRWaa	any brand of steel wool|`|aae33ca98ed4acc2878892601466ebc5aa	Do you have a removable shower head?

These are good for beginners. <br>  <br>  If you want to do it by hand, it can be different for everyone, but I suggest rubbing your labia together rapidly and use lots of lube.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	It sounds a lot like bipolar to me. There is no more severe mood disorder than bipolar - that is the most severe one.  You have to get professional help - for bipolar, that usually means both meds & counseling, for a lifetime. If you have had only one or two episodes of bipolar so far, then maybe the meds don't have to be forever, but it seems you have detected a pattern - so you probably will have episodes the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Usually if you get pure manias, you take lithium. If you get mixed moods - agitated depressions, for example - then you take depakote. If you have no real manias, and depression is your problem, you take lamictal. Those are the first meds tried.<br>  <br>  I get nightmares all the time.  I had one recently where a guy was decapitating people, one by one.  Really gruesome & upsetting. 3 months ago, I died in a dream, and I have been terrified of death ever since. That has helped me control suicide impulses at least.<br>  <br>  Go see a psychiatrist (not a GP, except to get a referral if needed) and a counselor. If it isn't bipolar, it is still pretty severe, sounds like.<br>  <br>  PS anxiety is common with bipolar. My doc doesn't diagnose the anxiety seperately - she just considers it a symptom of the bipolar.  And you don't have to be a jerk to have bipolar. I am kind to others almost always. Only my husband sees me at my bad times, and I still control it 95% of the time. I inflict all the torment onto myself, not others.|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	Manic Depressive.  The highs and lows...Based on your dream and the majority of the behavior your describing you don't only have a disorder that is depressive or mood related, you also have an anxiety disorder, it sounds ilke you have severe anxiety, which I sufer with along with clincal depression.  I've never heard of tri-polar but you have to be a real B*&tch to be bi polar|`|x1DAQAu0aa	yea, you know u would feel way better if u cut the drinking and the weed, go to a support group 4 help. if u really do have something wrong, i gaurantee u that drugs will not help at all. go to a support group seriously,you'll feel better! :) :) :)

For one thing the dosage is probably directed towards someone older.<br>  <br>  You won't believe me, but 13 is too young to be worrying about weight. Wait until you actually are 18. :)|`|MzWM9rBRaa	It's not recommended for anyone under 18 to take any supplement because results aren't clear on the side effects.  Your body is still growing at your age and it's impossible to tell what will happen.  <br>  <br>  You probably will not die though.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	I don't think you'll die but it may somehow stump your growth.|`|x6WWnbdhaa	I took those too!  Literally!  They gave me diarreha and backed up my system and I only took two or three.  You are not going to die but do not eat any more.  These people who made them should really be sued.  I probably dropped five pounds because I went number two so many times.  Go  back to your regular diet and you especially do not need them at age 13.|`|v6hvLQOjaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically.

They're all scams.<br>  <br>  <br>  You might get some weight lose but end up just gaining it back plus more.

xvxT46iJaa	If you truly understood what it's like to be bulimic, you would not be asking this question.<br>  If you want to lose weight, get off your @ss and get down the gym, and start eating more healthily.<br>  Bulimia is not something to be messed with, and it certainly isn't something to wish upon yourself. It's a disease and it can have fatal consequences.<br>  I think you should get someone to take you to the ward at your local hospital where those with eating disorders end up, just so you can see the reality of it all, and how unglamourous it really is.<br>  Grow up and be glad that you aren't bulimic as it is something that can follow you for the rest of your life.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You don't just become bulemic you foolish little girl. It's a disease that effects your mind and tears apart your body like other eating disorders; it is not a diet trend. Your face becomes puffy, you turn sallow, you can rupture your stomach and esophagus, wind up losing teeth, have an aneurysm, blow out the veins in your eyes, mess up your electrolytes, become anemic, go into cardiac arrythmia and then die of a heartattack. Eating disorders are serious medical and mental health conditions that shouldn't be glorified by anyone. People like you make it so much harder for those of us who actually have these issues to find help because eating disorders are thought of as a plea for attention by stupid teenagers.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Bulimia has a high death rate! WEIGHT LOSS: You can eat a LOT, yet still lose weight, and have a LITTLE of your favorites every day, to prevent cravings, by consuming mostly low energy foods, such as cucumber, tomato, capsicum/bell peppers, celery, onion slices pickled in vinegar, grated carrot, cabbage, spinach, asparagus, watercress, alfalfa, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, capers, a few olives, etc., with some lean protein, to delay the emptying of your stomach. Have a large glass of water 20 mns before eating. If you don't drink enough water, you won't lose weight as quickly! One of the tips I got through <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> is to stir half a teaspoonful of hot paprika, or chilli powder, into a glass of water, and drink it just before eating, and you will eat less, as a result.

iw9yogtMaa	You are correct in noting that there is a similarity in the symptoms of cerebral palsy and parkinson's disease.  While there is a greater likelihood of developing arthritis and osteoarthritis, there isn't any greater chance of developing PD if you have CP.<br>  <br>  The root causes appear to be different.  PD seems to be cause by protein misfolding and may be genetic in origin although that remains to be fully proven.  Research is looking in that direction now, especially at the Mayo Clinic.<br>  <br>  CP is said to be cause primarily by developmental brain damage or neurological damage to the developing brain.  <br>  <br>  Have you spoken to your neurologist about you recent symptoms? You need to document exactly where and when these new symptoms appear and occur.<br>  <br>  In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, tremor and body stiffness often appear only on one side of the body.  They do not become unilateral until stage 3.  Which is not to say that all PD patients are the same.  They aren't and the symptoms vary considerably.<br>  <br>  Perhaps there has been a change in your muscle tone.  You didn't mention which type of cerebral palsy you did have. You symptoms are also indicative of at least two types of CP.<br>  <br>  How's you depth perception?  Could you have ataxic CP?<br>  <br>  I can understand and appreciate your worries and thing that the best way to get some answers is to meet with a neurologist who specializes in both CP and neuro-motor diseases.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	i doubt it......<br>  <br>  I do have arthritis though<br>  <br>  I'm 44 have CP .......same as you--<br>  <br>  Parkinson's disease is more debilitating than CP

1vaqtRI2aa	Simply: Yes.<br>  <br>  Stress and lots of other things (lack of certain vitamins, severe weight loss, etc.) will cause you to miss your period. It's nothing to worry about. Watch a good movie, get yourself some ice cream and relax. You'll get your period!|`|9EVcTnUWaa	It could be a combination of both.

AA10481903	Hi rcarm.  I am a retired Chiropractor.  Below is a link to the admissions requirements to my alma mater, the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic (LACC), which is now a part of the Southern California University of Health Sciences<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scuhs.edu/PageInfo.aspx?id=1154" rel="nofollow">http://www.scuhs.edu/PageInfo.aspx?id=11...</a><br>  <br>  I encourage you to click on the "request information" link on that page so that you can get in contact with the admissions people.  They will be very happy to assist you in planning your education for a career as a Doctor of Chiropractic.  It is never too early to start planning, so I encourage you to contact them.<br>  <br>  It does not matter what subject you get your four year college degree in.  You just need to complete all of the pre-requisite courses (physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, etc.).  And, of course, you need to have competitive grades.  <br>  <br>  Frankly, the more extensive your 'science' education is as an undergraduate, the easier your professional training will be (you will be used to taking lots of hard classes and you will have a solid science foundation that prepares you for the advanced science courses in Chiropractic college).

WdBCECa1aa	You're 14 years old and having sex? Damn. 6 inches is completely normal, but having sex at 14 is not. At least in my opinion. Even any 'sexual activity'. But hey, it's your life.|`|ch3cnSTzaa	dude you're about average for a full grown male and yet you still have time to grow man. Girls your age have no clue as to what is really big or not. If they've seen one it was probably a baby's, a cousins, or a little brothers by accident. Your safe for now. Now when you get to college....well we'll save that for later.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	6 inches is normal for me.|`|HYQ1VI5raa	dude I'm not gonna lie... you have absolutely NOTHING to worry about. I'm pretty much the same exact age as you and mines that same size. Anywhere around 6 inches is above average for young teens. Email me if you have questions in this area.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	it's natural to look down and think it's small. i wear a size 15 shoe and i don't see my feet as very big. it's just because you see it every day. trust me 6 1/4 is big enough for any woman of any age.|`|aAcjC22gaa	Six inches is perfectly normal that is the average size for an adult man. You are fine especially because you still have some time before the end of puberty. You will be above the average so stop worrying.|`|ZSW2X8mhaa	No, that's not small, not by a stretch of an imagination.<br>  <br>  Average penis' are 4-6inches.<br>  <br>  I hate these questions because you always get an idiot out there to criticise you about it.<br>  <br>  Kid, don't worry about it, I'm 20. Penis' don't stop growing until your 21ish. I often keep thinking mine's "too thin" but hell, it don't stop my girlfriend craving for it. End of the day mate, just play it safe, wear a condom, enjoy life.<br>  <br>  I would say don't try having sex before 16 - but that would make me a hypocrite and nobody likes being lectured against their will. So just be safe about it :)|`|1nFtIq6daa	you really don't care about the size of your penis, your just over concerned about being embarrassed. the best cure, or what i found to be the best cure, for shame is arrogance. sheer unadulterated arrogance, seriously, have you ever tried to laugh at someone who's being completely honest about something that is so-called "embarrassing"? you can't, theres no shame.<br>  <br>  and, its not the size that matters, its how you wiggle it.|`|MiDEucdNaa	I don't think it is too small. Is it skinny or thick? It all depends on the girl. Some like it short and thick, some like it long and skinny, some even like it small. But I think there is a lot more to it then just the size. Your very young and have a long time to learn. Here are some things you can do when you are ready to have sex...<br>  <br>  Fore-play, sometimes this is the best part :-)<br>  <br>  Turn her on first (dont just put it in) get her so wet that she will want it even if you are 2 inches.<br>  <br>  Good luck younglin and wrap it up :-D|`|u6Hv8tA6aa	Thats very normal.  Most guys like to lie about their penis size and claim their like 12 inches.  It's not true.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askmen.com/sports/health/health4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askmen.com/sports/health/heal...</a><br>  <br>  Check that out.

MyUi3Blyaa	Can you do anything with the cutting to release the pressure on the sides of your nail?<br>  I found that with my big toe that every so often if I cut a V in the middle of the nail tip that the nail grows straighter at the sides. Just use an emery board so it doesn't catch in the socks. I never seem to get the problems and pain I used to but that was when I was running a lot more than I do now:)|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	Soak your toe in an epsom salts solution, in warm water for about 20 minutes, a few times every day, until the swelling goes down. And you can also try cold packs. Unfortunately, swelling takes time to go down. Don't irritate it further while it's healing--it sounds like you've done everything you can do, and now it's just a waiting game.|`|Ybkxy4H2aa	You may have some small pieces of nail still stuck inside the meat.  If had it operated on once, if I were you I'd go for another checkup.  For now apply heat then cool.  I there is no pain it should be fine for now but just put aspercreme on it for now...<br>  Also soak your feet in Epsom salt solution.<br>  <br>  :)
CciXZNYraa	Eat nutritious foods that are high in calories. Examples are whole-grain breads, vegetables such as avocados and potatoes, kidney beans, lean red meat, poultry and fish. <br>  <br>  Increase the caloric value of your meals. Add powdered milk to casseroles for added calories, add avocados and olives to sandwiches, add wheat germ to your cereal, add chopped meat to your pasta sauce, and so on. <br>  <br>  Avoid skipping meals. Knowing how to gain weight involves consistent eating. Eat three meals a day and at least two snacks. <br>  <br>  Increase your normal portion size. Take a second scoop of pasta, or add two bananas to your oatmeal. <br>  <br>  Choose higher-calorie foods when given a choice. For example, corn is higher in calories than green beans. <br>  <br>  Relax - excessive fidgeting and restlessness can burn up a lot of calories. <br>  <br>  Add weight lifting to your exercise program. It helps build muscle mass. <br>  <br>  Balance your caloric intake with the number of calories you're burning. You need to be taking in more than you use up, and you may need to ease up a little on your exercise program.|`|qnD5RfbPaa	I take it you just wants to be bigger,  not necessarily fatter.  For good health you need to be eating from all the major food groups - fats, proteins, carbohydrates, water.<br>  <br>  Your carbohydrates should be in the form of vegetables, fruits and starches. Your proteins should be in the form of fish, and other sea foods, meats, dairy products, nuts, seeds, grains, legumes etc.  Your fats you will get from meats and other protein foods.<br>  <br>  Eat most of your meals as vegetables - carrots, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, cucumber, celery, parsley, etc.  Most of your vegetables should be eaten raw.  These will supply you with fat soluble vitamins and some minerals.<br>  Make about 20% of your diet fresh raw fruits of all kinds - a very wide variety.  These will supply you with water soluble vitamins.<br>  Your starches however are better obtained from whole foods - yams, potatoes, pumpkins, breadfruits, green banana, etc.<br>  Normally I would recommend 10% starch and 10% protein for your daily diet.  In your case, until, you acquire the desired size, I will say make approximately 10% of your diet starch and 20% proteins.  Eat all kinds of foods - a very wide variety and drink 8 - 10 glasses of water per day.  In this way you will acquire normal size and keep in good health.|`|MpTZjdLJaa	going to a fastfood joint doesnt just make you fat, it gives you a higher blood pressure because of the cholestrol. you shouldnt just count calories but see what else is in the food<br>  <br>  now to your question, the easiest way to gain wait is to eat protien<br>  that is the muscle building stuff<br>  eat protien and work out a little and you will start gaining wieght (not in a bad way)<br>  muscle wieghs more than fat|`|34tNnzQ7aa	It depends on your height if you're really too skinny but if you want to become healthier, just try eating more. It doesn't have to be high in sugar, fats, carbs, etc. But if you add a little more of it in your meals, then you will become healthier. Try not to put it on in a short period of time. Gaining back the weight you lost over the next half to a full year would probably be best.|`|9yPEjN4Xaa	Healthy fats with omega 3 in them. Tuna, salmon, flax and walnuts. Up your protein which means eating more lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes. And last healthy carbs that are in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. You have to balance your diet. Eat several small meals during the day and buy some Carnation instant breakfast. Mix it with 1% milk but use it a filler for in between meals.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	Junk food just makes you slaggy so dont hit on that.<br>  Protein bars , Omega vitamins , eat allot of fish , beef?<br>  When summer comes hit up the ice cream?
aYgj4cIBaa	I hate to say this-but suffering from them personally(I have one now in fact), once it has blistered, you really just have to wait it out. I find that Carmex works really well to keep it moist & cuts down on the itching. I have tried just about every over the counter product & haven't noticed anything great. Also, stay away from chocolate & peanuts as they have an amino acid in them(l-arginine) that aggravates the virus. Hope that helps!
hI0ZWBycaa	You could've pulled your shoulder out of socket. Pinched a nerve. Severely bruised it. Pulled muscle. It's best not to guess and have it evaluated by a doctor who will know for sure. Sometimes for those kinds of injuries they will place your elbow in a sling for a week, depending on how much pain you are in. They can usually tell by evaluation but may need to order x-rays to be certain.
pOwOYqhEaa	Go to the ER if you dont want to wait for your doctors appointment. Six months is a long time not to heal? What happened at your six week apptment, did you get the OK from your doc? as for the discharge sounds like ovulation.|`|h6bIfvOzaa	it is possible that you do have a yeast infection, if you had one before and you cleared up your yeast infection but your husband did not get treatment as well, he can then pass this infection back to you again.  men are asympotamic most times for yeast infections.<br>  as for the bleeding, i would do as the previous reply suggested, go to the emergency room if your doctors appointment is too far off.
UOZP4Ma5aa	Its a high possibility of nerve damage, if its been 5 years the chance it will return is very low, but if its not causing you any functional or esthetic problems leave it, as nothing much can be done except reattaching the nerves and this is risky|`|wOecmtrzaa	Oh man I'm so sorry that you had to go through that.  <br>  <br>  Yeah, if a nerve was disturbed then the feeling may not entirely ever come back.  nerves regenerate at an allmost nonexistant pace, so probably bothering it again would most likely be best.  <br>  <br>  Theres probably some suppliment regimine that people who have had nerve regeneration could tell you that may help you regain feeling.<br>  <br>  Mabey you can stimulate it with heat to increase the blood flow and get your brain used to what it feels like now.  Be really careful, though, you wouldn't want to hurt yourself when you can't feel it.<br>  <br>  Glad your jaw is in its place how you like it, though.<br>  <br>  Good luck getting feeling back.

Wait a couple days, it might just be a little bit off...if it's more than a week late take a pregnancy test, just to make sure.|`|58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	Having sex won't push back your period unless you're pregnant.  Something else could have pushed back your period such as stress...but having sex won't do it.
TyqGdBw1aa	when you lose weight it will seem bigger because it will tend  to almost hide under access body weight. but your 14 years old don't worry about it for now. when you fully hit puberty it will grow.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Any guy who wants can try this; maybe when you get out of the shower or any time you are naked stand straight up in front of a mirror, stick your gut out as far as possible and arch your spine, as though you were imitating santa clause - now look down. You'll notice that your penis appears to be much smaller.<br>  <br>  In people who are over weight, the excessive fat pulls on the spine and produces an affect that makes the penis appear to be smaller. In 20 lbs - over weight - can reduce the appearance if a penis by 1 inch, while erect.<br>  <br>  Now being over weight actually does not affect the size of your penis, just the appearance. If an over weight person lays down or the get into a position where the spine and pelvic region of the body are bent forward, the penis size is still the same size as it would be if the person was not over weight.<br>  <br>  Losing weight is a good idea in general. It will increase your health, your self confidence and it can make your penis appear to be larger.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	It doesn't affect the size of it per se, only the appearance of how big or small it looks. <br>  <br>  Loosing weight and getting onto healthy eating habits is always a good idea, and your body will love you for it.<br>  <br>  As you are going through puberty, you will grow; so will your penis. Gradually. There's every reason for doing the best you can to have a healthy thinner body (but not starve yourself) so that you have more energy, greater self-esteem, and live longer with fewer illnesses. That alone should be enough to get you started.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Don't be embarrassed. Being overweight simply makes what you have look smaller. You are perfectly okay, don't worry about it. You are going to get bigger each year until you are 20 or so, anyway. you will be a perfect, sexy looking guy before you know it.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on deciding to lose the weight. Just realise, it took a while to get there, so allow it a while to go. Make losing your weight into an interesting hobby. It will help you greatly.|`|3WeAfZNraa	For men, fat is usually store in the stomach.<br>  <br>  For women, it is store in the thighs and breast.<br>  <br>  It make sense.<br>  <br>  In addition, DON'T WORRY. You are only 14 you still have plenty years to grow. I know some guys who are chubby in their teens, but grew up to be slimmer.

I am not over weight, but i had a small penis until i started to use a penis extender, i don't want to advertise the name of it (ask me on email if you want), and some enlargement pills. in one year i got 2 inches in length. good luck with your loosing weight program.|`|V5M9M8Exaa	For some people being overweight and having fat near the pelvis region could cover part of the "usable" part of the penis making it seem smaller. If that is what is happening to you then losing weight will make it bigger. You might not have this problem and if you don't, then nothing will happen.<br>  <br>  Ask a doctor if you're really concerned.|`|QyPAvUBbaa	no its only going to get smaller! like reallly small if you keep losing weight... gods punishing you for eating all those fuckin cupcakes.... sorry

4xN3ZIhYaa	congrats on the scientific breakthrough|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Be like "Bad penis! BAD!" And smack it and tell it behave....<br>  <br>  No your penis is not doing anything wrong. More than likely your semen is just mixing with urea from your urine. You can help to correct this problem by making sure you drink plenty of water. You should drink at least 10 cups of water a day. See urea in urine is actually the substance that gives urine its yellow hue. Drinking water helps to break down urea and make it more clear in color. <br>  <br>  The other possibility is if you are drinking a lot of products with yellow 5 in it or other yellow dyes. Some of these dyes can make it to your bladder, mix with your urine and come out not only when you pee, but when you produce semen.<br>  <br>  Solution: Drink more water and actually drink water. Pop or other substitutes will not help and may actually be the cause.|`|b2d07243a56fe86e58deeafb008493abaa	do not listen to those other fools.<br>  ejaculate which has sperm  and fluids from the prostate can be a whole range of colors.<br>  clear,white,grayish,yellow, or any combination off all these colors.<br>  some time when you masturbate every day you will see a lot of different ejaculate coming out of you, different colors different thickness, it is all good. <br>  nothing to worry about|`|OjbGuHa6aa	Simple your diet can cause sperm to turn yellow.|`|DrjpTADaaa	TOO MANY BANANAS|`|lOXqBBOwaa	I'd think that was pee in your sperm. :DDDD

wOecmtrzaa	I think your problem is a bit of bone loss.  It happens commonly when people don't have teeth or implants to stimulate the bone.  Bone only will grow and stay around where it's needed, and your body probably thinks its a waste of energy to use bone there, since it never gets used.  (Esp. since you may have low blood calcium).<br>  <br>  But it also may be that your denture, since it doesn't fit well, it is rubbing on your mouth and causing an irritation in the gums.  This would most likely produce a smaller "dent"<br>  <br>  The solution is probably to get a better fitting denture, anyway!  A well-fit one will place pressure evenly on all your bone surfaces so that you don't loose bone, and won't press onto any of your tissues.<br>  <br>  I would say try an implant-supported denture, but since you have bone problems it might be hard to find a perio/DDS who will be willing to place the implants.  Perhapse someone will place extra and hope that a couple will osseointegrate?<br>  <br>  Anyway, whichever method you choose, try your dentist out "_"

The juice box and tablets are best because they work faster.<br>  <br>  Has your doctor given you a glucagon?  This is a shot that is given if you have passed out or are having a seizure or something because your blood sugar is so low.  It may be a good idea to ask about this.  <br>  <br>  You should carry an extra backpack, or put all of this stuff in an easy access compartment.  Be sure to tell the people you are hiking with about this and what to do.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!

AA11286455	Yes, honey, alcohol CAN do this to you even if you're only a "binge drinker:"  In fact, I'd bet 'ya an easy $50 you were experiencing withdrawal.  (Rest assured, that's an easy win for me.) <br>  <br>  If your symptoms had been any more severe or any worse, at the hospital they would have given you medication to address the symptoms to make you comfortable and to save your life--at that point, it's called DT's (delerium tremens).  And yes, people can have some brain damage or die from it.  <br>  <br>  I'm super surprised, even with your "tolerance level", that you didn't end up with alcohol poisoning after reading what all you consumed.  <br>  <br>  Just think about the phrase "binge drinking".  In and of itself it implies that the person is out of control with regard to volume and timing at a minimum.  <br>  <br>  Binge drinking can sucker you into thinking you've got it all under control...you schedule it betw. the hours of....on specific days only...just this drink and that....<br>  <br>  You may not consider yourself an alcoholic, but try convincing that bottle of beer, that shot of whisky or two, that smoooooth bourbon you like so much, and which you *think* is soooo loving you back....<br>  <br>  Alcohol excess IS alcohol excess.  Indeed liver cirrhosis, kidney failure, etc., don't particularly care that you've carefully scheduled your drinking or restricted it to certain days.  The effect is cumulative, as well as episodic.  <br>  <br>  I strongly advise that you Google for "alcoholism test" and honestly answer the questions.  If you see yourself there, then you know...and you will also know that you need to stand and deal.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	Bing drinking kills many people. You are going down that road.

When I went through withdrawl I craved another drink or drug,i had sweats ,tremmors,I felt nautious,no appetite nothing but a drink or drug would make me feel better.I started with alcohol then i was smoking weed.I stuck there for a long time but would do the occasional hit of acid or eat a few pills but still just thought I was going through the party stage untill i ended up in rehab because my blood pressure was dangerously high because I was going through alcohol and xanax withdrawl.I got out and did the right thing for a few months but it wasnt long before I was partying again.Im from charleston sc,its a tourist,college and party town but then I moved to columbus ohio.I got into a bad car accident and was in the hospital for a while and I was put on oxy-contin.I got to where i was addicted to those and couldnt go a couple of hours without going into a agonizing withdrawl,puking,shaking,sweating and all i could think about was getting more...i didnt care what it cost.I started shooting it with a syringe and i was  going through about 5 to 6, 80 mg oxy contins a day just to stay out of th hospital.Then i discoveed what would become my drug of choice...HEROIN...it was a monster i was instantly addicted i didnt care about anything but getting high.My withdrawl consisted of puking,dt's being balled up in a ball on the floor because i was so sick that i had to get high,i constantly had a fever,i was always sick and i lost everything,a promising music career,friends,money,jewlrey,a car that was tricked out and worth about $50,000 that i won numerous awards with and was featured in lowrider magazine.I lost my family but most of all myself...I had to get help,i went into detox and i was in for 10 days compared to most peoples 5.After i got out of detox i went into a 26 day program and have been clean ever since.GOD has blessed me for getting clean,Im married and have a beautiful 1 yr old son who is a carbon copy of me and a gift to me...Im sorry for rambling through my whole life story but i thought it might help to show someone that this is a pogressive disease and i hate to see it effect anyone.It sounds like you experienced some very mild withdrawl but trust me it doesnt take long for it to progress.I hope i have said something that helped you and if you have more questions feel free to ask...my email is rab1973@yahoo.com and my name is robert...by the way,whats your name and where are you from

Your body is designed to work as a cohesive unit, and that includes your penis and the foreskin.  Would you cut off your eyelid if you had a bit of grit caught under it?  I doubt it.<br>  <br>  More than likely your masturbation technique is wrong.  This is not unusual for a young boy, and I am guessing that you have not been masturbating for very long.  One of the first things you need to understand is that the foreskin does not have to be pulled back when you are masturbating or, later in life, when you are having sex.  You can leave it in place and you will probably find that masturbation is far more enjoyable.<br>  <br>  If, however, you have a loose foreskin and it tends to come back in an case, simply make sure you are using a lubricant to stop any unwanted friction.<br>  <br>  The other thing is to understand that masturbation is a pleasure.  Dont hurt yourself by rubbing to hard or trying kinky things.  Just let yourself relax and enjoy the ride.  You are welcome to email me if you want further assistance or guidance.<br>  <br>  Next, do not be embarrassed about masturbation.  It is a natural process of being a male.  It is practiced by 99.9% of the boys and men in the world (I am not really sure about that percentage, but it is certainly almost every male in every country and climate).<br>  <br>  Finally, you really should talk to your Dad about things like this.  I dont mean to be imposing by saying this, and I apologise if you do not have a father for whatever reason, but he should be the best person you can get advice from.|`|aAcjC22gaa	Tell the doctor that you need him to look because it hurts when you get an erection so you don't have to tell him that you are masturbating if you're not comfortable. I don't think that you should try any do-it-yourself stuff because it can be dangerous if you don't do it right.
8pQrIL90aa	I have learned that is takes alot of humility to care for someone else who is incapacitated by an illness or even those who are afflicted with a mental disorder. I can say that I was under the care of my mother and father for one year and it was a very unstable rollercoaster, because my father does not harness his opinions and my mother is very headstrong. I hated it because I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I have my spiritual theories about it but he did not bother to listen, overlooking the severe depression that kept me locked away in the darkness for weeks at a time, even calling me names because he felt I was not being "obedient" to his faulty wisdom.<br>  <br>  I will be moving out by the blessings of God, but I would say the best thing I learned is to mind my business and to care for my daughter in such a way that she will have true compassion for the fellow man. She will know the LORD and that way she will know humility and love. I am sorry to hear that, but yes, without a true love for whom one cares for, it is more of a job than a willing submission to duty. Simply out of the love that you hold for one another.<br>  <br>  Pray about it. God will make a way for you, more important trust that if you have faith you will receive the holy spirit, and this way you will increase in the spiritual fruits that will make you sound and strong in the mind and purge out the filthy worldly thing that are inside the soul.<br>  <br>  Hate him not, but pray for him. And take care. God loves you and I do too.|`|A8t8bcJKaa	They "TRY" to order me around & control my life because they think I'm retarded & don't know any better.

CSuMuWlcaa	Um...no, don't do that.<br>  <br>  Liquid soap isn't toxic to prevent people with...odd notions such as this from killing themselves by downing a bottle, but it can't be good for you.  If you want a laxative, try something marketed as one.|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	I don't think so.  I have never heard of such a thing.  I wouldn't do that if I was you.  I think that it might hurt you if you do that.  I would call a doctor first!|`|N89HLv92aa	ewww...I dont know...I never heard of that. That sounds nasty thoo...im not going to try it. Just get some laxative meds.|`|3fRWF83eaa	Ummm... please don't do that. XD Liquid soap is very toxic if you drink it or if it makes contact with the eyes. If your looking for a laxative, the sugar-free Chocolate chip Girl Scout cookies cause a laxident effect if you eat a lot. XD Or buy a laxident at your nearest drugstore .|`|AA11119739	let me clear this up you do not drink soap you squirt it up your rectum and you will go shortly after that|`|ls5uUgx8aa	drink  a lot of apple juice|`|cQFYzAGSaa	Yes, drinking soap will work as a laxative in a similar way that drinking animal oils (grease) does. As was previously mentioned soap suds enema's are what is done medically. <br>  <br>  Some oral laxatives are actually a form of soap albeit made for medical purposes. (not Dial) <br>  <br>  Swallowing liquid soap directly can make you quite sick though so its obviously not advisable to do so. <br>  <br>  As a strait answer, Yes it would act as a laxative, but may also make you sick.|`|s5kVBEmoaa	Bad idea, dear. If you want a laxative, try some epsom salts (you can get them at Walmart and whatever). Liquid soap probably will give you diarrhea, true, but so will anything toxic, probably.

CzJzgeqEaa	Yes & no It depends on your lifestyle if your active you may have needed the extra long nap so get up clean house do chores run you'll sleep just fine. If your not then you might be up pretty late I would say till 12:30 - 1:00 am|`|eZRGGvUoaa	No that much.  Napping usually occurs when night time sleep has been insufficient, and it tends not to disrupt sleeping the following night.|`|nRT7sPXQaa	Yes. It's never a good idea to take naps on school days, no matter how much you want to.|`|USsjb7YLaa	yeah i slept for 3 hours once and i fell asleep at 3 o clock in the morning and woke up at 6
iE449w7jaa	I just went to the doctor today and got tested for mono! Actually yes, my doctor recommended for me to miss the entire week of school, and more if necessary. It is really contagious and you don't want to get any one else sick, so take some time to rest up! Also, your absences should be excused because mono is hard to recover from, it drains energy like crazy! Good luck and feel better!|`|9kvFuuh2aa	i had mono, and i had it for about a month<br>  i would only skip school when symptoms were severe<br>  (such as falling asleep in the bathroom in the morning getting ready)<br>  <br>  don't take too much time off of school though, because later you will have to make up for it.<br>  its alot easier just to go to school - with a few days off in between|`|BrDEyUZraa	yea, usually you're gone for about 3-4 weeks if u have mono and you can't do any sports/ p.e for a period of time, you get a note so that you're excused. <br>  The flu has similar symptoms of mono, i thought i had mono but it tuned out i just had a viral infection|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Where I live,you can not attend school while recovering from infectious mononucleosis.  For your own benefit, the risk of irreversible liver damage is such that complete rest is essential.  This may last for up to six weeks.  For the protection of other students, you are not allowed to attend classes, and the school will provide for you to complete your schoolwork at home. If you are diagnosed with mono, take it seriously and get the rest you'll need to recover without complications.  One of my daughters was home schooled for several weeks while she recovered....she slept almost constantly during that time.  She recovered completely, with no residual organ damage.  That was over 10 years ago.|`|3meIiIsmaa	Some schools require your to stay home for 4 weeks - so you will get well and not expose anyone else -- and get a Dr.'s release before you can go back to school. You are contagious - and if it is mono- a relapse can cause serious problems. Stay home, rest, rest, rest, take your meds - and you'll survive. Because you have a Dr.'s  excuse, you should be able to keep up with your work and take any missed tests, etc. Ask - you may be able to get your assignments online --|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Mononucleosis, aka Mono or the Kissing Disease- is caused by a cytomeglovirus called Epstein-Barr.  It's a virus, meaning that your own immune system has to fight it off, and there isn't much the doctor can do to make it go away faster.  Good news is that it will usually shift along in about 3-4 weeks all by itself.  In the meantime, all you can do is rest and take life slow.  Good hygiene practice will help protect people around you.  It spreads through saliva- which is why kissing is a major way to spread it.  So is sharing cups/glasses/straws.   You want to cover your mouth and nose to cough or sneeze, and wash your hands afterwards.  You would not want to be handling things that will go into or near other people's mouths.   As far as taking time off school, that's something you have to discuss with your parents and possibly teachers.   You may not feel all that energetic, but you are going to feel sapped no matter where you are.  What you do need to avoid is PE, as sports activities are not a good idea right now because the mono can cause the spleen to enlarge slightly and be more suceptible to injury.  Otherwise, for classes you just sit in, you are not in any real danger.  You may want to take a few days to rest, but you won't be able to stay out of school until you are completely recovered.  You recover by simply eating well, resting, drinking plenty of fluids, and listening to your body when it says it's time to chill out.  Mono is more nuisance than anything.|`|tQnE8PPTaa	Yes. My friend has mono and she does this... On Mon-Tues she does a half day. On weds she takes the day off. On Thursday and Friday she does a full day.|`|N89HLv92aa	yes....you can spread it to your class mates. You need to stay home if the doctor really thinks you might have it.|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	Yes it is very contagious and you need to rest up and sleep to heal
LxcDMjnDaa	that happened to me too!! itried everything I could but would get no satisfaction. I just started getting orgasms like 2 weeks ago and omg it feels good! =) all i do is i make sure im home alone and i put on some porn on the computer and just masturbate and i get them easily now.|`|xBgKqAPHaa	i recommend you get a vibrator you will enjoy it in no time|`|ZRgLHW3maa	try using different techniques and stuff, after doing it the same way for so long, it gets boring. try using a finger vibrator (very small vibrator used for the clitoris) and rub it on your clitoris. or try using different objects, just nothing that would break up inside of you or scratch you). the only way that I can orgasm during masterbation is by rubbing on my clitoris. but as far as something being wrong with you, no. it is totally normal. good luck.|`|dpgXzMenaa	Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|kAsY844Aaa	I think it is cause some times i dont get any satisfaction.....<br>  <br>  <br>  ANSWER MINE PLEASEEEEEEE<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AldQc2kgrq8q38RhCDAgRvfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309184407AAe8a1k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|FQjk7PTPaa	Have you ever tried a vibrator?

rgCWPPLmaa	This is nice breakfast, although I have a few suggestions, and a warning (sorry if it's a bit long haha).<br>  <br>  1)Milk contains a lot of gross chemicals, some from the cow and some man-made. If you are concerned about your health and your weight (it seems like you are), please consider at least trying organic milk. The less creepy chemicals you have in your body, the more your body is going to respond to your efforts.<br>  2)Make sure the oatmeal is SLOW cooking, not that instant stuff. Instant = processed = simple carb = sugar = fat. <br>  and the more fibre in there, the better.<br>  3)Replace those raisins with fresh strawberries! Here are a few reasons: the unique nutrients in oats and strawberries work even better for your body when you combine them (seriously! try looking it up at: www.realage.com). Even better reason: dried fruit has more concentrated sugars and doesn't have any living enzymes that your body needs to be healthy and vibrant, so go fresh whenever you can. Best: strawberries usually cause your body to burn more calories digesting them than they actually contain, which means they are helping you slim down. Not to mention all those fantastic vitamins and minerals.<br>  4)Almonds are wonderful. Don't be paranoid about having only 6. You're not going to get fat if you throw in a few more, I promise. Use raw (not roasted).<br>  5)Banana is good from a health standpoint because it's fresh produce, therefore it has lots of wonderful, living nutrients...and it's nice and filling and naturally sweet. However, it is a relatively sugary, starchy fruit, so I would suggest trying a couple of apples chopped up as a substitute now and then.<br>  6)add some cinnamon. It makes everything seem sweeter without actually adding any sugar (and virtually no calories) AND it helps regulate your blood sugar (actually, so do the oats) which means your metabolism is going to work at its best for you.<br>  <br>  This is not "too much" food, or "too little". You need to EAT SLOWLY, as slowly as you can, and listen to your body. Don't be afraid to leave some leftovers for later, and don't be afraid to have a bit more, as long you've waited *20 mins* to give your brain enough time to figure out whether your tummy's truly full.<br>  On the whole, you've chosen a fantastic breakfast, I'm proud of you for skipping the greasy eggs and meats and breads, and going for something that's going to take care of your weight, blood pressure, skin tone, energy and overall well being. Well Done :D<br>  <br>  The warning: it sounds like you're on the road to dieting, and while it's great to want to feel and look your best, let me tell you from experience that, at this age, you can make the choice to screw up your relationship with food, or to truly love yourself, your body and to love *healthy* food. I started freaking out about diets and trying to be super skinny when I was your age, and I ended up very, very miserable. And the funny thing is, I didn't actually get to the thinness I always wanted until I STOPPED dieting and started treating my body with love and respect. I'm skinny enough now to model (in fact I do model occasionally) but I keep myself that way through a strong understanding and knowledge of nutrition, not through being paranoid about a few extra pieces of fruit or an almond or two. And I know for sure that being super thin doesn't mean I have more love or happiness in my life.<br>  You can be as skinny and healthy and fabulous as you want, and you don't have to sacrifice the enjoyment of food to do it.<br>  I wish you all the best, and I hope you'll try some of my tips. Props to you for caring about your health.<br>  <3|`|s0wBK9eYaa	That's good but you need more healthy fats. Contrary to popular opinion skim dairy products aren't the best for you because they lack essential fats and can actual deprive your body of calcium and can actually cause osteoporosis! To get strong bones drink whole milk from a local dairy so it doesn't have bad hormones and antibiotics. Also try soaking your oatmeal overnight to get rid of the phytic acid. Otherwise its an amazing breakfast good job! Ooh and you need to try honey Greek yogurt on your oatmeal for a treat!

I gained a bit of weight, but I also had these weird skin pigmentation's where my skin looked like an elbow. <br>  The shot had been black listed for a while because it was linked to lose of calcium and the lose of long bones (thigh and arm) where girls were not able to walk any longer because of this. The shot has a lot more side effects! <br>  The pill is easier to manage the side effects and there are more options as to what dose of hormones you want. <br>  I would recommend the pill|`|xBgKqAPHaa	g on the pill<br>  i keep mine with my makeup bag as i use that in the mornings and i see it and it reminds me|`|ZRgLHW3maa	well, with the shot I gained 50 pounds! omg! lol. but the shot can cause so many many problems.

IJh4zjKfaa	I get some SAD every year and it used to bother me more.  Now I realize that it is just part of the natural cycle.  In the spring, I get energized and happy.  I could not have that rise if I didn't have the dip in the winter.  <br>  <br>  Winter is the time of death, inactivity, darkness.  It is natural to feel less alive.  This is in keeping with nature.  Of course, if it gets too bad and you cannot perform your daily functions, or if you are considering hurting yourself or someone else, then you should seek professional psychiatric  / psychologic help.  If it is not this severe, take comfort in knowing that you are in line with nature and look forward to the rebirth of spring.  <br>  <br>  I wrote a book called "The Asian Diet: Simple secrets for eating right, losing weight, and being well" which will be in bookstores in April 09.

There is a simple solution for this, you have to make a small mixture of ammonia and bleach (ammonia will kill the smell and bleach will make it so it won't come back) and place it in a bowl. Then you have to hold your scrotum down in the bowl for about 5 minutes for it to have an effect. After this is done, rinse and you should be clean and smell free.

Also, using a body powder may help - I suspect that you stay moist down there - and bacteria grows in the moisture. <br>  Also, you may not want to hear it - but white, cotton underwear (boxers or briefs) will keep you drier "down there". And they can be washed in hot water and bleached to prevent bacterial growth.

B4YESGmwaa	Have you tried WEB MD.com. They have a prescription section and they do not send spam. Before taking an anti acid speak to your doctor, it can reduce the effects of the medications. Norco is a fairly good mild pain medication. God Bless Reggie|`|nAp688tZaa	Vicodin and Norco are exactly the same drug (hydrocodone), it's just that Norco has less Tylenol per pill and can be taken more frequently if needed.  If you are getting chest pain, one of the previous posters is correct and you are likely experiencing acid reflux.  This is fairly common when taking pain medication, especially if you take it on an empty stomach.  It is safe however, to take an antacid. You may also want to consider taking your pain medication with a small meal or snack and also a full glass of water.  This will help with the acid reflux and also settle your stomach if the medication makes you nauseous.   <br>  <br>  This will not reduce the effectiveness of the pain medication. I know for two reasons.  First, I take pain medication daily for chronic pain caused by a neck injury I got in a 45 mph head on collision last year, and also take prescription Zantac for acid reflux caused by a Hiatal Hernia.  Second, there is a drug interaction checker at www.drugs.com that I use whenever I have a new medication added to my daily regimen.  It will advise you of any drug interactions, as well as any interactions that could be caused by foods, like grapefruits and grapefruit juices.  You can go there and put in all your medications and see if there are any interactions you need to be concerned about.  Or, you can always call the pharmacist and ask them.  They know more about drugs, their side effects, and possible interactions than any doctor does.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	Sometimes it can cause acid reflux in the chest.  Always eat before taking this pain med.

TCehI17kaa	first off I'm so sorry to hear this about your son. He will be in my thoughts & prayers & hope he will get better & recover from this. I do think he needs to know about his condition & the sooner u tell him the better. again my thoughts are with u your son & the rest of your family.|`|c07v7O80aa	Right. It's not any shame, and it's not a "mental illness." He should have already been made aware of it, and it should be a family project to learn about it and to understand how to live with it. Start here:<br>  <a href="http://www.tsa-usa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tsa-usa.org/</a><br>  <br>  There's a kid's section and a newsletter for kids. He needs to know that the nasty language outburst symptom is only found in a small number of Touretters. (Mozart had that kind.) Canadian surgeon, Dr. Carl Bennett has a wide range of very active tics, I mean barking, stooping, etc., that completely disappear when he's operating or flying his own airplane. He wouldn't "cure" it now, if he could. It's just part of who he is, and he's happy with who he is, as are his wife and kids (who get a kick out of daddy's tics). And symptoms sometimes go away after adolescence, as Dan Akroyd's did.|`|rcx668lgaa	Oh honey...I am at a loss for words.  Listen to Miss Massengill.  Therapy and support immediately.  It is time for him to know and for you to educate the faculty at the school.  You have my unconditional support...you need only say the word...Naka|`|F32uPjAraa	Have you ever considered hypnotherapy? You will be pleasantly surprised.|`|9S6x6xZ9aa	You waited till now to tell him what he has?<br>  <br>  This poor little dude needs some therapy... <br>  <br>  My brother has this horrible affliction...and kids used to pick on him all the time.... <br>  <br>  We got him into a support group & it totally turned his life around.. now he has tons of self confidence and is not ashamed of his disease... <br>  <br>  Do me a favor & find a local support group... here's a start<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tourettes-disorder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tourettes-disorder.com/</a>|`|Km6QTk9Caa	I am a bit lost at this.<br>  Why have you tried to shelter your son from knowing what he has or what is wrong?<br>  And he has been properly diagnosed correct?  And I know certain meds can help with some things aswell.<br>  <br>  Your son is 15,  most probably your son knows and is quite capable of handling people.   Having tourettes syndrome does not affect intelligence.<br>  <br>  Do you think you maybe undermining your son's capabilities and are making this more difficult than it needs to be?    I don't want to sound harsh   <br>  I understand that Tourettes can be a social difficulty and the person affected with the condition can suffer emotional and verbal abuse from those who are ignorant of the disorder.<br>  But the support and encouragement from family and friends and just treating him with love and not be sad for him,  he will accomplish much.<br>  <br>  Though I have not first hand experience of this disorder.   I briefly knew someone with tourettes,  a young boy,   he was a very sociable person,  he had friends,  he played baseball,  he did all sorts of activities.   He made odd sounds and ticks and things,  and he was very aware of what he had and was open talking about it.   But his family helped him to be like that.<br>  <br>  I think you need support as a mom,  I know it must be difficult for you,  no one wants to see their son suffer in any way,  but you need to be the strong one,  the positive one,  the encourager.      Maybe there is a support group for tourette families in your area.  Or if not, maybe an on line support group.   <br>  look into any help available to you and your son.   <br>  <br>  I am sorry you are sad,  try not to be.   Your son is going to be alright.   <br>  <br>  Have you ever seen the movie about Brad Cohen?  It is a true story about a man who had tourettes all his life and became an award winning teacher of the year.    A wonderful movie and an inspiring story.  Maybe it will encourage you to know that your son is not alone and life can be ok for him.  Here's some info on Brad,  his life,  the movie.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2008/12/04/evmovie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajc.com/services/content/prin...</a>|`|lKdD5Rblaa	I am so sorry that you and your son are having to go through this; but you are right is way past time that you tell him we told our son right away because he thought he was evil and we had to make him see that he was not, we bought books that were age appropriate for him to read and encourage him to be open with people about his condition. I don't know if any of this will help but I wanted to reach out to you just the same.<br>  Good Luck.|`|qnDk8xjPaa	You didn't tell him yet??? Of course it's time he knows.  That's ridiculous he doesn't know.   I ended up having a bunch of surgeries when I was really young..and I remember the doctors holding me down and doing stuff to me but I didn't know I had surgeries.  I knew I had problems where my bladder didn't function correctly but had no IDEA I ever had surgeries.  I just found out a year ago and was so upset with my mom. You need to tell him.
IX4Sf8Azaa	It's a critical time for brain development, specifically your pre-frontal cortex, which involves your thinking and judgment. It usual stops developing around age 20 (random- but this is why you shouldn't drink a ton before that age because it interferes with the development of that part of your brain). So you're going to need and want to sleep a lot until your out of your adolescent years.  <br>  <br>  Also check with your doctor to make sure you're not sick or anything like that. Sometimes being really tired is because there is something wrong in your system. Don't worry, but ask your doctor.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Teens need more sleep because their bodies are making changes and they need the sleep to keep up the energy your body is using up in making it's changes.|`|cbTlfqc0aa	Everyones body is different .. since you are young you need more sleep. as you get older-- your body changes and you need less sleep.|`|j6kyAhQOaa	It's probably just your age. When i was about 12 until I was 17 or 18 I could sleep 12 hours a night every night, if I had the chance. I was tired all the time if I didn't get 9 or 10 hours, and of course I never went to bed early enough to get that much sleep on school nights.<br>  <br>  As long as you're eating reasonably well, getting enough protein and taking some vitamins, you're probably fine. You might want to get tested for anemia, though. Sometimes after girls get their period, they can become anemic due to the loss of blood and therefore, iron. This would make you constantly sleepy and would be easy to fix with some iron supplements. Maybe go to the doctor for a check-up just to make sure everything's fine.|`|kLEiXXmyaa	Your body regenerates itself while you sleep, your brain, everything. It's a way to keep you healthy, especially since you're still growing.
ZDrXFS2daa	You should definitely consider it. My daughter has scoliosis but hers is not painful all the time. Just occasionally when she does a lot of lifting. However I do know a girl who had the surgery and they implanted a contraption called a "christmas tree" because that is how it is shaped. She lost her pain after her surgery, but she has to be careful not to hurt herself. Last I heard she was doing well. I haven't spoken to her for some time however.
CSuMuWlcaa	Height matters not.<br>  <br>  At 19, you're most likely not going to be doing any more growing.  Just relax and be happy you're not a midget.|`|HetjZkdmaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

AA11388527	Thanks for e-mailing me about your question.  Very interesting!<br>  <br>  One interpretation of your dreams is that dreaming about having seizures suggests a need for more control in your life.  There is such a thing as sleep-related epilepsy but it's relatively unusual and those people with it don't dream they're having the seizures....they just have them.  And they have epilepsy to begin with and know it.<br>  <br>  It may be that you have unresolved issues in your life and feel it's out of control.  Think about it.  And thanks again for contacting me.

jPooSycJaa	You may want to look up "Tinnitis" (ear ringing).  It sounds as though this medication is causing the buz in your ears.  However, it does sound as though the medication helps to some degree.  Pending your discussion with the doctor - I would cut the dose in half, regardless of what he started you at, and see if the ringing goes away.  I would not feel safe about staying on it if the ringing persists.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	You didn't say what dose you're on, that would've been helpful to know.<br>   <br>  When you first start taking Lexapro, you can have "break-in" side effects.

OGHDw55oaa	Here is a site that will answer all of your questions...***
c07v7O80aa	Yeah. Sounds like pleurisy. The lungs are encased in a chest lining, and a lubricating fluid lets them move smoothly. Pleurisy is a dry or rough spot, and the lung rubs, and that hurts, and that's what you hear. Classic signs.  It can be from infection or just spontaneous, but this long is way too long. It can turn into a chronic condition or worse. I know it hurts a lot. I've had it. One of the "worse" can be a spontaneous pneumothorax, a lung leaking air into the chest space, which is a medical emergency, and you'll think you're dying as the lung collapses. Go ahead and get a doctor now. It will be a bunch cheaper than the hospital stay in the worst case, which involves a chest tube, and if you think it hurts now, wait until they pull the tube.|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	You own your own stethscope???

168e1ad6c1f54e307a02551c3b7c8caeaa	First of all, a teenager (even someone in their late teens) can "lose" a period if they are still developing, periods are irregular during the first few onset years of menarche/puberty.<br>  <br>  Or body fat can be way too low, if someone "loses" their period. But thre are other reasons listed below<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However, the most common cause would be a lack of Ovulation for never having had a period. <br>  <br>  A Twenty-year old with possible primary amenorrhea could have any number of issues.  Depends on why and if there is family history of it.<br>  <br>  But only a doctor can test you and see if you  perhaps have a hormone imbalance or any of the above- or below-listed conditions.  <br>  <br>  *****<br>  <br>  Other possible reasons of amenorrhea include:<br>  -hypothyroidism (disorder of the thyroid gland)<br>  -polycystic ovary syndrome, which also causes hirsutism (excess body hair) and obesity.<br>  -hyperprolactinemia, (too much of the hormone prolactin), which can be caused by a pituitary (hypophysis, part of the brain) tumor, and psychiatric medications (such as Haldol)<br>  -disorders of the thyroid gland<br>  -absence or anatomic anomalies of the reproductive organs (womb, ovaries, tubes, vagina)<br>  -chronic illness<br>  -starvation or anorexia<br>  -excessive exercise<br>  -depression<br>  -stress<br>  -Turner syndrome<br>  -various hormonal disturbances<br>  <br>  These are just a few possible causes of not having periods. The diagnosis and treatment of amenorrhea requires a consultation with specialist physician.<br>  <br>  Some of the most important lab tests and other tests include:<br>  -pelvic ultrasound to check that all the reproductive organs are there<br>  -TSH (hypothyroidism)<br>  -Prolactin (hyperprolactinemia)<br>  -sex hormone levels (FSH, LH), sometimes testosterone and other hormones are checked, too<br>  -Head MRI (to rule out pituitary adenoma)<br>  -karyotype (genetic) testing: Turner syndrome, mosaic etc.<br>  -progestin challenge test<br>  **************************************...<br>  It is RARE, but a woman's body can still release and be able to have eggs for fertilization after already conceiving and being pregnant.

94NYYq5Haa	probably both.  Anxiety and depression are very related. Treatment is similar for both.|`|s9Pb6MnYaa	if it impairs your ability to function normally, like it bothers you day in and day out, then probably yeah. It sort of sounds like it. go online and compare the symptoms, or check with your doctor, then you'll know for sure|`|hSEVMy3Waa	I can't tell you what it is, I'm not a psychiatrist.  I advice you to go to a counselor, psychiatrist.  I suffer from chronic depression, and social anxiety, some of the symptoms you are experiencing are similar to my symptoms.

33dbb2ba12b8bd5e5a92e3f1eb3d03f9aa	When you are 18 you have a very high testosterone level and any one manipulating your scrotum or penis can be sexually exciting to you- especially at the age of 18. <br>  <br>  This says nothing about you being gay or straight. It says everything about you being in your sexual prime and are easily aroused. <br>  <br>  Men who are in their 60s go through this exam and it is just a normal non-sexual experience.  You are a normal horny young guy|`|0KGJRVMNaa	That's so hot.<br>  I don't think there is anything wrong with that.<br>  <br>  I love what Ionathan said|`|bf45e02fded8c8a9f5e2908ee70188c6aa	your prob gay<br>  cut your shaft off bro its the only way|`|pVVRMPb1aa	ho you are so gay ,man.|`|OjbGuHa6aa	Maybe your gay if you got aroused by this. Been touch by another man and you got very aroused? I get aroused if a woman did what your doctor did. But not by a male doctor I woundn't get aroused and go home and jerk off and then week later think about this man and jerk off again.|`|1nFtIq6daa	well, it can be very ignorant to break sexuality into just gay, straight, and bi. theres no solid line in the sand. who knows, maybe you have a fetish for doctors and not men at all?|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Most experts do not look at human sexual orientation as black and white, but rather shades of grey. The Kinsey scale actually rates homosexuality between 0 and 6, 0 being exclusively heterosexual and 6 being only homosexual. Most humans (guys and girls) fall between 1-3. Few are completely rated as 0 or 6.<br>  <br>  The other thing to understand is that with humans, particularly males, when the genitals are properly stimulated, a person can become aroused. Sometimes the source of the stimulation is not something that normally makes a person aroused. This can be confusing, but really it doesn't mean that you are gay, not in the slightest. The closer you are to around age 20 (the peak of male sexual development), the easier it is to become aroused.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	It's normal. because let's face it, physical contact of your genitals can get just about anyone going. Likely it's strayed into fantasy territory - which is fine - but I suggest keeping it there. That is, don't go back hoping he'll jack you off on the pretext of something else.<br>  <br>  The other thing I'd venture to suggest, is you mightn't have had a great deal of experience with someone else touching you there - Or it may have been a long time since anyone did; only you will know that. Hence, contact, hormones, stimulus = nice feelings.
7rD3uJzdaa	Listen to totem man, running away will not get rid of your problems? You have to talk with someone about them? Hope my answer was helpful?|`|PpKJIT0aaa	The problem with that - aside from having the police after you, causing all manner of stress and worry to those you know (family and friends), then ending up in the missing persons file and *maybe* in a whole lot more trouble than that - is you take your problems WITH you, when you run away. It doesn't solve anything.<br>  <br>  PS winter is a crap time to run away, anyhow.<br>  <br>  PPS is there someone you can talk to about how you feel?|`|82kVcoh2aa	I'll do it.
94NYYq5Haa	sounds a bit schizoid.  <br>  <br>  could be depression but depression tends to be episodic and occurs with a significant amount of distress.  <br>  "hates socializing" and "loves being alone" leads me to believe that this person is not in distress.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that this can't be a diagnosable disorder if it does not significantly impair functioning.
bQ4RAi07aa	For adults and children 12 years of age and older, the recommended dose of acetaminophen is 650 to 1000 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed, not to exceed 4000 mg in 24 hours. For extended-release acetaminophen, the dose is 1300 mg every 8 hours as needed, not to exceed 3900 mg in 24 hours. Some adult products (Extra Strength TYLENOL, TYLENOL Arthritis Extended Relief Formula) are not intended for use in children under 12 years of age.  Check with your doctor on dosages he/she recommends.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	Ya you can give him another , if you can, break it in half or look on childrens tylenol and compare the dosage in how much is in a teaspoon and go accordingly.  I'd try another 300 miligrams if in 30 minutes nothing happens give the other 200.  Then you need to weight at least 2 - 3 hours even if nothing happens before you can give him advil.  THis is okay to do without waiting the four hours because it's a different pain reliever.  If he gets too high take him to the hospital (104 or higher, or earlier if you are concerned).  Also try and get him to take a cool bath to cool him and eat some kind of cold things, ice, ice cream, popsickles, etc.  Also, I've seen at the store there are these things you can put on kids heads and it cools them down, may want to look into that too, good luck|`|oSvwWFEIaa	what are his symptoms ? head ace ,stomach or is it just a fever?if it's just a fever have him take a luke warm bath not hot or to cold that should help bring down the fever a bit !

That is the way the body works the infection out|`|8ddb7a13bfc50d6825c6a6f035345b83aa	give him one, if in about 30min it hasn't brought the fever down a good bit, you can give him a second one. <br>  just don't exceed 2 tylenols within 6hrs.|`|PHknlA1Zaa	give him Advil or ibuprofen Tylenol doesn't work for some people,so go to the store and buy Advil thats the name brand or also known as ibuprofen. it will bring his fever done and give him one of the Advil,but make sure to wait until 3 hours after you gave him the last Tylenol. If his fever doesn't come down seek medical help.|`|0WdCa5gLaa	Don't give him more Tylenol (acetaminophen), give him Ibuprophen such as Aleve. Unless he's allergic of course.<br>  <br>  Cycling these two drugs are common and are what many doctors will suggest for fever or pain.  Since they're 2 different drugs an overdose is less likely.<br>  <br>  If you have any concerns about this advice or anything else, call your local hospital emergency room.  They are the best resource and should tell you for free.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|6fjrcdYjaa	you should call  his doctor, but, you can always give him 2 tsp. of Children's Tylenol... that will bring the fever down safely. Then, in 2 hours, give him 2 tsp. of Children's Motrin... then, repeat in 2 hours with the Tylenol.|`|iRGcFNmDaa	I wouldn't give him anymore tylenol, especially the adult strength.  <br>  <br>  101 fever is relatively low.  I would go down to the pharmacy and pick up something for kids.|`|WttToNwtaa	If you're using children's Tylenol, give him 3 chewables every 4 hours.

IMPvzBk1aa	Low blood pressure is an advantage, and means your arteries are not being damaged as they would be if it was high.  If you experience symptoms associated with it, such as episodic fainting, you might want treatment.  But most people with low blood pressure never need medical intervention, and there is no damaging effect to your organs and tissues as there is with high blood pressure.  Just be more careful when you suddenly rise from a hot bath, for example, which could bring on some dizziness if your bp drops when you arise.<br>   My blood pressure has been as low as 80/50 in the morning, and I can still function just fine.  That would be considered shocky in some people.  So, enjoy the good health that your low blood pressure affords you.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Your BP is actually excellent and much better than 120/80 which is regarded as normal and acceptable.  Above 140/90 is too high and needs treatment. <br>  <br>  Below 90/60 could in some cases, but not necessarily in all cases, be low BP and common symptoms are dizziness, faintness and actual fainting spells.|`|Jxx30d5Raa	The only problem with low blood pressure, is if the patient is symptomatic with the low blood pressure. What that means is that the patient is dizzy when they stand up, get tingly or have difficulty staying alert. If you are not feeling any symptoms then you are fine. My blood pressure is usually 90/50 and I am fine. Relax.|`|O4qO8aoLaa	Well, its not a good thing.  You pressue isnt considerably low but its low enough to ask your doctor about it.  You could be anemic.  Which is a blood problem.  So, call your doctor and get his/her opinion on it.|`|sBh8U18yaa	HAVING LOW BLOOD PRESSURE CAN AS BAD AS HAVING IT HIGH, SO TAKE ODERLESS GARLIC AND IT WILL HELP REGULATE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE UNTIL YOU GO SEE A DOCTOR "GOOD LUCK"

That way, they can go out and get you a nice, new, UNUSED razor or shaver.  Also, if you think you're old enough to shave, then you're old enough to be open about it with your folks.

NVxGp317aa	it is a good option to get you started in the medical field. My only suggestion is to do some reseach about the programs offered and where they are accredited through as well as what the hospitals clinics and labs in your area prefer.<br>  There are some classes offered that when you are done and certified its not through a program that is accredited or that is wanted in a facility. <br>  As far as where to start you can always look at bloodbanks or traveling blood drive centers you wil get lots of experiance in drawing from various types of people.<br>  I think it is great you want to work with kids but let me tell you as someone who is currently a paramedic and worked in a er drawing labs it dosent matter how comfortable you are with kids it takes practice and patience to draw a child. The veins aren't as prominent they don't sit steal they don't understand what's going on so a lot of hospitals prefer some experiance drawing before they will hire you for pediatric draws such as if you worked spacifically at a childrens hospital. <br>  Good luck just do a little research talk to people that have taken the class your looking into and see where they are working and if they had a hard tike finding a job or not.|`|vpyPy7IMaa	i think its a great idea!

I also use hand warmers (you can get them at any hardware store like Menard's, etc.) and sometimes even put them in my shoes to keep my toes warm.  I even wear double socks sometimes, and constantly wear gloves.  Raynaud's is a pain in the butt but it is manageable.

yboEJ4jHaa	If you feel like you got hit by a truck, then it's the flu and you're looking at 1-2 weeks before you start feeling better.<br>  <br>  If It's just a cold, plan on up to 7 to 10 days of misery.<br>  <br>  Take Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) for the nose and Tylenol/Motrin for the aches. Good luck!|`|ITCknAHVaa	No way of knowing.  You could have either or something completely different.  If not better in about 2 -3 days see a doctor as you may have something else.  Plenty of rest, vegetables, fruit, vitamins, lots of fluid like water, orange juice and chicken soup.  It can take over 1 -2 week to really get rid of a cold or flu.

Add in more fruits and more vegetables or yogurt or nuts or an occasional treat.  Always eat when your body feels hungry or weak.  And continue to increase your calories more if you find you are still losing weight at the end of the week.|`|lmHBKBxYaa	You were in starvation mode, and most likely most or all of the weight you lost was muscle or water. As soon as you start eating again, your body, which no longer has the fat burning muscles, is going to put it all back on again and then some.<br>  <br>  You need to build your muscle back up if you want to not get stuck in a crazy cycle of yoyo-dieting and self destruction.|`|juhim6Bhaa	When you enter starvation mode, you STOP loosing weight.

That is not to imply that it is easy to deal with.  In the teen years there is so much changing chemically in your body that that contributes to the depression.  Also you are physically an adult and want to live as an adult (sex/marriage/jobs/material things/independence) but our society says that you need to get a good education/career start before marrying etc. and postpones those things for about 10 years. It is very frustrating to physically be ready but unable to do those things.  A hundred years ago people routinely married at 16 - 17 years old. The sex abuse thing - sure that can contribute also - depending on what happened and when it happened and what type of personality you have that alone could be crippling - or you may be doing better than most people could manage.  All of these things certainly go into your depression.  Stick with the counseling - recognize that it is a slow process.  Also recognize that some of what you're feeling - every teen feels.   Keep trying/talking and relating to others. Often parents try to "play down" problems in the hopes that ignoring them will make them vanish - it doesn't.  If it helps to know they are not uncaring - they're just trying to "dodge the problem" by playing that game of "if I don't look at that problem - maybe it doesn't exist".|`|ParFJxnSaa	Self esteem/confidence is addressed in section 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Depression; see section 2; pages R & V first, then young women's depression, and teens; section 13, pages A, K & T, and section 20, on child sexual abuse; try Pandys first. Some advice, and options: Volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I... (insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies. <br>  <br>  Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.<br>  <br>  Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".

Some doctors believe that it is a nutritional deficiency disease and many people eating more processed foods instead of whole foods is the cause.<br>  <br>  As far as genes, many people can be exposed to the same things and only a few will develop a complication or disease from the exposure.  I believe many times it's how we take care of our body by eating healthy, exercising, and filling in the nutritional gaps with supplements can make the difference.<br>  <br>  I have found a website about diabetes and perhaps you will find something interesting in it.

Yeah,  just use a very small amount of Hydrogen peroxide, in water.<br>  <br>  Also, might try warm water with salt..|`|AA10531094	Hydrogen Peroxide is good to gargle with, after brushing your teeth. Its kill germs. . . but for a sore throat you should gargle with warm salt water mixed with vinegar.  Gargle at least every 2-3 hours.  If your sore throat doesn't go away, see a doctor ASAP.

You can gargle with hydrogen peroxide, salt water, mouthwash or whatever you like - if something makes it hurt less, awesome! But there's nothing that can be done about the blotches. For a picture of those, go here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsillitis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsillitis</a><br>  <br>  In the meantime, if it hurts a lot, you can try taking a painkiller with ibuprofen in it.

If they are EXTREMELY painful that you're lying in bed all curled up and can't even begin to move, try using a hot water bottle held up just above your pubic hair (not around the stomach where you might be inclined to).<br>  <br>  Also, having a warm bath helps.

00cf6ed34d78a2476b4f555c2104e5d0aa	Chances are you're pretty young if you're asking.  The best advice I can give is to take protein supplements only if you are serious about working out.  It doesn't build muscle on its own.  Protein supplements are only effective in replenishing protein lost in fasting or during healing/rebuilding of muscle tissue after a workout.<br>  If you're serious about working out, then make sure you're old enough to resist overuse and keep the amount you use to the minimum required.  The more you use, the more you lose in your urine, but in the meantime your kidneys have to work way too hard to get rid of the excess.  Take your protein within 1-2hrs post workout or when you get up in the morning to help restore any loss during times of fasting.  Don't drink protein shakes 20 times a day because you are just wasting your money.<br>  My final piece of advice is that if you are old enough to cook, then eat high protein foods instead.  It tastes better and it's better for you.  Tuna, chicken breasts, egg whites, and lean meats are a much safer protein source.  They are easier for your body to digest.  They won't give you gas.  If you're young, and you work out, you need to eat eat eat.|`|5f198de200e1bdfd617b375df63245b0aa	You can start at age 13.|`|c662384be9f8ec4b26ff17453ef06ba7aa	just take whey protein powder or eat protein bars or energy bars<br>  <br>  jkim.qhealthbeauty.com|`|41257f4e78aadd2398641ca40c8c1be4aa	18
7X28owjxaa	I agree partially with the first answer. Go see your dermatologist to get a diagnosis and prescription. <br>  <br>  About it going away as you get older, I'd have to disagree... If you have the same thing as I do (mild eczema). Well I've had those little red bumps since I was 4 and I'm 21 now and they haven't gone away. <br>  <br>  According to my dermatologist there is an over the counter ointment you can purchase to help lessen the appearance of these bumps (the name escapes me at the moment, but you could probably ask around at a local pharmacy), or you can also use Retin-A on the affected areas (which is a prescription for acne).<br>  <br>  But like I said previously, it's best to go visit your dermatologist for a proper diagnosis. You don't want to put something on your skin that may end up aggravating it more. =)|`|GK8USG1paa	go to a dermatologist and they can prescript some lotion to you. But it does go away on its own when you get older

qNCsLuaNaa	Degree deodorant seems to be the best.  I didn't have a frequent sweating problem, but the other deodorants would be absorbed into my shirts and look like I was sweating.  Ever since I've been using Degree, I haven't noticed this problem at all.  On top of that, it smells nice and doesn't leave a lot of residue.|`|lPTKYQeaaa	You may have a certain condition or something where only a certain ingredient in the deodorant will help prevent sweating. I'm not sure what the ingredient is, but I used to have a similar problem. I use Secret Platinum Invisible Solid and it works really well. You should try it.

They said its not uncommon for women to experience this, but some women have Ovulation pain. So usually 1 to 1 &1/2 weeks before your period is when some women have these cramps, because this is when they're ovulating. And I usually don't have cramps while on my period. So its not weird not to experience them during it.|`|J4uWjrZwaa	im the same way i always have it before my period
GApjwrnJaa	From what i understand, PMDD is PMS to a harsher extent. Try looking into birth control. I know Yaz is specifically meant to lessen the symptoms of PMDD.|`|m2aznd8xaa	its definetly pmdd. do you take birth control at all.. i had the same problem and my gyny put me on yaz birth control it takes care of your pmdd.  its helped me out a bunch sometimes its given to you even if you dont want birth control just to control the pmdd. i was going through the same thing. and almost broke up my marraige too.  ive been married 11 years have two girls a 9 year old and a 21 month old. i statred on it right after my second baby and my life is so much better from it.  this is a big issue ,its something you have no control over i know. so talk to you gyny about yaz . i take the 28 day cycle. i still get tender breasts and a little cramping but  everything else is gone. and yea i had everything you named too.   yaz is only given when you have been diagnosed  with pmdd  with your gyny. so tell them about your symptoms and how you heard about yaz  helping  good luck|`|xjW5tnJcaa	you must have Seasonal Depression disorder|`|iC7cSqotaa	You sound like you may have text book PMDD.  If you think you do, there is not anything OTC that you may take for it and if it is really affecting you and your relationship, see your OB.  Not your local Health Department. PMDD is a hormonal imbalance and cannot be diagnosed through your county.|`|MnewrjTAaa	Talk to a dr to get a diagnosis.<br>  <br>  A lot of women find that cutting out certain foods--dairy fat, bacon, tomato products, etc.--helps enormously.  But it's hard to do because the list is long (and tasty!).|`|HO29eqstaa	It sounds like it. You should talk to your doctor because it won't just blow over.<br>  I thought I had it too but then it turned into being all the time... I'm assuming yours is only right before your period.<br>  But yeah, talk to your doctor
iC7cSqotaa	First and foremost, when changing a birth control, especially from one hormone level to another, please please please use additional protection at LEAST for the first month or two, until you are sure your cycles are in sync.<br>  I am on OrthoTri Cyclen, my generic is called Tri-Sprintec.  It is a 28 day cycle and always on the dot.  I have been on the generic and brand name before.  Sorry to say I have never heard of anyone being scientifically proven to grow larger breasts because of birth control.

J6O66K7Gaa	Thats not really a good high intensity workout. I'd go for something like: sprint all out for 30 seconds, jog for 1 min. Repeat 10x (15 total min.)<br>  <br>  As for calorie and fat burning: there are a few different things you need to look at.<br>  <br>  1> Total calories burned during the exercise<br>  2> Type of calories burned during exercise<br>  3> Total calories burned post exercise<br>  <br>  Low intensity exercise (ie. walking) has lower total calories but a higher % from fat (and not gylcogen aka carbs.) There are physiological reasons for this but the end result is the same - if you were only going to burn 200 calories for your workout then walk - 70%o of them might be from fat.<br>  <br>  But, when you look at the bigger picture, you'll see why high intensity is the winner. HIIT burned more _total_ calories and more total fat calories. It might be a lower % (since you are burning glycogen) but the total fat is still higher.<br>  <br>  And the post exercise energy burn is higher still. This is because you a spending a ton of energy making new glycogen and repairing all the damage you've done doing the HIIT.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Read these 3 articles.<br>  <br>  HIIT right after you wake up.<br>  <br>  LIS after a weight workout.

Some strains are hard to treat and somewhat resistant to drugs, which is probably why the baby stayed that long. But it's a very broad category with many dozens of strains.

vzlQiZNwaa	doing any pushups will increase the amount you could do fast. But its like running, if you run for a long distance you will have endurance, but if you spring alot you will be fast. But either way you will get a little faster and a little more endured (if that's a word)|`|MpTZjdLJaa	well doing them slower will make you stronger but think about it this way<br>  how many pushups do you think Arnold coud do<br>  he is to jacked and I bet he cannot do that many (70)<br>  so the best way to increase the amount of pushups is to do the pushups in sets<br>  what I do is 10 pshups, 5 second break one set<br>  i do that over and over till i cannot do anymore<br>  in one month, i increases my pushups from 30-45<br>  now, 3 months later, I can do 80<br>  if you follow my sets, in no time you will be doing 80<br>  <br>  edit<br>  another thing to think of<br>  sprinters have huge muscles and runners do not<br>  pushup wise, big muscles will help you to do faster pushups with less reps and smaller muscles will hlep you to do slower but more reps (smaller muscles not like  skin and bone)|`|jqSU112maa	yes it will make you do more! i asked my trainer from CATZ (competetive athlete training zone) and he said it would definatly help

But lets hope not...Here are the symptoms:<br>  <br>  Diabetes Type 1:        Symtoms of type 2 <br>  <br>  In type 1, the pancreas stop producing insulin, due to autuimmune response or possibly viral attack on pancreas. In absence of insulin, body cells does not get glucose for producing ATP (Adenosin Triphosphate) units which results into primary symptom in the form of nausea and vomiting. In latter stage which leads to ketoacidosis in which body starts breaking down muscle tissue and fat for energy, there is consequently fast weight loss. Dehydration is also usually observed due to electrolyte disturbance. In advance stages even coma and death, are being witnessed.<br>  <br>  Diabetes Type 2:<br>  <br>  * Increased fatigue : Due to inefficiency of cell to metabolise glucose, reserve fat of body is metabolised to gain energy. When fat is broken down in the body, it uses more energy as compared to glucose, hence body goes in negative calorie effect, which results in fatigue.<br>  * Polydipsia : As the concentration of glucose increases in the blood, brain receives signal for diluting it and in its counteraction we feel thirsty.<br>  * Polyuria: Increase in urine production is the result seen when excess of glucose is present in body. Body tries to get rid of the extra sugar in the blood by excreting it through the urine. This can also lead to dehydration because excreting the sugar which carries a large amount of water out of the body along with it.<br>  * Polyphegia : The hormone insulin is also responsible for stimulating hunger. In order to cope up with high sugar levels in blood, body produces insulin which leads to increased hunger.<br>  * Weight flactuation : Factors like loss of water (polyuria), glucosuria , metabolism of body fat and protein may lead to loss of weight. Few cases may show weight gain due to increased appetite.<br>  * Blurry vision : Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia nonketotic syndrome is the condition when body fluid is pulled out of tissues including lenses of eye, which affects the ability of lenses to focus resulting in blurry vision.<br>  * Irritability : It is one of the sign of high blood sugar because of the inefficient supply of glucose to brain and other body organs, which makes us feel tired and uneasy.<br>  * Infections : Certain signals from the body is given whenever there is fluctuation of blood sugar (due to suppression of immune system) by frequent infections of fungal or bacterial like skin infection or UTI (urinary tract infection).<br>  * Poor wound healing : High blood sugar resists the flourishing of WBC, (white blood cell) which are responsible for body immune system. When these cells do not function accordingly, wound healing is not at good pace. Secondly, long standing diabetes leads to thickening of blood vessels which may affect proper circulation of blood in different body parts.<br>  <br>  And last but not least, Depression is a complication of diabetes.|`|RgEtKVaKaa	A 14 year old can get diabetes.  Keep in mind that there are a lot of things that could cause symptoms that resemble diabetes.  Being 14 years old - very busy, lots of school, social, sports commitments.  Lack of sleep; not eating so well, etc. Some of the other responders mentioned some of the symptoms - I will elaborate to clarify.  Thirst - sometimes extreme because your body is trying to flush glucose (sugar) from your system.  Hunger - because you make little to no insulin, glucose cannot get into your cells to be used as food & energy.  Insulin is like a key that opens the lock on cells to allow glucose to get in to feed & fuel your body.  Weight loss - because you have insufficient insulin, you cannot utilize the food you eat.  Fatigue - because you are hungry & you have high blood sugar levels & because your body is working so hard to rid itself of the glucose.  Poor wound healing is not an immediate symptoms nor is tingling or burning in your feet.  To be diagnosed, a simple blood test is done.  If this test is positive, then a more extensive test is done.  If you are worried, tell your parents & go see your doctor.  Good luck to you.  I hope you are just a tired teenager.|`|YPtNr2O6aa	to answer the latter question first, yes.<br>  <br>  Some symptoms are feeling constantly tired/fatigued, needing to go to the toilet often, blurred vision, dry mouth and constantly feeling very thirsty.<br>  <br>  Leg pain can be another symptom of diabetes as well as slow healing (like cuts or sores).<br>  <br>  Although i'd recommend that you consult a doctor if you have any concern - you can make yourself believe you have anything by searching the net for symptoms. <br>  Diabetes tests are very simple and easy to have.|`|NRQXmIcwaa	tired all the time.|`|7wg1wMn7aa	i dont have diabetes but i know some symptoms. some are you are constantly thirsty. need to pee a lot. losing wieght when not trying to. weakness and fatuige. tingiling and or numbness of the hands, legs, or feet.

You always need to go prepared (I'll bet you will from now on) - OK - if you can't get to a store tonight, improvise -- Paper towels are thicker and more absorbent than TP - so, go to the kitchen and get the roll. fold 5-6 together to make and "pad" and fit it inside your panties. That should get you through the night - and You'll have the roll in case you need some during the night or first thing in the morning. Hopefully, you can get someone to take you to the store - or call your mother to drop off some to you. PS- THIS IS IMPORTANT - do NOT flush paper towels down the toilet -or you will stop it up.  Instead, wrap the used paper towels in TP and put in the trash or a plastic garbage bag that you can throw away.

m2aznd8xaa	well when i got my cavities tooken care of they didnt give me anything because it was only on the surface of my teeth. so they just layed me back and drilled away. while an assistant put water in my mouth and suctioned it out at the same time. then the dr just put a white filling in the whole he made. it was a little uncomfortable but not painful. what bothered was the drilling and they blow air in the whole they made to rid of the debree  and that felt a little sensitive like when you have a sensitive tooth but not painful in any way. i guess it depends on how they deep they have to go.  my daughter got a tooth pulled at 7 yrs ols because she had her big teeth commin in and her baby tooth didnt come out so they put a shot in her gum ,she said it was like a pinch ,she didnt cry or anything.  then recently now 9 yrs old she had to go through it again and this time they just put a gel and pulled it out and she said it wasnt bad either, . how tolerable are you to pain and how bad the cavity is is the question.like if your already having pain are sensitivity to the tooth before even getting anything done will mean youll feel things more. but really its not as bad as you think. dentists are really good especially the ones that deal with kids. i still get scared going to and i dint know why when ive never had a painful experiance.  good luck and youll be just fine youll see.
s8TwWPdDaa	I just learned about a terrible disease a little girl has i know. Its called Canavan's Disease. It is extremely rare..affects about 200 to 500 people in the US. It is a neurological disease with no cure and most children with it die around 8 years old. Yu can get more information on it from google. This disease causes seizures, mental delay, the children cant walk or talk...they are really sick! Another rare disease I know of is PKU. My sister was diagnosed with it through the heel stick test when she was born. I had a 1 and 4 chance of getting it. This is a metabolic disorder where the children cant break down the protein phenylalanine. My parents where both carriers of it. She is on a restricted diet her whole life and on a special formula. She also has to check her blood levels every two weeks. If we didnt learn she had this she would have been mentally retarded by age 5. You can get more info on these at the Boston children hospital website. But conditions are rare and most people dont know anything about them!

QD2AJv22aa	As someone sharing the same goal as you and making progress, I can help you.  And oh yea, i have the same birthday.  <br>  <br>  What Ive been doing is just a semistrict diet.  Now, I, like you, have tried everything in the book and the only thing that really works is old fashion exercise.  You will lose 10 lbs a month in the first month but it will gradually slow down.<br>  <br>  What I began doing was making salads on the weekends but adding something like tuna to them or chicken.  Spinach is really good in a salad and if you like to cook, look up recipies on foodnetwork.com.  Giada DeLaurentis usually has good stuff or you can copy her dressings for salads.<br>  <br>  Stay away from:<br>  Cheese<br>  Soda<br>  Ice Cream<br>  Bagels<br>  Cakes/pastries/cookies<br>  <br>  Now I am italian so if anyone has a problem with eating right, its me.  But Ive been losing weight and this is what Ive been doing.<br>  <br>  Biggest secret: I started drinking water all day, even when i wasnt thirsty.  I drink 5-6 water bottles between 9 am and 2 pm.  By drinking more water, your body holds less water thus you lose weight.  I drink a water bottle when im driving to and from school and everyday.  All in all, i probably drink 10-12 half liter water bottles of water, juice and milk, if not more.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, eat breakfast and eat it reasonably early.  <br>  -Have a bowl or two of cereal one day<br>  -Oatmeal the next<br>  -2 eggs and whole wheat toast<br>  -drink either milk or juice<br>  <br>  Stay away from foods with high sugars, trans fats, and high sodium<br>  <br>  Eat:<br>  Chicken<br>  Fish<br>  Pork<br>  Eggs<br>  Salads(spinach, lettuce, onion, carrots, and celery with a light homemade dressing is actually good and filling)<br>  Turkey<br>  Fruit: Eat a lot of it everyday: good for breakfast/dessert<br>  Vegetables(Buy the frozen mixed vegetables, microwave and add a little bit of butter or synthetic healthy butter)<br>  <br>  Now, the exercise part:<br>  If you dont have a ton of time, at least do cardio:<br>  <br>  You should have a stroller, take you and the baby for a walk around the neighborhood.  Try to clock out a route by car of 5 miles or so round trip.  If you do that everyday, you will lose weight.  1 mile wont cut it<br>  <br>  Remember, portion control.  If your hungry, prolong it a little by drinking water and eat slower, i know, easier said than done but really make an effort.  If your still hungry after a meal, wait, drink something, NON ALCOHOLIC(bad for you) and then if your really still hungry, have a little more<br>  <br>  Eat around 1600-2000 calories a day.  Get at least 8 hours of sleep(take turns with ur husband wen the baby cries)<br>  <br>  Skipping meals=bad<br>  Too little calories could be as bad as too many, what you eat, you will store plus youll b very fatigued<br>  -Eat fruit for snacks<br>  -equal instead of sugar(sugar turns to fat)<br>  -Eat a variety of food--wont get bored of diet<br>  -Exercise at least 5 times a week<br>  -Weight training when possible: look up workouts for women, i wouldnt want to give you a guys workout<br>  -dont give up!!!!<br>  Allow a cheat day every now and then just to keep you sane|`|lmHBKBxYaa	10 pounds of weight loss a month is too much to ask for. Maybe 5, if all you're doing is dieting and a pointless exercise tape. <br>  Losing 80 pounds in 4 months is not feasible. Aim for maybe 20 pounds gone by your birthday, and then all the weight gone by your 24th birthday.<br>  <br>  Okay, so your baby is 16 months old? Get a stroller, and go strolling. An hour a day minimum, maybe 2-3 on weekends.<br>  <br>  If you're serious about losing weight, you'll need to change your time scale. You're not losing weight because you want to look pretty for your birthday. You're losing weight because you want to look pretty for the rest of your life. It might take a year or two to drop that weight, and if you're not willing to put in that much time you should just quit and go back to eating tons of cake.

wOecmtrzaa	Well, I can only assume that you are going to get dentures.<br>  <br>  I was gonna elaborate on what the person said about getting dentures put on posts in your mouth.  Thats implant dentures, and are generally better tolerated and just a better Idea, I think.  I don' know if you have thought about it, but if you google "implant supported dentures" you should get an idea of what it's about.  I am just assuming a lot here, so just ignor this if you don't care to hear any of this.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new teeth!|`|AA11702934	I'm 44 years old and have had dentures for 3 years.  When fitted correctly the top denture suctions up to the roof of your mouth and will stay put.  If not fitted correctly a person has to use Fixadent or similar product.  The bottom denture will move around no matter what ..... but now there's a procedure where screws are put into your bottom jaw and the denture either snaps into place or is placed permanently.   I still HATE the way it feels to eat with my dentures in.  Sometimes I'll take the bottoms out and eat with only my tops in.  I inherited bad teeth and am happy with my decision to get dentures only because now my smile is BEAUTIFUL.   By the way, I went to Yuma, Arizona and crossed over into Alagonez (sp?), Mexico to get my dentures.  Many "snow birds" (retired people) go there to get dentures, prescriptions and other health related issues taken care of.  My dentures cost $1,400.00 compared to $2,500+ here in the United States.  Hope this helps.|`|KnwsvnTjaa	I don't have them, but my mother did.  I will tell you what she told me.  They fit well if you have enough "ridge" for them to set on. I assume she meant the gums where the teeth used to be.  Don't take them out at night.  If you do, then your mouth has to get used to them all over again the next day and they hurt more.  My mom got dentures when she was 20, so she had a lot of experience with them.  As she got old, they fit less well because her ridge got very small.  In younger days, she ate pretty much everything.  In old, old age, even with a brand new set, she ate only soft things.
0q7Wiiliaa	well walking, jogging and running is the healthiest excercise to mankind,     start of slowly, naturally ur body will adjust and you will feel more refreshed    start of by walkning to local store daily, if u have a car, try walking most of the time when possible, then slowly join gym and run 4 times a week for an hour|`|g2h6qUUXaa	start out slow like talking a 10 minute walk a day and then start walking longer to like 15 minutes and so on|`|Jxx30d5Raa	Walk briskly for 20 minutes, try to walk 4 or 5 times a week. Each week try to go further in 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  As time goes on, increase the TIME that you are walking. Soon you will be walking a 15 minute mile. After you are able to walk for 30 minutes at a time, you can set a goal of walking 2 miles in that time.<br>  <br>  As you get used to a 2 mile in a half hour walk, add light weights on your wrists, ankles to up the ante. Walking briskly will burn just as many calories as running the same distance, and you will decrease the incidence of ankle or knee injuries.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water before and after your walk to avoid dehydration. Use sunblock and make sure you can hear the traffic around you. Only use one earphone if you must use your headset while walking. Also, take your mobile phone for safety. Walking with a partner can really help keep you going and makes the miles go by faster.|`|lkIcWsT3aa	Are you very out of shape? If the answer is "yes" then walk 30 minutes a day at least at whatever pace you can handle. If you are in relatively good shape then bump up your walking time as you can handle it.<br>  <br>  (My father has diabetes and is 67, he can walk 30 minutes)
TR9lcgcjaa	You are just young with a lot on your mind and are starting to feel responsibility bite you in the butt.  You should get a journal/date book and write down important things.  As for the guy, he probably really likes you and has been trying to get your attention a long time but you were busy with other things and didn't realize he was stalking you is all.  If you actually have a conversation with him soon, ask him if he wants to go get a bite to eat or something simple.  Spend a little time with him in public, separate cars and see how that goes.|`|lGS54cfxaa	It's the fact that you were abused. You might be having problems due to physical or emotional damage, and I would recommend talking to either a doctor or to any of your friends that you trust. <br>  <br>  Play memory games; your mind needs as much exercise as anything else belonging to the body.<br>  <br>  Which would also remind me this. If you suddenly run much more than usual, you'll be sore, right? Think that way with the mind. However, you will have to talk to someone you trust about this, I'm sure. And if your memory doesn't seem to be getting any better, then please speak to a doctor, and say the information you've given here.|`|aAZaqTpEaa	You've probably been living in denial...and you've gotten so used to it, your mind just does it automatically? I don't really know. But i would definitely suggest getting some counciling...I'm sorry about your mom...and sorry i wasn't much help...but good luck!
LxcDMjnDaa	I have the same problem. I really wanna lose weight too. So you don't have to go on a strict diet and just exercise all day. Just watch the food your eating. mostly eat fruit vegetables through out the whole day. even if you want you can could calories just don't eat over 1500 calories per day. i guess its ok if you eat like one small candy of a small ice cream bar just after that just do something so that the sweets don't go into your fat. like maybe take a walk or ride a bike. just anything to get you moving. even if you do eat just vegetable the whole day and lay on the couch watching tv it will not help you. once you eat just do something!!! you could swim play with a dog...etc. you and eating and then doing nothing will not help you lose weight. exercise and eat healthy that all I have to say! so good luck. =)|`|aqeWwA71aa	Aint it horrible???  There's some people who just don't care if they eat or not.  That would be nice.  <br>  <br>  Try NOT eating carbohydrate.  Carbohydrate makes you more hungry - it makes more insulin come into your blood - and i've heard insulin called "the hunger hormone".<br>  <br>  So the less sugars, starches, carbohydrates you eat the less hungry you'll be....  or so goes the theory.  And you can also pretend you're somebody else.|`|gDO4KWgjaa	Hello  I found the best way to lose weight fast was drink lots of water and some simple exercising. If you want a quick boost get some of that acai berry stuff at <a href="http://freeacai.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://freeacai.notlong.com</a>    that all the stars are using. I only lost 20lbs in 4 weeks because I did cheat a little with some cakes but I feel so much better. The best exercise is always walking so try and just walk to the shops instead of driving.|`|8lVSpsNxaa	Try drinking lots of water, it will fill you up. Hate water? i do, try flavored water such as propel. Also try healthier foods. 100 calorie packs are great for that hunger urge!|`|UtwcSsfpaa	Cut down on carbohydrates.<br>  Eat more veggies (especially raw ones) and protein <br>  Did I mention cutting back on carbs?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nW0UanIzaa	well ur obvisously not serious about it if u can't cut ur calories for like a month......
RbCsBbhLaa	I think if you see a good therapist and get some medication you can work through it.

You were just unlucky with your other one.|`|6137572ac3c860420eba86c0f0f9061aaa	OK, I'm not a doctor and I wouldn't begin to offer a diagnosis - I'm not qualified - and neither is anyone else here.  You obviously know you don't want to go on like this.  That's very good.  You also sense that this isn't usual.  Find someone you can talk to about this who can help.  Your parents, a counselor at school, maybe there is a community medical center in your town.  Try the local hospital.  If you find it hard to talk to someone face to face, show them what you've written here.  There are people that can help and medication may be part of that.  Do not live with this, find someone who will help you.<br>  <br>  All the best.

ToILKl6waa	It's essentially the voice of negativity. It will always be there and will feed you irrational views and thoughts of disaproval even in your happiest states.

It is your own inner voice, that inner naggy voice we have.  Do some self-talk and take charge.  Don't let the negative side get you down....and ignore it. You are in charge!  Believe what you choose to believe.  Choose the positive side!  Reward yourself.  Do things you enjoy, bubble bath, pat yourself on the back for any small accomplishment.  Admrie yourself in the mirror....don't let negative thoughts creep in.  Talk to your family about your feelings.

gDHsx5I3aa	Sloooowwww down your horny kids hahaha. But really i think thats pretty normal that used to happen to me when i would have a lot of sex with my ex (when we were dating) basically same story i would stay over for the weekend or whatever.<br>  <br>  Try going down on her first so shes really wet, nothing beats natural lubricant. And don't settle for 'kinda' wet in the beginning of the weekend because the friction can hurt after a while if a girl is not wet enough in the first place.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	You need to get her fully arroused first off. If the girl hasn't provided herself with the right lubrication, it will hurt. Another factor is that this is her first few times and her vagina hasn't had the stretching so much. So it will hurt but be gentle. Use a condom with lubricant to help her out a bit more. And always get her wet before you start.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	She could be allergic to the laytex in most condoms. Get a water based lube and try laytex free condoms|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	Well it maybe too many times that you are having sex, or she may have a yeast infection.

gzaRhfAwaa	Do you mean inverted nipples? If so, I don't think it's terribly uncommon. Everyone is shaped differently and it's hard when you don't look like other people. But there are things that you can try to do about inverted nipples, if you want to. They have suction cup things that you can use to help pull the nipple out and there's also a surgery that can be done. Considering the fact that you're sixteen, you still have developing to do and you never know, they may just change on their own. And if not, there's nothing wrong with being different. Wait and see what happens and in the mean time, don't worry about guys seeing them...any guy is just going to happy to be seeing boobs at all!  :)|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	I'm assuming that you are referring to inverted nipples. Don't worry, I have the same problem. They aren't cancerous or anything, it's just like a belly button, your either an inny or an outty. Actually, some guys find is as a turn on. I will admit though that some people complain. "ew! what's wrong with you?" but all you have to tell them is that it's natural. Hey, your unique!|`|qfSKgxDsaa	that is normal and guys should be fine with it, plus they probably perk up when your get excited and play with them no?

f2ec926ce6206d4381143c6ad93b2768aa	A friend of mine has celiac syndrome as well. She has found WalMart to have many gluten free foods, and they label them very clearly. Rice is gluten free, as long as it has no spice additives. Beef and chicken broth, so you can makes vegetables soups, sushi, any vegetable or fruits, meats, chicken, fish. etc. Once you get into it, you will see that there are many gluten free options out there.|`|aFK7yD4xaa	You can't eat wheat, rye or barley, and a few other very closely related grains - these are the source of gluten. <br>  <br>  If you buy unprocessed meat, fish, eggs, cheese (not ready grated, as it's coated in modified starch), vegetables, fruit, nuts, corn, rice, peas, beans and lentils are all naturally gluten free. Unfortunately 99% of all processed food contains gluten which is added during manufacture for various reasons.<br>  <br>  You can get gluten free ready meals. There is very little choice, the price is horrendous and most of them are pretty much inedible, so I'm afraid you are going to have to learn to cook long term. In the meantime, you can stick to lumps of meat - steaks, chops, cutlets - though there are SOME frozen beefburgers that are gluten free. You will struggle to find a gluten free sausage, though. <br>  <br>  Soy sauce, seafood sticks and low fat yogurt are some foods that you might not think to check the labels on, as they "obviously don't contain gluten" - only they do. Lots of it. Soy sauce is made with wheat as well as soya, although there are some very expensive and hard to find gluten free types. Seafood sticks are made from refined gluten flavored with fish, and low fat yogurt is so thin and watery without the modified starch they thicken it with that nobody used to buy it. I'm old enough to remember this, you may not be.<br>  <br>  Gluten free shopping will become quite an ordeal as you read every label on every packet of everything you buy (unless you decide to forget about processed food and just buy stuff as nature made it).<br>  <br>  And the next time you shop, even if you found something that was ok on the mainstream shelves, you still have to check the label in case they changed the ingredients, which they do frequently if the availability or price of the existing ingredients change. Unless the taste and texture of the final product is very different, they will make no mention of this on the front of the pack.<br>  <br>  You can't trust anybody else to get stuff for you, because they probably just won't understand how to ensure they are buying something safe, and/or how important it is. Do not be surprised to hear the words "I didn't think a little bit would hurt" as you writhe in agony. Seriously, I hope you don't get reactions this severe, but it's worth egging it a little bit if this does happen, to get the message home! Whatever you actually feel, gluten is poisonous to you. Truly it is. You run terrible risks including bowel cancer if you don't keep your diet as gluten-free as possible.<br>  <br>  This article: Master of Disguise: How Gluten Hides Where You Least Expect It - <a href="http://www.glutenfreedietbook.com/articles/10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.glutenfreedietbook.com/articl...</a> should help you recognize what's safe and what's not.<br>  <br>  As a new celiac, you may find you have problems with dairy products as well, if the damage to your intestines is sufficient to knock out the enzyme-producing cells. This is only temporary. If you stick to the gluten free diet, after some months you should be able to digest dairy products again.<br>  <br>  I recommend these things: Corn Thins by Real Foods Pty instead of toast for jam, jelly, marmalade, pate, spreads and stuff like that (unless you LIKE ricecakes!); Rosti instead of toast for cheese on toast/eggs on toast type stuff; Orgran brand pasta; trail mix and Bombay mix for snacking; Mrs Crimbles coconut macaroons. <br>  <br>  I don't use a lot of specialist products. I do use quite a bit of rice flour for thickening stuff and for pancakes. I use gram flour (aka chick pea flour/garbanzo bean flour/besan) for batter.|`|cNwOuLuGaa	Not eating wheat is so hard to do...I now eat a lot of mexican food--hard shell tacos all the way!  You're going to have to shop around your local grocery store and see if they offer gluten-free products.  I don't know what you have around you but I have the best luck at Woodman's and Whole Foods.  I also have luck at Meijer's and it's the only store close to me.  I also tried Peapod and really liked it.  Some stuff is a little more expensive, but then again, all gluten-free stuff is more expensive.  I love Amy's gluten-free rice pasta microwaveable mac and cheese.  I also eat a lot of sandwiches, because I work at Subway.  It took me forever to find a bread that I liked but I like Glutino's plain bagels.  They're high in calories (as with most gluten-free products) but I love bread too much to give it up.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything...I know it's hard|`|Rl2Jcpqlaa	pasta! broth based soups! <br>  i am not allergic to gluten, but i meddle with recipes with specific things left out (gluten, animals products, nuts etc) for my own personal knowledge.. <br>  I hope you can eat corn and find some oatmeal thats OK, you can make chili and cornbread, gluten free pizza. It may seem like a pain in the butt at the moment, and its gonna be hard at restaurants and such, but gluten intolerance isn't the end of the world! <br>  bobs red mill, annies kitchen and many other known brands are around for the basics, and lots of cookbooks and food blogs are there for learning from. you can make some pretty decent baked goods too! the co-op is your friend.

So it becomes almost a daily shaving routine to keep them smooth.  I used an epilator for a while (rips the hair out by the root).  Right now I just ignore it.

It is just not the "society standard" so to speak.   For us it is expected for a woman to shave her legs and armpits.....really that is no more or less necessary then arms.....just what is expected.  Plenty of places that is not even expected. If you want to, go ahead.....or can try epilating or waxing.....that pulls the hair from the root so that it APPEARS thinner and lighter.   Shaving only makes  hairs look  thick and dark because hairs are tapered.  The very tip of a new strand of hair is thin, and so appears lighter too.....if you pull from root that is all you deal with.  After a hair has grown the hair reaches full diameter and so is thicker and appears darker.  If you shave it makes hair LOOK thicker and darker only because you are cutting off  all the thin light parts, and dealing with only thick dark parts of the hair.  Shaving is only cutting hair at the skins surface....it doesnt change the hair or hair folical.  If cutting hair made it come back thicker and darker, then the hair on your head would grow thicker and darker too if you cut it.|`|zQiORLtxaa	If not, how they can go with 'sleeve less' attire.|`|uIg6an6Jaa	there is no reason why they shouldnt

B4YESGmwaa	Some type of anti inflammatory would be helpful even over the counter. Also a heating pad, but not directly on the skin, can draw out moisture from muscles. The best way to use heat is to take a tube sock, fill with real uncooked rice (not instant) then you can microwave for 2 min or place in the freezer then place on your back-works great, and cheap and you can use it over and over

ZmP4zSJ3aa	I myself suffer from anxiety and panic attacks.  I was the same way, wanting to deal w/o medication. The good news is that its definitly possible! Your mind is a strong thing and that is what makes anxiety attacks worse. you over think. In order to get through them, it may sound crazy, but you talk to yourself. tell yourself that its only an attack, you are fine and it will end soon. Eventually you will find that you are able to get through even the biggest attacks just by talking yourself out of them. Things i have done to help in the begining : when i felt an attack coming on, SING. it sounds funny but you need to distract your brain, do a crossword puzzle, or call someone on the phone. Everyone is different but you may find that it will help. Good luck to you|`|Z3pMPWqLaa	i used to feel a lot like you do when i was 15, it really depends on the type of attacks you have, i used to not be able to breath then have horrible chest pain, the hole 9 yards, when that happened i use the tried and true paper bad method, for regular anxiety i took up some calming hobbies like drawing painting and reading. when i feel a little on edge those usually help to mellow me out pretty quickly. just find something u can lose yourself in.|`|dE7b0odvaa	You can definitely fix it mentally over time.  First off, don't bite off more than you can chew.  Prioritize your problems and take care of what's stressing you the most first(you can even write a list of things that are bothering you in the order of most to least and cross them off one st a time), then move on to the next.  If you try to solve everything at once, you'll overload yourself and accomplish nothing.  <br>  Also, focus on everything that you have to be grateful for and then the problems that you do have will seem alot smaller.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	You can start praying about what's worrying you.|`|pOmjcVjZaa	I share your problem, but I take medication because mine is severe.<br>  Well, you can't really "get rid" of anxiety, it's a mental health disorder; it's like cancer [can't really be fully cured] except you don't die, of course.<br>  I think that you should try coping skills to help yourself calm down the anxiety:<br>  -draw out what's making you anxious and then throw away the paper<br>  -don't think about what's making you anxious<br>  -meditation/yoga<br>  -slow, deep breaths<br>  -exercise<br>  <br>  those are all things that could help you with your anxiety.<br>  If these don't work, I would seek medical help and maybe consider medication; but if you feel the need not to take medication, I strongly suggest trying those coping skills [they may not work at first, but keep trying, some just take time.]|`|wI5bhnuBaa	It depends on what triggers your anxiety attacks, if anything specifically.  Anxiety is natural, although anxiety attacks are not healthy.  Tell yourself you shouldn't worry about things you can't control.  Just let things flow, don't take anything too seriously, find more things that make you happy or spend more time doing the ones that do.  Your fate is not set in stone, but it is only so malleable at the same time.  Decide goals and make steps towards achieving them.  Every fails at times, just remember your human and you're trying in a cruel world.  This may not make you feel better, but 14 is a tough age.  You have no idea how much you'll learn until you're say, my age, 21.  You may grow out of it or be able to tone down the intensity.  If it really gets in the way of living or getting things done that need to be done, you should probably take medication.|`|9D76WAg0aa	Try facing it head on i guess. I have awful anxiety and the only thing that really helps me is to breath, take a few deep breaths and think of things that make you comfotable.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|nF0Eaa2Gaa	There's a lot of breathing techniques you can perform to calm you down. Long and slow inhaling and exhaling works for me. Otherwise you can take meds to slow your heart rate.
f8mLpPXlaa	Check with your parents first. Ask them to take you to the doctor. Have you tried your inhaler? I assume you already have. And you're still wheezing, huh? That's enough right there to see your doctor or go to an ER. If it suddenly gets worse your parents should call 911. or you do it. w/e. Just get help. And the lack of appetite is not a good sign.<br>  God bless.

TC21ao0Paa	Some people may not opt for this ( stem cell research) because they may question, Where is the line drawn or, are we playing God ?? <br>  The same situation occurred with Organ Transplants. But, now that time has moved forward, more people are willing to donate their organs. <br>  Although, Stem Cell Research will be quite time consuming, it will open doors to understanding disorders and, possible cures/treatments.<br>  As A RN, who has seen alot of suffering, to me, any research that can help ease a disorder/disease and, possible cure. I'm all for it !! <br>  Unfortunately, there are many people that are not well informed of the process and that stem cell research is ( not always) from discarded embryos. So, why not allow research ?? At least, from discarded embryos ?? What is there to lose ??<br>  Some people store the placental blood from their newborns so that, if needed, there is blood available to be researched against certain diseases and disorders.<br>  <br>  As with you, I , also do not understand.<br>  <br>  But, hopefully, as time progresses, such research will be no different than Organ Transplants.|`|I7sS4w0maa	I deal with Insurance and the Lack there of on a daily basis..

f8mLpPXlaa	20% of the athletes who participated in Beijing were asthmatics, including runners. And that's competition. You're doing it for the best reason of all, to stay healthy.  Take a puff on your inhaler 15 minutes before running. Wait 5 minutes and then take another puff. Make sure you do it as you were instructed to get the deepest penetration. You needn't breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth that's for yoga. I mean that. Everyone says that to me when I have an attack and I'd just like to say "you run 2 miles and see if you can breathe through your nose!!"But I know they mean well. But really that was a yoga exercise not a way to overcome shortness of breath.<br>  Anyway, check with your doctor before you start getting serious about increasing your distance. You might want to check with a sports medicine doctor too. They'll be the biggest help.<br>  the reason your mouth and lungs burn is that you're breathing through your mouth and it doesn't humidify the air as well as the nose. Just keep your water bottle with you and sip if you feel dry. And that will happen especially in cold weather. If you're running in cold weather wear a scarf over your mouth.<br>  I'm just going to say this one more time(just because I can). Check with your doctor about a program.<br>  God bless.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	tips? stay away from factors that triggers your asthma while you are running.

2sycPf8Daa	Laura:<br>  Heartburn is common, and an occasional episode is generally nothing to worry about. However, many people battle heartburn — a burning sensation in the food pipe (esophagus), just below or behind the breastbone — regularly, even daily. Frequent heartburn can be a serious problem, and it deserves medical attention. Frequent or constant heartburn is the most common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — a disease in which stomach acid or, occasionally, bile flows back (refluxes) into your esophagus. <br>  <br>  Most people can manage the discomfort of heartburn with lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter medications:Antacids, such as Maalox, Mylanta, Gelusil, Rolaids and Tums, neutralize stomach acid and can provide quick relief. But antacids alone won't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects such as diarrhea or constipation. <br>  <br>  If heartburn is severe, these remedies may offer only temporary or partial relief. Most problems with heartburn are fleeting and mild. But if you have severe or frequent discomfort, you may be developing complications that need more intensive medical treatment and prescription medications. Talk to your doctor if you have: <br>  Heartburn several times a week 'Heartburn that returns soon after your antacid wears off .Heartburn that wakes you up at night.<br>  Wait at least two to three hours after eating before going to bed, and don't lie down right after eating. Smoking may increase stomach acid.<br>  <br>  Take care as always!
AA10358331	Mine does that too.. I think its over and it starts up light again. Its just a little bit of left over blood that hasn't escaped yet. <br>  Although I would see a doctor to get you on birth control because 9 days in a long time to have a period.|`|vlEeaB4baa	Is it normal for your periods to last nine days??

I don't know what to tell ya, but I don't think it's normal to bleed for 9 days, everyone's different, I guess.|`|bBJXp9oFaa	Completely normal.<br>  Happens to me as well, near the end of my period.

764Hudunaa	one thing you didnt mention. do you use condoms? if yes, you could have a latex allergy, if it has spermicidal in it you could have an allergy to that... now if your not using condoms 1st off you should be, anyway, you could be allergic to his ejaulate. see the doc and ask about these possibilities.
plrR4pHiaa	Could be the side effects of the birth control you are on. Some of them can cause serious problems. You should go see a doctor.|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	You maybe pregnant.  This would not be from the flu. I would at least talk to your doctor or nurse on the phone|`|vlEeaB4baa	It wouldn't be a bad idea to just go get checked out by the doctor.

About 10 years ago, I experienced the SAME THING.... and someone suggested to me that I may have a tampon up inside me. Okay, this sounds dumb, because, first of all... how the HECK would you forget you had a tampon inside you, right? I was on my period, using tampons and in the middle of the night, I guess I was too asleep when I went to change my tampon ( i know you're not suppose to sleep in them, but I use to). I put another tampon in when I already had one in. So, it pushed the old one up inside of me.<br>  <br>  It was 3 weeks later that I started having cramps and brown discharge... I also had a horrible odor that I noticed ALL the time. My advice would be to make sure this isn't what is wrong with you... get some rubber gloves and go digging! lol. Seriously, it's gross but you could get Toxic Shock Syndrome (which can be fatal) if this is, in fact, what is going on.<br>  <br>  If I'm totally wrong, and this ISN'T at ALL what you're experiencing, I would STILL say that it is old blood discharging and that you should immediatley see a doctor. Don't mess around with these things! They can be pretty serious!|`|FQjk7PTPaa	It sounds like you're spotting. When you're on birth control, even though it's supposed to regulate it, it will sometimes do things like this to your cycle. If you're getting that nasty brown stuff, you're not pregnant.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Darling you have been stressed all your life and while we have to cope and juggle everything in our live we just get on and do it.<br>  <br>  However there comes a time when we calm down that the results of all that stress starts to show.<br>  <br>  You psychologically are less worried about everyone else and so are noticing things going wrong with yourself.<br>  <br>  You are also heading towards menopausal age in fact you are probably already peri menopausal which is adding to your problems. That in itself will leave you feeling  more stressul and less able to cope with what life throws at you.<br>  <br>  You are certainly not nuts or stupid and it is not just in your head in as much as you are not imagining it. However i do think you aare possibly suffering from anxiety attacks which although stem from anxiety past or present, do actually produce physical symptoms. <br>  <br>  You are not going mad, you are not losing it, you are just at a point in your life when your body is telling you to slow down but your brain is still in overdrive mode.<br>  <br>  I suspect you are the sort of person who has tried to put your own emotions aside in order to keeep going and keep on keeping on.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it is time that you considered yourself and your own needs.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to shut yourself away and have a good cry, sob, howl ! That would do you a power of good and would certainly relieve a lot of that pent up stress. You can still be that strong person you want to pretend to be to the outside world, but start to admit to yourself that actually you are just a human being with human emotions and human needs. Fool everyone else but stop trying to fool yourself sweetheart.<br>  <br>  I recognize in you something I learned about myself a little while ago and I know where you are coming from....oh I know so well.<br>  <br>  Be kind to yourself and the rest will fall into place.<br>  <br>  Your tests have proved that there is nothing medically wrong, so when the obvious has been eliminated, start working on what is left.<br>  <br>  I wish you well darling.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk it all out online, email me any time and I will support you all the way.<br>  <br>  Lots of love<br>  <br>  Mel.X|`|c07v7O80aa	See what the 24  hour EKG shows. Certainly sounds like a disrythmia, a heart beat irregularity. The heavy beat that often follows an extra long interval after an extra or early beat is because of the extra blood pre-fill during the lag, which is the heart muscle recovering from the early beat. The early beats could be a premature atrial beat or a premature ventricular beat, or it could be runs of tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. All these can be treated and largely controlled. They may be intermittent and so may not show up just when you happen to be on the office EKG. Good news is that the lab work sounds okay, so likely no infarction - yet. A father who had an MI or by-pass before age 55 is a definite risk factor, but as they say, "Genetics loads the gun, but lifestyle pulls the trigger." Good news is you're not living 100 years ago when there wasn't much but digitalis, so you can do very effective therapies to prevent bad outcomes. Work with your doctor. But also learn to breath properly, Zen breathing with the diaphram. (You hardly ever see someone in a cardiac ICU who's not a chest breather.)|`|Q8m6BGKVaa	the "quick ekg" (you mean a 12-lead, didn't you? it takes only 6 secs to get what you need) usually is pretty clear on weather there are problems or not.  It looks at the heart from 12 different points.<br>  <br>  If that comes clear, there shouldn't be anything wrong with your heart.  Many of the symptoms you're describing could fit under other diagnosis (such as panic attacks).   The blood test coming in fine indicates that there are no eating-disorders or substance abuse problems, so it really may be psychological (in my humble opinion)|`|RgEtKVaKaa	Marie - let's see what the 24 hr EKG says.  Assuming it is within normal limits, then you can consider other possibilities. <br>  Is there something going on in your life that is causing you a great deal of anxiety?  Do you find that you are spending a lot of time thinking about your father's cardiac problems & fearing that it might happen to you?  This often happens to family members - we naturally begin to think "could this happen to me?"  Then the  flood gates are open & our minds are constantly going that direction.   You are not nuts or stupid - just really normal.  <br>  Doctors tend to run every test imaginable - or at least the ones the insurance will cover - just in case they miss something & you might sue.  Some tests ordered are not good  medicine - simply CYA medicine.   If everything comes out OK, perhaps you could talk with a therapist about your fears.  Your symptoms sound a lot like classic panic & you have ruled out just about everything else.  We all get nutty sometimes - we need to talk to someone who can help us re-focus, if you will.  Is your dad debilitated due to his cardiac problems?   This would certainly increase your anxiety.  Give yourself a break.   Good luck.

Check too see if you have symptoms described, and inform your parents you would like to share some information with them. All of you at that point can review what you have found. This would be a rather unique and simple way you can inform them of what you experience. I hope this helps you.
CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Besides being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, and Sprite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|B12E4rYiaa	This is simple all you do is get a calorie chart and keep track of all you eat and drink not to exceed 1500 calories and no less than 1200. Do cardio and weight training combo 3-5 days a week gradually increasing intensity it's the intensity that burns fat. So you need to get serious! <br>  <br>  No need for special diets only smaller portions of healthy foods. Very important to count the calories that's what counts and intensity in your workout simple but not easy. It's all up to you to do it.|`|3q5SSIcUaa	Hi  The best way I found to lose weight was to start with a short walk everyday to begin with and then once a week jog the same route. At the same time drink at least 2 litres of water a day and always use the stairs whenever posible. Eat at least 1 apple and 1 banana a day and increase the amount of milk you drink. If you want a quick burst of weight loss you will need some help. I got some Acai Berry free at <a href="http://linkbee.com/ITRR" rel="nofollow">http://linkbee.com/ITRR</a> and I used that and saw about 20lbs come off very fast using all these thngs together. Good luck!|`|IU5gS0J0aa	exercise at least 1-3 hours a day and you will be fine. Another way is to go to a gym or just eat healthier things. you could also check the calories on you food before eating so you know how much you are going to gain if you eat it

Some people don't react well to the flickering from fluorescent tubes, and that causes headaches.  It could also be the type of food you eat.  I have family that has to monitor their diet because certain trigger foods cause migraines.  It could also be dehydration. If you are doing a lot of physical activity during recess, and are sweating a lot, that could do it.  That would mean that you may want to keep a water bottle with you to ensure you stay hydrated.  Or...you may be allergic to school. Haha, though I doubt that.  Seriously though, there are numerous reasons.  If this is a chronic thing, you may want to talk to a doctor about it.

Some women can be allergic to the cotton or poly blend products in their tampons.  Also try alternating between pads and tampons, give your Vagina a rest. Do not sleep in tampons, re gardless of the time you have them inserted.  Use an overnight, over sized pad to sleep with.  This will diminish your chances of the swelling and reactions happening again|`|zf3ubDjWaa	You probably had your tampon in for too long. Don't worry it should go away with time, but if it doesn't within a few days then i suggest going to a doctor for some antibiotics

j6kyAhQOaa	In women, the arm is less straight than men, bending outward if you have palms facing upward. This is because we have wider hips, so we need the arm to bend more essentially to not bang into our hips! <br>  <br>  The "carrying angle" as it's called can vary greatly between individuals, so you just seem to have more of a bend than most. I wouldn't worry about it unless it hurts you somehow.|`|i8cFHtUzaa	I think that a "deformity" is unlikely- I just did this with my arms, and mine look very similar.

B12E4rYiaa	You need a modified body builder diet if you want bulk without fat. High protein low fat is how they do it. To lose fat you need to lose weight then you can put it back on in the form of muscle. Also the body gets used to things and doesn't respond as well anymore so you have to challenge it and change it up. Eating and training needs to change or you will stay the same or maybe get more fat.<br>  <br>  Spot reduction is a myth no matter how much ab work you do the fat will stay until you lose overall body fat. Once you get the fat gone do 20 minutes of abs everyday go to youtube for ideas and visuals to make up a routine. Hit the abs at every angle possible that's the only way to get great cuts along with proper diet of course.|`|7oetZ4I3aa	you are in your average weight range, you have nothing to worry about, 2,000 calories might be a little much for a 120 pound person, that's the average for adults who tend to be a little bigger..<br>  <br>  you have nothing to worry about, if you are worried about weight burn more calories then you eat, if you want more muscle work out, there is no mystery solution but all in all you are at a healthy weight

kzYsbLD9aa	Step 1:Place a heating pad over your belly button and over the entire area where you are cramping. For best results, lie down on your stomach with the heating pad resting close to your body. There are one-time use heating pads that you can get at the grocery or drug store. These are your best choice for convenient relief. They can be stuck to your panties so that they stay in place while you go about your daily activities. <br>  <br>  Step 2: Get moving. Cramps tend to subside if you exercise often. Those who workout on a regular basis rarely report any cramps at all. It's about getting plenty of cardiovascular exercise, and being on the go often. <br>  <br>  Step 3: Drink hot tea. This can be very soothing for the body and your energies can flow away from the cramping sensations. <br>  <br>  Step 4:Get your calcium. Monitor your diet so that you are getting adequate amounts of calcium on a daily basis. Many studies have shown that plenty of calcium can effectively help keep cramps at bay. <br>  <br>  Step5:Relax. Anxiety and worry can increase the pain of cramps severely. Do what makes you happy and what nurtures your soul. Being calm while on your period goes a long way to help eliminate cramps. <br>  <br>  Step6: Feel pleasure. Have an orgasm in whatever way works for you. If you are unattached, don't feel ashamed of giving one to yourself. The physical movement that occurs during orgasm contracts the blood vessels that are causing the cramps. You can orgasm your way out of cramping. <br>  <br>  Step7: Eat chocolate. Although its effects on cramps have not been proven, it is sure to help towards your relaxation and pleasure. Enjoy that piece of chocolate when cramping and your mind will instantly go to better things. <br>  <br>  I heard that bananas also help because of the potassium in them and dairy can help calm cramps. I always use a heating pad when i have cramps.|`|m2aznd8xaa	cutting back on caffeine also helps. excersice  and hot pads on you lower belly helps also lots of water.|`|7YZ6pzZCaa	take any kind of pain reliver|`|qfSKgxDsaa	i totally understand but honey you're going to have to take something and since they are that bad.  And you need to think about birth control, I had cramps like you from 13 - 18 until I finally started birth control and it's done wonders!!  I would have to do tylenol and advil every 2 hours and then narcotics at night just to sleep!  When the birth control kicked in I was able to just do advil like 1 - 2 times a day!  You can try a heating pad and hot bath to help but medicine is going to do what you really need.  I suggest (2 @ 500 mg) Tylenol and (2)Advil like Tylenol at 10:00 then Advil at 12:00 then Tylenol at 2:00 etc. dont take more than 12 advils a day and 4,000 miligrams of tylenol in 24 hours.  THen try tylenol PM at night if you dont have anything stronger.  You need to get into your dr. asap because it's not good to have to take all that, etc. Your dr. may try and give you something for the pain until the birth control kicks in (can take 3 months to get regulated in your body).  But you need to go you'll feel sssooo much better it's crazy|`|jvh9egWQaa	First I have to tell you I'm sorry your cramping !<br>  It sucks, I have the same problem, for me it get so bad I can't even get up and usually I won't go to school or anything it just hurts so bad!<br>  <br>  What I do is use a heating pad or take a really hot bubble bath:)<br>  But I also take Aleeve but besides that I don't know what to tell you!

I don't know what bad experiences you have had, but the right pill at the right time can be a good thing.<br>  <br>  The only other thing that really helps is a heating pad or a warm bath.

F2CJuZRSaa	Use a nice deep cleansing body wash regularly. Try to keep the area as clean as possible. Typically with blackheads, squeezing them out is the best way, If it is possible.

I am still working on getting rid of mine, we have the same problem. :(<br>  But so far this has helped me.<br>  If all else fails, see your doctor.

The bedroom is to be associated with sleep and relaxation only.  Some people like to take a relaxing bath before bed, some people say a bath energizes them.  you might try it and see what happens.  You can also try and do some body relaxation techniques such as tightening and relaxing your body in sections..starting at your feet.  Tighten and hold for a few (5-8) seconds, then relax.  Then add your calves..etc..all the way up.  Try and get your homework done as soon as you get home from school so that you have time to relax a bit before hitting the sack.   Best of Luck!|`|sJ39DTjSaa	Just something to think about....are you going to bed when you're actually tired? Judge it this way: could you read an entire page of a book? If you can, you're not tired enough. If you can't, you're ready for bed. You actually get better sleep when you go to bed tired because you fall asleep much faster and you stay asleep. So even if you only get 6 hours of sleep, you will feel better rested.

AA11286455	--You should still be able to donate blood.  <br>  <br>  --If they notice and ask you about the scars/cuts, I can't imagine what lie you could possibly dream up that would convince them the lie is true.

ufgv7oTjaa	Yes they do. There's actually a really good article on Wiki:<br>  "Stem cells are cells found in most, if not all, multi-cellular organisms. They are characterized by the ability to renew themselves through mitotic cell division and differentiating into a diverse range of specialized cell types."<br>  "The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are: embryonic stem cells that are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells that are found in adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all of the specialized embryonic tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells, but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin or intestinal tissues."|`|e7wD8sUiaa	Yes, they do and adult stem cells have already proven successful in treating a number of problems while embryonic stem cells haven't been proven to be effective for anything.|`|29yMjFInaa	Okay, forget all that hard to understand mumbo-jumbo. Adults do have stem cells, but they aren't quite the same as in a fetus. A fetus' stem cells can pretty much grow into anything, but an adult has stem cells that are already predetermined. They are only predetermined as to what kind of tissue they become. For example you have a type of adult stem cell called a Mesoblast that grows into cartilage. You also have some that are specific for muscle tissue, some for bone, some for soft, organ tissue, and so on. So a fetus' stem cells can develop into any type of tissue, but an adult has stem-cells that can only develop into a certain type of tissue. Of course each of these tissues are divided into more specific categories, and thats while they are considered stem cells.|`|b882f8d7ae92f0d5c6180f1a4ee17f0eaa	They aren't quite the same. The ones found in a fetus aren't developed into any cerain type of cell yet therefore they can maniulate the cell into any type of cell where as you can't do that once the cell knows what type of cell it is going to be. I'm 16 though and that's all I know. *Shrugs* I think they're working on a process to reverse the cells knowledge about what type of cell it is. We covered this for like 20 mins in class one day not even. Good luck :-)|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Yep, and unlike embryonic stem-cells, experimental therapies using them don't cause cancer.

nMOYFlzxaa	I have had pleurisy three times in the last year, so I know what you're going through. Every single movement hurts so terribly bad. I remember wanting to cry but not having the lung capacity or the threshold for pain to actually do it. But there's a few things I can think of to help: First of all hold your arms tight against your chest when it hurts really bad, or before you cough - it really helps. Also, as weird as it may seem, Ibuprofen really helps. I took 800mg and it made the pain go from a 9 to 5. And when you go to sleep DO NOT lay flat on your back. Prop yourself up with a lot of pillows. And the last thing is - as painful as it may be you need to every once in awhile take really deep breaths. It hurts but it'll help force out fluids. Oh- and if you live in a cold area right now, make sure to stay in the house. Cold air is the last thing you need right now. I hope you feel better soon.|`|7d7873da0c168e2a1cbda90dc29fd444aa	If you aren't seeing any improvement in your symptoms at all, you could just go to your general doctor and see what he says. Also, make sure that you get plenty of rest and drink enough fluids. Don't be afraid to cough up anything that might be in your lungs, either. It's better to get the mucus out than to hold it inside. If crying makes you feel a little better, go ahead. There is nothing wrong with crying because you feel sick. I hope that you feel better soon.

AA12368226	In my opinion the safest way to have sex is to abstain. But in today's world it is not "the thing to do" (I have an unmarried pregnant daughter).<br>  <br>  So to answer your question I would use birth control pills (it is important to take them at the same time every day) and in combination, I would also use condoms.<br>  <br>  Birthcontrol pills when taken conrrectly at 99 percent effective, but they do nothing to protect you from sexually transmitted disease. I would use a condom to protect myself and my partnet from sexually transmitted disease. Also by using a condom you are adding an extra barrier against an unplanned/unwanted pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Make sure this is what you want to do, because once you do it you can't take it back.|`|4jXlJczUaa	Ok, to go all preachy here, abstinence. Ok, now to be realistic (since *I* didn't abstain) a combo of them is the best way. Condoms protect you from almost everything, STD wise as well as pregnancy wise. If in a monogomous relationship where you know you'll be disease free, the pill is a great choice but needs to be taken daily, so in that case there is the patch, the shot, the implant. Withdrawl method is NOT advised and is likely to end up with a baby. <br>  <br>  My ex and I used the pull out method and were fine, but I know of babies who were pull out babies. Safest?

That will reduce your chances greatly of both pregnancy and STD's.<br>  <br>  Withdrawl/rythym and charting ovulation WILL NOT prevent pregnancy no matter waht.

The manufacture of hormones and neurotransmitters needed for the body's proper operation gets cut back, causing the complaints you speak of. More importantly, cell replacement gets cut back, too. That means brain cells, heart cells, muscle cells, almost every type of cell fails to get replaced in the amount needed to maintain good health.<br>  <br>  Most insomnia is caused by poor sleep habits. Large meals too close to bedtime, noise, lights, tv/internet surfing, homework, stimulants like caffeine/chocolate, warm room temperature, uncomfortable bed, worry/thinking too much can interfere with the start of the sleep cycle. <br>  <br>  I am dead serious when I say your future depends on you getting your sleep cycle back on schedule. If your sleep habits are good, then consider medication. I find the usual meds prescribed for insomnia have too many side effects. <br>  <br>  What worked for me is a 15mg dose of an antidepressant called Remeron (mirtazapine). It has a limited antihistamine effect that kicks in between 1-2 hrs after I take it. For me, it closely mimics the way I used to fall asleep naturally, doesn't knock me out so deeply that I can't be woken up to respond to an urgent situation, and it doesn't leave me dopey the next day like benadryl or any of the OTC products do. <br>  <br>  One caution: Most people find Remeron (mirtazapine) makes them VERY groggy all day long for the first 3-4 days after starting on it. This effect clears up by the 5th day.

AA10266252	It depends how much they take, but pretty much the same thing that happens if someone who does have ADHD takes Ritalin.  At therapeutic doses, Ritalin improves attention and focus in about 80% of the population (ADHD or not), so most people would find it easier to focus on things they didn't find interesting.  They might also feel more confident, and more alert or energetic.  <br>  <br>  At higher doses, people (ADHD or not) may feel anxious and jittery, their heart rate will increase (enough for them to feel), and they'll have trouble sleeping while they're on it - basically like having way too much caffeine.  Higher doses also produce feelings of euphoria, which is what people describe as being "high."|`|23d2b98ea726ae766b590e47c35b0487aa	They'll be high as a kite because it's the same thing as taking speed or cocaine.|`|LljZ7NFVaa	Basically People who have ADHD often times have an opposite reaction to chemicals in the body.<br>  <br>  My Ex Girlfriend's brother was ADHD and she had to give him Mountain Dew about 45 mins before bed because in many cases caffine causes drowsyness in ADHD people.<br>  <br>  In normal people Ritalin will have an increase in engergy and awareness much like ephedrine (for anyone who has tried that)..

My son was 9 years old and extremely hyper so the doctor put him on Ritilin.<br>  By the age of 12 he became suicidal.(one of the affects of Ritilin if taken by teens) After several attempts of suicide, he was placed in a mental hospital.That was when i learned that it was caused by him taking Ritilin.Like i said, i am not a doctor, only a regretful parent.My son is now in prison because he was so hooked on drugs from an early age, he continued to use drugs in order to cope. Think about it? Years ago children were never diagnosed with adhd.But now, 70 % of the children are placed on this drug. Teachers and doctors want the children medicated so their behavior doesn't have to be dealt with.The teachers would rather have zombies in the classroom instead of dealing with a child that may just need to have someone care about them and listen to them and give them the attention that so many children crave. So many parents have to work now days, children kind of get pushed to the side in order to pay the bills. I know, because i was one of those parents. I tried my very best to spend as much time as possible with my son, but there were times when i had to work 2 jobs just to make ends meet. Please look at other options before putting your kid on drugs.I urge you to do some research on Ritilin and the long term affects before doing this to your child.Also, look up how many people that are doing time in prison that took the drug Ritilin as a child.<br>                            good luck!|`|dOpkv2YMaa	If you do not have A.D.H.D ritalin has a reverse reaction and will make you hyper.

EBG1IAAUaa	Two things:  bicycling--the more hills the better.  ~or~ running up and down stairs.  Your gluteus maximus and quad muscles will be killer strong!|`|14ad394512d542c10b924db2e8b09cb7aa	Without going to the gym? I don't know if you can do much more than running and playing a lot of basketball to develop the muscles. <br>  If you can make it to a gym, I recommend squats, leg presses, and full body workouts to strengthen your legs by association with the strength in the rest of your body.|`|GY3C2MIeaa	Here are some great and useful tips. Fact #1, your ability to jump high come from the work of 2 main parts of your body. Firstly, there are of course the legs. Without going to the gym, I suggest squats, keep your feet little more than shoulder width apart, stick your butt out, (your back does not have to be straight) Squat down as low as you can go and then come back up (when you come back up to your starting position, dont come all the way back up, keep your knees bent very little, so you dont mess up your knees). Do the squats slowly, get the motion right and when you do, try 200-300 of those. Do 30 at a time, take a 20 second break and repeat. Do these every other day or every 2 days, so your legs can heal. Another spot you have to hit, is your calf muscles. Get 2 15-20 lb dumbells. Hold them in both hands and let them hang down to the side of your body. Have your legs about 1 foot apart and stand on your tippie toes.(you know your doing it right if it immediately starts to hurt. stand on your tippie toes as high as you can go, that is the right way) Do 50-100 of these every other day. Do them 10-15 times, take a little break and repeat. Your calfs are responsible for your lift off. The Second main part of your body to train are your abs. You want your core to be stronger, you do this by laying on your back, keeping your hands to the side ON the floor, without using ANY other part of your body than your abs, swing your legs over, so your legs are off the ground and over your head. Do this slowly and your lower abs will burn real bad. Do about 50 of these EVERY DAY. (Your abs are responsible for keeping you in the air). This workout should help you jump higher than ever. good luck and just keep working at it. ^^ peace out|`|9gio3Zqxaa	you know what you can do is stand on your toes and go back down without your heels touching the ground. do that about 50 times a day and you will feel the burn. which means its working and in about 1 to 2 weeks you will see results|`|lESxfjGxaa	Play soccer, or do a lot of sprint running.

If you can't swim, take lessons or go in the water anyways.  As long as you are moving you're going to get healthy.  You don't need a gym to get healthy.  <br>  Cut out chips, chocolate bars, baked goods, greasy foods; enjoy a treat night one day a week where you eat all the junk you want.

AA11775442	Only when he wants something.  Or is feeling guilty for something.  He has three chores thatI ask him to do on a normal basis.... Trash... Put his laundry away... and clean his bathroom.  <br>  <br>  Trash - I bag it ... take it out of the can... put it near the door.He just has to litterally take it out to the dumpster.  Often it will sit there until it piles up and I either go do it myself.... or I tell him there will be no golf until it gets done.  It is just plain gross.  This is a constant point of contention with us.<br>  <br>  Laundry - we used to have a problem.  He would come home and hit the door stripping.  a trail from the door of shoes... socks.... shirt.... warmup pants... etc down to underwear.  He walks around the house in his underwear most of the time since it is just he and I.  Well... I would have to go through and pick all of this up on a daily basis.  That is until we discovered the laundy fairy.  Periodically... and never on a specific day so it has to be kept up with on a daily basis.... the laundry fairy comes.  And if he has been a good little boy and put his laundry in the hamper.... she will take it... and wash and dry it and put it in his closet to be hung up.  IF he is not a good boy... he has to deal with dirty laundry for work until he does do it properly.  Since he hangs up everything but his underwear... he gets to deal with the wrinkles if he does not put it away promptly.   This has broken the chain of clothing from the door at least.<br>  <br>  Bathroom - He will go without cleaning the bathroom... almost until you need a hammer and chisel to knock the ring around the bathtub off.  He takes a bath everynight... thus the ring. It is his bathroom... and since he insists on taking bathtubs everynight.... he can clean it.  No one ever sees it..... they use my bathroom. <br>  <br>  If he does all of these.... on one day... or he does his half -hearted cleaning in the house ( rearranging the locations of things that are not in their proper spot but not actually putting them away).... I know he either wants something or is feeling guilty about something ( after I nag cause the first three have not been done in forever)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If I did not work... I would not expect any help.  I would even deal with his sloven behaviour.  But I blame womens lib for the fact that although I often work more hours than he does.... I am still expected to do 97 percent of the housework.  Now.. not only do we not get paid as much to do the same job a man does... but we also have the second job of running the house.  We should have kept our mouths shut and just enjoyed the days when the house and kids were the only job we had to do.|`|6a4d7d357521a8dce1ca0164e965750baa	yes!!!!

I think I'll go to bed" <br>  <br>  She went to the kitchen to make sandwiches for the next day's lunches.  Rinsed out the popcorn bowls, took meat out of the freezer for supper the following evening, checked the cereal box levels, filled the sugar container, put spoons and bowls on the table and started the coffee pot for brewing the next morning.  <br>  <br>  She then put some wet clothes in the dryer, put a load of clothes into the washer, ironed a shirt and secured a loose button <br>  <br>  She picked up the game pieces left on the table, put the phone back on the charger and put the telephone book into the drawer. <br>  <br>  She watered the plants, emptied a wastebasket and hung up a towel to dry. <br>  <br>  She yawned and stretched and headed for the bedroom. She stopped by the desk and wrote a note to the teacher, counted out some cash for the field trip, and pulled a text book out from hiding under the chair. <br>  <br>  She signed a birthday card for a friend, addressed and stamped the envelope and wrote a quick note for the grocery store. She put both near her purse. <br>  <br>  Mom then washed her face with 3 in 1 cleanser, put on her Night solution & age fighting moisturizer, brushed and flossed her teeth and filed her nails. <br>  <br>  Dad called out, "I thought you were going to bed." <br>  <br>  "I'm on my way," she said. <br>  <br>  She put some water into the dog's dish and put the cat outside, then made sure the doors were locked and the patio light was on. <br>  <br>  She looked in on each of the kids and turned out their bedside lamps and TV's, hung up a shirt, threw some dirty socks into the hamper, and had a brief conversation with the one up still doing homework. <br>  <br>  In her own room, she set the alarm; laid out clothing for the next day, straightened up the shoe rack. <br>  <br>  She added three things to her 6 most important things to do list. She said her prayers, and visualized the accomplishment of her goals. <br>  <br>  About that time, Dad turned off the TV and announced to no one in particular.

Como moro na praia, tenho a pele bem bronzeada, pois apanho bastante sol. Lembro-me de que, quando comprei, o pre?o equivalia ao de outros bronzeadores. Eu respeito a qualidade dos produtos do Boticário.

32QswYG1aa	the biceps are a pretty small muscle group so training them once or twice a week should be enough. Forgive me if i'm wrong but i'm guessing you're a beginner? You should start off doing high reps (15-20) using low weight for 2-3 sets with 30 seconds rest in between the sets. This way you build a base and after a month you can build up to heavier weights doing 6-12 reps for 2-3 sets with 60-90 seconds rest in between your sets. A suggestion on a workout programme would be to do 2-3 sets of chin ups to failure (a great bicep builder), 12 reps of sumo curls for 2-3 sets and 8 reps of EZ bar curls for 2-3 sets. Check the internet for exercise descriptions if you are stuck. Also don't forget to keep your weight training programme balanced- work your whole body not just the "tshirt muscles" and not to over train your biceps- they will not grow. Also don't forget your biceps are usually worked when working your back so allow recovery between these workouts or do them on the same day. Hope this helps|`|cCr1ilL8aa	the one that works your biceps

Venta multinivel. <br>  1. La venta multinivel constituye una forma especial de comercio en la que un fabricante o un comerciante mayorista vende sus productos o servicios al consumidor final a través de una red de comerciantes y/o agentes distribuidores independientes, pero coordinados dentro de una misma red comercial y cuyos beneficios económicos se obtienen mediante un único margen sobre el precio de venta al público, que se distribuye mediante la percepción de porcentajes variables sobre el total de la facturación generada por el conjunto de los consumidores y de los comerciantes y/o distribuidores independientes integrados en la red comercial, y proporcionalmente al volumen de negocio que cada componente haya creado. <br>  2. Entre el fabricante o el mayorista y el consumidor final sólo será admisible la existencia de un distribuidor.<br>  3. Queda prohibido organizar la comercialización de productos y servicios cuando:<br>  a) El beneficio económico de la organización y de los vendedores no se obtenga exclusivamente de la venta o servicio distribuido a los consumidores finales sino de la incorporación de nuevos vendedores, o<br>  b) No se garantice adecuadamente que los distribuidores cuenten con la oportuna contratación laboral o cumplan con los requisitos que vienen exigidos legalmente para el desarrollo de una actividad comercial. <br>  c) Exista la obligación de realizar una compra mínima de los productos distribuidos por parte de los nuevos vendedores sin pacto de recompra en las mismas condiciones. <br>  4. En ningún caso el fabricante o mayorista titular de la red podrá condicionar el acceso a la misma al abono de una cuota o canon de entrada que no sea equivalente a los productos y material promocional, informativo o formativo entregados a un precio similar al de otros homólogos existentes en el mercado y que no podrán superar la cantidad que se determine reglamentariamente. <br>  Artículo 23. Prohibición de ventas en pirámide. <br>  1. Se prohíbe la venta realizada por el procedimiento llamado ?en cadena o piramidal? y cualquier otro análogo, consistente en ofrecer productos o servicios al público a un precio inferior a su valor de mercado o de forma gratuita, a condición de que se consiga la adhesión de otras personas. <br>  2. Se prohíbe proponer la obtención de adhesiones o inscripciones con la esperanza de obtener un beneficio económico relacionado con la progresión geométrica del número de personas reclutadas o inscritas. <br>  3. Las condiciones contractuales contrarias a lo previsto en este artículo serán nulas de pleno derecho. >><br>  <br>  La empresa será más o menos "popular", sus productos funcionarán mejor o peor, ... pero lo cierto es que por lo que sé sobre herbalife se ajusta del todo a la legalidad (con respecto al sistema de distribución).<br>  <br>  Hay algunas dudas sobre la certificación de sus productos, pero esto es una larga historia y creo que ya me he extendido suficiente.|`|nImPAsIsaa	Muy bien por no creertelo, ?Te crees el producto que comercializa Xerox y City-Bank?

4a8723a2941488a3fef88e364558d865aa	Here we go again with another "penis length/size" question. There are no pills or creams, no toys or tools that will make a penis longer or larger. Any product claiming to do that should be regarded as being suspect. Likely it is a scam and the only thing that will get bigger is the wallet or bank account of the person/company offering the product. Look closely at the promotions and you will see that the product is not tested, inspected, approved or endorsed by any reputable organization. If it works why has it not been submitted to the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration for FDA Approval. If you are concerned that your penis is not large enough then consider that the average length is 5.5 inches and frankly that is plenty large enough. Read some of the posts from females who are afraid of the "huge" penises out there. Sure the "American thing" is "bigger is better" but that is not always the case. If you are concerned about the ladies pleasure - and that should be your main concern, you should develop a technique or style that makes the most out of what you were given. <br>  It is important to remember that sexual intercourse is not simply a piston going back and forth at a high speed. Actually a lot of the "jocks" haven't figured that out yet. If you work at developing a style you will score more and it will be more fun for both of you.<br>  And it will be fun learning the technique.<br>  And if you are still wanting to do something to make your penis bigger, each night before you climb into bed, get down on your knees, bow your head, and pray for a larger penis. Trust me, you stand a better chance this way than with any tools or toys.|`|9nElIoMiaa	Now that is some serious logic there dude, and some serious  incentive to lose a bit of weight, ie. to discover how big your penis really is.......<br>  <br>  But if you are going to own a big penis you should attempt to put on some muscle to match it... as the saying goes ... "you can't drive a six inch nail with a tack hammer"!<br>  <br>  I can assure you that there is substance to the Dor Oz theory. I lost 20 pounds and I think I now have more dick... not sure if you are going ot get another 5 inches out of the process.. but a couple is worth trying for isnt it? Every man thinks he can do with a couple more inches right? (even if it isn't "necessary").<br>  <br>  By the way.. when you say you are very overweight but don't look it... and that you can lose 120 pounds... you can't be serious can you? One of those two statements must be exaggerated?

Cuando los hongos se reproducen, son muy dificil de acabar con ellos, ademas es importante que cada ves que uses tu cepillo cuando tengas el pelo mojado, lo seques o lo dejes en un lugar que tenga ventilacion, siempre usa tu cepillo personas, ya que no puedes saber lo que los otros contengan...

GY3C2MIeaa	im personally a ddr freak myself. the exercise mode id awesome to have, but playing on different difficulties at different speeds will affect ow much you burn. If you are a beginnner, I suggest that you just go walking or jogging outside. lol. Just cause it would take all day to burn a significant amount of calories. 3500 calories burned off = 1 lb off your body weight. DDR workout only effective if youre at least at standard. play fast songs at 1.5- 2x faster, to burn more. to lose 20 lbs? I suggest 2-3 hours of it a day. every day. But remember losing weight is not just exercise, it is eating healthy and in moderation, and staying away from fried foods, cream sauces, sugars, and desserts. good luck, i hope i helped
4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	The company I am with is also looking into it and I think that it is something very viable.  I won't go into detail on our future program, but am willing to say that as people become busier this is going to be a very viable option for them.  I would say that as long as it is "live" it will have even more appeal as then people are getting the personal attention that they need- i.e. being able to ask the instructor a question about something.<br>  <br>  We have had a very promising response... and I wish you the best of luck!|`|9c1cb048e5cdd70622fc9e60d9257810aa	Yes I would, as long as the program was at a drastic discount vs. traditional gyms since they wouldn't be using your facility. Also paying monthly vs yearly would be a big plus since no one likes to get stuck in a membership that you end up not using.

dccb42df3c8daddfd79c083be2ac5972aa	There are 2 ways to go here. I would go to the dentist and be sure you don't have a cavity or an infection in your mouth. If the dentist finds nothing, make an appointment with your primary care doc.  <br>  <br>  I have had loads of sinus infections and sometimes they don't feel like an infection at all. But I went to the dentist first, when it wasn't my teeth it was indeed a sinus infection.<br>  <br>  I would ask your doc about the possibility of a having an MRI or CT scan of your facial sinuses. I was getting sick so often my m.d. thought I might have sinus deformities or polyps and he was right!  I also have a deviated septum and tiny bones in my nose are broken.  The CT scan showed all the problems.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, take one or two sudafed with Tylenol or Advil. If you're not using a humidifier in your bedroom while sleeping you should. Keep your door shut to keep the moisture in. Drink lots of fluids to keep the mucus thin, blow your nose often, and try using some nasal saline spray to keep the area cleaner.<br>  <br>  Been there, done that.|`|20ca577a27043d494c911596979845ceaa	It sure sounds like a sinus problem to me.

You can use a new method like Nasopure, or the vintage, Netipot.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	See your doc. 2 weeks is to long to have sinus pain and pressure.

I would visit a doctor, or even an RN/Nurse Practitioner.|`|TQRJM0kdaa	Bruises (contusions) develop when small blood vessels under the skin tear or rupture, Blood leaks into tissues under the skin and causes the black-and-blue color. As bruises heal, usually within 2 to 4 weeks, they often turn colors, including purplish black, reddish blue, or yellowish green. Sometimes the area of the bruise spreads down the body in the direction of gravity. A bruise on a leg usually will take longer to heal than a bruise on the face or arms.<br>  <br>  If you bruise easily, you may not even remember what caused a bruise. Bruising easily does not mean you have a serious health problem, especially if bruising is minimal or only shows up once in a while.<br>  Older adults often bruise easily from minor injuries, especially injuries to the forearms, hands, legs, and feet. As a person ages, the skin becomes less flexible and thinner because there is less fat under the skin. The cushioning effect of the skin decreases as the fat under the skin decreases. These changes, along with skin damage from exposure to the sun, cause blood vessels to break easily. When blood vessels break, bruising occurs. <br>  Women bruise more easily than men, especially from minor injuries on the thighs, buttocks, and upper arms. <br>  A tendency to bruise easily sometimes runs in families<br>  Sudden unexplained bruising or blood spots under the skin (purpura or petechiae) or a sudden increase in the frequency of bruising may be caused by:<br>  <br>  A medication, such as aspirin or blood thinners (anticoagulants). <br>  Infection that causes the buildup of toxin in the blood or tissues (sepsis). <br>  A bleeding or clotting disorder, such as hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, thrombocytopenia, or another less common bleeding or clotting disorder. <br>  Other diseases that affect clotting. Examples include: <br>  Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as lupus. <br>  Liver disease, such as cirrhosis. <br>  Some types of cancer, such as Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, or multiple myeloma. <br>  Inflammation of a blood vessel (vasculitis). <br>  Malnutrition, such as deficiencies of vitamins B12 , C, or K, or folic acid.<br>  to reduce the darkness of bruises use worm fomentation <br>  and you may need vitamens as B12 , C, or K, or folic acid.|`|NsqXklJ2aa	Check out this website.<br>  <a href="http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/health/Concern/Bruising.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/health/...</a><br>  As far as the bruise you already have, gently massage it from the center, outwards.  This helps the pooled up blood to re enter the system and work it's way out of the bruised area.

I did and lost 11 pounds and 21 inches in only 9 days.  I was very happy with the results and continued on the program and lost 29 pounds in 5 weeks.  This is the fastest I have ever lost with other diets like Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Medifast, Slimfast etc…. Cleansing works by removing impurities from your body.  You get impurities from your food (pesticides, preservatives, food additives, colorings) water, chemicals, pollution, medications, alcohol, hormones that the animals you eat were fed etc….YUCK!  The impurites get coated with fat and remain in your body.  To remove the fat, you have to remove the impurites.  This system worked for me, maybe it can work for you too.  You can check out the website or call this toll free number 1-877-587-4647 for more info.  The program is not cheap, but it is worth every penny since it works and keeps you motivated.  Good luck!

Because of the carbohydrates you get full on one bowl too and it give you energy with all the nutrients and vitamin.  It's a good source of fiber too.<br>  <br>  A lot of people are posting against it due to health reasons, but it is good for you, if you only replace two meals, eat one meal at the end of the day with protein & veggies and you don't do it long term.

3V98ONgRaa	if you find that it is hard on your back there are a few things you can do to remedy the problem:<br>  1- get a lumbar pillow and place it between you and the chair on your lumbar (lower back) region. lumbar pillows can be found at back / physical therapy shops or online, and range from $10-$20. or you can make your own. take a medium to large size towel (if it's large you may have to fold it in half twice, medium only once) then roll length wise and put rubber bands around it for it to keep it's shape.<br>  2- stretches every hour or so try and stand up, raise your hands above your head while you bend back for a few seconds then to each side and then to front. these will help keep you from getting stiff.<br>  3- keep yourself hydrated and not with coffee and cola. make sure you're drinking enough water for you (mean drink it but don't of do it). lack of water and too much coffee and cola can lead to muscle aches and kidney problems which will only make sitting at a desk 10x worse. <br>  <br>  i hope these things help and and if you have any questions or comments feel free to shoot me a note.|`|AA11627610	you should exercise  a little, after  long hours of sitting in order to keep up  good health & fitness. but for the safety  of  your back you should make sure that you're sitting in a good position.|`|D8rr1qqzaa	no

You have to eat a varied adequate and balanced diet. Your body needs all kinds of food to function properly including fat in smaller quantities though. Your body needs the nutrients and vitamins in fruits and vegetables the most, that is what you should eat the most of (at least 5 servings a day). You also need protein, and a little fat. Reduce your intake of sweets, fried food and foods that contain a lot of fat. Don't drink too many alcoholic beverages or soft drinks (they have a lot of calories). Don't go to sleep right after you eat. And finally exercise at least 3 to 4 days a week for about 45 minutes.Good luck.

But when most people say they want to lose weight, what they really mean is they want to lose weight without altering their current lifestyle. They want to lose weight without changing the foods that they eat, or without getting up off the couch, turning off the television, and engaging in regular physical exercise. Not surprisingly, there is a huge market that offers shortcuts to weight loss through cosmetic surgery, diet pills, nutritional supplements, and various diets -- such as the Atkins Diet. <br>  There's a growing group of people who leap from one weight loss fad to another, in search of the one thing that's going to finally help them lose weight without having to alter the foods they eat. People don't want to give up their soft drinks; they don't want to give up pizza, and ice cream, and fast food. And they sure don't have time to go out and exercise on a regular basis. So the shortcuts market is absolutely astounding -- $9.4 billion was spent last year on cosmetic surgery alone, and hundreds of millions more were spent on weight loss pills, fat burning nutritional supplements, and low-carb foods. It's a tremendous market, and the public seems to be more than willing to keep spending money on these items, even though the real answers are to be found in something entirely different. <br>  The reality of weight loss is that there are no shortcuts! You can have cosmetic surgery to remove fat from your thighs, or the back of your arms, but if you continue eating the way you've been eating, your body will just deposit the fat somewhere else on your body -- usually in a place that looks even stranger than when it was on your hips. Even if the cosmetic surgery works out for you, it doesn't alter your blood chemistry, your cardiovascular health, or your level of physical fitness. Meaning that you are just as unhealthy after the surgery as you were before, even though you may physically show less body fat. Something similar is true with foods as well. Many people continue to eat a diet high in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and obesity-promoting ingredients, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Then in an attempt to lose weight, they will take a couple of weight loss pills each day, and hope that those pills will some how counteract the entire day of eating unhealthy, obesity-promoting foods. It just doesn't work this way. <br>  If you really want to lose weight, you've got to do two things. First you have to avoid foods that promote obesity and weight-gain. These are the foods that are consumed by the vast majority of Americans, and are the ones that are the most popular in grocery stores and restaurants. Any food that's processed or manufactured is very likely to promote obesity, or some other chronic disease. Foods made with refined white flour or refined sugar, for example, will undoubtedly alter your blood sugar levels and tell your body to start storing fat. Foods high in saturated animal fats, such as red meat, or foods that are high in hydrogenated oils, like margarine or shortening, will also pack on the body fat, and harm your cardio-vascular health at the same time. Achieving a healthy body weight absolutely requires taking these foods out of your diet for the rest of your life. You can have either soft drinks and processed foods, or a healthy body weight -- but not both. In fact, much of the foods available today in the national food supply are simply incompatible with a healthy body weight, no matter how much surgery you undergo, and no matter how many weight loss supplements you attempt to take. <br>  The other part of the equation here is physical exercise. The human body simply won't shed excess body fat without engaging in regular physical exercise. Physical exercise gives you a much higher metabolism; it helps you burn calories, even while you're sitting or sleeping. It also increases your lean body mass -- especially when you engage in strength training -- and that results in even more calories being burned when you are at rest. Physical exercise, in fact, modifies your body chemistry in a way that helps your body better use refined foods such as breads or pasta. When you eat those foods without engaging in physical exercise, you're automatically going to add weight. But when you have an extremely fit body that engages in regular exercise, such as jogging, swimming, walking, or biking, you can get away with eating a few processed foods. But still you have to limit your intake of processed foods if you want to maintain a healthy body weight. <br>  In my own case, I engage in rather vigorous physical exercise several times per week, typically putting in 10 hours of exercise each week. And even then, I don't allow myself to eat any breads or pasta or refined carbohydrates of any kind. I don't consume breakfast cereals; I don't drink fruit-drinks or consume soft drinks. And what I've found is that if I eat a piece of bread or have a sandwich, then those refined carbohydrates alter my blood sugar in a way that makes me extremely hungry three or four hours later. If I had eaten a high protein meal, or a meal high in healthy fats and fibers, I wouldn't be hungry so quickly. So it is these processed foods that are in fact causing the obesity in the first place. And consuming diet pills or weight loss supplements simply isn't the answer to long-term weight loss. The answer is to look at your lifestyle, examine what you're doing wrong that needs to be corrected, and then have the courage to make the changes that will bring you into a healthy body weight and keep you there for life.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newstarget.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newstarget.com/</a>|`|AA10486799	Pilates are good.....especially Winsor Pilates. i do them and they seem to be toning my body..hope this helps...|`|AA11769670	I created a yahoo group to help me.

adb9e129f7932143e7f4b8f334929e53aa	I found this,<br>  <br>  Phony American Heart Association Diet<br>  <br>  AHA Recommendation<br>  The public should be aware that there are diets that purport to be from the American Heart Association that are not.  The true American Heart Association eating plan gives recommended daily servings from various food categories, not specific foods.  It’s a nutritionally adequate eating plan that’s intended for a lifetime of use.  It can help healthy people lose excess weight or maintain a proper body weight, but its goal is not quick weight loss.  The menus provided in the recently released American Heart Association No-Fad Diet book are also for healthy, sustainable weight loss over time. <br>  Background<br>  A diet supposedly from our organization has been cited several times across the United States and in Australia.<br>  <br>  The phony diet describes a three-day menu, supposedly prescribed by the American Heart Association or by the "Heart Association." It includes vanilla ice cream, hot dogs, eggs and cheddar cheese. The diet promises a 10-pound weight loss in three days.<br>  <br>  The bogus diet has also been cited as the Spokane Heart Diet, the Cleveland Clinic Diet and the Miami Heart Institute Diet. The poorly typed and photocopied phony diet has also been offered by mail for $2 per copy.<br>  <br>  The phony diet is not from our organization. For years, we have recommended that Americans cut saturated fat and cholesterol by limiting egg yolks, whole-milk dairy products such as ice cream and cheddar cheese, and luncheon meats. From time to time other fad diets emphasizing other foods have been falsely attributed to the American Heart Association.|`|8000f7e711beafa99f55c0c1ad9ac12daa	I am not sure who developed this diet, but I do know it works.

You can have as much water, tea, salt and pepper as you like but no other seasonings. After going on it for 3 days you can go off and eat normally for 4 days and can go back on it again. Don't over eat after the 4 days off of it.   GOOD LUCK.

Relax your body and make sure you do not feel tense.<br>  <br>  Sometimes there is something you have bothering you, try to tackle that thing head on. After you figure out what it is, maybe you can be more relaxed and fall asleep .<br>  <br>   Try not to eat too near to bedtime.

As you expand the space between the knuckles rapidly, it causes dissolved air to come out of solution and create a loud pop sound.

affeb92a248e5124a863ec37cde1127caa	Muscles pull.  That's how they work.  Pulled Muscle is not a medical term.  You may have strained or torn the muscle.  Strain needs heat for 10 minutes, and ice for 10 minutes a few times a day.  Tear needs medical attention.|`|f4cc337b330e63a7df3ccb6f581a8940aa	Yeah a pulled muscle is when you overstretch it. And the only way to heal is to chill and not use that muscle too much. It takes about a week. Sorry theres no faster way, heat can dull the pain but if you try to overuse that muscle it will get worse and take longer to heal. So just chill.|`|AA11478907	A pulled muscle is either a strain or a sprain.<br>  <br>  Strains are injuries that affect muscles or tendons, thick bands that attach muscles to bones. They occur in response to a quick tear, twist, or pull of the muscle. Strains are an acute type of injury that results from overstretching or over contraction. Pain, weakness, and muscle spasms are common symptoms experienced after a strain occurs.<br>  <br>  Sprains are injuries that affect ligaments, thick bands of cartilage that attach bone to bone. They occur in response to a stretch or tear of a ligament. Sprains are an acute type of injury that results from trauma such as a fall or outside force that displaces the surrounding joint from its normal alignment. Sprains can range from a mild ligamentous stretch to a complete tear. Bruising, swelling, instability, and painful movement are common symptoms experienced after a sprain occurs.<br>  <br>  RICE is the acronym used for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. It is used as the best initial treatment of soft tissue injuries such as sprains, strains, and contusions. The combination of RICE helps reduce inflammation that occurs after acute injury. It is important to remember that the earlier this treatment is put into place, the more effective it is.<br>  <br>  Rest: Rest and protect the injured area. If it hurts to bear weight on the injury, use crutches, or a cane.<br>  <br>  Ice: Apply ice to the injury. The cold will reduce swelling and pain at the injured site. This step should be done as soon as possible. Apply the frozen object to the area for 20 minutes three times a day for the first 48 hours.<br>  <br>  Compression: Compress the injured site. This will decrease swelling of the injured region. Although the wrap should be snug, make sure it is not too tight as this can cause numbness, tingling, or increased pain.<br>  <br>  Elevation: Elevate the injured area above the level of the heart as much as possible. This technique will also assist in reducing the amount of swelling to the injured site.<br>  <br>  Once the pain and swelling are eliminated, you should start gradual range of motion exercises but not to the point of pain.  Each day your range of motion will increase slightly.  Continue until you have complete range of motion.  Than start gentle strengthening exercises to re-build the strength in the injured area.<br>  <br>  The stiffness will go away over time.<br>  <br>  see <a href="http://www.coldoneinc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.coldoneinc.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|GULTdj4Eaa	The muscle is strained and over strethced.

Your thoughtfulness for your would be kids is really appreciable.<br>  When you say that your fiance's mother and grandmother both have the same skin condition, the I think it might have some genetic predisposition.

What you can actually do is, either ask your fiance straight about the skin lesion her family has (politely), and if she knows what exactly is the disease, then you can ask an expert about its genetic predisposition and chances of your kids to have the disease.|`|9GbD2FX5aa	go to morgellons.org and compare symptoms|`|XLFEhAwsaa	You have no idea what the name of the disease is?

e49645bfb5de900c2415f519da297d20aa	The yoga of India is traditionally thought to have originated with the sage Patanjali, author of the Yoga Sutra. The discipline consisted of what he called eight limbs, which were the following:<br>  <br>  1.Yama: Five ethical guidelines regarding moral behavior towards others:<br>  <br>  Ahimsa: Nonviolence<br>  <br>  Satya: Truthfulness<br>  <br>  Asteya: Nonstealing<br>  <br>  Brahmacharya: Nonlust<br>  <br>  Aparigraha: Noncovetousness<br>  <br>  2. Niyama: Five ethical guidelines regarding moral behavior towards oneself:<br>  <br>  Saucha: Cleanliness<br>  <br>  Santosa: Contentment<br>  <br>  Tapas: Sustained Practice<br>  <br>  Svadhyaya: Self Study<br>  <br>  Isvara pranidhana: Surrender to God<br>  3. Asana: Practice of yoga postures.<br>  4. Pranayama: Practice of breathing exercises.<br>  5. Pratyahara: Withdrawal of the senses, meaning that the exterior world is not a distraction from the interior world within oneself.<br>  6. Dharana: Concentration, meaning the ability to focus on something uninterrupted by external or internal distractions.<br>  7. Dhyana: Meditation. Building upon Dharana, the concentration is no longer focused on a single thing but is all encompassing.<br>  8. Samadhi: Bliss. Building upon Dhyana, the transcendence of the self through meditation. The merging of the self with the universe. Sometimes translated as enlightenment.<br>  <br>  In traditional yoga it is also essential to have a guru, and to have renounced worldly life. What usually goes under the name Yoga in the west is not yoga at all, even when it seems relatively "spiritual" and serious. Actually, it would be pretty much impossible for most people today to practice.|`|pYgHDwnnaa	<a href="http://webpages.shepherd.edu/tsantm01/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://webpages.shepherd.edu/tsantm01/hi...</a>

lObEjUh1aa	i'm not an expert, but here's what i've pieced together from what my personal trainer has advised, combined with a bit of common sense:<br>  <br>  1.  your body gains weight when the calories you intake (food) exceed the calories you output (burn through exercise).<br>  <br>  2.  your metabolic rate determines how many calories you have to intake to gain weight.<br>  <br>  3.  skinny people typically have above average metabolic rates, and therefore have to take in more calories to gain weight.  having to take in large numbers of calories may be difficult, as it may involve significant changes in diet.<br>  <br>  4.  overweight people may have below average metabolic rates, and may not have to take in a lot of calories to gain weight.  if the goal is to maintain weight, but burn fat while building muscle, the overweight person may not have to make any changes in the number of calories consumed, but will probably still have to change the types of food eaten (from foods with high fat content to healthier choices).  for many people, this represents a significant dietary change & is just as difficult as scenario 3 (above).<br>  <br>  5.  whether you the weight you gain is muscle or fat depends on your degree of exercise.  too little exercise = fat; just right = muscle.  too much exercise and your body can actually burn muscle tissue to produce the energy necessary to perform the exercise.  i assume this is why a lot of the skinnier women (eg models) work out constantly, yet don't seem to gain much strength.  they are taking in too few calories for their intense workout routines, and consequently muscle tissue is burned.<br>  <br>  the short answer, then, is that being skinny or big is an effect, not a cause.  it is metabolic rate that determines how many calories you must intake to gain weight.  the requisite dietary changes are typically difficult for anyone.|`|9nElIoMiaa	I'm only guessing... but probably.. since the energy resources are there to tap.. bearing in mind however that a fat person has some underlying muscle necessary to carry all that fat.... so it is purposeful to tone it up and reveal it through lots of cardio and some lifting... whereas a skinny runt needs to do lots of lifting to build muscle  .... whatever they do... it's really hard work for either body shape.|`|dXrdU0Qbaa	My field is in fashion, as a result many people ask me how they can slim down.

Also food choices can play a huge role in causing and preventing acid reflux.<br>  <br>  Eating 'fast food' that is high in fat and preservatives, missing meals, eating late, eating before physical activity and eating quickly without thoroughly chewing food can all lead to acid reflux.

Hope it helps.<br>  <br>  SUMMARY OF EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  1)  The adverse effects of tramadol are very similar to those of narcotics, except that respiratory depression and effects on smooth muscles are usually less pronounced with tramadol. Respiratory depression can result from coadministration of tramadol with alcohol, anesthetics or other respiratory depressants. <br>  2)  Physical and psychological dependence is a risk, although tramadol is less abused as a single drug than conventional narcotics. <br>  <br>  <br>  1)  Overdose effects of tramadol are usually extensions of its pharmacologic activity and include miosis, vomiting, seizures, coma, respiratory depression, tachycardia, hypertension, lethargy and rarely cardiovascular collapse. <br>  2)  Either monoaminergic effects (from inhibition of NE and 5-HT uptake), or opioid effects (from agonist effects of the main metabolite at the mu opioid receptor), may predominate following overdoses. Coingestants may affect the type of clinical presentation seen with tramadol overdoses. <br>  3)  Though uncommon, fatal respiratory depression has been reported with tramadol overdose. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EYES<br>  <br>  A)  WITH THERAPEUTIC USE<br>  <br>  1)  A single 100 mg dose has resulted in mydriasis in a previously healthy 32-year-old man taking no other medication (Gleason et al, 1997). <br>  <br>  B)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  1)  Miosis is common following an acute overdose (Prod Info ULTRAM(R) oral tablet, 1999; Riedel & von Stockhausen, 1984). <br>  <br>  2)  BLURRED VISION was reported in 5 of 190 patients (2.6%) in a retrospective series of patients overdosed with tramadol only (Marquardt et al, 2005)<br>  <br>   3.5   CARDIOVASCULAR<br>  <br>  A)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  1)  Tachycardia, hypertension, and rarely cardiovascular collapse can occur with tramadol overdose.<br>  <br>  CLINICAL EFFECTS<br>  <br>  A)  HYPOTENSIVE EPISODE<br>  <br>  1)  WITH THERAPEUTIC USE<br>  <br>  a)  Hypotension may occur as an adverse effect following therapeutic use (S Sweetman , 2001). <br>  <br>  2)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  a)  Cardiovascular collapse can occur in severe overdoses (Prod Info ULTRAM(R) oral tablet, 1999). <br>  b)  CASE REPORT - A 37-year-old woman developed hypotension (68 mmHg systolic), right heart failure, and serotonin syndrome after ingesting 2 grams tramadol (Garrett, 2004).<br>  <br>  B)  VASODILATATION<br>  <br>  1)  WITH THERAPEUTIC USE<br>  <br>  a)  Up to 5% of patients involved in clinical trials experienced vasodilation following therapeutic doses of tramadol. Less than 1% of the patients experience orthostatic hypotension with syncope and/or tachycardia (Prod Info ULTRAM(R) oral tablet, 1999). Underlying diseases and the use of other medications were present in some cases. <br>  <br>  C)  CORONARY ARTERIOSCLEROSIS<br>  <br>  1)  WITH THERAPEUTIC USE<br>  <br>  a)  Myocardial ischemia, hypertension, abnormal ECG and palpitations have been infrequently reported adverse effects in clinical trials. Cause-effect relationships between these effects and tramadol were not determined. Underlying diseases and other medications may have been present (Prod Info ULTRAM(R) oral tablet, 1999). <br>  <br>  D)  SINUS TACHYCARDIA<br>  <br>  1)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  a)  INCIDENCE - In a prospective series of 87 cases of overdose with tramadol alone, 11 patients (13%) developed tachycardia (Spiller et al, 1997). In a retrospective series of 190 cases of overdose with tramadol alone, 33 patients (17%) developed tachycardia (Marquardt et al, 2005).<br>  <br>  E)  HYPERTENSIVE EPISODE<br>  <br>  1)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  a)  INCIDENCE - In a prospective series of 87 cases of overdose with tramadol alone, 4 patients (5%) developed hypertension (Spiller et al, 1997). In a retrospective series of 190 cases of overdose with tramadol alone, 11 patients (5.8%) developed hypertension (Marquardt et al, 2005).<br>  <br>  G)  RIGHT HEART FAILURE<br>  <br>  1)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  a)  CASE REPORT - A 37-year-old woman developed hypotension (68 mmHg systolic), right heart failure (jugular venous distension, echocardiogram showed dilated right heart chambers, severe functional tricuspid regurgitation, high pulmonary artery pressure), as well as clinical manifestations of serotonin syndrome after ingesting 2 grams of tramadol (Garrett, 2004).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   3.6   RESPIRATORY<br>  <br>  A)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  1)  Severe overdoses can result in respiratory depression and pulmonary edema. <br>  <br>  a)  Severe respiratory depression developed in a 66-year-old male surgical patient after thiopental-induced anesthesia which was followed by 679 mg tramadol IV over 3.4 hours. Increased somnolence, miosis and respiratory depression developed 6 hours after surgery. The patient responded to intubation and assisted ventilation (Rothe & Brather, 1983; Prod Info ULTRAM(R) oral tablet, 1999). <br>  <br>  C)  ACUTE LUNG INJURY<br>  <br>  1)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  a)  Acute lung injury (pulmonary edema) has been reported at autopsy following large intentional ingestions (Musshoff & Madea, 2001; Moore et al, 1999; Lusthof & Zweipfenning, 1998). <br>  <br>   3.7   NEUROLOGIC<br>  <br>  A)  WITH THERAPEUTIC USE<br>  <br>  1)  Seizures have occurred with therapeutic dosing. <br>  <br>  1)  Cerebral depression can be seen in overdose. Seizures have occurred both in overdose and with therapeutic dosing. Recurrent seizures (10 hours post-ingestion) have been reported after overdose. <br>  <br>  a)  Dizziness or headache were reported in 18% to 33% of 550 patients who received therapeutic doses of tramadol (Prod Info ULTRAM(R) oral tablet, 1999). <br>  <br>  2)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  a)  CNS depression can result from acute overdoses (Sachdeva & Jolly, 1997). <br>  b)  INCIDENCE - In a prospective series of 47 cases of overdose with tramadol alone, 11 patients (23%) developed lethargy, 2 (5%) developed coma and one became confused (Spiller et al, 1996). In the same expanded series of 87 patients, 26 (30%) developed lethargy and 4 (5%) developed coma (Spiller et al, 1997). <br>  <br>  1)  In a retrospective study of 190 patients with tramadol only overdose, 52 (27.4%) developed CNS depression; 11 (5.8%) reported dizziness; 7 (3.7%) became confused; 6 (3.2%) reported headache; and 3 (1.6%) developed coma (Marquardt et al, 2005).<br>  <br>  B)  SEIZURE<br>  <br>  1)  WITH THERAPEUTIC USE<br>  <br>  a)  With therapeutic usage, the risk of seizures may be associated with chronic therapy, the presence of co-factors (e.g., other drugs which predispose for seizures), or confined to a small population subset that is particularly sensitive to this effect. Seizures occurred in less than 1% of the general population using tramadol in a retrospective cohort study (Gardner et al, 2000). <br>  b)  INCIDENCE - 121 seizure events were reported in patients receiving tramadol according to the FDA's database of adverse drug events through July 31, 1996 (Kahn et al, 1997). Of these events, 52 (43%) were described as generalized tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures, 47 (38.8%) were described as "seizure", and 22 (18.2%) were described as miscellaneous. Of 124 total reports, 30 (24.2%) were suggestive of possible overdoses. <br>  <br>  1)  The FDA has issued a warning concerning risk of seizures in patients taking concomitant drugs which may reduce the threshold for seizures or in patients with medical conditions predisposing to seizures. Tramadol should not be prescribed for these patients (Nightingale, 1996). <br>  <br>  a)  Focal and generalized seizures have been reported following acute tramadol overdose (VanDerburgh et al, 1998; Tobias, 1997). Seizures are generally described as brief, self-limiting, mostly single events, and most often occur within 4 hours of ingestion, although delayed seizures occurring 10 or more hours post-ingestion can occur (Marquardt, 2001; Marquardt et al, 2002). <br>  b)  INCIDENCE - In a prospective series of 47 cases of overdose with tramadol alone, 5 patients (11%) developed seizures, all of which were brief and did not recur (Spiller et al, 1996).<br>  <br>  1)  STUDY - In a retrospective series of 190 cases of overdose with tramadol alone, 26 patients (13.7%) developed seizures. Seizures developed within 6 hours of ingestion in 84.6% of these patients. Of the patients who had seizures, 80.8% had a single seizure, 3.8% had 2 seizures, 11.5% had multiple seizures, and no patient had status epilepticus (Marquardt et al, 2005).<br>  2)  STUDY - In a prospective study of 57 cases (mean age 22.3 users [range 16-43 years]) of tramadol intoxication and abuse, 31 (54.4%) patients experienced generalized tonic/clonic seizures (single in 14 and multiple in 17 patients) after a tramadol dose ranging from 250 to 2500 mg. In 26 (84%) patients, seizures developed within 24 hours after tramadol intake; in 5 (16%) patients, seizures developed later. Abnormal EEG findings (both epileptiform and non-epileptiform) were more common in patients with seizures than in those without seizures; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Overall, seizures were more common in younger tramadol abusers with a longer tramadol exposure. In addition, seizures developed at lower doses when tramadol was combined with alcohol than with other drugs (eg; benzodiazepines, heroin, butorphanol) (Jovanovic-Cupic et al, 2006).<br>  <br>   3.8   GASTROINTESTINAL<br>  <br>  A)  WITH THERAPEUTIC USE<br>  <br>  1)  Gastrointestinal effects are common. Nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and flatulence can occur. <br>  <br>  a)  550 patients enrolled in clinical trials involving tramadol administration for up to 90 days reported nausea in 24% to 40%, constipation in 24% to 46%, and vomiting in 9% to 17% of patients. Medical conditions and other medications were present in some cases (Prod Info ULTRAM(R) oral tablet, 1999). <br>  b)  Constipation and flatulence are reportedly less common with tramadol than with morphine (Worz, 1984). <br>  <br>  2)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  a)  The most frequent gastrointestinal overdose effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and xerostomia (Padmasuta, 1987; Padmasuta, 1985; Rohdewald et al, 1988; Rodrigues & Rodriques Pereira, 1989; Oviasu et al, 1984; Richter et al, 1985; Ofoegbu, 1984; Prasertsawat et al, 1986). Medical conditions and other drugs may have contributed to the effects reported in some studies. <br>  <br>  1)  Gastrointestinal effects were generally mild and did not result in discontinuation of the drug in most patients. <br>  <br>   3.9   HEPATIC<br>  <br>  A)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  1)  Death from hepatic failure occurred following an unintentional overdose.<br>  <br>  A)  HEPATIC FAILURE<br>  <br>  1)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE<br>  <br>  1)  The exact quantity ingested is unknown, but he was initially dispensed 84 tramadol tablets (50 milligrams) and four days later requested a refill. Eight days after starting the medication he was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, drowsiness, central cyanosis, hypotension and markedly elevated liver function tests. Cardiopulmonary arrest occurred shortly after admission and the patient died.<br>  2)  Abnormal liver function tests included: ALT (1739 Units/L); AST (1515 Units/L); albumin (26 g/L) and total bilirubin (57 mol/L). Autopsy revealed evidence of extensive hepatic necrosis without background cirrhosis. Autopsy blood tramadol level was 3.7 mg/L (normal 0.1 to 0.3 mg/L), which was significantly lower than previously reported fatal ingestion levels.|`|Rv6YJdwfaa	Tramadol hcl is a drug that is used mainly for the treatment of chronic pain. Often it is prescribed for people with conditions such as cancer or some types of severe arthritis, as well as after surgeries to combat surgery pain. Tramadol hcl works with the pain receptors within the body to help dull the pain the body recognizes and feels. This drug has been found very effective with people who deal with chronic pain and does not have as much risk of addiction, as some other narcotics tend to have. It is also fairly safe to use and usually, unless taken in large quantities, does not repress respiration. Overdosing on Tramadol-HLC can cause seizures, serious respiratory reactions, and severe dependency issues. Hope this helps!

uvLtN6Fqaa	If you want to lose fat then the body can only burn about 2 lbs per week. It takes 2500 calories to equal one lb of fat so you need to create a deficite of that in a week. Lower your food intake and increase your exercise. Be careful though, if you drop your food too low your body will go into starvation mode and try to hold onto the calories by lowering your metabolism. If you use other methods to lose weight, such as diet pills, they only cause you to shed water from your cells, so you will gain it right back after you go off them. <br>  <br>  Drink lots of water, exercise and reduce your calories... also do some weight lifting as increasing muscle mass will cause you to burn calories more efficiently.|`|rBrDrx1iaa	---eat only fruit ,veg,potato-no butter- no meat,drink only water or freshly squeezed oranges , if you have a good variety of fruit an veg,pulses ,rice or beans you will be OK health wise-       and fast weight loss-exercise or walk if poss-that will help. good luck,|`|c5b206ace3b334bb42d0edd240e0234baa	if try cutting out any and all fried foods, try drinking water or if you want flavor try crystal light(0 calories) and just do cardio 4-5 times a week, you should lose some weight.

Mlwd5Bt3aa	I'm sure that you'll lose a couple pounds, just like cutting out soda cuts out pounds, but it really depends on your normal calorie intake it.  If you are currently eating an amount of calories that makes you gain weight regularly you might just stablize your weight rather than lose weight, but if your weight is currently stable while you are eating transfat you will lose weight.  You need to put this into consideration in order to figure out whether you will lose weight or not.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :D|`|gM0rIwxJaa	That is a good start.  But there are a ton of hidden trans fats in all kinds of food.  U will see a lot of brands using the phrase no trans fat per serving. That means it has less than .5 grams of trans fat per serving, it is not trans fat free.  So if u want to eat as little trans fat as possible, buy only goods that have no partially hydrodgenated ingredients/oils.  Also try to eat more good fatty foods such as nuts and low fat milk and lots of fruit (i dont like vegetables but if u do eat those too)
897e7a393eaaa2e07450e638d086ce46aa	You have a bad sunburn, you need to see a doctor. Your body is probably retaining fluid, so I would imagine that you're gaining a bit of water weight. You might want to take it easy on your burn, it won't kill you to take a day or two off of exercising to let your legs heal. Your body will be burning more calories to repair your skin, so I guess you'll be ok just cutting calories, and maybe some light cardio.I couldn't imagine how you would be able to exercise while that badly burned without being in pain. If you have a fever, take some tylenol and apply some cold compresses to your legs.|`|PFrDGevhaa	Sunburn? <br>  <br>  <br>  Take a cool bath, then go to the doctor.|`|AA10698995	The water well affect your weight.

xBbd6Qkkaa	I wouldn't suggest ANY "diet plans" if you're prone to binging.  Because most likely you'll lose the weight, and something else will stress you out and you'll just gain it right back.  Just start eating healthy (lots of raw foods: raw fruits and veggies, raw nuts, healthy snacks like rice cakes, raw peanut butter for protein, veggie wraps, things like that) and drink LOTS of water (NOT soda or sugar-packed drinks).  Stick to that..it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle.  The weight will fall off, and you don't have to go nuts worrying about a "diet plan".<br>  <br>  Oh and one random thing that I have discovered in my raw, healthy foods journey.  This is a VERY healthy snack, and wonderful in warm weather.  It's my replacement for ice cream.  Freeze some fruit, I'd say like..half a container of strawberries, some blueberries, or raspberries, or bananas..basically any fruit that you like..or even a mix (the mix is good) and wait til they're completely frozen, then put them down a juicer.  They'll come out in the consistency of sherbert.  Add one packet of splenda or a small spoonful of sugar..and eat.  It's completely healthy, it's all fruit, and strangely enough, tastes EXACTLY like sherbert.  Try it, it's amazing for sweet tooth cravings!<br>  <br>  Anyways I hope something in this helps!  Good luck!|`|mqFm478gaa	drink 4-5 bottles of water a day. Eat lots of fruits and veggies. Watch your calories!

Some individuals with suppressed or otherwise abnormal immune systems or degenerative diseases use undenatured bioactive whey proteins to increase their antioxidant levels.

(Génesis 2:7.) Así que Adán era un alma. Cuando Adán murió, murió como alma. Su alma no era algo separado de su cuerpo. El alma de Adán era todo su ser. ?Dónde estaba Adán antes de que Diois lo creara? No existiía. ?Dónde estaba el alma de Adán antes de ser creado él? No existía. Así que cuando recibió la sentencia de que volvería al polvo del que había sido formado, Adán como alma volvería al polvo. Ezequiel 18:4 dice que "el alma que peca, morirá." Como todas las almas pecamos, todos morimos. Si hacemos la voluntad de Dios, seremos de la clase que tiene fe resulta en "conservar viva el alma" y viviermos para siempre. (Hebreos 10:39.) Si no, la falta de fe no nos permitirá "conservar viva el alma" y el alma morirá. O, como lo dice Santiago, si se hace volver a un hermano, "se salva su alma de la muerte." (Santiago 5:19.)<br>  Algunas versiones traducen en estos pasajes en lugar de alma, vida. Pero las palabras originales en hebreo y griego son nephesh y psiké, respectivamente, y se traducen alma. Nunca se encuentra en la Biblia la frase "alma inmortal." Sino que hace siempre referencia al alma como sujeta a la muerte, con la promesa de la resurrección futura. En efecto, Jesucristo se refirió a los muertos como los "que están en las tumbas." (Juan 5:28.) Desde el punto de vista de él, los muertos están en las tumbas y por eso hay necesidad de que en el futuro esas almas sean resucitadas. <br>  ?Le gustaría conocer más a fondo sobre este tema?

When i had to drop some quick weight before a match, the night before, i would sit in the bathroom with the shower and faucet turned as hot as they could get and just sweat. try it out, but be careful. DO NOT COMPLETELY DEHYDRATE YOURSELF!!  And tell ya family to lay off wit the jokes if that really bothers you|`|IhvbAor0aa	you have a week?  You can't lose too much, but maybe if you are that self conscious, just try taking away the carbs for the week.  If you starve yourself, you'll retain water and you won't lose any weight..  Just a fair warning.|`|UBlhj1E0aa	eat 6-7 small SNACKS daily, not meals, snacks. this gets your bodys metabolism sped up and helps you burn the carbs more quickly.  Ill be honest with you, you cant lose much in a week, you would have to be dying to lose weight in a single week, and thats your muscle being eaten by your body.not fat. what you can try to do if you want "results" by tuesday, is to just wing it and pick out an outfit that makes you look slimmer. I know this is just a quick fix but you cant really lose weight in a week. its honestly  a long process.
5H2OiZJUaa	Sounds like t.m.j (temporomandibular joint) disorder. the symptoms include "clicking or grinding" , pain around the ears, ringing ears, soreness and stiffness of jaw muscles. this disorder can be caused by a number of things including over closure of the jaw, stress, etc. If this sounds familiar i would suggest seeing a Dr for treatment because it can possibly get worse and cause more discomfort.|`|rC2dE1qxaa	Go to the dentist, you probably will need brackets to correct the position of your jaw... if you leave it unattended you could damage your jaw bones.

jwvKTPQvaa	about six grams of protein in a egg graded as "large"<br>  I wouldn't throw away the yolks though because the contain many nutrients, and the effects of the cholesterol (which we actually need to survive, our bodies would literally disintegrate without it) that they do contain is canceled out by a naturally occurring anti-oxidant in the egg yolk called lecithin.  <br>  here is a quote from this article: <a href="http://diet.ivillage.com/issues/ichoices/0,,vdd,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://diet.ivillage.com/issues/ichoices...</a><br>  <br>  "Dietary cholesterol has virtually no effect on serum cholesterol. Even Dr. Ancel Keys, whose original "Seven Countries" study gave rise to the whole fat/cholesterol/heart disease madness in the first place, has said: "There's no connection whatsoever between cholesterol in food and cholesterol in the blood. None. And we've known that all along." That has been confirmed in study after study after study.|`|GY3C2MIeaa	4 grams per egg. If you want to eat scrambled eggs in the morning, I suggest taking the yolks out of 3 of them and then eating it. Yolks are high in cholestorol, plus you still get all your protein since the protein is in egg whites. I also suggest eating a lot of tunafish, chicken, salmon, nuts, and lean beef. good luck, hope this helps
c9cnXVMFaa	A nurse I once knew had a stroke in her thirties.  After surviving a coma, it left her blind in one eye.  I asked her if she saw anything one day and she said she wasn't even aware of eye not seeing anymore.  She had become so accustomed to seeing with one.  The thing she did notice was that her depth perception was not there anymore.  It was hard to know when to stop while parking her car because she could not easily judge exactly how close she was.

8ckqWTwXaa	there is no such thing called "drinking too much water". Actaully, drink as much more water as you can. Dont lift super-heavy weights. Heavy weights bulk you ip. Lift light weights, but do several repeititions. Keep doing this for a few weeks. Do not lift heavy weights during this session. Your goal is to not let your muscle fibers break while working out if you want to get toned and look lean.<br>      Above all, watch what you eat. And do a lot of cardio. You may even cut back on lifting weights and fill up that time space by doing cardio. Maybe about 5 times a week. But dont push yourself TOO hard. Cuz if you push yourself too hard, you'll burn your muscles instead of fat.|`|9d3ce70fe723c76264a9f283d685bce2aa	Keep working your muscles to keep them big and do some cardio to lose fat.<br>  <br>  You can't really change the amount of water in your body without just dehydrating yourself, which would only work for a short amount of time. |`|EVS5t31qaa	"More leaner."

People make it like "I'm" the problem, when in fact, people are abusive & hateful towards me for no reason. I have no one to turn to. Not even people here on Y!A. Every time I seek advice or support, people think I'm crazy & need to be locked up. That's why I stay home all the time, & people get all "concerned" when I stay in my shell. When I come out, & start trying to interact, that's when people treat me like a plague. They scream AHHHHHHHHH! & run.<br>  <br>  I just feel like crying. People don't understand NOR care how I feel. They love inflicting pain on me, even emotionally. & they think it's FUNNY! I suffer every day.<br>  <br>  I have to question the morality of everything I do, say, think, & feel. It's eating me up to the point where I can't function normally in my daily life. The Wellbutrin doesn't help me feel better. The Luvox doesn't help my OCD unwanted thoughts. I'm mentally tortured. Unappreciated & unaccepted everywhere I go. In person or online.<br>  <br>  I'm 25 with a college degree & still can't make my own decisions or live how I want to. I REALLY want to be happy. But if you were treated on a daily basis how I get treated, you'd be shaky, nervous, depressed, & having angry outbursts, too.<br>  <br>  I have no control over my life. Outsiders, who so-claim to HATE me & wish me dead, always think it's THEIR place to tell me when, how, & where I can sleep, eat, & ****. & then, I have to owe them an answer for WHY!

eLbJennXaa	I think you just answered yourself there, sex aint suposed to hurt, if it hurts its the body's signal that something is wrong, and if you are bleeding well look at it logicaly ;)<br>  <br>  If you tried to push a carrot up your nose, and kept pushing even if it hurt, then nesicarily something would have to give, if this was the sensitive nosewalls ;) then you'd nosebleed ;)<br>  <br>  Even if you had kids, if you then dont have sex for months or had a c'section this may have lead to you geting more thigth again, and you will just have to take your time working on adjusting your body again.<br>  <br>  If your body tell you it had enough then stop and listen to it, dont keep hurting yourself, if your rifted, then pushing will just go to open the rifts again before they can heal.<br>  <br>  Much akin to say if you put your fingers on the skin of your hand and push down and apart, eventualy they will slide, no damage, however if there was a wound on the skin between your fingers, then the likelyhood is that streatching the skin around it would blow it up (because its a weak point) and it would need more time to heal again. Hence why wounds should be left alone to properly heal.<br>  <br>  If you got wounds from streatching to much these must heal properly first (find other ways to enjoy yourself) and then when they have, you need to go more carefully so you dont cause new ones by puting more strain on your surfaces then they can handle (so they crack).

0VYcSpz3aa	go to the doctor's and find out.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I think that regardless of whether it turns out you are pregnant or not, you need to get some help and talk to someone about this, whether it is your boyfriend or a therapist or evem a phoneline councellor. Regardless of whether or not you have a disorder, it doesn't make rape any more acceptable and it is still going to be hard for you. Maybe even make an appointment with your gp, you can talk about what happened and work out what steps you need to take in relation to both your physical health as well as your mental wellbeing.|`|2vwzSCuiaa	Be honest about what your thinking and feeling with your boy friend. (If he is suppoartive and its a health relationship) He should help you and support you. Wheather he secretly wonders if it really happened or not, he should help you if your obviously distressed. If hes just not a nice guy confide in a friend or relative. Above all get to a doctor and find out for sure!! But this is a big deal you need help to get through it.|`|S0uKxvgFaa	Hey!  I think you definitely need to see your doctor about this.  And report this to the police - don't let your disorder stop you from making a report.  I was almost diagnosed with this myself so i know what the conditions is about.  However, if you WERE raped, you need to do everything in your power to stop this happening from somebody else.  Right now you need all the support you can get.<br>  <br>  If it turns out you are pregnant, you now have a very important decision to make - either keep the baby or have an abortion.  If you chose to keep the baby you will have to decide whether to tell your partner the truth about your pregnancy or not.  Should he find out you were raped and the baby isn't his, it may present a lot more problems for you.  Please get yourself some help.<br>  <br>  Sore nipples can also be a symptom of a period though (sore nipples, sore breasts), but i still wouldn't hesitate for ONE SECOND about getting yourself some help.  See a doctor as soon as you can - not just to see whether you are pregnant, but to also see if you have any sexually transmitted diseases.  If you do then you will need to get the right medications to clear that up.  It could also be a side effect of the medication you are taking but to be sure you'll need to see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Please get yourself some help and make a report.  Too many criminals walk free because people are too ashamed, scared or believe it was a dream (i do know that sometimes this disorder can cause confusion about reality but its better not to take that risk).  It is never your fault, you have nothing to be afraid of and if it turns out that you are mistaken, at least you will know for sure.  Please get help.  I wish you the very best and hope things turn out for you.|`|XqfH76PMaa	You may be missing your period because of the stress that you are going through.  That happens alot.  Wait for another week and if you do not still get your period, take an at home test to see for sure.  You need to talk to your doctor about what happened.  It will help you out and it is not good to keep this in.

What you should do it incorporate cardio into your lifestyle to burn fat, and also add weight training to tone and tighten your arms.|`|0f49406b90defffce3a0f65909e39bdaaa	Eat only when hungry and not more than thrice a day. Nothing other than water in between. Include plenty of uncooked vegetables and fruits in each meal, preferably 50%. Chew each morsel at least 32 times to activate ur body to generate signals of hunger/fullness.

Slowly do small circles forwards for count of 10 to start.  Then without putting down arms, do 10 more backwards.  When you can, increase by adding medium sized circles.<br>  <br>  This done every morning and in a few weeks adding it to nights before bed (twice a day) reduces upper arm fat but also tones the flab out from the under arm bottom.|`|ba9fde6960c9467d0cf35bd2669e803eaa	You gain arm fat because you're eating too much.

Generally, men have them in the stomach, and women have them in the arms, thighs, and buttock.<br>  <br>  To lose it, do lots of cardiovascular exercises, such as running, swimming, etc. Even jumping and walking helps. Also, mind your diet. Eat less calorie than you give out.

WqqDw3PCaa	Does he have plantar fasciitis?  If so, he can buy some insoles online which are VERY helpful.  Sorry I forgot the wesite (I'll post the website if I find it in the next couple of days).  Also my mom had this and the doctor told her to stand on a step but only with half of the foot on the step, so the heel hangs off the step, and then to just raise your feet up and down, as if you are doing exercise for your calves.  He also told her to take a soda can and place it on the floor and then put your foot on it and roll it back and forth.  She also used to massage her feet all the time.  If he has plantar fasciitis sometimes the podiatrist will give injections but the pain can return, so I would try those tips if he has plantar fasciitis.<br>  <br>  Also, prednisone is a VERY STRONG medication, if he can do something else it would be much better than taking prednisone again.|`|f005983d8c4908c03021a87774d6b3f5aa	Sounds like maybe plantar fasciitis. It is an inflammation that the Prednisone, a steroid helped to ease. Since the med is stopped, the inflammation has returned, is my guess.  Call your foot doctor.  Maybe a refill of the Prednisone is in order.  Aleve is another over the counter anti-inflammatory that you might try.  But, if the problem has not resolved your doctor needs to know. Good luck.|`|hyGSMcIyaa	You need to identify the cause of the pain and then reduce exposure to it. Whatever fix you find will probably cost you something.<br>  <br>  For instance, after slowly gaining weight over a period of months, I had a pain in my foot in the mornings getting out of bed. Xrays showed nothing wrong. I finally figured out that my feet had gotten wider supporting my increased weight and that the shoes I wore were gradually squeezing my feet, which after a long time had a deforming effect with subsequent pain. <br>  <br>  A larger shoe size, along with some nutritional supplements to rebuild joints and cartilege did the trick for me after just two months.  Email me if you would like particulars.<br>  <br>  No more foot pain for me.|`|2eS7tQ8Vaa	Depending on the foot pain (area), it can be solved with correct foot wear, arch supports, shock absorbers...go to www.footsmart.com you do not have to purchase anything if do not want.

I was told my feet went flat and that was the cause of the pain. My doctor was right.
hpadhXUiaa	The food that we consume day-to-day form lectins . <br>  <br>  -Lectins: The Diet Connection.-<br>  A chemical reaction occurs between your blood and the foods that you eat. This reaction is part of your genetic inheritance. It is amazing but true that today, in the late twentieth century, your immune and digestive systems still maintain a favouritism for foods that your blood type ancestors ate.<br>  <br>  We know this because of a factor called lectins. Lectins, abundant and diverse proteins found in foods, have agglutinating properties that affect your blood. Lectins are a powerful way for organisms to attach themselves to other organisms in nature. Lots of germs, and even our own immune systems, used this super-glue to their benefit.<br>  <br>  For example, cells in our liver's bile ducts have lectins on their surfaces to help them snatch up bacteria and parasites. Bacteria and other microbes have lectins on their surfaces, as well, which work rather like suction cups, so they can attach to the slippery mucousal linings of the body. Often, the lectins used by viruses or bacteria can be blood type specific, making them a stickier pest for a person of that blood type. <br>  <br>  So, too, with the lectins in food.

AA11799144	Has nothing to do with needing to pee. Do you get an erection every time you have a full bladder?  Of course not.  It is just another of the multiple erections you have while you sleep, often as many as nine or ten at night.  In fact with a full erection, as you may have in the morning, you cannot physically urinate until the erection subsides somewhat.  Forcing urine flow during a full erection damages your internal valves, which are designed to prevent urine leakage during erection and assumed intercourse.   The whole nighttime erection thing is done so your body can nourish and maintain your penis, as erections during the day are not really wanted unless you are beating off or getting sex.|`|uLcZssY6aa	its when your dic* gets hard while you are sleeping and you wake up to it long. its happen to me on more then one occasion..it just means you need to pee.|`|af1de3d0eb977a493a750ff4ff639490aa	~Has nothing to do with having to urinate.

I'm sure you know that!|`|AA11262556	its when you have to pee, so your body makes you have an erection so you dont wet the bed.|`|V66YUXL7aa	When overnight retention of urine makes the bladder full, the prostate is congested and it causes erection which is known as morning wood.|`|40f2edd63ccc642b68951f86702e943eaa	i SEE it as your "little man" taking a good long stretch in tha morning|`|Eqhmnescaa	it means ***** and idk but every male wakes up with boners so relax its normal.|`|mshYf0nBaa	Its when your purple headed yogurt slinger gets hard in the morning cause blood circulates in your body and it makes it hard....and you have to pee too.|`|nFzteHPhaa	its gettin hard when you wake up. most males get it everyday and is becuase the blood starts movin around more once you wake up and walk around
0841c7c0f9ce722c1d8e3a20b07fddd5aa	There is no legal way and if you use drugs, you could hurt or and kill this person, so many bad things have happened with Pranks, so I would think about just what you are going to do?????
Ujazp3txaa	yes it will start to tone your upper body. but the more you do it the easier it will be for you to do your normal set or sets. after a week of doing them start adding more to your sets to give your muscles a challenge and so they don't get used to the same thing every night . And do then in different  positions wide,close, diamond, put your hands in the shape of a diamond so when you do a push up it is in the middle of your chest you can separate your legs to make it easier and balance yourself when doing diamond push ups. And putting your feet on a chair so you can work your upper part of your chest also|`|IKPiI19haa	Yes. They build muscle and endurance. Make it hard on yourself and build mentality.|`|1c83e3de6343c84e03ea242c1d425fbdaa	Um . . yes. It will make you stronger. Exercise, all types, is good for your metabolism and immune system.|`|YZt8LuLraa	nice muscle tone in your upper body|`|fc45bdbe3503c05cc9ceaf000ebe81deaa	Can't hurt, I think push ups builds up your chest and back and upper arms.|`|tDwRjCfNaa	no it will make you fat|`|tLAmvJ2zaa	Of course it will! Any kind of exercise will make a difference. Push-ups would probably help to tone your arm muscles. Another great way to get in shape is crunches or full on sit-ups!! The best and cheapest way to a 6 pack :)
bCmY3Bxvaa	Um....<br>  Maybe if she's acting or dressing a little more sexual. Or if she's dating more frequently.<br>  Try sitting down and having an open conversation with her, without the intentions of getting her in trouble for her actions.<br>  If she is having sex make sure she is doing so the proper way and not being carefree about who she is with. I'm a 17 so I know a little about teen girls, and sex. Just talk to her, and make sure she is being safe, but let her know your angry and it's not okay.|`|s75pqolCaa	depends on how old she is.  im a sophomore, and most girls i know are not willing to engage in sex.  and me my self i wouldnt even know how to try to ask my girlfriend to have sex with me.  just have faith in and trust your daughter. the more you shield and try to keep her from it, the more curious she will become about it. so just tell her what you think and take it from there.
AA12326646	One time I went to a amusment park, and on it I couldn't breathe because it was going sort of fast. After I sat down for 25 min, I felt a bit better. Do you still have trouble?

Pv8cj7cjaa	yeah its probably bacteria or a fungus . they make a cream to take care of it go to wallgreens and ask the pharmasist they can help find the rite stuff for it|`|etWY35Z8aa	yes, they are from the pool. sometimes bacteria can gather on the bottoms of the pool, and even though people may clean it, it will not always be totally clean. what you are experiencing is caused by the bacteria that has gathered on the bottom of the pool.
ff135c5b01f69eacba703039373fd0e3aa	This is a great question and one that I have successfully addressed for over 24 years.<br>  <br>  You may want to narrow your target market to 40-60; it is a much easier approach targetting "boomers" and "tweeners". First of all, they aren't busy with small children (typically), and second of all, they have cash.<br>  <br>  You can approach churches, but if any of your philosophy looks "new age", you better stick with the Unitarians.<br>  <br>  It is a great idea to approach "high end communities" with club houses and events. But again, they should be 40-60. I didn't have great response with community talks; it just didn't seem like anybody showed up.<br>  <br>  Better, have several independent health food stores in your area sponsor lectures on Tuesday or Thursday evenings. They already have people who are interested in aromatherapy and you will help them sell product while picking up a few clients. Make sure they do a press release to local newspapers, websites and put of flyers in their store with your website prominantly posted. Play down the fact that you stock essential oils.<br>  <br>  For acupuncture, I taught Qi-Gong classes at the local park (which just happened to be on a lake). There was allot of exposure through free local press releases for the classes. Include your website when posting anything for the classes. Then follow up every inquiry with a newsletter regularly. You might try a meditation class if you have training.<br>  <br>  Libraries have different policies in different places. Our library had a $20 rental fee for a huge room, but didn't want anything commercial. It is totally worth it to offer a free "educational class" if you start putting out a press release a month ahead. You will pick up clients.<br>  <br>  My best patient base ever were a close-knit group of women in AA. Those folks would love to see a demo during one of their meetings and you will have tons of material with the way aromatherapy can be used for emotional imbalances and to relieve anxiety.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|86c7466fa05ac2714a38eec74bc060a8aa	you could try going to a church and constructing a class of middle age to seniors...|`|V9vizxMaaa	In September this year our local village hall is hosting its second alternative night.

These could belong to churches and such and meet weekly.  I know you want the younger age also but these groups are full of people with children and meet weekly and you could then be passed over to them by recommendation - which is all the better.  I speak of these type of groups because I know of many people who attend them  regular.  Good Luck - they could do with a change of 'input' - because the 50's and over are are of 'much' younger mind these days.

JJks5k1Haa	Feet and toes are generally the coldest parts of the body because they are the farthest away from the heart.  Ideally it would be helpful for you to increase the blood flow to your extremities through constant activity. Also look into foods that thin your blood to make it easier to pump, such as water and anything with sugar. <br>  <br>  A temporary solution would be to put your feet in warm water, then progressively add hot water as your feet get acclimated to the temperature.

50bd7be473534d7db07bb37100a4013faa	You must be kidding. Even if  you weighed 200+ kg and consumed nothing but water for an entire month. It's highly unlikely you would lose that much weight. You'd probably die before you reached 15 kg loss. For a 70kg person, that much weight loss is completely impossible, even with liposuction, because no reputable doctor is going to remove more than 5-7 kg of fat in a single procedure. Losing 20kg / 44 lbs in a single month is just...the most ridiculous, dangerous and borderline suicidal thing I've ever heard anyone consider. <br>  <br>  You seriously need to change your views on weight loss. Immediately. Weight is completely meaningless. Think about this. Would you really care if you weighed 120kg (or even 200kg), if your body size and shape looked how you want it to? If you would still care, you have a potential eating disorder, and need counseling *today*. If you wouldn't care, then there's a chance you can fix this yourself, in a healthy way. <br>  <br>  First, realize that muscle weighs more than fat. You can take two girls, one toned, and another chubby, and they may weight the same. Muscle tone, bone density, your genetics all affect your body shape. Instead of worrying about kg, worry about muscle tone and your body's body fat percentage. <br>  <br>  If you want to lose a healthy amount of weight (0.5 to 1.5kg per week MAX) eat a healthy diet, take a multivitamin, do cardio and resistance (weights) exercises to increase your metabolism and build muscle. Then your body will burn more fat naturally. If you simply diet, your body will cannibalize your muscle before it dips into your fat stores, and you will lose more muscle definition, and look less toned, and consequently, fatter. <br>  <br>  Do not believe any diet or program or anything that claims to let you lose that much weight in a month. None of them work, and even if one should, through some miracle, you *will* end up in a hospital or dead from either starvation or the actual shock to your body of such an insane change. Assuming you live, it's almost certain you'll gain all that weight back (and then some) in a few weeks to months.<br>  <br>  Go see a doctor, and get on a healthy weight-management plan, and get away from the old thinking that less pounds = better looks. It's simply not the way it works.|`|Vf6vbRhJaa	work on the abs,, crunches, leg raises, stuff like that,, and u can combine it wit jump rope and jogging,, never do some diet program, ull just end up unhappy or eating more. hahahaha, good luck

ZI8sxpTRaa	To get a sixpack takes a lot more than doing abb workouts anyone who says so is wrong. Your body even in a lean state has a layer of subcuteneous fat about 3-5 ml thick. You have to loose a good deal of this fat so that the muscle seperation will show through. I would suggest 4 things 1. Diet - Choose clean foods low fat - high protien. Eat small portions several times a day. 2. Weight Training- Weight train just before doing cardio to get heart rate up increase fat burn and metabolisim. 3. Cardio- I know cardio sucks but it has to be done to get the lean ripped look. 4. Abb work- finally do just the basics, crunches, leg raises. Increase your reps and challenge yourself every workout. Then add new more advanced exercises every month or so to keep it fresh.<br>     There you have it if you can do this I garantee you will get your sixpack.

Since your abs are being used during almost every weight lifting exercise you will see an improvement there, and weight lifting also is he best way to burn fat.<br>  On your off days I would do some cardio about 1 hour.day to start, and then p the speed, but not the time spent doing it. <br>  Remember it is alll about the diet and getting rid of that fat to see the 6 pack|`|dy7eTV0Maa	Crunches, Crunches Crunches.

All you need to do is burn waaaaaaaay more calories than you take in to cut the fat from your body. The older you get though, the more difficult it is to cut the fat from your abdomen. Genetics plays a big role in how quickly your fat deposits leave certain parts of your body. The way I did it was to get up at 5:30 every morning ( that's when I heard that morning exercise would increase your metabolsm) go to the gym if you can or workout at home for 60 minutes. 10 - 15 minutes of cardio to get the juices flowing, Then weight training...the more muscle you create the more fat you lose over time with proper diet. Be sure to vary your ab exercises, don't just do sit ups, or crunches, or ab rocker type exercises...try different exercises that work the different muscles in your abdominal region. The lower abs are the most difficult to get cut. If you're young though...you stand a better chance of losing that belly fat....atleast that's how it was for me...then I got married...ganied 30 pounds...got divorced....lost 50 pounds....and I've almost got my pre marriage body back.

XqVNU8fDaa	At 5'5" and 140, I don't think that's overweight. However, that's my personal opinion.<br>  <br>  Substitute carrot sticks or celery sticks or other vegetables, fresh or dried fruits with no sugar added for the junk food when it's possible. If you drink a lot of soda (pop) then cut down or completely eliminate it. My husband lost about 20 lbs when he quit drinking soda and started drinking water instead. Jenny Craig had water additives in orange and lemon that made the water taste good without adding calories. The orange was really good and I normally REALLY dislike orange drinks! There are also water additives like Crystal Lite that come in individual packets that can be added to a bottle of water to flavor it if you don't like plain water. <br>  <br>  As far as the food thing goes, I would not completely cut junk food out. It opens the door for you to binge once you start eating it. Allow yourself to "cheat" once in a while but not too often if you can help it. Try to keep the portions small and eat them slowly so you'll feel fulfilled quicker. I've also read that if you drink a full glass of water prior to eating, it will help you feel full quicker.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|vaVc11iSaa	Find something that gets you active.

YjVm0ujDaa	no u dont, trust me when I say its just going to come right back..... do this:  you should eat 1200 calories a day and eat only 30 calories from fat.... watch the salt intake because salt makes you retain water.... also you should do lots of cardio. Eat 25 grams of fiber a day or get the fiber in the form of a pill because fiber makes you feel full and it also absorbs the fat you eat and you pass it out of your body before your body has a chance to get into your fat cells and make them bigger.....Did you know that you burn 550 calories while you sleep, so get lots of rest.... 1000 calories on an 8 hour phone call, 30 calories watching TV for 15 mins, 12 calories walking up/down 10 steps...... The more calories you burn and the less you eat= weight loss.... A very good way which is legal is getting a body wrap, that works soooo good, you can get it from any local spa for about 60 bucks and youre sure to lose toxins and 15 pounds. You can also drink a tablespoon of vinegar which promotes a faster metabolism.... thats all I can think of.<br>  Good Luck!|`|JetBoOaFaa	That's not a good idea.  As soon as you stop the diet you're going to start gaining weight again.  A better way is to drink water, water and more water.  No soda, or sugary drinks.  Cut out the potato chips, dip, etc.  Mcdonald's is definitely out.  Just start watching what you eat.  It's better to have a lifestyle change to lose weight than to go on a diet that's just temporary.|`|Tj6UR5zxaa	never heard of it but if u follow my diet ull be fitter in 6 weeks<br>  7:00 breakfast- 2 egg whites fried with olive oil ,unsweetened cornflakes with fat free milk<br>  10:00 Snack - a bowl of mixed fruits<br>  01:00 Lunch - grilled chicken with 2 eggs without the yolk<br>  04:00 Snack - Steamed vedgetable <br>  07:00 Dinner - 2  eggs & sczechuen chicken<br>  10:00 Snack - Fruits<br>  Do Cardio Twice a week|`|gZNDlZlJaa	Great post!

6bce587f3f97e3c4d0483f8ed0a7ea9eaa	Eat something light a couple hours before your work out - a slice of toast or something. That way your blood sugar level won't get too low. <br>  But your main meal should be afterwards to stop you getting stomach cramps: when you exercise, the blood flow is directed towards your major organs (heart, brain), so you will get indigestion (less blood to the stomach) if you exercise on a full stomach. Also, eating afterwards your body will be in fat-burning mode so you will actually continue to burn calories during your meal - added bonus!|`|FLw6PtQaaa	In my opinion, its best to eat afterward.  If your stomach is empty, you'll burn more fat during your workout.  Also, the best time to take protein is directly after a good workout.  So make sure you get something high in protein also, like chicken or fish.|`|LwcVeAvIaa	I would say before, because then you can burn it off and since it's kinda later in the evening that you are working out, it's not exactly a great idea to eat late at night because you'll want more and more food. Chew some gum after your workout to keep your mind off food if you become hungry.|`|PFkZAt6Gaa	I was watching something in the news a few days ago and they said that it is better to have a healthy meal before you work out.|`|aZqZTPtwaa	Hahaha!

Eat your dinner (nothing insanely heavy like pizza or spaghetti, etc) about 1.5-2 hours before you workout. Then drink a lot of water during the workout. I woudn't eat anything else the rest of the night though, and your body will keep burning calories for a long time after your workout is over. If you get hungry later, drink some hot tea (green, etc.)|`|PQSVEKRKaa	It all depends on how late it is... You really have at most 2 hours after your workout to eat (because you metabolism is pretty high at that point).. I would recomment eating a light meal (salad,fish,grill chicken,protein shake) NO CARBS and NO SUGARS!!!
OBnJtCqraa	I get the same way!<br>  <br>  Gosh I miss my BF now....lol<br>  <br>  Anyway its all the hormones building up in your body preparing for a period...each woman reacts differently to these hormones, some have an increased sex drive, some dont want to have sex, and sometimes some women dont experience any changes.....|`|UJtDab4Qaa	probably because you cant really have sex while on it.<br>  <br>  + did you know that the reason you want chocolate while on your period, is because it gives off the same hormones that sex does? haha i just thought about that.|`|oAMIsI10aa	that happens to me too. i guess its because during your period, there are hormonal imbalances and that contributes to why it happens. you know, FSH(follicle stimulation hormone) and LH(Luteal hormone) hormones....i think i even answered my own question!|`|AA12131791	Most girls do.. its because of all the hormones raging through the body.

So in your room you could run on the spot or do skipping.  <br>  <br>  Or better would be to skip the psp, and go for a walk or a bike ride around the streets for 30 mins a day.  <br>  <br>  Most important is what you eat.  You need to eat healthy food, which means that half of everything you eat should be fruit or vegetables.  Eating a small handful of nuts early in the day should help you to feel less hungry and not overeat.<br>  <br>  It can seem a bit overwhelming when you start exercising and losing weight, but remember every little thing counts and the more you do the more it will count!  Good luck.|`|jYovD38Iaa	When i went to the doctor she told me that i had to serve me 1 cup of beans or rice etc. No soda. tortillas, bread, chips, and too much candy. and also always try to play outside instead of psp. and when you go to the stores avoid buying younk food or even looking at it.

You need to clean up your diet and do weight bearing exercises.  If you don't like lifting weights then join a yoga or Pilate's class.  Body weight exercises work just as well as weight lifting.  Just keep in mind that muscle helps your body burn fat.  The important thing is for you to find something that you will enjoy and stick with.  Ask a friend to join with you so that you can motivate each other.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!!

There are also protein, shakes,bars and snacks that are all labeled for this purpose.  A rule of thumb when buying if you can't read it don't eat it.In the end protein will help your diet but not make muscles just because you eat protein. Good Luck

f88077843121730d437a4c79a52d45c8aa	First off get a second opinion.  Make sure this is the correct diagnosis.  <br>  <br>  The traditional treatment for RSD involves various forms of sympathetic nerve blocks, consisting of injections of anesthetics into the sympathetic ganglion in the neck and back. These sympathetic ganglion blocks cause an immediate increase in temperature to the limb due to the increased blood flow. Often the patient experiences immediate pain relief.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this treatment is only temporarily effective. RSD patients may receive multiple sympathetic blocks, to the point of having anesthetic pumps placed in their backs, or even have the sympathetic nerves severed in an attempt to find relief from their pain.<br>  <br>  In prolonged cases of RSD, complementary treatments that improve blood flow may be necessary in addition to the Prolotherapy. One such treatment is a topical application of dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO. This liquid is applied, typically twice per day, to the skin of the painful limb and has been shown to be very effective in the treatment of RSD pain. Other treatments include chelation therapy, bio-oxidative techniques, heat, exercise, and physical therapy.<br>  <br>  I have this condition and what I use for treatment is massage therapy, applying moist heating pad to the area for twenty minutes and afterwards massaging a analgesic cream into the area.  I also take anti  inflammatory medication and muscle relaxants.  |`|AA11968773	I would find a doctor who is experinced in treating RSD/CRPS in your area. Usually a good place to start is at a local University/Research Hospital in the anethesiology/pain manegment or neurology department. The best thing to do is get a good doctor who can help you, this will be challenging, but finding a good doctor is essential. They will probably start treatment with sympathetic blocks, and medication. Usually narcotic medictions aren't very effective in managing RSD/CRPS pain, but sometimes it's nessecary just to be able to deal with the pain. For some patients nerve medications like Lyrica and Neurontin are helpful in managing the pain. Other treatment possibilities include a Spinal Cord Stimulator, epdidural catheter, IV infusions, physical theraphy, etc. Another helpful thing may be to find a pain psychologist who can help you will pain manegment from a mental standpoint so you can cope in the best ways possible- I know that is what got me through the horendous pain. You also may want to join a support group for RSD/CRPS. There are many in the Yahoo Groups section- just search for RSD, Relfex Sympathetic Dystrophy, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, CRPS etc. A few helpful websites may be www.rsds.org www.rsdhope.org and www.rsdfoundation.org  <br>  <br>  I understand how you feel right now, a month after my knee surgery I was diagnosed with RSD/CRPS, and I didn't have a lot of hope. I had many procedures which most of them only gave me temporary relief. About 6 months ago I had an experinmental low dose keatmine infusion which has put my pain into remission. Just don't give up and try to keep moving forward, I understand how hard it is. Good luck to you!

MR6IEKKaaa	I think you have over-consumed too many animal byproducts such as meats, eggs, fish, poultry, milk, yogurt, cheese etc for a long period (years maybe?), result too much storage in the body that were difficult to digest and metabolize. I would suggest you start on a low protein diet as your doctor may also mention the long term effect may lead to higher health risks for kidney or renal failure, and cardiovascular diseases.<br>  <br>  A low protein diet include large consumptoin of veges, fruits, and pasta / bread / grain, and less meats and dairy products. Regular exercises are also essential. You can refer to the Food Guide Pyramid in the source section for a better idea of how to eat healthy. Good luck!

Pwx6BSCtaa	Ideally you should do your entire training session and take your protein within the hour after your finished.  This helps to replace proteins, electrolytes ect. lost during your training.  I hope this helps. Thanks.
XqfH76PMaa	Can you bend it at all?  If not, it is probably broke.  The only thing you can do is to tape that toe to the toe next to it to stabilize the toe and to take ibuprofen for the swelling and pain.  The hospital won't do much more than that.  I hope you feel better!|`|AubmEoYgaa	I don't believe your toes are broken, especially if you can bend them. The fourth toe I know you can't bend. It is swollen because of the stubbing you took, and the color is blood. If there is a thumping going on under that toe, that also is blood. It's probably to late to drill the nail and ooze the blood out. Ice would have been a great help when you first stubbed it. That's probably to long also. You can still try it for the swelling, but at this point I would soak the toe and foot in hot water diluted with Epsom salts. That to will take away swelling. Once you get the swelling down, try bending that toe to see if it hurts because it could be broken. If nothing helps, better get an xray of the toe just to make sure. I would like to advise you that in the future if you stub a toe or finger, grab it and start pulling it so it is stretched. Hold on to the finger or toe for a few seconds, then let it go. You could also take for a few days about 600 Mg's of Motrin. Good luck to you and may your pain go away very soon.|`|WH0a9vSYaa	Go see a doctor, it could be broken. My mother walked on a broken toe for about a fortnight, so it might feel like a sprain but can be broken. Purple is a good indication that something is wrong.
2eS7tQ8Vaa	wrap it, rest it (3days or so) you can also take an over the counter pain or inflammation medication for temporary relief.. you put too much strain on that joint/tendons/ligaments..it will get worse..besides push-ups will always be there..as for "knuckle push-ups..?..that will only cause  compression on wrist adding more inflammation and pain...good luck|`|IUeVNHmXaa	I'm fifteen and do weights every night but I can't do pressups because I'm to heavy.

It's been years now and I have finally kept the weight off to live an average weight life.  I have found whenever you are trying to lose weight, you should concentrate on these three things which all work together in providing a healthier and quicker weight loss goal for yourself. I have found this combination really successful in my weight loss plans. The first thing is exercising and how much you can put forth into it. The more you exercise, the more results you will see. The next thing is dieting and the calorie intake. If you exercise more, technically you could eat more? Always watch what you eat.<br>  <br>  Now the last step in a good weight loss plan is always a good diet pill that can help you get to the end of the road. I have found Proactol which is a natural herbal diet pill to be the best around. It's an appetite suppressant along with being a fat blocker which stops up to 28% of fat you eat. Read up about it at Theweightlossplace .com where I saved money on it. Proactol really works well with exercising which gives you plenty of energy to perform. Along with that you diet will be affected by Proactol due to the appetite suppressant and fat blocker. If you slip up on meals, the fat blocker kicks in. It's really great to stop food cravings.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on those three things and the combination is deadly for the fat cells in your body. Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|etyMYycCaa	yes
EnVY2Mx4aa	no deprovera is a birth control shot. that doesnt stop your period. try googling it!|`|XqfH76PMaa	Is it the Depo-provera shot you are talking about?
cb8e778b0cb0637f995e91dbdf7778bbaa	I'm thinking the doctor is referring to the veins in your legs. All veins have little valves along their length to help keep the blood moving on its trip back to the heart.  If these valves are not working properly the blood can back up, causing swelling of the veins and eventually what is called varicose veins. <br>  <br>  The best treatment is support or compression type stockings, which you can get at a pharmacy. These will help your veins and muscles keep the blood moving and perhaps avoid any future problems.  Good luck.

jgP51MlRaa	Yes i think you'd definately suffer more, both mentally and physically from starving yourself.<br>  <br>  Try dieting slowly and gradually increasing exercise.  If you starve yourself your body tries to hold onto the fat yuo have got for as long as possible so it can keep going.  Also when you do start eating again you'd gain weight quickly.<br>  <br>  Maj|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	A proper diet of about 2500 calories  with no junk food, plenty of fruit and veg, no sugar loaded food such as shop bought cakes, take a walk of about 2 miles daily and you will lose weight with no palpitations and breathlessness. It will take some time but stick with it. Starving to lose weight only makes you over indulge when you start eating again so that any weight loss will be put back with interest.|`|524cae5743cfed0523fb8f84d210ef26aa	Nobody should starve themselves, fat or thin.|`|66M38GMTaa	There is no difference between someone who starves themselves fat or thin. It's silly and dangerous either way. You know it.<br>  <br>  The body if starved will adapt, so when it is fed it stores even more because it is the routine of having time periods where it doesn't eat.<br>  <br>  Also when starved the body doesn't eat fat stores first, it eats all the other stores before touching fat. The short burn sugars etc. So you don't actually lose much weight unless you really starve yourself for long periods, and at that point the body starts going haywire, blood sugar, salt level, chemistry of the bodies liquids because there is no nutrients etc. So lightheadedness, immunity problems etc<br>  <br>  So yes in your condition, starving is bad. See a doctor and discuss, or see a dietician and learn some healthy routines to eating that you can manage. If nothing else have your heart checked out.<br>  <br>  Hard not to give advice
iY0hqF5raa	Simple answer is yes you cna burn an eye ball. <br>  <br>  Like any part of the human body, the eyeball itself is made up of cells, all of which can be damaged by heat, especially that of a cigarette.<br>  <br>  As a guide from wiki....<br>  <br>  Temperature without drawing:<br>  Side of the lit portion: 400 deg C (or 752 deg F) <br>  Middle of the lit portion: 580 deg C (or 1112 deg F) <br>  <br>  <br>  As you can see, thats more than hot enough to do damage.<br>  <br>  Now as for the eye itself, it seems it is a very small wound and as such will heal over time, but over the next couple of days you may feel like there is grit in it when there isn't but you might feel a need to rub it... it is best if you don't as it will heal quicker, if you are worried at all about how it feels, seek further medical advice from a GP (Doctor) or your local ER dept. <br>  <br>  Sean|`|41715dbf19c908548499a6d56b79490faa	rinse your eye out really well for the next couple days, if it gets infected you can be in serious trouble.

mfTHJFNraa	If you are an adult and a tooth became loose and actually came out and didn't just break off, then there may be a root tip still left down in the gum/bone that could have fractured off.  If you feel something loose, the crown part of the tooth may have broken off leaving the hard roots still under the gum.  If you had a tooth extracted, it could just be a bone sliver or piece of root that is working it's way up and out.  Other possibilities are a "dry socket" if the site didn't heal properly, or it could just be infected from periodontal disease.  (If a tooth came out by itself, there are gum disease problems)  Hope this helps!|`|aace79fe25dad7fc466030fd8ee14753aa	I am a dental hygienist.  If your tooth came out on its own you must have periodontal disease. This disease also affects other parts of your body, so it is good your are seeing a dentist. As far as the pain, there may be a root tip left there or infection still in the bone from the diseased tooth.  The dentist will need to xray the area and will give you an antibiotic if its infection. Good Luck!!!!

Most people are.  Because of the great pictures you posted, I don't even have to lie about it.  :)  Believe your mom from now on.  And accept that you're pretty.  If you can make yourself believe that you're attractive (you actually really are), then it will make you feel more confident.  So don't worry if people pick on you or tell you that you're not pretty; you are.  They're just trying to bring you down and that's the only way they can think of.  Besides, as far as us guys are concerned, the hottest girls out there are the ones that are attractive and don't know it or don't act like they know.  If it was up to me, I wouldn't change anything.  You look like a cool, cute girl.  <br>  <br>  So smile :)|`|Ia013uYPaa	First of all all because of all the 40 year old men out there who haven't been laid since the Nixon administration, you might not want to post your pictures online. That said I think you are very pretty, I too would go out with you (judging by these pictures). But more important then that is substance, which I also think you have. I am 16 BTW and I have been through all this, so I am not talking out of my *** here. You should always distrust people who know so much about your looks.<br>  Best of luck to you,<br>  MI|`|LLKdkSBFaa	I have horrible self-esteem. Last year I was suicidal. I feel the same way that you do about this but I can say, yes, you're pretty.  My best friends always say I'm pretty but I don't believe them. Although it's kind of hypocritical, take compliments from loved ones =)|`|WK0MM8ezaa	You shouldn't have to ask whether you're pretty or not.  I didn't even look at the pictures because personality is far more important than looks.  Don't worry about how you look.  There is always someone out there who finds you attractive.  |`|cfea134a3434ba70fb379058bf6b6aa0aa	I think that in the first picture you look pretty, but in the second, not so much. Try using eyeliner, it worked for me... also do something with your hair, like put half of it up! good luck!|`|tnoyTNlzaa	People only say you're ugly because they feel bad about there self.  And<br>  I looked at your pictures, you're not ugly!  Just forget about what people say!   <br>  <br>  <br>  Smile girl (: |`|m8wMKhOoaa	yes you are pretty<br>  if there are stupid people out there saying your ugly or whatev/ its probably because their jealous<br>  dont listen to what bad comments they habve|`|AWatuhG3aa	Zayanda's pretty. Your first picture is pretty.|`|S8VGBhKlaa	you're fine <br>  if people tell you you're ugly, they're just bullying you|`|Z1lIoL2Oaa	awww i think your really cute. dont listen to the assholess that say your ugly.|`|bvkbHfGeaa	YOU GO BE PROM QUEEN!!!!! your super beautiful|`|0GUAq44Gaa	ur friend is MAD HOT!

xvey8ixPaa	It depends on what kind of plastic the lenses are made of and what coatings are on them. Even so, there is no gaurantee that they will tint the same and no way to know if they will tint as dark as you want them to. We do have neutralizers that remove some tint, but they do not make the lenses go back to clear at all, if you want them un done. Just because they have UV protection does not mean that they are tintable. Some plastics are "UV protected" Just becuase UV light does not pass through them, not because they were treated with UV DYE, and some of those can not be tinted. So, you can go in to a place and ask them to look at them and see if they will take a tint, or pay for sun lenses to be put in if it is an ophthalmic frame. If it is a costume, or reading over the counter frame, it might not take the heat needed to pop the lenses in and out of the frame. You could be charged anywhere from $20-$30 to do this, and there is no gaurantee of it even working. You also run the risk of the lenses crazing up or dimpling because of the heat involved in the dye process. Another thing is if there are any scratches in the lenses, the scratched parts will take on more dye than the non scratched areas, if there are a lot of circular interior cleaning scratches it might look like there was a ball point pen that scribbled on it. So, just keep all of this in mind when asking your questions! But do ask and see what can be done. The worst then can tell you is NO!|`|lObEjUh1aa	the tint coatings added by optometrist shops are baked on, so i doubt there is a reasonably feasible way for you to do it yourself.  even if you got your hands on whatever chemical forms the coating, putting your glasses in the oven sounds more likely to damage the glasses than successfully bake on the coating.<br>  <br>  even if you use window tint film (such as what is used on car windows), the film is permanent and not meant to be removed.<br>  <br>  i think the most practical solution to this is to take the lenses to an optometrist.|`|ZRyxMkWqaa	it would be easier to shop. |`|KKev7q04aa	The places that make eyeglasses might be able to tint them for you, but it is going to cost something and, after halloween is over, if you want them clear again, I'm not certain if they can easily be "un-tinted". They used to sell car window tint that was like dark plastic film you just stuck it on, maybe you could use that?
MOtDVPLaaa	with any meds you take if can reduce the effictiveness of bc so it always good to use a backups just as a precaution better safe than sorry mn#|`|4tJshewFaa	Yes, all antibiotics have a negative effect on birth control.  That's why when the doctor give you the prescription, they ask if you take BC.  And explain that taking the antibiotics will cause the BC to no longer work until after you stop taking the antibiotics.|`|dN3Ik6fPaa	Yep. Thanks to not knowing this little fact, I got pregnant with my first son. |`|ARZuNtT4aa	I'm only a pharmacy technician so I don't know for certain but I do believe that all antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of birth control...i usually hear to use an alternate method just in case!|`|8HIfUoxyaa	whenever you are on antibiotics you should use a backup method of birth control such as condoms until at least 7 days after you have completed the course of treatment.<br>  <br>  Better safe than sorry|`|BhVUnQslaa	Definetly.  I had a friend who didn't know that it would and was on the pill and got pregant.  So use a back up plan.|`|01cYvR2Gaa	you will more than likely get a yeast infection :( 
u0B3x55qaa	You just had a very intense sexual experience. I find it to be a huge turn on when women lose control like you did. Don't mind a little pee every once in awhile either. Now maybe you think I'm gross. I just love sex in everyway. There are no limits with me. Just enjoy the experience, and let things happen. I have had "grosser" things happen, but again I have had lots of experience. Just have fun with it and let yourself go Baby. I am glad to hear that you had such a great time. Enjoy life and relaxe Babe. xoxoxoxox|`|HPXRs04jaa	The feelings were so intense you lost control.  Tha's all, nothing to worry or be ashamed about in my opinion.  I've felt like I'm gonna wee as I orgasm many a time... lol<br>  <br>  I think you should just laugh about it and not worry, and realise that you're not in the first million people this has happened too :o)|`|kAxGl7PWaa	thats female ejaculation love.  i get it every time i use a vibrator. u just need 2 get used to it and recognise the feeling of when u r about 2 do it. you should appriciate that you are able to do this some of my friends who i have told about this r even jelous!! the people who have answered eww just think its pee n they r just ignorant, as its not pee. have fun bbz, i no i have :) x x x |`|04177a9acab7abe8a2f3da96b690c4f5aa	ok i think you squirted. female ejacualtion. it can be a shock, and a mess until you recognise the feeling just beofe and grab a towel.|`|iQg9hrB1aa	Its perfectly normal. Sometimes sex can press down on the bladder. Ive drenched my ex before now but if you're both mature you'll understand it's ok!|`|f4c8bc1971cd1455d61d7a1ad090cf12aa	maybe you hit the g spot that's what happens to me when my husband finds it,a strange feeling definetly.|`|AA12120099	Ive had the same feeling when my bf was giving me oral, how embaressing is that! Its a strange feeling but gurrd! :-)|`|eN85efntaa	thats amazing. If I were your husband I wouldnt care|`|AA10081413	That's perfectly normal!  It's wonderful!  Remember, all the muscles involved in an orgasm are also used for peeing too, so don't worry about it.  Have your fiance put a towel down on the bed if you are going to play with toys or have long oral sessions and don't think a thing about it!  Enjoy!!!|`|AA11320270	Dont worry missy, somethings happen. If it repeats, it may become a concern. Sometimes things are not ok.   Clean up yourself, and clean the bed. Take a good rest, and avoid the same setup for say, 24 hours.|`|H3uCyARJaa	If there was vibrating stimulation on your clitoris that is perfectly normal. It happens to women due to the connection of your "kegal muscles" to your clitoris and your urethra.|`|AA10423110	that happend to me before but i peed all the way and didnt realize it 4 a minuites lol but it okay,i think you were just really into it lol|`|LvbDU6ixaa	U probably did lose control because you were about to have a o and when you have one of those you cant control anything. |`|JP5qPISoaa	Perfectly natural, congratulations, enjoy.|`|wBX4qqswaa	Perhaps you hit the g spot, which can lead to a squirt, which just means you've had a very intense orgasm|`|xJ8Hpmsjaa	Its normal, girls even do it on porn as some men love it. |`|AA10720479	Happend to me once, no worries|`|9EkFrApiaa	golden showers rule...|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, your question is not gross at all!  What happened to you is fairly normal.  Some women just lose control of their bladders when the orgasm is that intense, especially if you have had a child or typically have to go to the bathroom frequently.  Nothing to freak out about.   Just relax and if it bothers you that much, talk to your gynecologist about it, he or she may have some suggestions for you!  Good luck!|`|yDJiiqcsaa	That is what happened and it is very common. This phenomenon that people talk about "squirting" - you just experienced it. |`|Z4Z0IO7aaa	If you feel that it is gross, why did you ask it twice?|`|MVY8xhXlaa	That's gross?? wow- pampered, are we?
YOO5iZMCaa	lots of little boys play with their penis and i wouldn't consider it masturbating<br>  they just know it feels good an it is relaxing<br>  it happens a great deal in school and most teachers ignore it or may mention it to the parents<br>  it isn't a big deal|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	If you go over the principal's head - then you can kiss your job goodbye.  Once you get a reputation as a troublemaker - then your name is MUD.  Do what you feel is best since you will have to deal with the consequences.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	I started when I was in 3rd grade however, the exhibitionist I am, I would never do it publicly.<br>  <br>  |`|Gw1LLzDgaa	I had friends who masturbated in 2nd grade when I was young -- it seems to me to be pretty normal.  I don't think its an issue or a big deal -- although it sounds like you are determined to make it one.<br>  <br>  It isn't like anyone can stop you -- if you want to hurt the kid because of your hang ups -- and the hang ups of some other people -- go for it -- and may it return to you three times over.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	You pull him aside and explain to him that is not appropriate behavior. You don't want to embarace him or make him feel that masturbating is wrong. Just that it is a private thing and that if he keeps doing it, he'll get into trouble.|`|AA10720479	I have never heard of that, wow starting at such young ages. Not sure what you should do, but I would have to say that it is a big deal.|`|ubofHDxPaa	It's no big deal, he just needs to be told he cannot and should not do that in public. You are the one overreacting to it. |`|2Ml05azZaa	Have a meeting with his parents, explaining why its wrong to do it in a public place. If it happens again involve the principal or a higher authority in the school, punish him until the problem ceases to exist<br>  <br>  On a more dire note, boys dont normally do that by themselves until the start of puberty, he defiantly learned it form somewhere...|`|c2uEs18eaa	It would be appropriate to explain to the kid that he should not be doing that where other kids can see him.<br>  Assuming he is being sexually abused at home is a big leap. Do not go there by yourself. Trust the principal about having seen it before... but, if you really think there is more to it, ask the school counsellor or someone to chat with him and assess.|`|GUdvd8I3aa	It's not uncommon. The sexual urge starts in us as babies (rocking in the cot/crib) and carries on throughout life.<br>  <br>  Whilst it's fine for him to play, he needs a positively reinforced message about NOT doing it in class, as it is a private activity. No matter HOW good it feels.<br>  <br>  Sometimes kids even strip off on a hot day; so it's nearly always just their innocence that they do this, not something deviant. The way you and the school handles it will determine whether the message he gets is positive or negative.|`|A5Tf6C3Iaa	i dont know much about little boys and when they discover themselves. i mean i have tried asking my husband but he tell me he doesnt remember so whatever, i wouldnt make that big a deal out of it unless he does it again. you might embarress him. but if he does do it again then yes i think it presents a problem and may present other issues.|`|KOfwamdbaa	let the boy have his fun just jking yea thts totally weird|`|mNo7Efyhaa	Wow thats crazy I actually have a 8 year old thats in 2nd grade and if I saw that I would have beat him silly. He is still very much a child unlike these little kids now days that grow up before their time. I would take this up with their parents because 1. They did it in school and other kids could have seen it and youve tainted 20 other kids who go and tell others who tell others and so on. 2. Where did he see this behavior  either he saw someone from home doing it and they never need to do it again in front of this child or he was watching something on TV that he shouldn't have been and to be honest if my child was in the same school I would have been outside with a poster board and picket sign until this kid was kicked out!|`|mmD4MEnGaa	I have heard of this. I was supposed to babysit a second grader and his dad told me that he plays with himself. it's not a bad thing really, its human nature but at the 2nd grade....it shouldnt be happening very often.<br>  but did you know that some kids are born with that urge? my best friend, since she was a very little girl would do it. my little sister who is 9 years old would ALWAYS DO IT and it started when she was about 5. she would do it in private and try not to get caught. we told her she shouldnt be doing but she would go hide and do it...i would catch her and talk to her. one day she somehow hurt herself doing it and she never did it again. <br>  the point is, some kids just do it but they dont realize what they are really doing. just talk to the parents and they will talk to their son<br>  <br>  definately tell the kids parents!!!|`|ia0RRieZaa	If it's obvious to the other students you really should talk to the teacher or principal because normal kids of that age aren't quite there yet and probably shouldn't be exposed to it. However until you get some other signs that would indicate something is going on at home you should not assume there is.|`|k8NzagAIaa	Your intuition is correct.  Boys typically don't 'discover' this behavior until they are 12 at the very youngest.<br>  <br>  My wife is a social worker and she can tell you that 99% of the time this is a learned behavior that someone has done in front of them or done to them.<br>  <br>  No matter what the principal says, call social services.<br>  <br>  I know you'll do the right thing.<br>  <br>  -omgyay_dotcom|`|plJj63PWaa	This can be very normal for boys this age, however there could be something else going on.  I work for childrens protective services and have received these complaints before.  Has anyone talked to his parents to feel out how they react..could be important to know their response.  Also worse case sceniro...if you make a complaint and nothing is going on...oh well, then it's just filed.  But maybe the family has history with CPS that you don't know about and with your call maybe something could be done.|`|zp9JRc2aaa	If somone Jerks off at any age im sure they haven't got anything going on at home.  And if you told on the teacher then you must be a pretty good writter for a grade two student unless your just making this crap up because i didn't even know the meaning of wanker, let alone maturbation when i was in grade two|`|fbecltgmaa	haha i've never heard of that in my life thats funny, but i think you should contact the parents and tell his parents wut happened and maybe they can have that "talk" but i do think hes to young idk talk to the parents|`|FnZgkbABaa	I bet the dad jackes off in the open when he thinkgs the kid is sleeping and the kid sees him jacking of and thinks he can do it.. Like monkey see monkey do. But I taugh my little bro at second grade tho |`|82kHZ7Szaa	Some people are saying that it's normal!? 2nd graders are supposed to think that the other sex has cooties! Kids are growing up way too fast nowadays...dang! It's definitely wrong if he's making it so obvious in the middle of class!|`|ViFnrdqsaa	Most school districts/states require that any action of a sexual nature be reported so that it can be assessed as to whether the child is at risk emotionally or physically for abuse.|`|XaH93wuzaa	Alert the child that masturbation in class is unacceptable. |`|lpDXCQwoaa	2nd grade is wayyy to young! Yes, you should tell the principal and tell the parents.|`|B4zroZHmaa	You need to relax. He is a horny 2nd grader whatever. He just need to realize he cant be doin that in public.|`|VpXwO9qwaa	I would suggest a parent teacher conference with the principle. Talk to them about what's going on. What you seen..|`|vC3Jpr5Caa	LOL I started masturbating 4 weeks before 8th grade graduation ROFL!|`|Lkj7HxAwaa	Dang, I thought 2nd graders don't even know about sex|`|L34kfdKyaa	hes not gonna hurt anything|`|qg2bgR9Daa	freaky and gross and wierd|`|J8sebhAdaa	OMG you got to say something! Little boys go not learn (or are even curios at that point) by themselves. He is seeing someone else do it and that CANNOT be good for him!|`|BIvShwQKaa	that's messed up. maybe try to were more conservative clothing.|`|B4VdNdo5aa	Well, that's insane.   I've never heard of a 2nd grader doing that.  I thought like 6th grade was kinda early. But apparently not anymore.  <br>  <br>  I understand where the principal is coming from, it isn't that big of a deal because he doesn't know at all what he's doing, but she does need to take some action and tell him that that's not okay.  But she's got to be careful how she does it, because it could end up that he wants to do it more, and tells his friends about it, then you'll have a bigger problem. <br>  <br>  I just can't believe a 2nd grader!! Sick and crazy. |`|BuRCz2EYaa	Chances are its innocent, kids find something that makes them feel good, and they do it, without thinking sexually. I would recommend the principle contacting his mother, as she is the only one who can really decide what to tell the child to teach him not to do that.

FO0L004waa	when you get an abortion they look and feel around, there is no age you should stop going just like any doctor, wat they do depends on if you are there for a check-up or there b/c you're pregnant. If you're NOT sexually active, then you shouldn't have to worry about seeing a gyno, otherwise you might want to start going.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	Its not so bad they do a pap smear and stick a big q tip in there and you really cant even feel it and then they stick there fingers in there to make sure nothing wrong , the whole thing last about 10 mins its real fast.|`|pUBOnD9aaa	why would this have to do with abortion....<br>  <br>  and you only need to go if your sexually active.|`|XqfH76PMaa	It is true that you do not need to go to the gyno until you are 18 or unless you are sexually active (I have a 15 year old and just spoke to the doctor about this).  As for the abortion, I am not sure why you included this, but, as far as I know they only do the abortion and let you go.  <br>  <br>  When you have a pap, they will examine you but they do not exactly feel around down there.  I am including a link to read what all is involved.  And, you never stop going to the gyno.  All sorts of things can happen and develop all through out your life and you have to keep a constant check on it.  So, it is a never ending thing.  I hope I have helped you!|`|NCN93RPRaa	No matter whether you are sexually active or not you should go to the gyno. They can give you an amunity shot and or check for ovarian and uteran cancer. You are never too old to go to the gyno, yes they look at everything but it is only for the best. It is nothing to be ashamed of. All women should go to the gyno every year.|`|CDkUMzzCaa	1+1=3 consider the consequences morons|`|9k9eHUpEaa	youre 15 what the hell do u need a gyno for|`|uavlqBDDaa	Well, I don't know about an abortion. As far as a Woman's exam, they will but these things that look like spoons in your vagina, and it has like this thing in between the two of them to hold your "stuff" open. After that, they will get this little brush that resembles a very very small mascara brush, they will stick that in your cervix to check for STD's, when they do this they are collecting cells. It doesn't hurt so don't get scared it is just uncomfortable and tickles a little. They will also press down on your breast area to check for any lumps that may show signs of breast cancer. Oh, and there is not age to start or stop going. The doctors recommend after you have had a hystrectomy you can go less, but you don't have to worry about that for another at least 25-30 about.|`|FdLgtVGmaa	When you go to the gyno they will look around and feel, but only checking for anything unusual. Its nothing to be afraid of, You dont have to have had sex to go to the gyno, if you are a virgin and are THINKING about or CONSIDERING having sex, then you should go to the gyno. Most young women (15 years old) are often afraid to speak to their own mother about sex, in regards to them having it, a gyno can help you out, give you the sex talk, some informational pamphlets, and talk to you about birth control and all your options to help you from getting pregnant. <br>  <br>  Also, even if your NOT having sex or thinking about it, if you have started your period, then there is NO reason why you should not or could not go to the gyno. Some women (even very young women) have heavy periods, and you can be put on some type of pill (birth control, or other meds) by your gyno to lesson the flow, and or deal w/ the pain and cramping if you are experiencing any of that. <br>  <br>  If you have had sex, than you should most def go to the gyno. Its nothing to be afraid of. I started going when I was like 16. and one is never too old to go to the gyno, you shouldnt just stop going. women should go atleast once a year for an annual check up. |`|jc5UNoZUaa	They look and feel around<br>  to make sure you don't have cancer or any stds<br>  <br>  you can get cervical cancer at any age<br>  so I don't think you stop going....
pha427Puaa	It could possibly a few things- bacterial or parasitic infection, ulcer or colon cancer, you need to seek medical attention no matter what, its not normal.|`|AA10720479	See you doc right away. Colitis, cancer of the colon is the most common reason that blood is in the stool. Don't mean to make you panic, but you should tell your doctor, and take a sample to him/her. I did do a colon cleanse last week and had some blood in my stool, but that was from the cleanse, as soon as I stopped it the blood went away. I wont be doing that again.|`|xye9Nc2Xaa	u got your period omg<br>  im so jealouse of you lol <br>  =T|`|647d5d09dea3015f258c13a34983e878aa	It could mean that you have polyps that have burst, or that you have a more serious problem You need to see your doctor to be sure it is not a more serious condition. Do not wait because time is of the utmost importance if it is something more serious. I am not trying to alarm you, but I just want you to understand that it is important that you not wait to see your doctor. As I said, chances are it is nothing serious, but that much blood can also be an indicator of cancer. |`|E7oR0hj0aa	go to the doctor it could mean many bad things including colon cancer so get tested right now|`|s4psKJrPaa	you have an ulcer or another stomach problem. go see a doctor really soon.<br>  <br>  <br>  its happened to me before.|`|4VwRYcgHaa	I've had minor blood in my stool since I was 11, but I have had it completely fill the toilet like you described. I thought I was going to die butt I'm still here. I went to a doctor several years later to have a colonoscopie, and they couldn't find anything, they told me it is probably just minor hemorrhoids that flare up from time to time. I never did anything about it, and they didn't recommend anything...no big deal I guss.|`|0sIf3n5Eaa	go to the doctor. if it is bright red you are probably fine.
B9nAQ7a3aa	Most girls continue to grow for about 2 years after she starts her period, but each girl is different.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	You generally keep growing about two years after your first period. |`|QcDN1Bizaa	NO! since i've gotten my period i've had a growth spurt! ive grown like 7cm in 6 months so no you do not stop growing :)|`|DyHpuiR8aa	No.<br>  <br>  You don't properly stop growing until you're about 18.  Once your feet stop growing though, that's usually a sign that you won't get much taller|`|XkWd08Uvaa	puberty is nothing to do with growing taller ---growth depends upon the genetic pattern added to this Good mixed diet and exercises will desired effect|`|adf525b4138be771a36082b8b629fd41aa	no, you don't<br>  <br>  i've grown about 11 centimeters since i got my first period , and other people have grown a lot more than that - so no worries :)<br>  |`|lMbgo6yEaa	No. No one that i have ever know has stopped growing.

VcvMQVFKaa	It's normal, she scrapped your insides...If there was a problem she would have told you!|`|6QkHAeXYaa	could be old residual blood from your period. If you do not have any need to worry about STD's then it might be safe to assume you are ok, but wait for the pap test to come back! |`|XqfH76PMaa	I don't think you have anything to worry about.  It was probably just where the exam aggravated you and caused you to bleed a little bit.  Plus, it wasn't that long since you have had your period.  You may even have a small amount of spotting today if it irritated you.  Don't worry.  It is nothing big.|`|30e7b808304ee867ce23c80d9216a4c6aa	I've just had the same thing. Don't worry, if there is anything wrong, your doctor will ask you to go for a repeat smear test to make sure it's worth worrying about, and THEN he'll refer you to a gynae consultant for a mega check-up! Don't worry about things until they're worth worrying about (that's my motto!!!!).<br>  <br>  Keep smiling. xxxx|`|4Vz8lBlwaa	I've had that too and it worried me at first but then I realized after my exam I wasn't bleeding. I think it's just the chemical of some sort they use on the swab.  |`|QHjNCSYjaa	............|`|PF40NG1Eaa	It might be possible that there is still a little bit of old blood from your period left mixed in with the normal mucus build up around your cervix.  I had this a few months ago.  Obviously, if something is wrong the doctor will let you know, so don't worry too much!
39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	Sorry, but there's nothing you can do to accelerate your breast growth. You'll just have to be patient. 12 is a bit young to really have developed breasts, anyway, you probably won't start noticing any real growth until you're 14-16. <br>  <br>  Not even with "peanut butter and syrup sandwiches" (utter nonsense). |`|AA10720479	You are normal. Every girl is different, you can not make your boobs grow any faster, just let nature take it's course, besides big boobs are a pain. They make your back hurt, and it's painful when you run, jump, ect.I am very athletic and know this from experiance, alot of my friends want breast reductions, and some have had the surgery already.Why is every one in such a hurry to grow up???? It's not all that|`|p5YOM8Zxaa	you dont need to worry about your boobs when you are that young, because they will grow over time. try not to take any suppliments that would throw your body out of wack.and having big boobs isnt necessarily the best thing, you can have a lot of problems with your back. but if you really want to know how, try using the bras from victorias secret. i find they work really well. |`|OfEwZUNfaa	all you can do to make your boobs grow is wait. i'm afraid that's it. i was the same as you, my boob eventually grew at 14. everybody is different, we all grow at different rates an to different sizes, so try not to compare yourself to your friends. don't worry your boobs will come!! :)|`|bbefiWtKaa	You're 12. Wait til you're 18.|`|LEImGspmaa	sorry but nothing will work. trust me ive tried it all. don't sleep in a bra thats the only tip i have for you. sory|`|EFW8GETcaa	Eat peanut butter and syrup sandwiches. <br>  I know it sounds gross and pathetic, but my friend told me to eat them to get my boobs to grow bigger, and it actually works! It takes time, of course, but if you eat them every day before you go to school, it'll probably be within a month when you upgrade to a new bra size! :]|`|o2M6RSrpaa	oh why do you worry so much, you'll get some when you're older whats the rush now. I dont think nothing helps just be patient|`|H8RbaxRjaa	MILK !|`|eYaRliPgaa	stuff your bra with tissue
eQ2CDAvMaa	No smoke is formed by gases in the air (carbon) and dust is particles in the air (dirt).  Do you want the full scientific breakdown of difference? <br>  <br>  I found a couple interesting sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehponline.org/members/2002/110p703-714lioy/lioy-full.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehponline.org/members/2002/11...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?topic=dust" rel="nofollow">http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Natural...</a><br>  <br>  I enjoyed reading the second link here.  It compared teh two as one in the same.  I am sure this is the answer you are looking for.|`|TBSh1OSgaa	No.  Smoke is the collection of airborne solid and liquid particulates and gases.<br>  <br>  The particular make up depends on what is burning.<br>  <br>  Dust is a mixture of waste material like human skin particles, mould spores, human hair, pet hair, food particles, etc.  The main allergen in dust comes from dust mites.<br>  <br>  So smoke is not dust, but those sensitive to dust (eg asthmatics) may also find they react to the particulate matter in smoke.|`|AA10398889	Technically. they are both clouds of small solid particles.<br>  <br>  but dust is mainly a collection of dead skin cells shed from the skin, while smoke is solid broken down into smaller solid particles. (its why it hurts to get it in your eyes)
AA10720479	OUCH,,, I've heard 2-3hrs|`|3JMfrsMHaa	That doesn't sound right at all. My son broke his femur in a car accident. His first surgery was about 2 1/2 hours and the Dr put in an IM nail with screws through the hip, and above the knee.<br>  <br>  His first surgery didn't work, so the Dr went back in and put in a larger nail. This surgery was a little longer because they had to ream the bone.<br>  <br>  His second surgery didn't work either. His last surgery was around 4 hours. He had to have an osteotomy, removal of the nail and screws, a bone graft and have a plate that runs from his hip to knee, along with a dozen screws.|`|IYMhFESVaa	it took them 3 hrs for mine, it depends on how bad its broken.  i had to get a 8 inch metal plate and like 6 screws to fix mine
9rLi9pSRaa	Stress certainly contributes to all those other things like the sores in the mouth.  You sound like you are suffering from it but I think you need a good night's sleep and a  lot of the problems would cease.  Sleep is very important.  I think you might be close to anxiety but not quite.  Anxiety is more of a feeling of having a heart attack and the inability to breathe. People often exhibit different types of symptoms but that one seems to be the worse.  So I think that if you get some sleep and  exercise a little and get a hand massager and massage your neck and back with it it will move any toxins that are building up in areas there and you will feel better.  All of those things helped me when I was going through a very high stress period in my life.  Good luck and try and laugh a lot more.  |`|qSwGwO5Kaa	I have had anxiety issue after quitting smoking earlier in the year. Night sweating, heart palpitations, insomnia, jittery and short breath are the symptoms. Also I have dry or sore mouth/throat like you have now.<br>  <br>  Hope you get well soon!|`|oBR1ShBbaa	I have anxiety disorder, very much the symptoms you have...especially heart races, sweating, shaking, uncontrollable thought, go in to a mental health worker or your family dr. and try to get a medication.  It does help with it and will reduce the symptoms also I have learned not to take things so seriously .  Sometimes I would work myself up into such a state of that anxiety just by thinking that way!|`|XqfH76PMaa	Well, other than the fever, I can see all the signs of anxiety.  I have the problem not sleeping and waking up in the middle of the night, the headaches, numbness and all.  But, I have never had any fever.  I think that you might want to see your doctor.  You may have a bug on top of the stress and that will make things worse.  I would make an appointment and go in and tell him/her what is going on and let them help me.  I hope I have helped you!|`|WVNUgbOdaa	i have anxiety and several other medical conditions, but yes those are all symptoms. i have to take medication for my anxiety. i feel alot better and my sleeping habits have also gotten alot better.
39c44f18ac3bbd529eb83042abf2d8aeaa	My momma always had the theory that when I had trouble hearing, that smacks and slaps were the best remedy. I would've thought a hearing aid, but that idea was when I learned that it was bad to be 'smart'. Thank God she thought I was retarded.|`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	Sleep it off!
woRgtPBKaa	It depends on what your comfortable with in removing it. I do it fast that's just a personal preference. I'd say though if it is heavy, remove every three hours and if it is light every six hours. It says eight, but I like to be careful. |`|AA10720479	You should change them every 3-4hrs or so no matter what. You pull on the string slowly the exact same position that you got it in.|`|yy0LqCP4aa	It starts to leak.
a8OfOuc6aa	no they can't get lost. You vagina is only a few inches long, the tampon can not go past your cervix. |`|oqO6ff4caa	it's impossible for a tampon or anything to get lost in your vagina. Your vagina is like a small tunnel but it has an ending. Your vagina is less than 10 inches deep.|`|FvwmRtNjaa	Stuck is probably a better word than lost, but they can get so you can't reach them. When this happens, sometimes a doctor has to fish it out with a forceps.<br>  Amazing how many girls on here think it is a "myth". It isn't. Here, read these:<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2107786_remove-stuck-tampon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2107786_remove-s...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080817211711AAGhRLx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hipforums.com/newforums/showthread.php?t=267069" rel="nofollow">http://www.hipforums.com/newforums/showt...</a><br>  <br>  Believe it yet?<br>  A lot of the girls posting on this board are very young, and they don't always know what they are talking about. The people who said it can't get into the uterus are correct, but they definitely can get so the girl can't reach them. Ask your gynecologist next time you see her.|`|h0KhvQlyaa	No it cannot get lost the average vaginal opening is 4-6 somtimes 8 inches deep. there is a small hole called the cervix where the menstral blood comes from and a newborn during childbirth but other than that nothing goes in or out unless you get an advanced papsmear at the gyno. and as long as you keep the string out it wont get stuck. but make sure if this is the first time you get tampons get the small to regular size until you get used to them or your flow is heavy. NEVER LEAVE IT IN LONGER THAN RECCOMENDED ON THE PACKAGE NORMALLY 4-6 HOURS UNLESS YOU HAVE A HEAVY FLOW OR YOU CAN GET TSS TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME YOU CAN DIE FROM IT.|`|zb78QFnXaa	Tampons are perfectly safe to use. If you leave them in for longer than the recommended amount of time there is a chance that they could get "lost" but not on a use to use basis. |`|aLHxXtNtaa	 No. LOL.|`|CJ8oCFc7aa	MYTH!|`|aMlxa7Ksaa	Unless you have a vagina the size of the grand canyon, there is absolutely NO way a tampon is going to get 'lost'.  I do know of some young ladies that had them fall out when they went to the bathroom and did not notice and somehow thought it had gone farther up inside.  A tampon cannot get through the cervix into the uterus, so that just isn't going to work either.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I don't see how that would be possible as there is no where for them to get "lost" really.  The worse thing I have ever heard is one time, only once, I heard a friend say the the string came off and she had to remove it another way.  Don't believe everything you hear.  People will say anything to get a reaction.|`|jCcW82Iraa	No! I actually got one "lost" last year. I forgot I had already put a tampon in and put another one in, and couldn't reach the first one.  I went to the gynecologist and she used these pliers to get it out. It was no big deal.|`|gktbI6dEaa	No they can not. The cervix is to narrow for the tampon to pass through it and enter the vagina.|`|ZWbB6N7laa	hahahahahahahahahahahahaha|`|nMwOjYiEaa	God no.|`|zD0V9nQraa	No|`|Y2gPTMgfaa	there is no way for a tampon to get lost!!  they make tampons with & without strings but id advise you to use the one w/ strings cuz their easier to get out. But just keep in mind tampons can leave pieces of cotton behind sumtimes. Usually not but it can happen. My friend had went for her papsmear & they found a lil piece of cotton from the week b4 when she had her period. They told her even though it might sound gross when ur periods done it doesn't hurt to stick a finger up there to make sure nothings there. Cuz if cotton does get stuck & left in there it can cause infections.<br>     So again tampons completly safe just remember to change them every few hours, use the size best for u (don't use a size bigger if it's not needed cuz the bigger the tampon the worse chance for TSS) and last thing check urself evry so often to make sure nothing gets left behind. |`|NZvIJTIRaa	They call them "lost tampons", but what really happens is they get lodged sideways in the far end of your vagina so you can't find the string.<br>  <br>  I'm glad this has never happened to any of the girls on here (me either), but it DOES happen. Read this link.<br>  <a href="http://www.womenshealth.org/a/lost_tampon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.womenshealth.org/a/lost_tampo...</a>|`|yr1e64Lhaa	There is nowhere for them to get lost in. When you put a tampon in, your muscles will hold it in place and it won't move around at all until you pull it out. Get them. They're a lot nicer to wear than pads!|`|f2EbrS4Zaa	dey r perfectly safe.. dey dont get lost inside..|`|phwWiCP7aa	NO NO NO NO NO!! i am wearing one right now no matter how far i stick it up i can get it out...
AA10398889	get a warm bowl of salt water, and sniff it through your nose, without actually breathing it in. The salt water will get into your sinuses and breakdown the mucus in your nose. your nose will be runny for a while, but just blow your nose and it will be clear again if done right. the coughing will probably go away on its own. the coughing is either related to the stuffy nose long term, or u have a small cold, which your body will fix on its own|`|xJS5FYvLaa	3 year cold...is that like a 7 year itch?|`|uXFRVqzLaa	get a jar of vicks and smell it.|`|SEWGSUfvaa	3 years?? wow..go to the doctor|`|hef21bA9aa	u may need surgery(not a need)just to clear t up.if u have alot of migrains,u have what me and my mother have,and i may get surgery eventually|`|tkYrGtQFaa	It could be devias septum maybe ?<br>  <br>  I had it and i did a surgery to cut off some stuff inside the nose to clear the passages.

ParFJxnSaa	Agoraphobia often results from having had a panic attack in a public place, associating such places with panic, and wanting to avoid having another attack, away from a place where you can get immediate help, or where you feel safe, which is usually at home. The idea is to learn, and become proficient in the techniques for coping with panic, then, little by little, and with support from a friend, family member, or therapist, (at first) start going out again, confident in the knowledge that you can cope with any attack. Section 27 on phobia, at ezy build, below, refers. <br>  <br>  View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious).<br>  <br>  Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing. (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense.<br>  <br>  Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, or 42, respectively). The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. <br>  <br>  Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause: read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and/or phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them. For some people, this is enough. These days, I have instilled the habit of, whenever a situation occurs where panic is likely, I visualise a large, "STOP!" sign, as vividly as possible, followed by repeating to myself: "stay calm" in my mind. You could try the same method. It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack. <br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, and this requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. <br>  <br>  Because many people can't access/afford professional therapy, I include the EFT, and EMDR variant for them to try, free of charge. Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy is generally available in most areas, but EMDR (see section 33) may well be worth trying, and is becoming more widespread. A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective. If you are fairly suggestible, (40% of people are) you could also try the searchbar at: <a href="http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/</a> "panic attacks"|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Well, it is a mental illness and sometimes an inherited disposition for mental illness runs in families.  However, it is a very scary world.  Given mistreatment enough and no support I can see how someone could lock themselves away from the world so long that it becomes a phobia to think of going outside again.|`|XqfH76PMaa	It normally stems from having a panic disorder or such.  Someone who becomes so terrified of having a panic attack that they stay at home to avoid a stressful situation and avoid the panic.  I am enclosing a link so you can learn more about it.  I hope it helps you!|`|5AWtOwhtaa	Usually it occurs when an anxiety disorder goes untreated (or treated ineffectively) and the problem expands into a debilitating nightmare.  Agoraphobia makes you scared of fear itself. |`|yEMRPW1Aaa	i was house bound when i started to get panic attacks then i fanally went out again after they settled down but im still lefted with anxiety.|`|LyE9e6JHaa	I don't think anyone knows any exact reason as to why people become agoraphobic. <br>  <br>  I personally had been shy and anxious all my life, then in my teens I started developing terrible social phobia. This led to me having a panic attack in a pizza shop and next thing I couldn't leave the house, or think of leaving the house without having a panic attack. I went years with only leaving the house a few times a year. |`|2sycPf8Daa	Fear or extreme Shyness in childhood  is the beginning of Agoraphobia<br>  Shyness is all about fears and self-esteem. Usually, a shy person will fear social interactions and will think poorly of himself. Shyness is related to a fear of being unfavorably evaluated by others Because shy people have such low self-esteems, they fear other people evaluating or judging them for many reasons. They fear that the people evaluating them will not like them overall, will not want to talk with them, not accept them in their group, or will find something about them that will bring on ridicule or humiliation. <br>  <br>  When shyness is so extreme that it interferes with a person’s social or occupational functioning, it is known as an anxiety disorder called social phobia or Agoraphobia. The fears that social phobics(Agoraphobic) suffer from are so drastic that they cause them to isolate themselves from people.<br>  <br>  The causes of agoraphobia are complex and not completely understood by the medical world. It has been known for some years that anxiety disorders tend to run in families. Can be:<br>  1-GENETIC. Inheritable<br>  2-INNATE TEMPERAMENT. A person's natural disposition or temperament.<br>  3-PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIONS TO ILLNESS. It is also possible that respiratory diseases could generate fearful beliefs in the child's mind. Sleep disorders can cause Agoraphobia.<br>  4- LEARNED BEHAVIOR. It is thought that a person's initial experience of phobia-like symptoms in a specific situation— for example, being alone in a subway station or crowd.<br>  5- SOCIAL FACTORS RELATED TO GENDER. One form of this hypothesis maintains that some parents still teach children to be fearful and timid about venturing out in public place alone.<br>  <br>  As of this writing in 2008, the genetic factors that appear to be implicated in the development of agoraphobia cannot be prevented. On the other hand, recent recognition of the link between anxiety and mood disorders in parents and vulnerability to phobic disorders in their children may help to identify children at risk and to develop appropriate preventive strategies for them.<br>  <br>  I am an agoraphobic and still searching the causes and a cure.<br>  <br>  <br>  
XqfH76PMaa	You have all the symptoms of being depressed.  Why would your parents flip out?  I have a 14 year old and I would want to know if she were having problems so I could get her help.  Fighting depression (especially at your age) isn't something you should be trying to do alone.  I really think you should try to talk to at least one of your parents.  If you can not do that, you need to talk to someone.  Do you have a counselor in school that you can talk to?  I really believe that talking to your mom would be the best bet.  We all have trouble some times and it isn't anything to be embarrassed about.  Let her know what is going on so she can help you.  Do it soon so things don't get worse than they already are, okay?  I hope I have helped you and I really hope you talk to someone.  |`|cae59d624671ee1e5f2b5f05477f68f8aa	 you need to talk to them you are normalthese feelings are felt by everyone weather they admit it or they cant recognize it.

You can tell them as much or as little as you like. If you are having thoughts about suicide or harming yourself or others, don't tell your counselor this as they will tell your parents but still go and see one. Keep in contact with your friends and make sure they know what is going on.

yDVlTUYTaa	Can be, Fatigue is a typical PMS symptom. I sleep really deep right before my cycle and dream really vividly. Go figure. You can also get headaches, as you said, fluid retention, irritability, swollen glands, night sweats-no wait, that's menopause. Wait til your 40's. Best of both worlds, sigh!<br>  Anyway pick up a box of those menstrual relief products at your local drugstore and read what it says it relieves. That will give you a pretty good list of PMS symptoms.|`|AA10720479	Yes it is normal to get tired. Could be your problem, but that's not the only thing to make you tired. Not getting enough sleep during the night, gets me every time.|`|AA12265078	It could be. As a teenager, I find that the symptoms are getting worse for each period. When I got it at 13, it was so easy! No cramps, bloating, or PMS. After a while I started getting horrid leg cramps from my hips to the tips of my toes. And 3 years later, I'm just now starting to get abdominal cramps, blowating, backaches, and headaches. And I'm starting to get crabby/moody and bark at people. I'm also fatigued and can't sleep at night.<br>  The one strange symptom I have (IMO) is loss of appetite around the time of my period. I can barely stomach 800kcals before feeling nasueous.|`|V8hRhOGjaa	Sure it is!! You wont have the same symptoms every month!! Every month I get a combination of different ones!!

V3mpzjcuaa	My advice would be to make sure you have plenty of foreplay to make sure you are really wet and "open" to be ready for penetration.  He can eat you out, finger you - whatever.  Just remain as relaxed as possible.  <br>  <br>  Then when it's time.  Open your legs as wide as you can.  This will help facilitate him being able to slip in.  If you close your legs/tense up, it will be uncomfortable and it might hurt.  Relax.<br>  <br>  Keep your legs open when he's getting ready to enter you, as he enters, try to remain relaxed - breathe.  It might be painful or not, but be relaxed.  If you're relaxed, he'll be able to get in with no problem and start thrusting into you without issue.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|wEUwGLiDaa	Its great that you have waited until your 20 to be sexually active the thing is that every girl is different when having sex for the first time just don't think your going to enjoy your first time cos its a bit uncomfortable but after a few times its amazing good luck|`|gcYDA1ZRaa	yeah, just make sure he knows to take his time.|`|AA10720479	He has to take his time.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	First of all, there is little point comparing contraceptive experiences, everyone reacts differently to medication.<br>  <br>  The contraceptive injection contains a progesterone hormone. It has been used since the 1960's and is widely used world-wide. Depoprovera (called Depo for short) is the brand used most often, and is given every 12 weeks. <br>  <br>  Depo is 99% effective. During the first few months some women have irregular bleeding which can be heavier and longer than normal. But, it is unusual for heavy periods to persist. After the first few months it is more common for the periods to become lighter than usual, although they may be irregular. Periods stop in about half of users within 12 months of use (this will not have any effect on future fertility.)<br>  <br>  The general side effects that some women report are; tiredness, depression, bloatedness, breast tenderness, headaches and loss of libido. Not every women gets these side effects.<br>  <br>  One long term problem with Depo Provera, is that it decreases oestrogen levels. Over time, this can cause a loss of bone mineral density and increase the risk of osteoporosis. This is particularly important for adolescents and young women whose bones might not yet be fully developed.<br>  <br>  You need to discuss the pros and cons with your GP or family planning clinic. Your Dr will also assess if this method is suitable for you.|`|AA10720479	I went through severe depression while on depo(side affect). I will never go on it again.|`|SnTuaKcJaa	it is the worst contraceptive on the market.

It gave me migraines when I had first had it because of the amount of hormones. i don't have any websites for you to look at but I would advise you give it a go as it's different for everyone.

dlUAJfgRaa	SGI Busshism|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious).<br>  <br>  Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing. (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense.<br>  <br>  Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, or 42, respectively). The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. <br>  <br>  Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause: read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> website, and use the locators, and phone book. I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them. For some people, this is enough. These days, I have instilled the habit of, whenever a situation occurs where panic is likely, I visualise a large, "STOP!" sign, as vividly as possible, followed by repeating to myself: "stay calm" in my mind. You could try the same method. It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack. <br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Phobia is addressed in section 27. Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, and this requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. <br>  <br>  Because many people can't access/afford professional therapy, I include the EFT, and EMDR variant for them to try, free of charge. Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy is generally available in most areas, but EMDR (see section 33) may well be worth trying, and is becoming more widespread. <br>  <br>  A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective.

I have had panic attacks as far back as i can remember. im 21 years old and i don't know what its like...ya know a day without worrys...or stress. change things in your life. find other things to focus on. don't sit here and think about ur anxiety...it will only make it worse. just make new friends and make yourself feel better. just naturally calm yourself down. don't even think about it...just do it. don't think about what you are afraid of. and when its time to be around that fear...get pisSed at ur anxiety and face that fear head on. once you keep doing this...you will get better. i once had lists and lists of fears but im slowly realizing how annoying it is. how unhealthy it is. i went to florida this year and flew there. i took all my stress and worry out and made it into anger...so i faced the fear head on. just don't stay in a little ball of worry. open up and just face it. its hard...but you only make it harder by thinking about it. i've been through this 21 years...im sick of it. so im changing. im forgetting about the people who cause this on me...and worry and dream about the good people i may meet. i was positive and met someone! so just be positive and don't clam up. make it a goal to face fears. once you do that...things will get easier. take it one step at a time and don't think about things too much. good luck and email me whenever you need me. don't think of this as a curse...dont think of it at all and it will slowly be less stressful. please really listen to me. believe me i experienced this since birth.|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	im proof that   you will get better. i was home ridden for two years. i figured the only way to get better was to beat it. im working now and getting back on my feet. coping skill and meds. im hear if you need help or anything|`|JYTSF21Haa	it is necessary for you to have medicines and therapy.  can you go to your local mental health?  you can get one on one counseling,plus go to group therapy.  i went for over a year.  there were those in there with panic attacks.  they took different stuff than just xanax.  i can tell you that it can get better, and it will get better.  you can enjoy life again. <br>  find someone to talk to.  call the crisis line, just to talk if you need to.<br>  are you seeing a psychiatrist?  if you have had panic attacks for 5 years.  and before then you enjoyed life,right?.  what triggered it?  you are reaching out and that is a good sign.  keep doing that.  don't give up.  please.  see what other methods can be used for you.  there is a lot of hope.  you can be the real person that you used to be again.  make a decision to get the help you need, and to work it.  you can do it.|`|Zxmtx9GYaa	For some reason, it's REALLY common to resist getting prescriptions for problems like this.. I went for years in denial, trying to tell myself that my problems weren't due to anxiety, and that meds wouldn't do any good for me.<br>  <br>  When I finally went and got diagnosed with Panic Disorder and got a prescription for Zoloft to control the anxiety, the change that happened over the first month completely shocked me... I had actually forgotten what it was like to just live, like a normal person, without worrying about room temperature and smells, and having an escape route at all times in case some small little everyday thing set me off...<br>  <br>  I would strongly recommend getting on some kind of anxiety medication. I wouldn't really suggest the Xanax route, because that's not a routine medication, (you only take it occasionally when needed), and it can be addicting. But anxiety medication can help SO much.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about not being able to handle your anxiety on your own. If it's that extreme, it's not a matter of you failing to handle things - it's a chemical imbalance in your body, and you can't alter that without some kind of medical treatment.<br>  <br>  I hope it works out for you! It's not fun to live with constant anxiety and never be comfortable.|`|oWZIZHiraa	You should seek professional help in psychiatry. They may be able to perform test to rule out possible causes and then help you retrain the way you think. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it can be triggered by a learned behavior when we were young and then get worse as we get older...<br>  <br>  If you honestly believe you are in complete control of your life...you are not. And the more you try to control with expectations, the more it can spiral out of control...especially if the intentions are not good...<br>  <br>  Do you do any exercises, meditate and pray? These three combined, work well for us to deal with life and all the changes that take place as time goes on. They reduce stress (anxiety) and provide opportunity for us to learn and grow in healthier ways.<br>  <br>  You sound pretty shaken so I would suggest professional help.

I've had that feeling in January where I would cry and feels as if i was going to die. When that occured, I knew it was time to seek a professional. And despite beig misprescribed the first time, I got alot better and even though my depression is gone, I still have anxieties, but not like before. here's what you do for the best help in my opinion<br>  1) Increase your SSRI intake<br>  2) See a "TRUSTED PROFESSIONAL"<br>  3) if it ever gets extreme don't hesitate to call for emergency, money is of only moral value in this world and can be replaced, not your life.<br>  4)If your a religious oerson, pray for help, if not scream for it in your prayers believe me they will be heard, like I did at my church.<br>  5)Everyone has Anxiety is just some coop with it better than others remember your by far not the only 1 who has it.<br>  6) THEY'RE NOT REAL!!<br>  7)Stop being so pushy on yourself, take a couple of meds if neccessary, I hate meds my self, but I'm temporarily on them myself as a matter of fact i'm takin paxil, prozac, and valium, but my doctor is surely cutting me down from what I use to do.<br>  8) Positive auora= positive state of mental growth<br>  9) YOUR NEVER ALONE<br>  <br>  May all the angels and saints guide you on the path to recovery and help you out of the dark tunnel where you will once again see the light!<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|Nkljibh5aa	you need to find a different medication. xanax is like a trenquilizer, i took it at a party once and i cant imagine being functionable on it.. ur anxiety can come from a number of things..an unresolved issue in your life, being insecure, depression, and so on. the best thing for you to do would adress your depression first, low seratonin levels cause severe anxiety. something else to look into that people overlook is ADD. it sounds like you have a severe case of mind-wandering. if u have control over your mind you'll be able to take charge and be more confident. ask ur doctor about adderall, i take that during finals and i feel like im on top of the world, you get a kind of euphoric feeling that you have the answer to everything and ur not afraid of any challange, im not kidding.. its a miracle drug. ur anxiety might be affected by it if it goes untreated though, and definatly never smoke weed with it. in the mean time, just relax, take a lot of hot baths, drink chammomile tea, and have a lot of sex(it seriously helps). good luck|`|XqfH76PMaa	I don't think you are going to be able to get over this on your own.  You sound like you have a sever case of anxiety.  You really need the help of a therapist.  There are medications out there that will help you.  There are medicines that can either make it go away or come really close to it.  Why let yourself suffer like this when you don't have to?  I had anxiety so bad that I didn't leave my house for over a year.  Once I met my therapist, he got me on Paxil and (after taking it a little while) I felt like a different person.  I can't believe I went as long as I did feeling like that.  It doesn't have to be like it is.  Take the first step by calling a doctor or therapist and get on the road to being you again.  It won't happen overnight, but you will start feeling better in a couple of weeks.  Get the help and I promise you will wonder why you ever second guessed it.   You can have you life back.  I am living proof of that.  |`|uCUEZj3Jaa	I feel the same way sometimes. i used to get really bad anxiety attacks. have your doctor switch you to a medication that you take ever day. I did that for almost 6 months. then after i started to feel better i just stopped takeing the pills every day. Now i feel great. it helped me get through the hard times that were makeing me panic.  Ending your life isnt the answer. If possible check yourself into a mental hospital. They helped me so many times. Been in 3 times in 2 years. There they can see what is going on and can help you. i wish you the best of luck. |`|uzrQllpraa	this probably wont be the best answer or even good but me personally i use to be like that and i just decided to lose my mind (go insane basically) and i became religous. so now i just say oh well if i die, i die. or if i fail, i fail. i've basically become crazy to the point of liking the feeling of anxiety hehe makes me wanna laugh... a lot... and very loudly. meh you could try this if you want but its kinda self destructive and only people with strong will to live can make it through and be happy. For me i've bcome very happy and dont think about the future at all could come back to haunt me but atleast i'm enjoying life while i can|`|pPoxPEAIaa	i had anxiety & the more i fought it, the worse it got. <br>  <br>  i realised i couldnt beat it, so i  asked the Lord to take it from me & it helped tremendously.<br>  cast the spirit of anxiety out in Jesus name.<br>  <br>  ask for the peace of the Lord to fill your heart.<br>  put God & his kingdom first; & everything will be added to you.|`|eStPbblraa	hello i would recommend just doing simple things. things that sooth you. like watching a comedy or reading a book maybe even take a walk. do what takes your mind of things. if your afraid of eating think of your old fave food or something u used to eat a lot then cut it up into to small bits for me its grilled cheese ooooooooooooooooooohthat'ss the stuff. never give up on life. life is the mostBeautifull thing in the world sure it can be a ***** some time excuse my language but seek out theGood in it  and you know that its a miracle|`|ScXlu2Rsaa	email me johnsonrlj41@hotmail.com|`|iQLAGon8aa	i feel the same way if you need to talk to someone about it email me at forthwin@yahoo.com|`|AA11435706	Its really hard to answer a question like this in a small comment box - obviously this is a serious problem and shouldn't be taken lightly, but i also want to help so i say...<br>  <br>  Stop being afraid - decide that that part of your life, being afraid all the time -  is over. <br>  This may sound ridiculously impossible but just go with it. Tell yourself everyday that 'being afraid' is over. Nobody is ever in control of everything. <br>  <br>  Find a therapist or friend to talk to. This can be very hard when you dont even think you can leave the house, but sometimes its like talking about the problem takes part of it out of your body. Does that make sense?!  You've done alot by even writing this email. <br>  <br>  Personally for anxiety, exercise helps me alot. Walking around the block, home work out dvds etc, are awesome - and you can do these privately, hopefully get your confidence up and then maybe take a class out side the home. This will help with the anxiety, restore confidence and energy, distract you from thinking about negatives for too long, and hopefully even boost your amount of (hopefully supportive) friends.<br>  <br>  Remeber, you're still here -  so part of you knows there is the possibility of things getting better. And they will. <br>  Everything changes - weather you want it to or not! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Don't worry. It won't always be like this.<br>  <br>  |`|Y1cRCaLfaa	Take your meds as prescribed!

Just like you can't get over (in my aunt's description) Diabetes without meds...<br>  I am Currently suffering from Post Partum Depression and taking Zoloft. I also experienced panic attacks to the point where I had my husband move our bed to the wall and I had my 3 year old son sleep in our bed with us out of fear of not seeing him the next day (death of myself or him), or him being taken away from me... before I was married I would feel like no one would even want to be my friend, or everyone talked about me behind my back, so I never made efforts at friendship making me miserable... I would get worked into such a frenzy that I would feel as though I was being spoken to discouragingly from supernatural beings... I used to get so afraid that I would puke...

They just mask the underlying problem.<br>  <br>  I used to get severe panic attacks, and the rest of the day was controlled by anxiety.  I had a hard time leaving my house, going to work, interacting with people.  I would get dizzy, my heart would race, it felt like I was going to pass out, or die...<br>  <br>  Talking with my Doctor didn't help, he just kept pushing meds.  I was looking for a cure!<br>  <br>  I found that cure on a website!

ELbs3Dpwaa	<br>  Well, obviously something is going on with your body!<br>  You need to see a gynecologist as soon as possible!<br>  Only a doctor can truly figure out what is going on.  <br>  While you are experiencing the symptoms on your panties there could be a serious infection running wild in your intestines!  <br>  Because you experience no other side effects such as fever, nausea, etc. it is probably an easy fix but needs to be diagnosed by a professional.<br>  <br>  <br>  You definitely need to talk to your mom about this.  <br>  It may be embarrassing for you, but that is what mom's are for.<br>  It could even be hereditary and she may know exactly how to fix it.  <br>  Either way, she will know exactly which doctor to have you visit.<br>  <br>  <br>  I imagine you will get tips to douche and use over the counter yeast meds.  DON'T!  You need to treat the cause not just the symptoms!

6ecc210754a6de7e9d52b2bd7326c6b9aa	First of all, when you get a cramp, flex your foot towards you and massage the cramp until it releases. Don't point your foot, it'll make it worse.  Cramps are usually caused due to one of two reasons. The first is dehydration. You need to make sure you are drinking enough water. If you exercise, a sports drink, like gatorade, will also help keep your electrolytes in balance. The second is low potassium. Oranges, Orange juice, bananas and yogurt all are good sources of potassium. Always be sure to stretch your muscles prior to exercise and again to cool them down afterwords. Hope that helps. |`|vlHTJhtaaa	You can also try stretching in the morning and before going to bed.|`|5MY81u4caa	Drink lots of WATER!!!!

Y1IoAugVaa	Your BMI is underweight, a healthy BMI is between 18-25. But sense you're 12 your still growing and your body is adjusting so it really all depends. 15.7 is probably normal for your age group, but double check with your doctor at your next check up to make sure you're healthy. Don't worry too much about weight right now, as long as you are healthy you are good. |`|T4uZeVXjaa	Well, since you know your BMI, I assume you have access to a BMI calculator.

lObEjUh1aa	usually partial / complete sensation loss, sometimes accompanied by "pins and needles" or tingling sensations, esp. in extremities, are symptoms of circulatory problems.  insufficient bloodflow to the symptomatic area causes cells in that area to become oxygen-deprived.  this interferes with nervous system functioning and -- voila -- you temporarily lose some sensory feedback and get a tingly sensation as your nerves "malfunction" from lack of oxygen.<br>  <br>  usually straightening the legs for a few minutes (don't lock the knees) will take pressure off the blood vessels and restore circulation, allowing nerve cells to get oxygen and return to normal functionality.<br>  <br>  as far as why you experience this when using the elliptical trainer -- that i have no idea, but perhaps start by finding out whether you experience similar symptoms while doing other types of exercise.  last but not least, you can always ask for a doctor's opinion.<br>  <br>  hope this helps; good luck!
082c52d49d24cf249ff2b1bcab72a8f7aa	ah, someone who also has doubts to the effectiveness of a "calming" medication. I was told.. that the medication (DRUG as I found it to be) .. didn't find its effectiveness until after several weeks .. I had similar symptoms or BAD SIDE EFFECTS.. and I was more alert to citaloprams disadvantages than I was to the real world.. sound familiar?<br>  <br>  No doubting the meds will work for SOME... but not all.<br>  <br>  I was a total @rse to the people close to me and at the end of the day, even they washed their hands y' know...<br>  <br>  it was suggested I was imagining it all, it was suggested that I should give it time .. when all the while I KNEW things were getting worse and no way was I as bad as that before I took the damn things.<br>  <br>  In the end I just stopped taking them .. cold turkey.. the sensible way is to Tell your GP you're not happy with them and ask for an alternate prescription DRUG ... he should accept your request and offer you something else .. or he may decide to wean you off the tabs gradually reducing the dose.<br>  <br>  Either way, you may get down hearted to say the least .. but the choice is yours.<br>  <br>  After deciding to stop the drugs that were turning me into a shell that was asleep while my mind was STILL overactive .. I realised that the best thing to do was to stop moping about, take stock of my problems and deal with them one at a time.. no-one else was around to help and all my so-called friends thought I was just a whinging git.. honestly. Nowt like kicking you while your down eh. But its times like those when you know who you can trust and who's just along for the ride... friends can help.. but only if they are aware of similar problems themselves..... even then, some of them seem to think that they are the only ones who can get depressed ... I know where you're at .. feel free to message me if you want someone to listen. Thats what we're here for .. but the safest bet .. is get down to the docs and DEMAND he looks at your situ more sympathetically... word to the wise.... look up online any meds he offers you ... the side effects are not just listed for the fun of it... as you've found out, its a stark reality.<br>  <br>  Play safe my friend.|`|J1stiMioaa	same here, never worked for me, just awful side effects, i went on to fluoxetine which worked better. go back to your gp, he can prescribe something else, they just like to try the cheapest first!|`|DT1j1CKvaa	citalopram never worked for me i'm now on fluoxetine & works a treat|`|gV0OjqhMaa	I used citalopram after I got terrible side effects from fluoxetine, and I have to say that yes, it worked for me the first time I took it.  It made me calm and I was able to pick myself back up.<br>  <br>  However, the next time I took it the side effects were terrible, I was clenching my jawcontinuouslyy, i shook so much I could not write, I was exhausted and yawned alot and felt entirely detached.  However, this wore off after 8 weeks, and in the long run I feel it was worth it.  <br>  <br>  If however the side effects are worth the next time (im bipolar) then I will looking for a different medication.<br>  <br>  The most effective anti-depressants are the ones used in conjunction with counselling (personal opinion from experience) |`|mluuLPoLaa	hi John<br>  <br>  i would love to offer encouragement about being on citalopram but it did absolutely nothing for me. if anything it actually made me feel worse.  if you have been on it for 14 weeks then you would be seeing some effects by now if it was working correctly. i would suggest going to your doctors as they may want to try you on something different.<br>  <br>  it took me 4 different anti depressants to find one that worked for me so just hang in there and have patience and you will eventually find one that helps. <br>  <br>  best of luck xx|`|uKiOxi6Gaa	Hi, I'm on 40mg of Citalopram a day.  When I first started taking it, I was a zombie.  I slept alot and when I was awake I was in a world of my own.  This lasted for a few weeks and then I was OK.  It is the best anti depressent that has worked for me.  However, you have been on Citalopram for quite a while and still having problems, it could be because of the dosage increase, which is most likely and should pass quite quickly.  I know this may sound daft when you're having side effects, but try and stick with the higher dose for 4 - 6 weeks and you should be getting the beneficial effects without the fatigue or other problems.  Citalopram is a better anti depressent to be on as it doesn't have as bad side effects in the long term.  If you get no further benefit after 4 - 6 weeks, you should go back to your gp.  I wish you all the best and try to stick with it, things should be starting to get better soon.  Just a note that may help, since I started Citalopram, I have had no need to be admitted to a psych unit.  It really helps me.
AA11251285	Here are some good ideas:<br>  1. Do something that gets your heart rate up a bit like, walking, running, biking, and swimming.<br>  2.

The one thing that has really helped me over the years is my mum's comment when I had been abroad for several months was "you waddled into the arrivals lounge".  That comes from someone who loves me!<br>  <br>  For me keeping the weight off is important as I feel better.  My skin is clearer, my clothes fit better, and I have more energy.<br>  <br>  I do my best (but fall down every now and then), by trying to avoid going shopping when I'm tired as I end up buying sugary snacks to eat.  I have a cross trainer which I use about four times a week, so I drag it in front of the TV and catch up on the soaps.  I can't be bothered with a gym.  It costs too much money!  I also go for lots of walks with the husband and the dog.  It is a great way of exercising as there is less impact on the joints and I catch up on the news from my husband.  Alternatively take up a sport, or join a class.  A bit more fun and you meet lots of people.  You'll feel so much better after doing some exercise.<br>  <br>  Try to cut down on the alcohol as well, as that contains lots of calories.<br>  <br>  Good luck, it isn't easy and I hate to say it but old fashioned will power plays an important part.  The hardest part is usually convincing yourself that you want to be active when it is comfy on the sofa!

Her period can be irregular for the first year.  Don't worry.|`|Zv0ODLR8aa	go to a doctor that isnt good<br>  <br>  estrogen is produced all month. Estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. In a normal cycle, progesterone production increases following ovulation.<br>  <br>  Progesterone "stabilizes" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. If you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall, triggering the release of the uterine lining - your period. So, if you do not ovulate, the estrogen build up of the lining continues, but without the usual ovulation-associated progesterone. Thus, the hormone levels don't decline, and the lining stays up inside the uterus - your missed period.<br>  <br>  If you have been several months without a period, a gynecologist may give you some progesterone in a pill form (eg Provera 10 mg for 5 days). Within 48-72 hours after stopping the progesterone your "progesterone blood level" will fall, triggering the release of the lining that has been building up. Alternatively, the built-up lining may begin to shed under its own weight. Either way, women report that these periods are very heavy - as though several months of lining are shed.<br>  <br>  Such flows can also be prolonged or have a stop and start pattern. The reason for this erratic or prolonged bleeding is this: without the progesterone the lining does not have a clean shed down to the base layer.<br>

LuWT8KQBaa	No, not at all. It would most likely make a fat person look fatter. It's designed to push water into the cells in your muscles.|`|AA10720479	For body builders only. Does not make you looose fat, it is designed to gain muscle.|`|albqdNEsaa	The short answer is yes. <br>  <br>  You see, gaining muscle automatically boosts metabolism, thus making it easier to burn fat. <br>  <br>  If you are female just trying to lose weight, then I do not recommend using it. But if you are a male looking to gain muscle and burn fat, then it could be very useful. An earlier response stated that it makes you retain water. Some does, but many of the newer versions are designed to deliver the results without using water as the key transporter. Therefor, it very possible to get great results from creatine without the water retention problem that occurred with some of the earlier product.<br>  <br>  I have had many, many clients lose weight while using creatine.|`|FKwt8JM4aa	No.  I take creatine and it does two things for me: 1) cell volumization by storing water and 2) it gives me a 2nd, 3rd and 4th wind when I'm exercising.  When I think I'm running out of energy, I'll sometimes get a huge rush that allows me to get another 2-6 reps out of an exercise.<br>  <br>  For Fat loss I would cut some unnecessary calories from my diet.  |`|TYV3HmsNaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Indirectly it helps burn fat. Here's what I mean...Creatine pulls water inside the muscle cells...this helps with strength and energy, which help you put on more lea muscle mass, the more lean muscle mass you have the more fat you burn.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|iRFR5JTDaa	creatine makes you retain a lot of water. unless you're a serious body builder and you're competing I wouldn't do it. 
UutmihD1aa	It is frustrating for the boyfriend of a non-orgasm-er to have sex b/c he feels emasculated.  I know because I myself an a non-orgasm-er.  He has NEVER made me come or really even gotten me close.  I enjoy the sex we have a lot, but I never climax.  Just talk to him about it and, while it will be hard to accept, it will make him feel less inadequate to know that it's not him, you just can't do it.  When I had to tell my boyfriend, I waited until he told me after sex how much he wanted to make me to climax.  I just said, "that's probably not going to happen, because no one ever has before."  After that everything was easier and he was really cool about it.  I know it's still hard for him sometimes, but he understands the conversation really took a lot of pressure off me to climax and I enjoyed our sex life more.|`|AA10720479	May be he should try a little harder, and quit getting mad.Just tell him exactly what you said here|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Some things to consider:<br>  <br>  Have you ever had an orgasm, ever? If not, you need to do it on your own first before he will be able to do it to you. Don't be embarrassed. There's nothing wrong with getting to know your own body.<br>  <br>  Did you used to have orgasms, but no longer have them? It could be something medical. Some medications, like anti-depressants, can take away your orgasms. Also, there may be some medical conditions that take them away too.

It can be frustrating, especially since guys get off way easier.<br>  <br>  You also don't mention what you're doing during sex.  Is it just intercourse?  Do you do oral sex or fingering?  You're likely like most women and can't orgasm through sex.  They can through direct clitoral stimulation.  Have you masturbated?  That may be the best course of action to see if you can.<br>  <br>  A small portion of women can't orgasm at all, but that's unlikely the case.  Many women can have great sex and not climax (but telling a guy that is like Charlie Brown's parents, they won't understand).|`|Mgc8aWq5aa	Don't believe in the myth that you are a non-orgasmic girl. I don't have a long list of girls I have been with, but all of them have had an orgasm when I had sex with  them; to the point that, I myself  have complained to them, if they are faking it. They affirmed to me, not having faking it. I think, it is not your fault, it is his fault. He maybe immature in the way he involves you into having sex. Women of all types need foreplay to have an orgasm. It doesn't matter what kind of foreplay, as far as you like it. For instances, once you are ready, you might like to be treated as a princess; or might want to be treated as horny bi..tch. But he must be careful and tactful, making sure that, he is taking you into an excitement you can' stop. If he can not do that, it will be very hard for you to get into an orgasm. Don't try with toys, because you will get addict to them, and will never feel a satisfaction from your partner.<br>  |`|e02136ad0a948639cac21098b544ca86aa	he should have some clue to this, if he is at all compassionate about how you feel..he should not just be all about getting his nut!

4Uhkxcm9aa	I have encountered this problem myself with skull crushers. The easiest way to fix this is to change your position while doing the exercise. First make sure your form is correct and if not correct it, that slight adjustment may work, if not and they click during a flat press try an incline or decline press. For skull crushers I have to adjust the bench slightly incline because my elbows pop when I'm flat causing pain and distraction.  Alternatively you can try an extended warming up session using very light weight, I found my elbows only pop when a certain amount of pressure is applied so during warm-up I didn't have a problem, although once I went back to regular weight it started again so that didn't solve the issue for me, but it might for you.

AA10250631	So, this dog did not actually eat you, even a little part of you, right?  Because if the dog ate part of you, it would legally become your dog.  Then you could do whatever you wanted, like rabies tests, special haircuts, party hats, doggie skate boards, stuff like that.  But if the dog didn't eat any of you, you're probably s.o.l.  If you wind up with rabies, you'll know it.  I hope this is helpful.|`|AA10720479	If the dog didn't break the skin you shouldn't worry about any thing.|`|4mzbkw07aa	Yes, model is correct.

fXlUIIEfaa	I understand exactly where you're coming from. The truth is that sex is something that feels really, really good and it's fun, right? Well, sex is also not a game. It comes with a lot of responsibility, which is why I waited until I was out of high school to make that decision. People nowadays do not value what sex truly is. It's a beautiful thing and it isn't wrong, but you have to be right. All the people that just go around having sex for fun and what not obviously don't value themselves and what it truly is. There's nothing like being in love and being able to share that part of yourself with someone that truly deserves it. Now that I'm 21, all of my friends, both male and female, regret taking that step in high school, especially now that they're in serious relationships. They always give me praise and fame for always being smart of the decisions I made when it came to sex and even envy me! So, take my advice, wait until you know, not think, it's the right time and be prepared for all the consequences and aftermath it comes with. Be smart and don't let peer pressure get to you. I didn't and I'm much happier knowing I made my decision, not society. So what if I was a 20 year old virgin, I didn't care!    |`|jkOph5PNaa	wait.  guys are pigs and just want to bang you and get on down the road.  make it special.|`|CHF7VtElaa	You need to be physically and emotionally ready for it.<br>  I say that you at least wait until high school but then again thats totally up to you..<br>  Sex with someone you care about it worth the wait.|`|cbVeIB4caa	Just be sue that you love the guy and make sure your ready. If you are having to ask this on yahoo answers then your probably not ready :)|`|BIknet7Oaa	its worth waiting to lose your virginity to a guy you love. <br>  real love and puppy love are easily confused|`|LmicIEOxaa	<br>  Wait. You never regret waiting. Get to know yourself a little bit better before you share yourself with some one else.|`|cxKgX7m7aa	sweetie, it all matters if you love him or not. even though its fun, do it for the love. and id wait until ur a freshman in high school. thats usually when you get sexually active and want to experience it.<br>  its fun, TRUST ME.=)<br>  but i would seriously WAIT! until your older and you kno better.|`|r4TbhrxFaa	i would say to seriously wait until you are emotionally and financially ready to raise a baby.  it only takes once and you have to be ready
qNMfaJ4Raa	Yes, if you shave, it grows back itchy and bumpy. Try putting lotion on right after shaving, although it doesn't do much.<br>  <br>  The solution is to wax, really.|`|TORBP6QIaa	oohhh yeah...the itch is awful....if you have a cream that is non perfumed and non irritating...then you can put it on the outside bits...be careful when applying the cream as it may irritate the pink bits.|`|7SgVzX4daa	yes, that's normal. I have shaved several times. It itches at first but after a while, it doesn't anymore. I had to simply ignore it even though I wanted to scratch it SO BAD, but I was in school so I can't. That's so embarrassing! You can try lotion, but I never did. The itching does stop after a several times though. Good luck!|`|x7duxnBLaa	Next time, use an electric razor, but only use the trimmer feature on it and you will not have any problem at all. No bumps, itching or anything else mentioned.   You will never  use a regular razor again and  you will not need any lotion afterwards!<br>  <br>  In the meantime, use lotion for the itching.  Aveeno lotion is good for itchy skin.|`|huVZPnyvaa	Try and keep it shaved and this should keep down the itchiness.<br>  <br>  Keep it maintained and add lotion will make it feel a lot better|`|lqxTD0E5aa	Get Bikini Zone gel to put on right after you shave, as soon as your skin is dry, and get a non-scented lotion for after that.|`|Z8Yn7KrCaa	yes its normal but your body gets used to it. Try to put petroleum jelly after u shave it totally helps.|`|OnMM30oqaa	yes. its going to itch every time it grows back. try a anti itch cream or lotion with aloe in it.|`|cxKgX7m7aa	hahahaha newby.<br>  
MiKrWuM6aa	That is NOT normal.  You should only have 1 a month.  Please go to your doctor.|`|iyLV1CADaa	I get periods every three weeks and there are nine weeks in a two month time period, so it is possible to have four periods in two months, one that ends the first week, one the fourth week, one the seventh week and one that should be the tenth week, but that starts at the end of the ninth week. It is not normal and I got a severe case of anemia. I had to take 3 iron tablets per day and I took ibuprofen which reduced the bleeding quite a bit. You do need to have your iron checked if you are bleeding often or heavily. Anemia is no fun. You feel like you are dying. Make sure you are taking a multi-vitamin with iron.  |`|qLuodu3Raa	it isn't normal you should get checked out|`|jNroKMXsaa	go for cervix chick they are a sing of cervix Cancer i hope not but just to be Shure..|`|7587552420ff2e407908b75146174b33aa	go to the beep-ing doctors. now. somethings wrong :[|`|ZzoOl8xYaa	not normal, go to the doc, something might be up|`|f3429b5a162459c283b52abb7190de45aa	you really should go to the dr. <br>   some ppl. have very strange cycles meaning they can be quite long or very very short. you should make sure everything is ok first before just assuming you are one of the few with terribly short cycles. <br>    good luck at your dr's appointment :)|`|aroRl6jsaa	i have the exact same thing you do i get mine twice a month and im still find i dont know why everyone is panicing. you should only go to the doctors if you dont usually have it twice a month.|`|FoKxhEQJaa	i know people that get their periods about twice a month and their period is really heavy. they went to the gyno, and got put on birth control. it helps make them more regular and lighter. you should go get some lol.|`|D8fJufa6aa	No. Quite frankly, I would have gone to the doctors by now.|`|55dLZ238aa	I would agree with the rest of them, go to the doctor...|`|AFjlouBMaa	go get checked |`|BWF8ol8Naa	NOT <br>  goooD! <br>  goo see a doctor.<br>  
oSWY9GK3aa	Very few experiences can be as frightening as receiving a call that your smear came back abnormal.  Although cervical cancer is the first thing that may comes to mind, most of the time an abnormal pap smear indicates a minor problem with the cervix that may or may not need treatment.  An abnormal or positive smear result does not mean you have cancer. It means you have some changes in your cervical cells that may eventually develop into cancer and these need to be looked at more closely. Abnormal changes (also called dysplasia or dyskaryosis) may be mild, moderate or severe. Most mild changes will go back to normal on their own, but if your changes are moderate or severe, you may need treatment.<br>  <br>  Abnormal changes may also be called CIN1, CIN2 or CIN3. This is just another way of expressing mild, moderate and severe. CIN stands for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, which means ‘new changes in the outer layer of the cervix.’ The numbers 1, 2 and 3 refer to the depth of skin cells affected: CIN1 means the outer 1/3 of the cervix is affected, CIN2 means up to 2/3 of the skin thickness is affected and CIN3 means the full thickness of the cervical skin is affected.<br>  <br>  The amount of CIN can really only be measured following a colposcopy and biopsy, but it usually matches the initial smear rating and may therefore be used to describe results before the extent of changes has been confirmed.<br>  <br>  |`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	That happened to me - my smear came back abnormal and I had to have a repeat - that came back ok, so there is not necessarily anything to worry about.  However, my closest friend had abnormal cells which at her 2nd smear were pre-cancerous so she had her cervix lasered - this removed the pre-cancerous cells and she then had to have smears every 3 months for a year - everything is ok now and she is pregnant with her second child.  It is good that abnormalities have been discovered with you early on, you may have nothing to worry about, or it might be something more.  Keep all of your doctor appointments and you should be ok.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Try not to worry.  The same happened to me, and most women who are sexually active will find this. I had to go back 3 times, then I was referred to hospital as it kept coming back abnormal.  They found I had a bad infection which I was told would clear up itself and to go back in a months time.  I went back a 5th time and was given the all clear.  Smear tests are great but painful and they do save lives.  If they pick up pre-cancerous cells they lazer them, I do know a girl who had to have some of her womb removed.  You will be ok. x|`|xicMjyETaa	It hasn't happened to me, but it means that you have a higher risk of cervical cancer due to exposure to HPV (very common), and a higher abnormal cell count. You will need to have PAP tests more frequently from now on, so that if the abnormal cell count increases, they can take action early. Don't panic too much, it sounds like they have everything under control, it's good to pick up on these things early.|`|Jprjt05Faa	Yes I was 20 and I was pressured into going for the smear in the first place, I had abnormal cells and when I went back again they were still abnormal - they turned pre cancerous, luckily because I had gone they had caught it early enough for me to have the right treatment, this does not happen to everyone and they are just being safe with you.<br>  Don't worry about it, they are keeping an eye on you and they know what they're doing.<br>  It is scary I know, but try not to worry|`|XqfH76PMaa	I know what you are feeling right now.  Don't panic, okay?  Abnormal doesn't tell you much.  It could be nothing.  Some of the tests are really touchy and can sometimes come back abnormal when they are really fine.  Your six month will tell you more.  <br>  <br>  I would call my doctor and talk to him/her or the nurse and see what they tell you it looks like.  <br>  <br>  If you are sexually active, there is a chance that you have contracted HPV and this is the problem.  If this is the case, they will bring you in for check ups every six months for about the first two years to make sure your cells do not turn into cancer (doesn't happen often) and then start seeing you yearly again.  Again, do not panic.<br>  <br>  I would call the doctor as soon as I could and ask questions.  I would not want to wait and worry for six more months not knowing what they at least think might be happening.<br>  <br>  I hope I have helped you
Gxs7tnGTaa	Go the doctors|`|c0UhndO6aa	um green , ew .<br>  go to the doctors .|`|za9b8cHKaa	See your doctor. You may have a vaginal infection, which needs to be treated immediately. Tampons should not be used when your flow is abnormal, as they can make it worse.|`|kABzPANwaa	gyno plain and simple u gotta get that checked out<br>  <br>  please answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmF8_NzqJT219_.vBRFA4IUjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20081115213100AA0uLJg">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OK1aP7qvaa	HOLY **** GET TO A DOC.

Hopefully,you will teach your child that your currently pregnant with that its a good idea to use protection, especially when your only 15.<br>  i love people with no lives who post random fake questions.<br>  <br>  okay dont give me a thumbs down.. go read her other very "legit" questions.|`|PyyODrFOaa	Lime-A-Way dosent work for vaginal issues|`|epaArgfQaa	green....ohhhh.....I forgot my salad some where...<br>  <br>  Joking......<br>  <br>  You must see a DR as this could be infection.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|i3SAzMsMaa	That sounds like Gonarrea DUDE......|`|O9nHNLp4aa	green means infection<br>  I have a feeling your a troll|`|WFleEUTvaa	see ur doctor asap<br>  
8fjgp1K3aa	Hiya,<br>  <br>  If you are concerned for her health and it is effecting your relationship then you have every right to bring it up. Although I would definitely suggest doing it gently as she may (or may not be) very self-consious of her weight already.<br>  <br>  The first thing you could do with thinking about is why is she gaining weight - is it diet, exercise or both. Then think have a think about what times of day/week is worse for her - maybe she eats alot of high calorie food over the weekend, or when she gets home from work. This could mean she is stressed about her work or other areas within her life.<br>  <br>  Maybe suggest going for a walk - before you mention her weight/diet - getting a few more healthy food in or visiting the gym together. If she isn't up for any of the above, then it's probably time to mention bring up her weight. <br>  <br>  Take care and good luck,<br>  x|`|O3ArS1Poaa	You should never tell a girl that she needs to lose weight.  If you've been with her for 4 years, you obviously care about her.  If you think it's unhealthy for her to be the weight she is, maybe try getting gym memberships together.  If you just don't like it because she looks bad then maybe you don't care about her enough to be with her.|`|7e8NN8saaa	Not unless you don't want to have a girlfriend anymore. <br>  <br>  The point is son, to love her like she is. Warts and all.|`|G13DBUcUaa	You could encourage her to eat more healthlier but if it is just for your pleasure in her looks than forget it. You should love her for how she is. |`|DswHsIzpaa	What do you look like? If you are out of shape too then suggest getting in shape together. DO NOT call her fat or say she is over weight!!! <br>  <br>  Just lead by example. It shouldn't be about her looks if you truely love her. It's been 4 years since you started dating...is there a reason why there isn't more of a commitment? It can't be because you think she is fat. Just think about it.<br>  <br>  Maybe she can sense you think she is fat...that would force someone to lack self esteem. Which will make her eat more. You see the pattern.<br>  <br>  Take it easy on her man.|`|tmiAqUgBaa	Yes, its all ok to tell her but in a sweet way. First try telling her to avoid cheese and butter. She will understand a bit and later you can approach her and ask her to join in with you to a gym for just for your company. In this way, she wont even feel bad and she will also burn some calories. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps my friend.|`|vHwYENVjaa	Get a gym membership together. Try to hint it nicely. I mean, you have been with her for 4 years, what do you two eat? You might have to sacrifice what you eat in order to get her to eat healthier. <br>  <br>  In the end, it's up to her.|`|yPE2u1CZaa	Yeah it may ruin your love life. But if you love her then you need to try to make it work. Being with someone doesnt mean you love them for their body. You are suppost to love that person for who they are.... not what they are.|`|xRXPtnwuaa	well i think you should just tell here your concerned about her health(not your love life) and you want to be with her for a long time but shes not if shes unhealthy and overweight <br>  <br>  <br>  let here down easy|`|1lTJlSd7aa	neverrrrrrr tell a girl she needs to loose weight.. just break up with her if its bothering you that much<br>  |`|gLffUQWfaa	tell the fat ***** to get off her **** exercise and stop eating crap |`|cMqrpQHyaa	anything you say will be wrong ... leave her or get into hoggin its up to you .. plz keep in mind FAT chicks try harder |`|bjv7lM9Iaa	first depends? if your as fat as her then dont cry about it, but if your skinny and she a fat *** then. tell her you to fat!!!! loose it.|`|0Hh8bwWwaa	First it's LOSE not LOOSE!, tell her to LOSE weight or you will look else where for a skinny b1tch.|`|AA12041870	Do you love her?  She is still the same person she was when you met her, only there is a little more to love.  You can tell her to lose weight if you want to, but take a few steps back so that bat doesn't knock your head into the next county. |`|o2tPN5Geaa	The easiest way to do it is to join a gym with her and go together.  Tell her that you want to start getting healthy, and you want to do it together.
