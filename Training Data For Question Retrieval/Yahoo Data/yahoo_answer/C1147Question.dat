20090304124120AAeWHug	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Grrr...how can I pull my jeans up without everybody noticing?	My low rise jeans (Hollister, abercrombie especially) always feel like they're falling down even when I'm wearing a belt!!! I use the belt loops, but I've been told not to because they can tear really easily. So what's another way I can? (Keep in mind that wearing a belt doesn't really help with me wearing low rise jeans).   Can i use the pockets or something?    I know, I've asked this before, but I guess i wasn't being specific. I've tried wearing a size bigger, but it doens't help. I've tried wearing a size smaller, but it doesn't help. So I surmise it has something to do with the fabric or my body or something.

I said "Are you suree this is such a good idea" and he said "I really wanna though..."   He's a nice guy and stuff, not good looking but nice, and it was sorta my fault that he thinks I like him.

20090304125020AAWtroF	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Are there certain "racial" features you love?	I'm so in love with white female beauty, it's almost all I think about. In all of nature's beauty, the tree, the sky, the sea, I find the elegance of white female beauty to be the most beautiful. See  http://www.wallpaperbase.com/wallpapers/...  . Indeed, her golden blond hair shining as bright as the sun; her cherry red hair and elegant brown is, as likeable. Her many different eye colors like the rainbows in the sky and her white female beauty being the pot of gold at the end of it. Her beautiful white face & skin so more pure looking than snow. Her soft white barefeet like vanilla ice cream. She is exceedingly beautiful in appearance. See  http://cm.iparenting.com/fc/editor_files...  .      However, this does not mean that all other types of women are unattractive because I could say nice things about their features, as well. But I'm in awe of white female beauty, it's most beautiful to me.

I spoke to couple of artists already, they said that really the only think I'll need is fine art, and rest is my choice. I was going to pick fine art way or another, so that's done already. Does anyone else have advice on that? What to pick, maybe what did you pick? D: We are only alowed 3 :l As for DT, none of these seem usefull- they are all about building nightlights and investigating chocolate wrapers (that's what the booklet says, as well as most year 11s who picked DT).

My dress is red with black trim and black toole. It puffs out at the waist and it's a little bit above my knees. I'm wearing big black heels with it. I need ideas for hair, makeup, and accessories.       Hair:   My hair is blond and VERY thin and difficult to style. I was thinking of leaving it straight and just blowing it out, and I might end up getting low lights just before the party. But I'm not sure and I need more ideas for thin, straight hair.      Makeup:   I have very fair skin. My idea was to wear foundation, and do smoky eyes. But I need ideas for my makeup as well.      Accessories:   So I know I'm wearing chunky black heels, and I'll probably just use my little black purse. I need ideas for jewelry... I have nice diamond earrings I might wear, but I'm not sure if they'll go with my outfit. I might wear a necklace too but I'm not sure yet...      Also, what color should I paint my nails? And should I paint my toenails? (My heels are peep toes, I guess, they show just a little bit of my toes)      So I really need some advice. Thanks!

20090227074545AAHDqnW	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	What do you think about this tattoo?	I have this crucifix I like to carry around because it makes me feel safe. My aunt gave it to me and it was blessed by the pope. Anyway, I want to get it tattooed on the inside of my wrist.    Do you think tattoo shops could make it small (like the size it is) and still be very detailed?    Also, does it hurt more to get a tattoo where a lot of veins are located, like the inside of a wrist?

20090304142913AAUeK2Q	Beauty & Style;Hair	No mustache, and now.....?	After reviewing recent advice from: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  and also notice many other students absent of mustache, with some students who recently removed their own. Until waiting for summer to remove my mustache, I was anxious to try so today.... with intentions of only shaving it down some.      So I removed my mustache, and sorta think it looks weird. My mom say it looks good, but I'm still finding myself questioning. Looking at myself from far back makes it looks even more weird to me. Also with timing, I've recently have been brushing my former mustache with the same brush for my hair... which have oil etc.... causing a allergic reaction to my lip.    How do I got about this reaction if anyone know what I'm talking about? You mainly notice it when brushing mustache with same brush for hair.   How long did it take you/ think it will take me to get use to the absence of a mustache? I've had one as far back/ before 9th grade ( I think. Currently a junior).   Any specific reasons why the absence of a mustache makes one looks weird?    Any replies are welcome, such as information you think I might would like to know.

20090304105306AAzxPL4	Beauty & Style;Hair	Aphogee Hair Product Question?	I began using Aphogee Hair Products 3 weeks ago; well today will be my 3rd week.  I use to have very thick, long hair until a bad perm about a year ago; which caused my hair to break and shed badly.  I now have thinning, limp hair. I haven’t permed my hair in a year and don’t intend to ever again. I’ve only been shampooing and conditioning and doing hot oil treatments, until I heard about Aphogee Products.      For two weeks (once a week) this is my regimen.      Aphogee Shampoo for damaged hair    ApHogee Intensive Two Minute Keratin Reconstructor    ApHogee Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizer    ApHogee Pro-Vitamin Leave-In Conditioner       I also noticed that since using these Aphogee products when it’s getting close to a week, my hair starts to shed more.  My question is should I start doing my hair regimen twice a week instead of once a week?      Before I started using these products I use L’Oreal Paris Vive Pro Nutri gloss shampoo and conditioner with pearl protein complex for long damaged hair. On the week that I don’t use the aphogee products, since aphogee products are high in protein should I still use the L’Oreal or switch to something milder with much less protein.      My last and final question is should I use the Aphogee 2 Step Protein?, If I should, when should I according to my regimen.

20090227080226AAZytoZ	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Can anyone estimate a dressmakers charge for making this dress?	 http://www.freudianslipsvintage.com/dres...       This is a dress I've been pining for for ages now. I've investigated avenues such as finding a similar one cheaply online and making one myself (or at least the skirt).    I'm now thinking that taking this set of pictures to a dressmaker would be best, although this is not an imminent thing, just something I'd like to do.   I'm aware that I will probably have to buy the necessary fabric myself, but can anyone give a vague idea as to how much I would be paying a dressmaker on top of that? Any hidden charges I should know about?      Thank you

Okay, well about 8 months ago, i dyed my hair black...now it has grown out, and is a medium/dark brown...I went to sally's hoping for a change of pace with this hair, and I saw a product called hicolor loreal.  It supposedly takes your dark hair out completely and changes it to the color you purchased...So, i bought it, and I am looking for ratings from you guys??? The color i chose was vanilla champagne.  This is the color i chose because i figure, if i chose any darker, it wouldn't lighten it up as much so i am not expecting it to be vanilla champagne, but i have hopes of it to turn light brown??? Will this work?  Can you help?

20090304143925AAbnwOW	Beauty & Style;Hair	Help me with my hair color?! Brunette Going Blonde!!?	My family is blonde, but my hair color is tawny. Half my friends say I have golden-brown hair and the other half say it is dark, dark blonde. I love being a brunette, but I am 16 and long for change. This summer, I want to be a full-blown blonde.    The salon I know is fab, but my mom will only let me color my hair once, at the start of summer, and then not until winter. But this means brown dark roots!      This is my hair color now:  http://www.exposay.com/celebrity-photos/...       Then I saw THIS of Mischa:     http://www.mischa-b.com/gallery/albums/f...       This would be perfect! Tawny still on top, but there would be a lot of blonde towards the bottom. When my hair is down, I could be quite a blonde...but if I started to feel sad about getting rid of my brown hair, voila, I could put it back in a bun and I would be brunette!      I need help and am scared...what if it looks like I have 2 diffrent hair colors altogether? Will this look natural? Will the roots grow out and make the whole hair color look bad? HELP! Thanks!

My parents are skeptical about the whole idea of stretching , they have said no so many times , I've explained to them its my body and i don't care what others think , they just relate it to getting jobs and things , i still have like 2 years of college and hopeful to go to uni and have said ill have them fixed by the time i apply for jobs etc . but still the answer is no, doing this would make me so much happier , not about life but about myself and personal views on my own appearance would be so much higher, I'm pretty much not the best looking kid around and doing this would make me feel much more confident and relaxed around myself most importantly.Culturally i respect this for of modification and thats the only reason i want to get it done (that and it looks good) not for any scenes or stupid trends Ive thought about it for years and decided nows the time to do it as exams are coming up and my high school wont really say anything about it . If i do stretch I'm going to 25mm+  (both ears)   Any comments on this are appreciated    thanks !

I kinda didnt expect him to tell me, but he said he had to get something off his chest.    I've been best friends with him since 2nd grade, and i started liking him in 4th, and liked him until like recently.    I'm 16 now, and I still kind of like him, but thing is, im too scared to date him, cause im afraid we might break up, and i would lose him. That would absolutely kill me. This is what he told me earlier, in a note:      "Hey i want you to listen to me ok, there isnt a moment that goes by that i dont think about you lara. i love you with every inch of my heart. i love you so much lara. most of the time i look at my self in the mirror asking my self why would anyone ever love me and how could anyone want to be near me, but then i think about you and you your the only thing that keeps me going, lara. i drag my self out of bed just cause your alive and your the only reason why i havent killed my self yet you know if i never meet you i would already shot my self or hung my self. well i just want you to know that i love you so much, that its unreal."

The saying means a lot to me- it's simple yet strong. Plus i like the idea of it being on my wrist since it is right above my hands which "let go" of things.      I initially wanted it in french- but i am not french and i live in the US- so i have no idea how to properly word it. I've consulted people who speak french but i get a few different ways to say it. I like it in french since it gives it mystery, but i definitely do not want to get the wrong saying or an improper way of saying it on my wrist for the rest of my life. So would it be wiser just to get it in english? What do you think?

20090304154143AAcJIx6	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What should i wear with this skirt?	i have a skirt that looks kind of like this:    http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...     except its chocolate brown and has four bigger buttons on the waistband instead of the little ones going all the way down. also, the pleats (folds) on mine are a little more prominent, but you get the idea.   what should i wear with this? i searched on google but all i found were suggestions to wear a fancy blouse under it. i thought they were okay but its nothing special (and they were all paired with the high waisted skirts that had a pencil skirt bottom)   please give me some links or make me a set on polyvore if you can (if you do that, remember its brown, not blue so that the colors will go) thanks!
