uctxzjIIaa	Yes. Gamecube disks could only hold 1.5 GB of data, while a single-layer DVD, like most PS2 games were, hold 4.7 GB. So there was no need for a second disk on PS2, even with making the cutscenes video files, rather than in-game graphics using animation scripts like the Cube version.|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	the gamecube cd's can't hold as much information as the ps2 dvd's|`|kES9saVkaa	yeah, though personally i still find it very annoying to change it despite taking only about 2 seconds

j1gdd5GQaa	The 9400 GT is not designed for video games. The last three digits have to be 600 before you can call a video card a gaming card. Having said that, the 9400 GT should run older games pretty well.    When you say fsx, do you mean Flight Simulator X? These are the system requirements:      Microsoft? Windows? XP SP2 / Vista    PC with 1 GHz equivalent or higher processor    256 MB of system RAM for Windows XP SP2 / 512 MB Vista    14 GB available hard disk space    DVD-ROM drive    32 MB DirectX 9 compatible video card required    These requirements are incredibly low so you should be able to run it at the highest settings. If the program looks ugly, that's probably because the highest settings always look ugly. If you really think there's a problem then it's not caused by your video card.
kIqq7yIAaa	the best way to learn DM'ing skills is by teaming up with an experienced DM and picking his/her brain    head to your local hobby shop and post a message on the bulletin board "D&D players looking for DM"  some players have done well just "winging it" you just need a campaign framework to run your party through  keep things simple at first with just the basic book character types  thus you need only the 3 core books  DMG  PHB more than one is OK  monster manual    sites for DM'ing are few as DM habits are as varied as the DM's|`|VzJQUCPIaa	Depends on how much you've played already - it's difficult to GM well if you haven't played on the other side of the GM screen much so far.

Have a short dungeon crawl or the like culminating in the climatic fight in the BBEG's lair with a number of captives who are freed to reveal these are the 'new' PCs! A possible alternative is for having the old group encounter the new, also investigating the same dungeon - however, this can cause an initial fight between the two groups if either contain hair-trigger 'fight before talk' guys.

pEWEEUBraa	Games for windows are PC Games, but instead of being played like a third-party game (for example World of Warcraft), they have the same interface as their counterparts for the xbox.

The short answer:  Games for windows are basically xbox games ported to the pc.|`|dvkWQvfDaa	I don't think PC to 360 is possible. Windows-Live is just a software that Microsoft games ask for. You create an account and it allows you to play online if you have a Microsoft game.    It is likely to be a protector against piracy. If you own a pirate game, Microsoft will know because the game needs Windows-Live, and it will track your game and won't allow you to play online.    Windows-Live is just a software that Microsoft games request. It allows you to play online, but the TRUE intentions of Microsoft on doing this remain a mistery.    ^  That's just my theory. Don't know if I'm 100% accurate, though.

YQpn7XOeaa	Bingo! we do it in class alot to help us get ready for a test!  Just hand out cards with empty squares drawn (5 squares by 5 squares is perfect). The give them all a list of Key Terms, or other answers and have them copy wich ever ones they choose in the squares, in any order they like. Also give the kids some buttons or small peices of scrap paper to use as game peices (for covering up their answers). Then, using pre-made flash cards with questions written on them, call out questions and give the kids a small amount of time to find the correct answer on their bingo card. When a kid has 5 covered squares in a row, they have Bingo. Then they call out their covered words to you, and you decide whether they are correct and have Bingo! or not. If so they do, every kid must clear their cards and a new game has begun! You don't always have to use a 5 squares in a row method. You can change it up a bit, such as a complete board, a true square (4 squares covered which are connected to look like a larger square), etc. etc.  I hope this helped!  Good Luck with your project.

As for the body of the scarf, strands of yarn are tied together with a kind of crochet stitch or sewn strands.  It's not really something you would do yourself.

AA11001595	The answers above are correct, but there's more to it.    Players online tend to bluff more than in live games. It's easier to do since all you have to do is click a button and you don't have to worry about people getting a read on you.    Because people bluff more, people call more online. It makes sense to since people are bluffing more.    Because people call more with worse hands, people put bad beats on other people more often. It's not a higher percentage of the time that it happens, but you definitely see it more.    There's more to it than even that though. In addition to bluffing more, people play crazy more online. If you call with a 73 offsuit in a live game and then beat someone with it, you don't have to look them in the eye and have them hate you, but online, it doesn't matter, so sometimes people are just in the mood to play crazy and you see it more.    All that means that you see more beats put on people and you remember it more. Sometimes it happens a few times in a row and it feels like something crazy is going on, but it's just math. Sometimes it works out that way.    The number of hands per hour is also a factor online as someone else already said.    Some sites like http://wsopfreerolls.com have bad beat jackpots that get huge. This particular one hits 4-5 times a month for the person with the winning portion of it and they make between $50,000 and $250,000|`|eNHGiEvGaa	I think you're only marginally correct.  There are many bad beats in every game, in casinos, online, and in homegames.    However, probability and common sense tell us to expect more bad beats when players are looser.  The definition of a bad beat is pretty much when a player is playing a crap hand, and wins anyway.  The more crap hands people play, the more bad beats they produce.    There may be slightly more crap hands played online than in typical casino games.  Probably the same as typical home games, for small stakes.    As for the short stack advantage, it should be understood that, especially in tournaments or in no-limit games where the short stack is very small, there's heavy pressure to get the chips in.  The short stack is often forced to make a loose or unorthodox play.  However, against a field of opponents, the short stack often gets called all-in by whoever holds the best hand at the table.  Therefore, when the short stack shoves and gets called, he/she usually has the worst hand.  We must therefore expect more bad beats that favor the short stack.  When QQ holds up to beat K7, we don't call that a bad beat... it's just a beat, and the QQ is more often held by the caller, not the shover.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	You have to realize that online poker goes in the neighborhood of 3-5 times as fast as live poker. If you're like me and play 10 tables at a time, then just by doing the math you'll see that I should see bad beats 30 to 50 times more often than in a brick and mortar casino with the same level of play.    Also, most people seem to play sit and goes. The dynamics of sit and goes are very different than ring games. Eventually, everyone except the winner is going to have to go all in with a short stack. Because of this, you're going to see people pushing with bad hands or calling with bad hands a lot more often. That's means you'll have more people showing their bad hands and winning, whereas those hands would never make it to the river in a live ring game, if people even bothered to play them at all.    It's also important to note that it's a lot easier to try to bluff online. Not everyone can look you in the eye and shove their chips in the middle with Q7 in a live game, but when they're hiding behind their computer it's a lot easier. The nature of online poker encourages loose play much more than live games.

Get tired for farming, take a trip to the caves and fight for a while, then farm then fight. You really have to play it to appreciate it. As a game, a solid 8/10.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	I totally agree that games aren't as fun as they used to be.<br>  <br>  My guess is that developers forgot all about making video games fun.  Or developers are catering to the gamers.  Seems like gamers today don't really care about having fun.  All they care about is how realistic something looks.  The top selling games are shooters, like CoD:  World at War, GTA IV, MGS 4, Gears of War 2, etc.|`|NbjU4lxsaa	The guys making the video games are worrying about graphics a little to much.|`|nVg4xiTuaa	go buy an old school nintendo somewhere then.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	I know what you mean.These games today are Sh*t,and its a disgrace.The developers have totally forgot about the quality of the games..and all they focus on is graphics and stupid online sh*t.These "next gen" consoles are garbage,and a total waste of money.It makes me sick that all these retard kid think that the 360,ps3 and the wii are ''cool''.They should pick up a super nintendo,sega genesis,n64,ps1 and a dreamcast,then they will know what cool is.The truth is though....video games are dead.Its just going to get worse from here.The 360,ps3 and the wii killed video games forever.
AA10207386	Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility.    i've always loved harvest moon games, but this one is the best of all time.  you can play it for hours and still not be bored of it :D  and as you go throughout the game, you unlock mini game syou can play with your friends. [they're really fun!]    i also like mario cart because i can play against my friends who also have wiis without any of us leaving the comfort of our rooms via WFC, or multilayer mode if they come over.    zelda is also good, but i'm not very good at it D:      another good game is Okami.  it's also out for ps2, but i like it for wii better.  although, the concept of 'what do i do next?' in this game is a bit vague, it's still loads of fun :]      you also might wanna look into mario galexy. it's reeeaaally fun, but it gets sorta hard, at times.      hope i helped bunches :]    [you might wanna go to www.gamespot.com to get reviews and other opinions on these games.    if you want examples of game play, youtube should work.|`|vZJL5XUpaa	Supersmash bros brawl  Dragon quest swords  naruto clash of ninja revolution 2  no more heroes  fire emblem radiant dawn|`|6ePMWtKkaa	Twilight Princess  Brawl!

2Q2ltt1Saa	The double exp bonus from the RAF program is available right away, when both players are on the same server.  Each 2 levels the referred player gets is worth one level to the referring player, and the giver has to be the same level or higher as the recipient, so it's not like there isn't work involved.<br>  <br>  You only get it once per referral, though, an it has to be a new account, so it's not like you can keep getting the bonus over and over.|`|s385zhsHaa	I haven't done it before, but I imagine you can still use it on new servers.  It's only 1-60 so it doesn't really throw the balance that much.

40ObXE0caa	Make Pokeblock in Lillycove City and make sure it goes into your Pokeblock Container. Select it and click on a piece of Pokeblock. It should say "Feed to Pokemon?" or something like that. Then feed it to the Pokemon. Feebas is not obtained through Pokeblock. It is obtained by going to the lake under Fortree City. It's on 4 tiles there. You have to use Surf to get it. After you catch it feed it lots of the Pokeblock that raise beauty and it'll evolve into Milotic. BECAREFUL! If you feed it to many low level beauty Pokeblock, it will raise its sheen all the way until BAM! You can't evolve it into Milotic! Give it only high lvl beauty Pokeblock.|`|eF1wHOFTaa	You need to feed pink poke-blocks to Feebas to evolve it into Milotic. Feebas is a VERY hard pokemon to find. Search different areas of route 119 by fishing and you may eventually catch one. Then give it lots of pink poke-blocks, and if your lucky, you'll have a new Milotic! To make a pokeblock, simply go to one of the contest halls and talk to the old man by the Berry Blender.|`|QG4sDSH1aa	et the poke block case, lotsa berries and head to the contest halls gold or pink berries will work for feebas. Then click on case in inventory and feed the gold or pink pokeblocks to feebas.|`|nSYnCIB4aa	First, you atleast need a pokeblock feeder go to key items and click use and then you can pick a pokemon congrats your soon to be milotic!

6bqqNsiuaa	First, rapidly tap B when he jumps at you. Then shoot him and the tickers that crawl out of the holes. Avoid the ink grendes and the falling stalactites, and keep your Lancer out. Whenever he jumps at you, mash B. IMPORTANT: when he cuts down the columns, face towards him and jump sideways as the column falls. After 3 or 4 cuts he should be dead.|`|QIv9jeJ1aa	ya  just kill his minions and when he fights you you just have 2 keep pressing b till he leaves. then after that you have another fight with him    pretty sure|`|4x9PBxAoaa	Just fight the chainsaw duels and dont die. You should get a cutscene. And his name is "Scourge". You need to put spoiler warnings next time to post a question.|`|KtsOtRiPaa	Killing Skorge is pretty straight forward. I have beat the game on all 4 difficulties, i should know lol. All you have to do is get in a chainsaw duel to begin with. Then he will jump on the cieling and drop stalagmites on you, so just dodge those, pretty easy. Then he will come down and the barricades will go up, he will shoot at you with a gorgon pistol, and lambent tickers will come out of the acid vat looking things. dodge that stuff. Then he will cut down a column and try to crush you with it, just run and dodge when dom says to jump now or w/e he says. then chainsaw him again, and repeat the process. then you will need to fight from the gunner seat of a flying thing...cant think of what its called for some reason lol. He will be on a hydra. After that it is pretty easy.
cXX8iDDNaa	depends how badly you want afew new weapons and some extra gameplay. <br>  You can wait and see if it drops in price <br>  get it now<br>  or wait a little while for The Pitt to come out, it will be coming out in march and is based in a Raider settlement in which you can interact with raiders and not go into direct combat.|`|JAicBUHAaa	Lets be honest, not really.  You get a couple of new weapons, some new armor, but it's not really better than what you already have.  The gameplay itself isn't that great.  I would wait until the next downloadable content.|`|v33bnxICaa	Well, it is an easy 200 achievement points, and you get some pretty nice equipment after the mission, but it is way too short in my opinion. My answer would be, no it is not worth the price. Maybe if they drop the price by a few hundred points someday.

Personally,when I go to an amusement park, good weather really helps. Like even if its your birthday and its raining, there is no point. Plus, when you got to a park, you want to cover all of it, which means having rainy and sunny weather on the same day kind of screws it over. In terms of crows, disney has the fast pass system, just use that.|`|c8I9oxq0aa	I agree that you should go on your birthday. Starting this year, if you prove with identification that it's your birthday, then your entrance is free.     Otherwise, going on a typical weekday is fine as well.    You have to make sure its not a special event day because it can get really crowded.|`|dhdz5uNSaa	You should go on your bday. But the least crowded day is Wednesday.

MnEHO9u9aa	it sucks.... a lot|`|bGNBEtImaa	It is fairly fun. I just started for the 2nd time, first was at launch when I got to 37 and sold my account for a profit(thanks limited copies of the game). It is quite fun, and it can be fairly difficult if you don't know anybody in the beginning. I found that getting money in the first 10-15 levels was fairly tough, but as my profession skills got better and I did some instaces, I came into a decent amount of money.    In my opinion, you need friends in game. That is what makes or breaks MMOs. Friends can help you out, and also make the game more enjoyable during some of the hard or boring quests. Just be nice and talk to people in group, and you will make friends in no time. You might want to watch out for the general chat though, for some of the people there can be complete assholes IMO.|`|G3ScsO6haa	i reckon world of warcraft sucks even though people say it is good it is because they are geeky nerds    ps sorry if 22222 offensive|`|ncs6NLVZaa	i love this game its addicting though, noobs don't have as much fun prices are not too great but overall i worship this game XD|`|MyqOdACOaa	its really good and if u buy the game email me beacue i can send u a friend request so we can both get triple exp from monsters and quests then make and account with my code i gave you email me at albert.alar@yahoo.ca for more info i hope to hear from you soon thanks

They have used the game engine of Call of Duty 4 (Modern Warfare) which is still considered as one of the best game engines every developed.

The list of crafts is just unlimited!!|`|wnGBq14maa	How about Origami as a hobby? (art of paper folding). You can use any kind of paper, from craft paper found at your local store, origami paper (amazon.com) or even simple colorful wrapping paper which is more readily available!    You can choose to fold from a variety of patterns and models from animals, dinosaurs to Ornamental kusudamas or trickier modular origami pieces.     Models can range from beginners, to intermediate to complex. It depends on how experienced you are to try the more complex ones.     To give you an idea, you can simply run a search on youtube.com for origami models such as butterflies or dinosaurs, etc.     My hobby is Origami and I can spend hours a week simply browsing through books, patterns online and of course trying my hands at folding these models.     You can have a look at the various models I have folded, as well as tips and instructional videos at:  http://origamiancy.com/    Definition:  Kusudama: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusudama  Origami: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami|`|Y6B2b3xgaa	x box live|`|ctZ15JN5aa	I like this one and it is some thing that you can oneday show some one else.  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|tOH6hue6aa	i Print tshirts, magic, read, write, model cars, custom legos, video production, draw, music. the list goes on but maybe this list will give you a idea that you havent thought of.      toad|`|kIqq7yIAaa	try reenacting  lots of groups out there are willing to teach you their period    medieval/rennaisance  revolutionary war  cival war  WW1-2  korea  vietnam  modern|`|rP1OWD38aa	The list of hobbies and/or crafts is very long.

WxmNSxNGaa	I never sat at the big dollar ring games in the play money sections, but I did play the sit and goes up to the top level. I can tell you that the players at the top limit play money sit and goes (at Pokerstars) are about the same ability level as the low limit real money players. So in my opinion, if you can build up a big stack and beat the highest limit sit and goes, there is some value in that. You will be prepared to sit at the micro limit tables and start building a real money bankroll.    As far as begging for or even purchasing play chips, I agree with you. There isn't much value in building a huge amount of chips if you're not really going to play poker. But, I could see someone trying to get to the highest limit sit and goes ASAP just to see if they cut it. That would be reasonable, but I doubt most of the people you are talking about are doing that.     So yeah, in general it's probably pretty stupid. I guess you could mirror it to Yahoo games (like pool) or other video games where everyone is trying to get the highest score even though they don't get anything out of it beside enjoyment, but you're not going to become a great poker player begging for chips.|`|AA11001595	I know that on http://wsopfreerolls.com you get a bonus of $50 when you get to 10,000,000 play money chips.    You can get that bonus as many times as you want.    Other than that, it's just a pride thing as far as i can tell.
3IS5oGgBaa	My little sister played that game all the time. (It was really annoying me.) She said it will never reopen. It was just a promotion. But now she plays this other game kind of like VMK called VFK. This game is Virtual Family Kingdom. Look it up on google and make an account. Sorry about VMK.|`|8eLWAbHeaa	never.. it was just a promotion

I think xbox games are in visual basic but I am not 100% sure about that. I do know that maya and 3D max are the most popular 3D software. Maya has it's own programming language called Mel but I'm not sure if it's used for video games. Both oddly enough are primarily used on windows. (Macs are typically to expensive to get one powerful enough to do the rendering, they are also a lot harder to get fixed when they break)

Z2EzfQFvaa	Yes..mario classic is way better than the crap mario today.Its really good that you are young and can appreciate a good game..I like how your not just into todays games and not the older ones...because all of todays games,(except on the DS and GB),are garbage.Its really good to see someone else who knows Good games.Great question.|`|HDgdxtesaa	I love to play Super Mario Bros. on my Wii (I have 2 and 3!). Some of the new Mario games are fun. Super Mario Galaxy is cool. New Super Mario Bros. takes the cake though. Super Mario 64 DS is just like the one for Nintendo 64. Mario Kart DS is kida sorta good (Worth buying of course). Super Mario 64 is awsome!|`|1hyUQ0dKaa	Personally I appreciate all those WTF?! moments in the classic games as well.

Just play online thats where its really fun.|`|ffPla5WDaa	Yeah that's a whole lot especially for having only 5 games!!!!!!!!

BslZx9lYaa	well, i dont play PS3, but i can give u my top ten for 360    1. Grand Theft Auto 4  2. Gears of War 2  3. Madden NFL 09  4. Rock Band 2  5. Halo 3  6. Fallout 3  7. Fable 2  8. Call of Duty: World at War  9. Gears of War  10. Guitar hero 3|`|gbQ9URBJaa	well i don't really play any playstation games but i do play a lot of xbox 360.      Halo 3 is good because there is always a ton of people online, and it's easy to play.    Gears of war- I still like this one better than part two but anyway, this is good if you like a smaller multiplayer experience because the games will never be more than 4 on 4.    Rainbow Six Vegas 2-even though it's not a run and shoot type of game it's still packed with action, and it has a lot of multiplayer modes.    Grand Theft Auto 4- you can spend hours and hours just running people over lol    Guitar Hero or Rock Band are the best games to play when you have people over, especially so you can laugh at the singer haha.    Dead Rising- killing 53,594 zombies= pure fun    Left 4 Dead- if the zombies on Dead Rising aren't challenging enough for you then this is your game, and plus it's four player coop.    Dirt- is one of the first games i bought but it's still my favourite racing game. You get to race a bunch of different vehicles.    Ace Combat 6- is one of the coolest games i played, you should definitely try it but if you wait a little bit, another game like it is coming out called Hawks.    Lost Planet- I've never actually tried it online but i like the story, but it takes a little while to get used to the game play.    Those are my top favorite games, but you can safely choose any game that gets good reviews but don't not play a game because of the reviews. (sorry if that's a little hypocritical)|`|Uj90Fip8aa	go to gamespot.com  its a great website for all platforms
AA12042448	For the one in jeans, take a tight long-sleeved t-shirt or top and cut it shortish.  Measure about 5" below your bra and cut there.  Then, hem it up and take it in a little if needs be so it's tight-fitting. The overshirt on that one looks like a Japanese impression of a too-large American baseball player's shirt.  It really does.  Take off the buttons, sew up the button holes,  and add the fancy fastener at the bust.     For the other one, get a swimsuit top, cover it in red fabric, and put lacy ruffles around it.  Your sister may opt to wear a skin-colored leotard with this, especially if it's chilly where you live.  Blue skin and goosebumps aren't very attractive, after all.  The skirt should be made over some tight-fitting bike shorts with the legs cut off and hemmed.  Gather the fabric onto the shorts and sew it down, then sew on the ruffles and belt.  It's not that hard at all.

KtsOtRiPaa	Woah dude! Get that damn cooler off of it now! Those do not extend the life of your xbox! They actually deteriorate it from the inside. Those are terrible for it! And your best bet is horizontal, so you dont tip it by accident or anything and destroy a disk. To keep it from over heating, put a mirror behind it, and turn the xbox around. The mirror will relay your controller signal, and with it facing outwards all the hot air will escape so it doesnt over heat.|`|iClAIGn2aa	horizontal all the way|`|WI1q9kbBaa	i have mine standing up. Don't know what the difference is it just takes up less room that way.|`|ACU4Xbmmaa	you should let be at a verticle place because the disc will play much better and if it doesn't then you should buy a new xbox 360.|`|UZ2nix6xaa	If having your Xbox vertical worries you then it's probably better to place it horizontal.     I've had an xbox for a couple of years horizontal and i've never had any problems with it but i did put it vertical for a while and the disks started to skip so from personal experience i would say horizontal is better.|`|sLt4Hz5Xaa	Well, I did the same thing ( put a fan under it ) but then I put one on the back to pull the air out. Other wise it gets over stuffed. If you are good w/ the techno stuff and have an air compressor take your Xbox apart and blow of all dust on the fans. I recommend getting the fan to pull air out because it prevents RROD. As far as the faded spot goes, you can't move your Xbox while the game is spinning or else be prepared to have to get your game fixed. I recomend play n trade if you live in Arizona, otherwise toothpaste is supposed to work but don't use a toothbrush. Hope this helps!!!|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	vertical, better airflow|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	i agree|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	vertical; save space, looks techy.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	you have a better chance of you games not getting all scratched up and for you system to not over heat if you have it laying flat.|`|ad0eb1e8f993f37b5e550bf42f6ca748aa	Lay it down flat in a well ventilated area. You have a much higher chance of scratching the CD's in a vertical position.|`|E2oEVStcaa	Horizontal!!!    At the rental store I go to they won't rent xbox 360 games to you unless your console is kept horizontal and they can tell because they have hundreds of ruined games with marks in exactly the same spot from vertical xbox 360s.    The xbox wears down one spot on the game as it spins when it is vertical.|`|lAbVvmRoaa	vertical!! it wont over-heat|`|ac0rRBHCaa	Vertical give a room a better feng shui|`|HfF4EAAhaa	Uhhh....    Yikes. And buying a new one is out of the option? Sounds like you'll pay more than you bargained foe if you don't.     But if you're bent on using it still, I'd say vertical, but in a spot it won't tip over easily. Buy a cordless controller if you don't have one already.|`|0jBjvOuwaa	Vertical. :]|`|Lb20Wdgvaa	horizontal, vertical's bad for the disc, the fan isnt too good for the system either ( if its the intercooler thingy)|`|RbKZoDUNaa	Putting it vertical can damage your games making them unplayable.    I would put it horizontal and make sure it gets enough air.
sgRDJUXqaa	Have you played it yet?  You have a TON of patches to download, and it's a little less than 15 GB total.  (Just checked my folder.)    You use the "trial" version; when you pay for the CD keys, you can jump right in because you're required to download all of the patches so you're playing the same game as everyone else.

Rock Band just has a wider variety to choose from.|`|AA12328571	Both, Each has great songs to play to but guitar hero gives more of challenge, i found that playing hard on rock band was like playing medium on guitar hero.|`|LPQKZNUAaa	I like the songs on both, but I prefer to play Guitar Hero.|`|kBmy1joWaa	In my personal  opinion gh3 has the -like I said In my opinion- best songs by far.

If I were the average teen I would probably be all for rock band. I just happen to appreciate good music.|`|8qwHu5R1aa	It's impossible to label one as 'better', since it is all up to what kind of music you listen to.

hEfVCNcQaa	IIRC the weapon skill you start off with as a paladin is maces.    To be able to equip a sword you first need learn the skill. For this you speak to a weapon trainer who offers sword training. If you're aliance you can find one in Stormwind or Exodar, if you're playing horde he'll be in Undercity or Silvermoon.    Cost is 10 silver.|`|gKllAGmnaa	well if ur a blood elf pally u start out with swords and two-hands swords.  to equip u go to ur little picture on ur action bar then open ur bags to the weapon u click and drag to the slot that says main hand  next to off hand.  another way is to just right click the weapon in ur bag. but u might also have to learn the weapon skill at a weapon master if u dont know the skill, at ur home city such as stormwind(A), silvermoon(H), ironforge(A), darnassus(A),undercity(H) and orrigrimer(H).  To check what type of weapons u can use u go to the thing were u put ur weapon but u go to the bottom and click skills and scroll to weapons.

R6o5E022aa	Eevee can not envolve into espeon or umbreon in leaf green fire red.  it can only evolve in ruby saphire emerald.  in emerald, max out friendship and level up between 12:00am to 12:00pm to get espeon  12:00pm to 12:00am to get umbreon.  friendship envolution can occur in fire red and leaf green. for example: togepi to togetic, golbat to crobat, chansey to blissey. to check out if the friendship is max out, go to your neighbor's house and ask the women inside. she will tell you, if she say your pokemon can't love you anymore, it will evolve when you level up.|`|2chHEzY7aa	sadly, no you can't because to evolve eevee into them, it has to be night or day and in fire red there is no time concept.|`|WJzTnzovaa	no cuz you have to transfer them to another game like ruby/saphire/emerlad to make them evolve into espeon or umbreon, this is beacuse in the hoenn region there is time like 6:47 pm and 4:32 am while in the kanto region games there isnt so even if you tried the game wouldnt make them evolve cuz it doesnt know witch form to change it in to espeon(day=8 am to 8pm) or umbreon(nite=8pm to 8am)|`|WI1q9kbBaa	i don't think it can. You need a Pokemon game with a time zone on it. Pokemon emerald or ruby and sapphire.
oihouY7Naa	There is a cheap trick to bypass it and its pretty simple    Open up C:\\Windows\system32 and find any d3d dll, rename it to the d3d file thats needed for example d3dx10_35.dll and load the game. (copy and paste the original then rename it in the same folder)    It works great and I don't seem to have any problem when doing it to Call of Duty 4.

AA12286594	They're the same game, with the only difference being that FES includes a slew of extras that the original P3 didn't. Aside from all of P3's content, FES includes:    -an entirely new storyline (The Answer) with Aigis as a main character, set after the main plot of P3  -a few new persona fusions  -a few armors which cause actual appearance changes in your characters' clothing  -new boss fights    Basically, buy FES. It has everything you'd get in regular Persona 3, and more.
7gfNIajYaa	Aw man,originals give a game more class rather than pirated junk,I mean you buy it,you take the plastic off,and its yours. It gives the game so much more of a feel. I don't think there is any quality in pirated stuff,its just not the same is it? Damn, I love buying my games,I mean...the anticipation all the way from Gamestop all the way home just to open it up and play...eeeek I love that feeling!!|`|0kv2Mtskaa	it isn't the same as a new game from EB Game etc. I still feel like "OMG, A new game!!!Yes!!" but it's not the same as buying a game from Eb Games.|`|32dPb4rPaa	pirated games are no way as good as the realthing so i suggest just stick to the real thing!!!|`|NsYPUHOcaa	who care?|`|X6WAOqZOaa	Pirated games are usually buggy, so they don't come pair to actual disc games.  Although if I can I will save the entire game to my computer to keep my disc tray and laser from wear and tear as much as I can.

They are some popular gaming websites. They have a lot of games on them, and they're have some good time wasters. If, you're not looking for this type of site, I'm not sure if it will help you.|`|9dAcLvijaa	dizzywood.com|`|PpCTpuwSaa	I like Poptropica   kind of pointless but it can be fun|`|ad0eb1e8f993f37b5e550bf42f6ca748aa	www.google.com|`|v5Z4wsJhaa	miniclip.com  clubpenguin.com  pogo.com  yahoo.com|`|KtsOtRiPaa	Um, i like addictinggames.com  all the games have ratings.  there are no games with sexual material, or sexual innuendo.  the games that are violent are rarely ever that bad, usually stick people or crappily drawn zombies. monsters, etc.  not to much language      just check the rating on the game, its usually right under the game window.     more for teens than young children.

7o27vGPvaa	Is your internet high speed?  Do you know the Kb or MB/sec?  Could be equipment problem within your PS3.  Is your router fairly new?  I just had to replace my router and it fixed all my problems!  Do you have any computers that run off of the wireless router?  If so, and they work well, then your problem is obviously within the PS3.  That would be the first thing to check.|`|AA12328571	Ok few things to try and few things to change.  1. If you doing wireless, tried using a ethernet cable and see if you still have slow speed, if u still do, then it could be your internet connection.  2. If not and you wanna be wireless, then maybe upgrade your router to the wireless N network, the G network runs on the 802.11 line where as the N network runs at 54 Mbps line which can be up to 10-20 times faster than the G and newer routers even quicker so would suggest that.   3. Changing your security setting from WAP to WPA2 or WPA2-PSK  WPA is now old security technology and can be easily hacked. Your router may have WPA2 or WPA2-PSK on it but the bonus of the router with N network is the quicker speed and increased security encryption.    So try those things and should work, if all else fails what i do is pack up my stuff, go to the beach, drink a coke and breathe in the fresh air cause its not worth stressing over. :-)|`|pxMpWKk7aa	im sorry to tell you this but i think its time to purchase a new ps3 :(|`|imbcdRvXaa	as long as u have high speed internet then it wouldnt be the provider|`|sqaRnidQaa	connect the modem dirctly to each 1. to see if its the modem. then check the routers speed. it might be dividing it. 15 feet isnt bad as long as its clear view between eachotheer. id put most blame on the router though|`|3WyKt2bYaa	same problem but i havent try that much, i both a new router it cost me $120 and it was good for about 2 weeks, then bad !! i only get connection at midnight till 8 am, and sometimes in the middle of the day,  like i never know, i believe it could be my ps3 cuz its the first one that came out, i think the best result is connect the internet cable to the ps3 , that will be a 100% connection, i bet u wanna play COD 5 right, lol

zDeXMBnbaa	As the founder of Public Enemy, Chuck D. is one of the most colossal figures in the history of hip-hop, not to mention its most respected intellectual. He redefined hip-hop as music with a message, and his strident radicalism ushered in an era when rap was closely scrutinized for its content; although rap's primary concerns have changed over the years, its status as America's most controversial art form has only gotten stronger since Public Enemy hit the scene. Chuck D. was born Carlton Douglas Ridenhour in Roosevelt, Long Island, on August 1, 1960. His parents were both political activists, and he was a highly intelligent student, turning down an architecture scholarship to study graphic design at Long Island's Adelphi University. While in school, he put his talents to use making promotional flyers for hip-hop events, and went on to co-host a hip-hop mix show on the campus radio station with two future Public Enemy cohorts, Bill Stephney and Hank Shocklee. Under the name Chuckie D, he rapped on Shocklee's demo recording, "Public Enemy No. 1," which caught the interest of Rick Rubin at Def Jam. In response, the now simply named Chuck D. assembled Public Enemy, a group designed to support the force of his rhetoric with noisy, nearly avant-garde soundscapes.    Public Enemy debuted in 1987 with Yo! Bum Rush the Show, a dry run for one of the greatest three-album spans in hip-hop history. Released in 1988, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back was acclaimed by many critics as the greatest hip-hop album of all time, and was instrumental in breaking rap music to white, alternative rock audiences. Fear of a Black Planet (1990) and its follow-up, Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black, consolidated Public Enemy's position as the most important rap group of its time. There were storms of controversy along the way, most notably Chuck D.'s endorsement of the polarizing Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan, and group member Professor Griff's highly publicized anti-Semitic slurs. But on the whole, Public Enemy's groundbreaking body of work established Chuck D. as one of the most intelligent, articulate spokesmen for the black community. He became an in-demand speaker on the college lecture circuit (much like his peer KRS-One), and was frequently invited to provide commentary on TV news programs.    Muse Sick-N-Hour Mess Age (1994) found the group's status slipping, and the following year Chuck put PE on hiatus while planning its next move. In the meantime, he released his first solo album, The Autobiography of Mistachuck, in 1996, and published the book version of his autobiography the following year. He reconvened Public Enemy for the soundtrack to Spike Lee's 1998 film, He Got Game, and the following year left Def Jam over the label's refusal to allow him to distribute Public Enemy music via free Internet downloads. Signing with the web-based Atomic Pop label, Chuck became an outspoken advocate of MP3 technology, and made 1999's There's a Poison Goin' On... the first full-length album by a major artist to be made available over the Internet (it was later released on CD as well). He continued his lecturing into the new millennium and made regular appearances on the Fox News Channel as a commentator. Even if Public Enemy never recaptures the popularity or vitality of its glory years, Chuck D.'s legacy is secure enough to keep him a respected voice on the American cultural landscape.
tytyvT8Naa	When Van comes into the Valley, (The fat man who has a shop by the tangerine crate upstairs of the Inn, he visits when the date has an 8 or 3 as the last digit) sell him Jewelery you dig up with your hoe in the Excavation Site. Buy from him about 10 Bodigzers (or something like that). I do not recommend that you buy Bodigzer XL, as for it heals all of your Stamina, and is pretty useless.      Now go into the mine and keep breaking boulders in the second mine. WATCH YOUR CHARACTER! When you see her wipe the sweat off her head use the Bodigzer on her and you will be back to normal. Repeat the process and you will reach the bottom of the Mine.     DON'T GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MINE UNTIL YOU HAVE ALL YOUR TOOLS (excludes milker/shears) AT EITHER 400% OR MYSTRILE LEVEL. The only REAL point of that mine is to get the Legendary Sword. Once you get the sword, go to the rock above the waterfall, press  and watch the scene unlocking the other side of the waterfall. You now unlocked another field!    Sorry for the length, hope I helped!|`|EVjoCpjEaa	If you want a way to reach the bottom of the 2nd mine *without* spending any money, just collect a lot of wild grasses (indigo and blue ones from summer, white ones from winter and black ones from the 1st mine).    Have your Truth Bangle (from casino) equipped and make sure that your stamina doesn't reach 0.     Run around for holes to fall down and eat a piece of wild grass each time.    The whole point of this is that even if you have +1 stamina, and THEN fall down a hole, you'll only lose that +1 stamina, because you can't lose stamina and gain fatigue at the same time in the mines.    Save often though in case you land on a dead floor (no holes or stairs).    If you have the medium Harvest Goddess Hat from Van, you will also not lose any stamina when attacked by the mine creatures, or when you use a tool (without charging).

qNYzCKaZaa	Heres the step by step guide - i honestly dont advise being friends with EVERYONE in the neighbourhood...good luck with the phones if you do.    Enter boolprop in the neighbourhood view and then select your family, shift+click on the letterbox, now click 'make me know everyone' , you will now know everyone in the neighbourhood, now shift+click the mailbox again and click MAKE FRIENDS FOR ME , now you will be family friends with all these people.    If you onyl want to be friends with a select few then i advise doing it this way...    Make sure boolprop is on, select your family, invite the sim you want to be friends with over, shift+click on them, then select MAKE SELECTABLE now you can control that sim, go into their relationships and find your sim, drag the bar out too 100. Now shift+click them again and select MAKE UNSELECTABLE, you can no longer control them, now select your sim and open relationships and find the visiting sim and drag out the relationship bar to full. THen talk to them and you will become friends:)|`|Dso7k3sjaa	It works, but you have to turn the cheat on while you are in the neighborhood view.  Then go into the lot and open the relationship panel and it will now let you drag the bar higher.  That's also how you change their interests, their personality and their skills.    It will do other things if you turn it on while you are in the sims' lot, but for certain things you must turn it on while in neighborhood view.    Or, if you do turn it on while in your sims lot, save then exit to the neighborhood screen and then go back into their lot.  Now it will also work.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	All that cheat does is turn on the ability.  After that, you either click on the mailbox or the sim, something like that.  I never use it; it can seriously ruin your game, so be sure to change it back to false when you're done!

PSP is great for more mature gamers, since their titles are mostly shooters, sports, racing, etc. The DS on the other hand is only good for interactive games because of the touch screen. But you can have UNLIMITED games if you decide to use a R4.  As I said before, depends on your needs.|`|VtMgUpMYaa	I like the DS alot better then any console i have owned  But you might enjoy the PSP alot better.    The PSP has better graphics, built in internet, 32 GB memory stick, and unlike the DS it has FPS and Racing games. The DS might have a few but not as many as the PSP.    I like the DS it's great, I love the touch screen it makes games more interactive and it doesn't hurt my hands like buttons, the game are original no other system has them then again no other system     But If you wait later this year Nintendo is comming out wiith the DSi which is more or less PSP's clone with everything a psp has, a camera, but yet the same graphics      Really If you want to play FPS and Racing games I would  get a PS3 or give my computer an upgrade.    If you are going to go with the DS WAIT Till the DSi come out|`|HcDVPoZpaa	Well since you put it that way.

avhgLEu8aa	For electric racing in general, a battery charger/discharger would be worth it's weight in gold. They allow you to always ensure that your batteries are always at their best.  For Touring Car racing, the motors have to be a certain size and type to conform with the race rules so find out what your local track does and go with whichever you feel better with. Certain motors go in different classes. Then find out if it's either rubber or foam tyres. There are tyre additives you put on foam tyres to help with the grip. But the race organisers will give out control tyres so everyone is on the same tyres. Also, bodyshells have to be cut carefully. Too low and they might be disqualified, same goes with rear spoilers.  Buggies are still limited to the motors, with different motors in different classes and there are different classes for 4 wheel drive and 2 wheel drive. And again, race organisers will give out control tyres depending on the class and type of buggy. But they're more open with wings and bodyshell types.

You'd get about $30 for the system, and maybe $50 for all the games combined, if you are lucky (most of that value coming from Madden 09 and GTA: San Andreas).|`|Jm8au5qfaa	Basically you take in your games and they give you very very little for those games and rip you off.|`|8sTsyKOTaa	very little... you would make more off the street|`|vJcVOEtlaa	Madden NFL 09 for PS2? you are truly a dumb ****.

lQGDV7MEaa	-Raise your Sneak skill. The better that is, the better you chance of sneaking around unnoticed.  -Wear lighter boots. Light armor fur boots are the best for a low sneaking level.  -Don't go full speed when you sneak. Keep movement to a minimum.  -Take less valuable items first. How much you can take is dependent on how much the stuff is worth. Try to keep the worth to a minimum.  -Make sure the crosshair isn't solid when about to steal. If it's solid, that means someone sees you,and they will report illegal activity.    That's about it for stealing.|`|psUL6906aa	Upgrade your sneaking skills. It will be a heckofalot easier to steal items.|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	I don't blame you, you can't really play an evil character because any evil you do, the guards will come and take all the stuff you stole ever. I was playing Morrowind when I stole some glass armour on the other side of the continent, and got busted for taking a sword, and lost all my stuff. The system is unfair, so just play nice and don't steal without killing everyone around first. Not an easy or very good solution but it works on occasion.|`|vXZYuZ57aa	It's pretty old, which attributes to the price. As for the stealing thing, I'm not sure. If you're not seen, then they can't pin it on you. Are you in crouch/sneak mode and making sure the eye is translucent, not lit up? If they're turned the other way, but aware of you, they'll still know you stole. And other people can witness you stealing.|`|kYgU8NHAaa	No, if the guards are coming after you, then someone saw you.  Even if they didn't see you stealing, you can also get arrested if someone sees you trespassing.  In other words, if you're in a house that you aren't supposed to be in (you had to pick the lock to get in), even if you don't actually pick anything up, you can get arrested for stealing and all of your stolen items will be taken away.  The chances of being caught pickpocketing (or sneaking around) will get lower as you improve your sneak skill.     It's a great game.  There is probably something in the strategy guide about stealing.  You should join the Thieves' Guild, anyway, so you'll have access to fences who'll buy your stolen items.    Here's a link all about how burglary works in the game.  http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Burgla...
5d32e9336d3d64f65b396ddb85ea1f14aa	Find a specialty paper store in your area like Papyrus, The Papery, or Dick Blick Art Supplies.  Michaels or Hobby Lobby may be worth looking into.  You'll be looking for rolled tissue paper or sheets.  You didn't say what state or area you live in, so it would be hard to research stores without that info.    You could try a Factory Card Outlet or Party store.  I doubt you'll find it at Hallmark, but it's worth a try.    If you can't find it in stores I know Nashville wraps is a reputable dealer of some beautiful tissue papers.  I have always been pleased with the high quality of their items.  http://www.nashvillewraps.com/ShowType.w...    A simple trick to get those wrinkles out of folded tissue paper is to place the paper on a flat surface (preferably an ironing board) and place a thin cloth over the top.  Press lightly with a warm iron.  Time consuming but worth the effort.    Good luck.|`|hChy7BAPaa	try hallmark|`|841c629a3cfe63eb3ea9d0f6a74c8e71aa	You could also get Swedish paper...it comes out on a roll and its extremely cool...its a lot nicer then tissue paper and it is extremely great product for craft people.

BLwtzGWcaa	I'll be honest, I hate old time war based shooters, so I have avoided CoD 5.    As for Halo 3 and CoD 4, both are amazing.  CoD 4 really moves at a fast pace with realistic gameplay and amazing game mechanics. Best online multiplayer gameplay I have seen so far. As for Halo, it has been around longer online and therefore has a more solid, fixed game. (Ex. You can't glitch through most areas and snipe people while never being seen) This makes the game more fair. I prefer CoD 4 for the realistic action and awesome weapons. Halo 3 has nice gameplay, but something lacks in it.|`|s3AwAF4saa	call of duty world at war   a bunch of peaple play it|`|ZuCMKtabaa	COD 4 and WaW are basically the same only set in different time periods. I prefer COD 4 Modern Warfare to yet another WWII game. Also IMO the COD's are both better than Halo 3.|`|2xaBi6Whaa	umm having owning all of them they all have ups and downs but the best i think is cod 4 or halo 3. WAW IS TE WORST CALL OF DUTY I HAVE EVR PLAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not get waw if unless u lke getting killed by about 4 of the same weapons the entire time and lvl up maybe once a day. trust me its horrible|`|yMM8yY3daa	Cod 4 is the best|`|5vprfgCbaa	World at War!!!!|`|dUBFlhoEaa	Well I haven't played COD WaW yet but it shouldn't be that much different than CoD 4 which i've played. I've played Halo 3 and I think its overrated....Just doesn't seem that good. Gameplay feels weird...dont know what it is though  I have to go with CoD 4  Has to be the best FPS I've played so far(next to Counter Strike 1.6 =D)|`|w7C5Wvsdaa	kind of hard i mean all are good games. i don't like halo as much cod games i don't like the future like aspect so i rule that out for me so it is between cods. im going to have to say cod 4 its a new thing for the Series i like cod 5 but i mean they got Alto of glitches and i don't like the tanks at all they take too long to kill and people like to brag on how much they killed but they were in the tank more than half the game that is why i like cod 4 the kill streak rewards better.     my choice is cod 4|`|9EWN2Ktuaa	Halo! I don't play it much any more but CoD cant compare. Halo has forge,tether,best customizable private games,and you also get file share. CoD 4 had a few maps you could download. Halo is constantly being upgraded. You can become the top rank on both CoD with time. Whats so fun about that. Halo takes skill. Everyone in CoD is a GOLD CROSS. The prestige mode in both CoDs is pointless. Lose all your guns and perks for a new symbol??
YQ8YsYepaa	You should sign for catas, (7 signs competition) and collect seal stones, you can  sell those or exchange for ancient adena and sell that. AA is going for 1:5 at times on my server. Ive been playing for a while,  but even now on a new toon i port to HS or some higher lvl spot and pick up drops left by other players. Be careful not to pick up if someone is hunting there,  you will prob get killed.  If you havent joined a clan yet,  you prob should, A lot of times clans will help you out on lowbie gear. Also run through catas ( heretics or some other low one you can handle) and pick up all the common gear the bots dont pick up. Have a friend crush it for you and sell the crystals. Seems like its not many,  but they add up and that will get you some adena.

T6V9zXymaa	(SPOILERS)    Although it was originally stated before release that there would be many possible endings to Fallout 3, there are really only four. I've completed the game with two different characters: the first was good and the second was evil.    What happens to you is based almost entirely on the two decisions you make at the very end: 1) Do you use the FEV virus, and 2) do you go into the irradiated chamber to activate the Purifier or do you send Sarah Lyons in.    If you go in yourself, yes, you die, but you die a hero! With the release of the 3rd DLC in March, you will be able to continue at this point (making the level cap 30!  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/fallou...    If you send Lyons in, she will make the sacrifice you wouldn't. You, theoretically, continue to live although the game still ends at this point.    Using the FEV virus doesn't prevent you from dying, but it changes the dialogue in the summary at the end of the game, as does choosing whether or not to sacrifice yourself. I also noticed that the montage of pictures at the end is different for Good vs. Evil characters (I remember seeing an image of the freed slaves at the Lincoln Memorial with my Good character and an image of Raiders and various scenes of destruction with my Evil character).    Don't think of it as sad that you sacrificed yourself for the good. It's actually quite noble.|`|JVyPJaX5aa	Yes you can live or die depending on a bunch of things like your karma and how you play some of the missions. So yes you can live but i don't know if you can keep playing it just kinda ends.|`|fKKcrT8Maa	There are apparently around nine to twelve different endings, all of which depend upon different factors...

I have a pretty decent summary here: http://www.greatgptguide.tk .  Hope it helps you find one you're looking for.
6JqcFQxlaa	Lightsworn: Money waste..need cards like JD, Honest, Charge...but it does own GB. If you go to the metagame website and look at the tournaments..the top 16 decklists..about 13-14 of them are TeleDAD and 1-2 are lightsworns...so no GBs. This tell the limited strength of GB. Also, because of the high budget, Lightsworn decks look better than GB...shiny cards....if you wanna show off, go for Lightsworns. You can make a 40 cards lightsworn deck with all holos.  Gladiator Beast: CHEAPER than lightsworn..only need some bestiari or some other holo cards. But..the new banlist is coming. If I was you, I would wait first of purchasing or trading cards. If JD or some other keycards in LS is/are banned, then GB would come back.    Also, this is about synchros..LS don't use any synchros GB does.    Hope this helps ^^|`|yzpU5fZJaa	personally, i like loghtsworn. they are just funner to use. it is really up to you, when it comes to lightsworn vs. glad beast, it really depends on how well the deck is built. unless of course you drop a judgment dragon, then it's all over.|`|gwy4cp7Saa	I heard JD was being limeted to one and some other LS cards are being limeted nowdays its about sych monsters gladiators beats deck deals them well and its cheaper after JDs limeted the LS will die down.|`|0Zv4RtFFaa	It kinda depends on what you like really. Would you prefer self-milling, or tagging your monsters out after a battle. Personally, I would choose the light sworn|`|xB0vOgSwaa	wait a month until the new ban list comes in...march 1...certain staple cards like Judgment dragon may be limited or banned...personally i like  gb's better
81ZqCu42aa	Can you be more specific? Was there any message on the screen or any pop ups?|`|FgHwxPeGaa	was it downloading the patch?    or your computer has a virus.
Ex79fiD9aa	Past lottery numbers have absolutely no bearing on what's going to come up. Anyone who thinks otherwise is only fooling themselves.    Every number has an equal chance every drawing. It is impossible to make any accurate predictions. No human or computer can do it.    In games of chance, what happened in the past cannot possibly affect what will happen in the future. It never has and never will.
fvre0o9laa	Not free, but good:  http://jalie.com/sewingpatterns/patternc...  http://kwiksew.com/Catalog/Book_Toddler....   http://kwiksew.com/Catalog/cat_thumbs.cf...  (the KwikSew toddler and kids books will save you a ruddy fortune and teach you some basic patternbashing skills at the same time!)    Many of the kids' patterns in the usual pattern books are not well drafted and "fit funny" -- many are not balanced, and get even stranger as you try to make derivative patterns from them.    You might also see if you can find someone with a copy of Ottobre or Burda Kids and trace out some patterns from those magazines.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	February 13 - 16,  JoAnn will have Simplicity patterns on sale for $1.00.    There is a limit of ten - stock up!
kIqq7yIAaa	most people use this great invention called a     ***yardstick***    as most ribbon is sold by the yard it works nicely|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	I have never heard of such a thing.....you could invent it though! If you have a craft table, draw (or tape) a tape measure to your table like they do at the craft stores. It only takes a few seconds to whip out the ribbon and slice it. You can even have one of those paper slicers mounted to your cutting table to make cutting easier.|`|AA12042448	I have never heard of such a thing.  I use a ruler.  Could one of those kids of yours do the simple measuring and cutting?  You could call it "practical math application."|`|k0g1qjoXaa	Measuring tape, it's usually used for sewing and measuring waist, chest, ect. But it'll work!
Uj90Fip8aa	its not tht great|`|5vprfgCbaa	Yes it's awesome and great if you have friends over that you wanna do a coop game with. With coop there can be a very good strategic done you can customize ur stuff where one goes for regular rifles and the other big machine guns that attract "aggro" or w/e you wanna call it I forgot what its called straight from the game but the bigger guns will get the attention and the other can pick off snipers and such. Me and my friend beat it in a few days I recommend it its great.
0pkAFo8vaa	Nope. Look at this screenshot from Battlenet: there are two separate ladders for wins, one for TFT and one for RoC.    Also, I can confirm that your icons (based on race-wins) do not roll-over either. TFT doesn't have the same icons as TFT - for instance, if you get 25 wins w/ human your icon is a rifleman, not a footman.  (too lazy to get screenshot but I know from personal experience)
JeNw0gZbaa	do u mean Gears of war 2 cuz i never heard of Dawn of war 2

Sorry. Katee
CBqmFF7Faa	The best presently and personally would be Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid 4, and Gran Theft Auto 4. In the future, Killzone 2 (coming Feb. 27), Grand Turismo 5, MAG, and God of War 3.    Little Big Planet is a great game for creative people because you can make your own levels as well as share it online.    Metal Gear Solid 4 is a great shoot-em-up game with a great story and graphics.    Grand Theft Auto 4 is one of the best sand box games out there. Great story, graphic are ok but not in HD, and a GREAT physics engine that creates a rag doll effect when you hit someone with a car or push them off a building.|`|Uj90Fip8aa	little big planet|`|JeNw0gZbaa	Metal Gear solid 3 and little big planet and Cod world at war|`|DeY4klPAaa	Im not sure if its out yet but if it is, it's almost certain that God of War 3 is the best.|`|5vprfgCbaa	Call of duty world at war
DbDDl1x5aa	buying a membership is just a waste of money. you get to buy clothes and stuff for your igloo for a couple of months but when your membership expires you cant wear are decorate your igloo with any of the Accessories. so you spend all those coins to buy stuff and then when your membership expires it goes away. it is a waste of money|`|UGrZGjZnaa	lol ur kidding me

AUCcZ8lQaa	check for the updated patch which was supposed to resolve a lot of the pc issues.  If it still doesn't work the simple solution is to buy it on the xbox or ps3, that way you know every game you buy for the system is going to work right from the start, every time without having to know if your specs will handle it.
iu9j3fQzaa	I'm pretty sure you can use whatever cards you like
cb2NxPERaa	240 hours. The other answers are all wrong.|`|fKKcrT8Maa	Well, considering it will be about 6,600 trips for you to make it to level 99, I'm guessing it will take you around 9 hours if you can fill a bag of willows within 5 minutes.|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	About 205 hours or over 8.5 days of straight wood cutting at 1 lot every 5 seconds continuously. I have no idea if those numbers are right, but that is what I came up with.|`|vTGnZsOxaa	Maybe a month or two. Or 10 days, depending on the number of hours you play.|`|kfaQLgdCaa	Don't waste your time with woodcutting. If i were you, do a combat skill like attack or strength. They're fast and more useful than woodcutting. if you want a skill to make money with do slayer, that way you still can get a combat skill.
SkpRC2Nmaa	check the imob forum at the site bellow    imob.lefora.com/
vtJDHJDYaa	You can't move them. To the left of the Accessory Shop in the alley that you started in at the beginning of the game is a RED TRINITY MARK (1/6). Use this to enter a closed off section of the Alleyway. The chest here contains DALMATIANS 4, 5, and 6. Return to the First District.|`|F3lyP5XLaa	I think they break with a secret move were donald goofey and sora start running in to one an other|`|vJcVOEtlaa	I used to play that game a long time ago. Upgrade to newer console. Fagget|`|ZmajohHraa	If you dont have donald and goofy on your team i dont think you can do the trinity and the other problem is you cant jump high enough. You probably will have to do the trinity a little later in the game by getting the ability high jump. Actually i think you need to pick up some small boxes or small barrels then throw it near the big pile of boxes. Just be careful not to chuck it at the boxes. Once you have done that hop on the box or barrel and see if you can jump over it.     ps: You cant destroy the boxes.

n3Rysktjaa	Try re-installing it or something. Maybe it would help. I think maybe your comp is sensitive to burned stuff, like mine. My comp usually works on original stuff better. Anyways, just try to uninstall then install it again.  *EDIT*  Have you tried inserting the disk again? If you have not try following whatever the error window said. If you did, maybe you could take a look at customer support online. I think you could check Sims2's official site, maybe theres a link there.|`|t7cuerySaa	i don't know how the burning cd look like but try play the game using Bon Voyage.  ok download bon voyage nocd patch copy it to bon voyageTSBin folder
Jm8au5qfaa	Yeah it's pretty good idea.|`|RDoH7Ac9aa	well...its a start. but its not that good.
ZiMkydtHaa	xbox 360 cause it rocks !!!|`|F3lyP5XLaa	PS3 all the way!!!!   ( I'm not gonna talk much about technology, just mainly features, games, and online)    The only "reasons" that I ever hear from 360 fanboys is "The 360 has better games" and "The online is better". They always say Halo 3 and Gears of War, that's about it (What about Bioshock you ask? Oh wait! It's on the PS3!). The 360 used to have better games, but now the PS3, despite being released nearly a year later than the 360, has the better games; Uncharted Drakes Fortune, Ratchet and Clank Future, Resistance: Fall of Man, Warhawk, Motorstorm, Gran Turismo 5, Metal Gear Solid 4,LittleBigPlanet,Resistance 2,Tekken 6,God of War 3, , SOCOM, Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier, the Agency, I could go on. the 360 fanboys who still use this excuse are either ignorant or just can't accept the truth. Plus, the only major games the 360 has to look foward to is Gears of War 2 and Halo Wars,   As for the online, PSN is just as good as Xbox Live; still, fanboys refuse to believe this, the 360 just has better features, the ps3 is getting EVERY feature that the 360 has it firmware 2.60, and it is also has HOME. Plus, you can play online for free on the PS3    The PS3 has the potential to have better graphics than the 360, yes, multi-platform games look better on the 360, but that's cuz they were first developed for the 360. Look at any screenshot of Uncharted Drake's Fortune; beautiful graphics ( better than Gears of War) and it's only using 30% of the PS3's power.    But hey, at least the Red Rings of Death is Original :D    Lastly, another thing people (mainly 360 fanboys) complain about for the PS3, is the price. Sony is being pretty generous for lowering the price to $400/$500 (80 GB and 120 GB models, respectively) from the original $600, yet 360 fanboys still think it's overpriced. You pay more, because you get more:    -Built in Wi-fi  - Blu Ray Drive that plays Blu Ray movies, CDs, and standard DVDS  - Can play online for free  - Flash Card readers  - Ethernet Port  - HDMI port that supports Full HD (1080p)  - You can upgrade your own hard drive with any 2.5" SATA HDD; you can have up to 250 GB of space! AND, it DOES NOT void your warranty!  - Supports 3rd party Bluetooth headsets and video cameras ( but there is an official "Playstation Eye") unlike Microsoft; you can only use the ones they make.    Total- $400 (80 GB)|`|RjGtp41Zaa	With this type of question, ur gonna get a lot of opinions. Here is one thing you should ask yourself to see wat system is better, "Am I a Hardcore player who wants top-notch online play?" If so, get a 360. If you like FUN games with average competition, get a PS3. They bot have their own ways of greatness. Oh, and ask what system most of your friends play.|`|Jm8au5qfaa	xbox 360 better graphics and better games.|`|dKsQktrjaa	XBOX 360.    easy to use, much better games, (sorry PS3, go play Afrika) more of your friends are bound to have 360, and its easy to bring your things and play your games at a friend's house. PS3 is just there for competition.|`|stnCjBP4aa	Xbox 360 better games|`|AXqmo8rlaa	Neither.....Wii is more versatile and adaptable for the future.|`|vAWnjsZpaa	ps3 by quite a margin. yes it is more expensive but having both i enjoy the playstation 3 so much more. The graphics are better, the games are better, the movies look better, the controllers feel better in your hands, online is FREE!!  and with that they give you playstation home which is like a social game. Its just amazing i love the ps3. The only thing that the 360 has better is beautiful katamari for real.|`|s3AwAF4saa	360|`|YqR8Aym8aa	360- better graphics... better sound...better games...everthing is cheepier|`|8vIiBt9qaa	I personally prefer the Xbox 360. The 360 has a better selection of games and the online interface is better even though you have to pay for it. The PS3 isn't a such a bad system it just isn't preferred because of lack of games, some graphics, and price.|`|xIKtpZodaa	360 because you have a lot of games to choose from but the PS3 has some nice graphics, but not a lot of games.|`|AUCcZ8lQaa	you are going to get fanboys saying one is better than the other.  I have both.  I like them both for different reasons.    Xbox  The best online experience, hands down.  Everything is integrated. And every game has the same standard online options. Game updates and system updates are automatic.  Exclusive games like Halo and Gears of War.  I personally like the xbox controller better than the ps3 controller. Xbox has backwards compatibility with most old xbox games.    PS3  Most systems have a larger hard drive than the standard xbox hd. You can easily upgrade the hard drive with a standard laptop hard drive.  It has free online, but you get what you...don't pay for...the online isn't that good.  No one has a mic (which sometimes is a good thing), and there isn't a standarized system for online play for each game. Each game is different and you will be signing agreements and such.  My biggest complaint with the ps3 is the installment of games.  I put in a game expecting to play, but first i had to install an update that takes 10 minutes, then it has to install part of the game on the hard drive.  Then when i try to play the game online it says i need to do a system update, so i have to back out of the game, do a 30 minute update, then get back into the game.  Once all that is done though you are set.  PS3 has awesome exclusives like Metal Gear Solid 4 and Resistance 2.  One bad note: they removed PS2 BC from the new models...but you can play PS1 games...lol.    I guess my statement for the PS3 is longer, but my main urk is the initial install of games...including demos, where on the xbox you can just download and play.      Final Verdict:  If you want to jump in and play games, and especially play them online, go with the xbox.  Sure Xbox live is 50 bucks a year, but its money well spent on the better online service.    If you want to play Metal Gear Solid, Resistance 1 and 2, Ratchet and Clank, and other PS3 exclusives, then get the PS3.      Me I got both, so I can play the exclusives on the PS3, and all the other games with my friends on xbox.|`|cp2CYB0caa	My next door neighbor has an xbox360 and a ps3 and i think the xbox is better. If both have internet things with friend codes i would go with whatever more of your friends have. The xbox is also very cool because of the head set which lets you talk to your friends and strangers while playing games or in a chat room. I personally like the xbox360 because i have a ps2 and the ps3 is alot like it and the xbox360 is a lot different than the first xbox. One down side to the xbox360 is that you have to pay for online but i would highly sugest it because it really makes the xbox the better system. Just make sure that you have a internet connection first before buying xbox live or you wont be able to use it. but them if your posting this on the internet you probably have internet unless your at a library or friends house|`|vJcVOEtlaa	PS3 so that kids can make fun of you.|`|8hkonSmFaa	the ps3 is better because in the xbox 360 you have to pay to play online and in the ps3 you dont.|`|CBqmFF7Faa	Playstation 3, though at a price of $399, it beats the cost of owning a 360 and paying for xbox live which is 50 dollars a year. So after 5 years if you owned a 360, you would of paid 450 dollars all together, more than the ps3 that has free online play.    Though the playstation 3 has a small library of games compared to the 360, It has better quality of games and better graphics. Examples would be metal gear solid 4, Killzone 2 (coming feb. 27) and soon coming, Grand Turismo 5, God of War 3, and MAG.    The Playstation 3 also is reliable. The reason is that the 360 has a 33% chance of having RRoD which is the complete failure of the system and if you do not have a warranty or passed the warranty, you have to buy a new one. If you have a warranty, you have a chance of waiting months to get a new one and you have to start all your games over again because your saved data is gone. The Playstation 3 rarely has a problem with system failure though it does happen but it is rarely talked about it because almost never happens.    Also the big thing about the Playstation 3 is the blue-ray, the best way to watch movies on your HD tv. Great picture quality and great storage space for games. That means you dont have to deal with multi disc games like the 360 that uses dvd discs.    That about somes it all up. My pick is the Playstation 3.|`|BrVPlsdsaa	Well, if you are looking to buy one...go for the Xbox 360. It has more worldwide players than Playstation 3. The gaming quality is much higher. Also, it has better games.. unless you like gay games like the Little Big Planet crap.
LnYr2dLfaa	Because the best games usually contain the adult content.    Tell your parents you are responsible enough and ready to start playing more mature games. If you need to prove it to them, then do what it takes so you can get the games.|`|Jm8au5qfaa	They all have language intense violence and extreme gore or something like that.|`|7pHvCkasaa	It's fun to kill people and shoot peopel. you get to break the law without really getting arrested or killed|`|d9cB8yN8aa	"Best" is a matter of opinion, although I agree, a lot of good games are rated M. I have been attempting to convince my parents to allow me to buy the game Oblivion, but because it was re-rated from Teen to Mature, they wouldn't let me. However, I went on Ebay and found a good condition Teen version, and my parents let me buy it :) I would reccomend buying a Teen version of Oblivion online.|`|oM7P6pMgaa	im sorry dude, all the good games are rated M, i don't know of any good ones that are rated T, you might just ask for something not too bad to start out with, you could get some M games for your Bday, you said its in a month  all you have to do is be good, don't ask for cod: waw, or gears,  ask for halo 3, that's probably one of the least gorey M games around, cod and gears are probably the most gorey along with alot of others like assassins creed|`|dKz9no3waa	Sadly i don't think they make different versions of games in that respect. The only things i can think of that you could do is either    1. Wait 2 years until your 17 and old enough to buy them yourself or...  2. Sit down with mom and dad and just explain to them how you feel. Reassure them that they have nothing to worry about if you have them, and that you will not be influenced by them and hurt people. Ask them if they would let you rent the game and let them watch it. That way they can see the game for themselves and not be influenced by the media going overboard and jumping to conclusions. Its worth a shot and they will be impressed with you being an adult about it. Hell they may want join and play it too!|`|33gTvEAfaa	Because Mature games is where the money is, People get more excitment out of games, with violence and so on. T rated games, they dont really make anymore because they dont relate to much, either its going to be Rated E (everyone) or M(mature)|`|YqR8Aym8aa	all what these guys are saying and because the rating places are cracking up on game companies trying to make them stop making them so bloody  and bad....so the game companions are just raising everything good to m so they can publish it....    my parents are the same way... i just get rid of the case and tell them that its T and wont play them in the same room as them...    obama is going to stop violent gaming

If you dont have friends u can play with bots.  Not to mention Horde mode! FUN!!|`|BLwtzGWcaa	Depends I suppose. Gears of War 2 is great if you are into it. Amazing storyline and awesome game mechanics. LIVE play can be hindered by the smaller player base, but it is still fun.     Skate was a very inavative new kind of game for it's time and no doubt, Skate 2 will continue that traditional gameplay. I found it fun to play as I was able to more fully interact with it than it's Tony Hawk counterparts.    In terms of storyline/campaign mode I would go Gears of War 2.  And since I don't see a massive online base for a skating game...that vote also goes to Gears.|`|7pHvCkasaa	Gears of War 2|`|QLvcwJmdaa	skate 2 all the way i had skate 1 and it is by far my favorite game ever skate 2 looks so sick plus there great for achievements!|`|Uj90Fip8aa	gears 2, and skate 2 is already out fyi|`|dciibBF0aa	It depends, If you already have a shooter like halo3 or lost planet, get skate.  If you dont have any shooters, than get gears.  If you dont have anything at all   gears>skate|`|33gTvEAfaa	If you got the First skate and like the story line go with skate 2, has a good story line. GOW 2 Is a great alien Game and if thats what your more interested in, fight game etc. go for that.

Good luck!|`|wzue5Xzbaa	I've worked one until my fingers hurt. and then I gave it to my two year old nephew to drool on.|`|ZiMkydtHaa	nope not solved it yet but son has|`|gK4gIepZaa	no, i dont know the allgoritims(spell-check)|`|0IievPCaaa	Hahaha! Are you serious? Within 30 minutes of getting one of  those things, I sat down with the little booklet that came with it, and I solved it right away. After I got used to solving the 3x3 the 4x4 was pretty much a piece of cake too =) .
d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	I'd choose LG (Personal preference), but the aquos is a very good TV.    If you're anal about the visuals, then get the Aquos, otherwise, they're not too much of a difference, other than one is slightly higher quality

1IJUxVBSaa	Go to Moonlight Hill and there's a platform that you need to cast Fira on. You'll need to defeat all the heartless in the area. The platform brings you to a bridge that leads to Oogie's Manor.|`|d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	you have to visit the cemetary, then pumpkin hill, then go across a bridge    the entrance should be next to the mayors office past a gate at the top of some stairs    EDIT: moonlight hill actually, thinking of sonic adventure|`|ZmajohHraa	Well first you need to beat these 3 little kids i cant remember there names. Then you need to look around for a green door. It should be where oogie is. Just look around and jump off the vines and stuff and see if you can spot the green door. By the way im pretty sure the door has a picture of oogie on it.|`|5lMsk9Wsaa	go up the stairs and fight the monster than you walk across the trirlly hill and once you get past there you get to oggis manor|`|vtJDHJDYaa	From the Graveyard, Enter the casket again and go around the broken pumpkin to reach another door. This is Moonlight Hill. As you head up the hill, examine the small gravestone to uncurl the hill.    First things first: take care of all the enemies in the new area, and then jump into the gorge. The chest under the bridge contains a DISPEL-G. Climb back up the stairs and jump from the blue platform to the chest on the other side of the gorge. This chest contains DALMATIANS 40, 41, and 42. The chest on the other side of the gorge is actually possible to get. If you jump towards the ledge without quite landing on it, you'll land on a small ledge underneath that doesn't look like it would hold you. From here, just jump to the chest, which contains a DEFENSE UP. Now head across the bridge to reach Oogie's Manor.

The 360 hard drive runs about 1.25 bucks per gb.|`|AUCcZ8lQaa	Its worth it if you want 120GB of space.  That is one of the shortcomings of M$.  They make you buy their hard drive.  A good thing about the videos and arcade game is that as long as they are on xbox live, you can download them at a later time without paying again.  That way you can delete some you aren't playing or watching to make space, then download them again at a later time.|`|Pa8SpGoiaa	Hell No! I think the 20GB Hard Drive is more than enough brother, just stick in the videos and stuff you like the most and that's it!

154dzJ1Faa	You can get some iron-on transfers that you print with your computer printer and they work quite well.  Or you can get some fabric ink that will do the same for free-hand drawing.    I found that acrylic artist paints stuck on the fabric quite well, and didn't wash off (found out when I was doing some painting!).  You can apply the paint with brush or fingers, depending on what design you want.  It can be mixed with water like water-paints.    There are also fabric dyes for an over-all effect.  You can paint with them too, but you need special equipment to set the dyes so they are permanent.|`|tOH6hue6aa	I use photoez paper to make screen printing stencils. and Versatex Screen Ink. go here and check it out.    http://www.cbridge.com/|`|Mt0hyZzmaa	I've spraypainted stencils onto shirts and after it dried I put newspaper over it annd ironed it. That helps it last longer, and make it washer safe, it'll begin to fade slightly after a year or two. Or you can get some actual fabric paint, and screen print it on to your shirt. Depends all on how you plan to print whatever image it is you have in mind. Need some more details.

Remember one thing though, there donating as a favor, never be 2 greedy.  & remember to make a post that lists all the donaters that ever donated to you.  If you want to get more gold, you should try the games (i highly suggest fishing, it might be hard at first but you'll get better and then you could go to Gambino or Durem to try the harder fishing).  If your just looking for EZ gold, go to towns and shake trees/shrubs/stones to get random gold; post/pm/comment and you get random gold (usually 1-15g)    My username's Kyoko-chan_1
afcd1aa4cb78f4cdd13f0fca424a4385aa	I have before it is a great game.
AUCcZ8lQaa	World at war if you want fun online and a good FPS.  LBP if you want a fun game that isn't that long but has a lot of creativity and downloadable levels.  RE5 if you want a game with a good story, but moves slower than cod.      Personally, if you don't have MGS, get that, because that is the best game out on the PS3|`|PgQui4jNaa	Little Big Planet. You can play endless amounts of levels since you can create your own and play others levels. And it's just a lot of fun!|`|dnTPhqo2aa	World at War. greatest game i own. no lie, you wont be disapointed|`|lQGDV7MEaa	I don't know, you tell me.|`|hjbKQ7IKaa	RESIDENT EVIL 5!!!!!|`|L4gRARNwaa	Wait till Feb 27th and get Killzone 2|`|oM7P6pMgaa	depends on your style, if u liked cod4 get world at war, if your not sure just look at reveiws and decide, i heard little big planet was really good, i don't have a ps3 so i wouldn't know, but i love cod waw for 360
QsCPOHAraa	Well that depends on who's throwing the dart, doesn't it? It's not like you just throw a dart and where it lands depends on mathematical probability... It has all to do with the skill of the dart thrower, and even then it's not a question of probability.|`|gQpoSC6Baa	practice makes perfect !|`|q4Qk8MDjaa	1 out of 256|`|VzJQUCPIaa	For a skilled player, fairly likely.
0IievPCaaa	Wait, you're telling us that you bought a NEW, legit copy of the game, or did you pirate it? Haha. You should have a working serial out of the box. Yes, you need a valid CD key.

Xs3a4oQ4aa	Sony updates it software to crack down on privacy. You need updated exploits and software, check out my source if you want to know more.|`|C7mD5Y3Waa	do you have a custom firmware? If so, then download another copy. games tend to do this often|`|AUCcZ8lQaa	You probably need to update to the latest version of the system firmware.  Do a system update, then try playing again.  If not, then the game file may be corrupted, or it may be a bad memory card.|`|Mqz4ngkXaa	cuz u were probly looking at pornography|`|sHYx1Jpfaa	Because its Illegal to download games that you didn't pay for :)~    You need to do a firmware upgrade can be dangerous doing this though.|`|yMM8yY3daa	Have you gotten you PSP chiped because the standard system cant play downloaded games
oMSafmhTaa	A lot of people have been having problems in Age of Mythology with ESO (the built-in online service). You might be better to try it with GameRanger instead.    GameRanger is a multiplayer online gaming service supporting over 500 games that lets you play online in a friendly community without the hassles of network connection problems.|`|Pa8SpGoiaa	I guess you are using Windows right? well, if you downloaded it from the internet, you will never get to play AoM Online, i did it, and happened to me, i fixed this by buying the game. The only other way that you can play it, apart from the campaign mode, is over a local network, against another pc that is connected to the same network as yours.
AUCcZ8lQaa	On your router, you have a couple of options.  The easiest would be to turn off your firewall completely, or you could enable upnp then turn on your ps3 and your router will automatically open the correct ports.  If that still doesn't work then you may need to get a compatible router.  There should be a list of compatible routers on sony's website.  Some just don't work.
MX0s76pzaa	Same deal here. I'll tell you what works:    - Setting a timed automatic log off/shutdown thing.    - Simply put on a password/change the password so that the kids don't know It.    - Internet games won't be available If you disable Internet. Enable It when you need to use It (8 year olds won't be smart enough to know how to enable It themselves)    - If nothing works - Locking up parts the computer (monitor/keyboard/mouse/powercord - any one of these would work) In a random room/cupboard and keep the key with you at all times.    No 8 year old would know what to do next. Just don't give In when he begs.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	sure...YOU are the parent. TAKE the things out of the house, unplug them or put LOCKS on things. Ever heard the word NO...as in NO YOU CAN'T.|`|1hciyvKdaa	You are the parent, slam down the rules. Take time to do something else with them, give them a strick computer policy. All chores done, all homework done, and you get an hour or whatever works for you.

I know its hard to control kids but it is your job.|`|jJqx6HQlaa	you can set parental controls so they CANT play the games.|`|csGKIic9aa	i aint no parent but i would say make them work or do something before they can play .....make playing on the computer a privilege ....|`|M3maZgdyaa	Take the plug off the computer and let them earn computer time and do it in blocks of time.|`|Gp160xHOaa	You shoud tell them that if they dont listen you are going to take it away from them or restrict them from the computer.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Lock them off the computer|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	hmm did you try a remote control he he|`|kFEx2Bx0aa	Uhh.

(your 8 year old wont find out how to connect it back for quite a long time.|`|vTNWiFPwaa	oh, you cant.  i'm sixteen and once i discovered the computer and videogames, i did not care.      well thats not totally true.  my mom controlled me until i got to highschool and discovered facebook.    ok.  so just make a rule that they can't go on until their hw is done.  don't buy them too many video games (i guess you call them pc games) cuz that'll just make them have less options and they'll get bored with playing a game soon.  ur their mom, if they don't follow the rules, take the disk or put up a password on the computer so ur kid can't play.  also, do NOT let them get a facebook or myspace until they are at least in highschool.  omg,  such a procrastinating tool but i love it.  hopefully you haven't exposed them to online games cuz those rock and he'll just get more addicted.|`|7VnmPYuXaa	Turn it off|`|oM7P6pMgaa	no computer/gaming until after you do your homework.

If you want to get your kids in something different then a computer game then offer some thing else to them like going to the park or go-carting, but if he still plays the game then make him finish his homework and you correct it for errors before he can play the game. And set a limit on how long they can play the game for. That should get him straight. If not then try to be stricter.|`|ZHbDYF1Kaa	ok i am a 13 year old saying this but i know sumwhat how to      if u have a windows vista there is a program to set up a timer on how long you can stay on. so you could say 2 hours a day then it would require a password to continue    try to sign them up in sports like baseball or football    sorry thats all i can think of.    you could also try some hobbies with them|`|lhLGeCrtaa	Hmm...you should try setting them up on a schedule. Like play computer games only on friday nights, saturdays and sunday mornings. They should have a study room, far far away from their computers, maybe their bedrooms, if their computers are in their bedrooms try somewhere else|`|7gHnVJpyaa	You must set some hard rules about this. No gaming unless they have permission from you.    Set up passwords and user accounts for your computer, for each of them. If you do not give them Administrator rights, then they cannot install any software/games that are not already there. (right click on "My computer", select "Manage", and go to Local users and groups > users > right-click on their account and select "properties" - you can use this area to change their user access).|`|tp2y8Aqzaa	Lay down the law, they have to listen to you!|`|wDJbbb2Iaa	Turn your computer off.

Ground them. Limit them.     No games until homework is done. When grades slip, they lose the video games.    Limit them to an hour a day maybe? 2? If they go on anyway, take the keyboard (my mom did that, oh man it pissed me off). You are the adult. They have to listen. Let them have it an hour before bed time so they can go out and play during the day & do homework early.    Catch them when they fake sick to play on the computer.

Your going to have to be able to guess what items will be in demand within the next few days & get it before it's value jumps up. Most merchants these days have lost their shirts & given up.|`|1sEh3nApaa	Im not a mem, so i wont be much help    B bones buy for lowest on G.E. sell them for 350 at varrock bank east one.    Umm...    Cowhides buy for 100, sel for 150, ppl buy this to train crafting, just go to a mem world, it works in both, but mems better      here is a way to save time though.    Need to get to Barbarrian Village Fast?    GO to the hole in the barbarian village and kill minotaurs. they drop a right skull half.    then kill those crikets on the second floor. They drop a part of a staff.    then kill cablepons- they drop another part of the staff.    then on the last floor kill the glowing skeletons lvl 90's drop more easily. They drop left skull half. Comine those together and voila. a Skull Sceptre.  If you right click it, the options are    Equip  Invoke  Divine  Examine  blah blah blah.    Invoke teles u to Barb village  divine tells you how much magic is in the staff. you only get to teleport to barbarian village 3 or 5 times, so use it wisely    oh, the staff is NON MEM!!!!!! HOOOT  P.s. the monsters wont drop the staff parts right away, kill a few then youll get the parts.
AUCcZ8lQaa	My funny answer would be to get an xbox...but hey those get the rrod too.    I would say try another game and play that for a while and see if the same thing happens.  If not, then its the game and not the system.  What may be happening is the data on the hard drive could be corrupted, and since the PS3 loads everything to the hard drive it may be trying to read corrupted data.  i would delete the install file for the game, then try reinstalling it.|`|AA12259461	PSN network doesn't work that well.|`|1sEh3nApaa	GEt it for wii
ZiMkydtHaa	the 8gb may be a bit funny with the m3   i would go for a 4gb card   I use the dstt one better than a m3 http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sk... works out about 12 with the 2gb card and you get free p&p  hope that helps
AA10775575	The Ice Cave  this is a fun little place, you skate around to find your way   out.  The first big ice maze works like this: go in, then Up, Left, Up,   Right, Up, Left, Down, Right, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Right, Down, Right,   Up, Right.  Are you out now? Good! Keep going, you'll find another skating   place, but if you drop the boulders through the holes first using STRENGTH,   you'll have no problems.  If you roll the boulders the wrong way, you can   always reset them by leaving that level then returning.  TM44  Rest is hard   to get to  until you realise that you can jump the ledge bordering the ice!    You just line up your launching point with a rock near the TM, and you'll be   able to slide across to it.|`|9fdceccbb99cad1d9f92e681ee91a7b5aa	i beat that game a long time ago so i dont remember so go to  "gamefaqs.com" for detail help on games|`|AA10927069	u have to use strength on the boulders and put them in the hole so when u slide u stop because of the boulder
