A Masters in Public Administration will get you a managerial position with the government, non-profit, and some private sectors. Gotta know what your interested in though. There are plenty of websites that go over the MPA. <br>  <br>  www.naspaa.org<br>  www.publicservicecareers.org<br>  <br>  These two websites will get you started. Best of luck to you.

LxEAT0XKaa	You look just like the other few thousand applicants to Duke. No doubt you're in the running, but you gotta distinguish yourself more to impress the admissions officers. A 30 on the ACT is probably good enough, but not as good as they would like. Also, you're going to need to have a couple of competitions and contests that you placed first or second or so in the county or region. I'm a junior also. I think grades and courses are good enough, but you will need more, which you can probably accomplish before applications.

EeArGfskaa	Lots of misinformed answerers here.<br>  <br>  yes for the most part they get the same pay rate.<br>  <br>  In fact, some gym teacher will earn more - as they can pick up coaching slots..<br>  <br>  You are thinking about it incorrectly. In education - we have different types of assessments. those big standardized tests arent the "end all" of what we do. Your state has determined that physical education and the arts are an essential component to an educated student. What you have done is noticed a difference in teaching styles.... thats it.<br>  <br>  in academic classes - you are used to *summative* assessments - those are the big tests to see what you know - end of unit tests, end of chapter.. the ones that your math, history and science teachers always seem to love to give. We do this because of many and various reasons - but it is designed to see if you have mastered a set of standards.<br>  <br>  When some teachers want to see your progression of skills - they might implement a *formative* assessment. This is simply designed to help the teacher decide how to teach needed next step skills. Many writing assignments are considered formative - think of the first draft of a paper... its not designed to be used for the final grade - its used to help you with the second and third draft. Physical ed teachers cannot say - play a perfect basketball game and Ill grade you on it. They have to observe and make small changes to help you get better - much like your english teacher and that first draft.<br>  <br>  So rethink your observations and really look at what they are doing - they deserve every penny for what they do - I teach math and science - and I look to *them* to help me get better at what I do. We all need that coaching idea in our classrooms.|`|C5E2liU8aa	They get paid the same for basic teaching of classes. <br>  <br>  Gym teachers usually coach and earn more. <br>  <br>  <br>  School pay is based on a combo of: <br>  Years teaching<br>  years in district <br>  5ish classes<br>  degree type (BA, MA, Phd)<br>  <br>  A first year teacher will recieve the same if they have an MA or MS. A gym teacher usually only has a BA.|`|aqto0hJTaa	Yes, we all get paid the same.  Differences in salary are based on years of experience and education levels.|`|H0LfFGmlaa	Yes and sometimes more|`|iCATP5Uqaa	Teachers get paid according to a scale....amount of education above and beyond the Bachelor's degree gets more money.  Teachers (all) get raises according to years of service. All depends on what the union negotiated for them.  And yes, it varies district to district and state to state.<br>  <br>  Art and gym teachers are real teachers.|`|LSkWap67aa	No<br>  <br>  gym isn't a REAL subject! (according to my mom :p)<br>  <br>  art is a real subject tho|`|ALtOHBC6aa	I think it depends on how the college/school fund Arts and PE.<br>  <br>  But they should do?|`|EmszPrnhaa	they actualy do even thou they shouldn't|`|XkEGLOPpaa	i think so|`|buFDcNBKaa	i dnt kno ask dem|`|67qIs9Efaa	gym teachers get paid less...<br>  <br>  art teachers i am not really sure|`|dGvKF19kaa	At my school, the art and gym teachers get paid the same as any other teacher with an equivalent education level and same years of experience. It is really frustrating to a lot of the core subject teachers when we see how many breaks/downtime the "specials" teachers get throughout their day. It is also really frustrating when it comes time for report cards, and we see that the "specials" teachers are just giving every single child the same generic grade when we are pouring over every test/assignment to make sure we assign a grade that reflects a genuine effort and mastering of skills. I'm trying not to sound bitter, but right now I've been doing my lesson plans for the week for the past two hours.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	It depends more on the supervision and exact arrangements for teaching positions in the school.  Art teachers should be doing the same preparation as other disciplines, but obviously the way their classes look will be different as it is usually necessary to work on the art in class while other disciplines may assign homework.<br>    Gym classes are more complicated because one of the purposes of the teacher is to take legal responsibility for what is going on - following game rules, eliminating unsafe behavior, stopping fights, dealing with injuries, etc. Otherwise it kind of defeats the purpose of gym if you don't let the kids carry out the game/sport/exercise.   Traditionally, gym teachers have been looked down upon as not being academic but the risks of student injury are much higher than for other teachers.|`|lnp5yy3maa	It only seems that way to you because you don't know how much education and work is put into it.<br>  <br>  My brother has a Masters in art and teaches high school art. They have lesson plans and he puts tons of time and energy into his students. It is not "easier" at all. And yes, they make the same as the teachers who teach academic subjects.<br>  <br>  When I was in high school our gym teachers also taught a regular class, like Health or even Chemistry.
ZdIaVkIcaa	1.  At the time Great Britain and France went to war against Germany, Germany had done nothing against the U.S. or it's interests, so I don't blame for waiting, when the U.S. saw what Hitler was trying to do, and got a little push from Japan, we got in it.  Had we not, see answer 2<br>  <br>  2.  Hitler was a genius at military tactics, his only problem was he would listen to his "star gazers" instead of his generals.  If he had listened to Rommel in regards to Normandy, we would all be speaking German.|`|d9329ea0bdca3de02039a3f70fc57a5faa	1. I did think that the US was right at the time. Just imagine what Japan would have done if the US had joined earlier in the war. When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, then it was the right time to start fighting.<br>  <br>  2. The biggest mistake Hitler and Germany probably made was invading the Soviet Union. While it seemed like a good idea at the time to try and Surprise the Soviet Union with an unexpected attack, it was not smart because of all the other countries already against Nazi Germany. The last thing The Germans needed in my opinion was to lose an ally and have another country attempt to attack them.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Take all the math and lab science (bio, chem, physics) you can while also taking the courses you need to get into college - English, history, languages.  In college, major in whatever you want and take the premed classes in bio, chem, physics and math.  Then you've got 4 years of med school and 5 years of residency.|`|UxooffHZaa	Sciences.|`|LxEAT0XKaa	I went into 9th grade thinking I wanted to be a plastic surgeon. What makes me so happy now is that I didn't choose my courses and everything based on that, because now thats not what I want to be. You are not meant to choose an occupation before high school even starts. DOn't choose classes by what you think you want to be. High school courses don't matter much at all if you want to be an Anesthesiologist. DO enough to get into a good college, then in college take Pre-med courses. So my advice summed up is, take any course you want next year. Don't limit yourself to being an Anesthesiologist.
0be940862a3c253f0432eb848850e14aaa	It's okay. Not terrible, but you should really aim for a 25-26. Depending on what college you want to get into, it may need to be even higher.|`|AW7CcCAVaa	didn't your councelors review your results with you? I took the same test and got a 22...23 is a pretty good score but you should probably study a little more on the section/s you did bad in and consider taking courses to help you for when you take the real thing
k7niEeNGaa	You don't need one, you don't help a student with asthma. You ring the office and ask for a nurse/ send the student to the nurse.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Black Cherry is correct. I taught art for 30 years. I kept band-aids, usually colorful ones, in my room and a couple pair of latex gloves. That's it. Everything else, every other problem gets sent to the office. Don't even keep a first aid spray, any medicine etc.|`|9dcd19c7dec39b3d7b8127a4328d3eccaa	I have a basic first aid kit in my classroom.  You can buy one at a local drug store.  If a student is having an asthma attack they usually know before it gets out of hand and I send them to the office. They usually have an inhaler on file.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	As far as first aid goes you really only need band-aids. If the student needs anything other than a band-aid for a small cut like a paper cut, the student needs to be sent to the school nurse. That's what they are there for.<br>  As for helping a student that is having an asthma attack, if they can walk to the nurse, they should be excused from class and sent to the nurses office. If they can't make it there on their own, you should call the nurse to come to the classroom. Any student that knows they have asthma should have a backup inhaler at the nurses office.

They are all mammals and therefore all are warm-blooded, give birth to live young and produce milk.<br>  <br>  2. They are all air breathers and must come to the surface to breathe.<br>  <br>  3. There are 2 different groups of whales, baleen and toothed. Each group gets split into several other smaller groups. If you can't see if they have teeth or not you can just look at their blowhole(s), if it's a baleen whale it will have 2, a toothed whale has just 1!<br>  <br>  4. All whales have blubber to keep them warm in cold temperatures. Of course some have more blubber than others because some live in the arctic while others stick to warmer waters. <br>  <br>  5. All baleen whales eat small crustaceans like plankton and krill, while toothed whales usually eat fish, however some e.g Orcas have hunted things like rays, birds and other whales.<br>  <br>  6. Most whale species are becoming endangered due to whaling, fishing nets, over fishing, captivity etc...basically mankind is killing them all!<br>  <br>  7. Dolphins are porpoises are just small whales.<br>  <br>  Thats all I can think of off the top of my head, so take your pick! ^^

t4DP30r6aa	Private school.. More opportunities|`|bSr3WeXNaa	I have tried both and I prefer Public School. Its is more relaxed and allows for individuality and the ability to see your Friends.|`|HBUO10i7aa	THERE ARE PROS AND CONS FOR BOTH...THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH VAST CURRICULUM AVAILABLE AND SOME GREAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS WITH HIGH END INSTRUCTORS, (AND HIGH PRICES!). I'VE TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS, AND KIDS WILL GET OUT OF IT WHAT THEY WANT TO PUT INTO IT. DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE ON FREE LUNCH OR GO SOME PLACE THAT HAS BLAZERS AND PLEATED SKIRTS! THE HUNGER FOR KNOWLEDGE BY THE INDIVIDUAL PERSON IS THE TIPPING POINT.|`|nkzUaRr8aa	Public, because you don't need to worry about the fees, and I have found many private school girls to be b*tchy and kind of snobby/snooty.<br>  <br>  NOTE: I don't mean to say that ALL private school kids are stuck up or anything, just the ones that I have met seem to be... Give me public teenagers anyday!|`|0b8830a9996850776676a58c9915fb1eaa	public, more freedoms, more socialization (communications)|`|RUuQ3syDaa	public! in a private you are too sheltered and too many trivial rules|`|dC7nixE6aa	public school all they way..you get to have more fun and get to have freedom!|`|AA11746368	Depends.  There are good and bad schools in both categories.  I graduated from public schools, and to be honest, I didn't know how lucky I was to go to one of the good ones.  But now I have my son in a private school because I live in an area where the public schools are not only terrible academically, but they're also dangerous.  Public schools tend to have a larger variety of classes and activities for the kids to participate in, plus they expose kids to different types of people - even those whose parents can't send them to a private school or don't care enough to bother.  <br>  On the other hand, private schools tend to have smaller classes (as a teacher, I can tell you that makes a HUGE difference).  Many of them are seen as "better" by colleges (I recently learned that the school my son attends had three people out of 30 seniors accepted to Vanderbilt last year - while the local public high school had NO ONE accepted.)  And if a student causes a problem at a private school, they can always be kicked out - so there aren't so many problem students.<br>  So I'm not sure if one is "better" than the other - just different depending on the location and such.  In fact, different schools may just be better for different kids.|`|zw323Zbyaa	Honestly, I prefer a public school.  Private schools are good too but I think that by going to a public school (especially a middle school or high school)  you become more independent and realize that life is tough and how to survive in the real world.  Not that private schools don't do this, I just think that public schools are better at it.|`|NuPwR75Jaa	well ive always gone to a public school and there great. And from what i hear about private schools they don't seem as good. Everyones posh and snobby and so are the teachers. Why pay a LOT of money for private schools when public schools are just as good?

SLFt8eHEaa	Of course you will!  London isn't some small town in the American Mid-West you know (!), it's a sprawling city which is one of the most multicultural places in the world (even more so than somewhere like New York in my opinion).  We have people from virtually every country in the world here and so being an American will be nothing new.  We certainly don't hate Americans, although we don't have time for the stereotypical 'ugly Americans' and so if you start claiming that the US is the best country in the world and that we all secretly want to be Americans you might find people sniggering at you.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of good universities (we never refer to universities as school over here; school is purely something that kids go to).  The main ones are University College London (UCL), the London School of Economics, Imperial College and King's College.  It's probably best that you have a look around their websites so you can get a feel as to which one suits you and your course requirements the best.

fhR3MSbmaa	It's from Romeo and Juliet. It should end with "..do what he dare." Closing their hands with holy words means marrying them. Romeo's saying that he doesn't care what happens, even being killed, if they can only be married first.
NBnuL73Eaa	Juliet is an unusually strong character for the period (though not necessarily so for Shakespeare) especially given her age.  This is her story (think of the closing lines never was there a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo) - Juliet and HER Romeo). Juliet is intelligent and strong-willed - she suggests marriage, lets Romeo kiss her. She is willing to defy her father's wish to marry Paris (which is important because Juliet was dependant on her father for wealth and status), she willing to deceive and undertake a desperate act to avoid marriage.<br>  <br>  Her decision to commit suicide is also indicative of a character strength that was unusual for the period. She is not a traditional tragic figure from classical Roman or Greek literature but (at the time) a modern 13 year old girl who is at the centre of this play and who willingly takes her own life.

Take a look at this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wilderdom.com/intelligence/IQWhatScoresMean.html" rel="nofollow">http://wilderdom.com/intelligence/IQWhat...</a>|`|W1xs3vYBaa	You need to get tested by a professional to actually get an IQ score. Online tests, even those associated with a society, are not accurate. I've looked at this test, since it is spammed all over here, and it is not an accurate assessment of a person's IQ. It isn't even decent. It tests too much arbitrary knowledge to be valid. <br>  <br>  If you are interested in your IQ go to you local high school and ask them for the contact numbers for professional IQ test administrators. Any score your receive from an online source cannot be considered valid.|`|JVhXuu9qaa	It's very good indeed- in fact pretty well off the scale, which generally ends at 130.  But be warned:  tests have shown over many years that IQ is not linked to other assessments of ability, wherther spatial, artistic, mathematical, scientific:  or being able to play football well for that matter.<br>  It means you're smart.  It doesn't mean you're going to be a high achiever:  that requires work and application as well!!  But it does mean that with hard work and application you are capable of becoming a high acheiver.  So go for it!|`|t4DP30r6aa	Good.. Average is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. So you are more than 2 standard deviations above the mean which is pretty huge.

OSzHAr8uaa	I believe abortion is wrong so I don't have any pros but I can supply a few cons:<br>  <br>  Its killing an innocent child! <br>  <br>  If an unborn baby had been killed along with the mother in a car wreck, the person who caused the car wreck would more than likely be charged with double murder even though the baby hadn't been born yet. So doesn't this contradict abortion. A child is being killed in both areas, except one is an accident and is charged with murder, while the other killed the unborn baby on purpose but goes free and suffers no consequences from the government.|`|886211ea2fdb56df4ef99f287f4a6884aa	Pros: not being pregnant while still a teen. <br>  Cons: killing a innocent unborn child is unethical. <br>  complications while having the abortion. <br>  check out these sites. it should help you|`|oGc617Ppaa	Pros: <br>  1: The planet is, by far, overpopulated.<br>  2: In some instances the mothers life could be in peril if a 'problem pregnancy' is not aborted.<br>  3: If its to a poor family it could end up being a burden to the taxpayers.<br>  4: Could end up in an adoption center and may never find a loving home.<br>  5: People who are 'forced' into parenthood dont always care enough to be a good parent.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  1: Against some religious beliefs.<br>  2: Complications from an abortion.<br>  3: (Depending on when you consider life to begin) Is murder.<br>  4:  This last resort is used too often with pregnancy being very preventable.|`|9nmkoJgYaa	Pros: Are free clinics where you can nip it in the bud.

d3c054109cf626de0b868751662b1b40aa	It's an adjective that comes from the name of an Italian political statesman during the Renaissance---Niccolo Machiavelli. He wrote a treatise called "The Prince" where he advocated "the ends justify the means" (a ruler should use any means necessary, moral or immoral, to maintain his power).<br>  <br>  So the word "Machiavellian" means:<br>  <br>  -The belief that a ruler can use any means to stay in power. <br>  <br>  -Also: Relating to trickery or dishonesty; suggestive of or characterized by expediency, deceit, and cunning.<br>  <br>  Example: <br>  "The ruler used Machiavellian tactics to stay in power and remain wealthy."|`|eca735eb563a6a25bedeef0050127389aa	To be machievellian one must be an excellent judge of character and clever and treacherous enough to know when and how to manipulate others without having the others realize they are being manipulated until it is too late to oppose it.<br>  Being scheming, shrewd, cunning, and unscrupulous are attributes.<br>  Machievelli wrote the book The Prince which was a book of rules on how to rule others for the Medicis who then controlled  Florence.

In alchemy the lily symbolized the female principle and it has also symbolized the fertility of the Earth Goddess. The white lily is said to have come from the milk of the goddess Hera, and the fertility implied by this caused it to be a popular decorative motif in Greece, the Middle East, and Egypt. Once you reached Byzantium, the lily symbolized prosperity and royalty. Some say this is where the fleur-de-lys (flower of the lily) gained its nobility.

FLgDn3OTaa	Yes. This can be explained by a number of factors.<br>  <br>  Poor health care and huge numbers of patients to every doctor. Most of the population is rural so doctors have to travel large distances to reach their patients- immediate assistance is difficult when someone is ill, decreasing the chances of survival. Roads are poor due to unreliable climate, and are blocked off by floods, making this even harder. Few people are qualified and can read and write, so the employment rate is very low, people do not have enough money for essentials. Water is of poor quality, with few pipes or clean toilets. The population are dependent on the climate for growing crops and this is often unreliable, resulting in crop failure, so many people starve. The ever growing population means not enough food can be produced.

AA10331753	Logos, as you know, is logic (mainly). So, just make believe that you are Spock from Star Trek. You convince by building a logical proof rather than appealing to emotions (Pathos) or your fine character (Ethos).<br>  <br>  You could argue from definition: You have been a good girlfriend. A good girlfriend is one who is loyal, helpful, and affectionate. You could come up with at least one instance of when you were each. For instance, when his best friend made a pass at you, you just ignored the guy. When he needed help with math, you tutored him. And, when he was depressed you took time from your busy schedule to cuddle with him. Having done all that, you satisfy the definition of a good girlfriend and therefore he should take you back.<br>  <br>  Your could make an argument from principle. The principle could be something like a person becomes like the people he hangs out with (major premise).  You are a good person and your friends are nice too(minor premise). Therefore, by hanging out with you he will become a better person than by hanging out with other girls who have lower character but might offer more of things that would drag him down. Therefore you are his best choice of a girlfriend and he should take you back.<br>  <br>  You could make an argument from cause and effect. A guy's reputation is caused in the minds of others by the girl he has on his arm. A beautiful, smart girl makes the guy she is with the envy of his classmates. You have a reputation as a trophy girlfriend . Therefore, your presence would increase his status (social rank) in the class better than any other girl. He should return to you because he has the most to gain in status from you as his girl.<br>  <br>  Obviously, if you have to stick to the absolute truth, the assignment would be a difficult one.  By being absolutely outrageous in your proof, you would become an intentional laughingstock, which beats the heck out of making claims about yourself that classmates dispute and may become bitter about. Remember, everyone likes to be entertained--even poor old English teachers laboring into the middle of the night, reading your compositions.<br>  <br>  But, if you wish to stick to the whole truth and nothing but the truth..., substitute in the facts about you. In any case, the Logos remains the same. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Hope this helped.

GGJhrEOyaa	Ha Ha brain fart XD<br>  <br>  Dont combine them.<br>  Think that 5 is in 20.<br>  <br>  20+80=100
uUW7rbCUaa	Ooh, I like substitution.  I won't give you all the answers but I'll try to explain how to do this stuff (This looks like a lot but I think It'll help). Substitution is basically exactly as it sounds.  You substitute for variables (ex. x, y, z).  The point for substitution is to make ONE problem so it puts the variable by itself on one side.  For the first question, <br>  1.) 3X-4Y=4     <br>        X+2Y=8   It would be easier to use X+2Y=8 and isolate the X.  In order to isolate the X you must get rid of the 2Y.  To do this you subtract 2Y from the left of the equal sign and do the same thing to the other side so you are left with: X = 8 -- 2Y <br>  Now you know what X equals so you substitute the (8-2Y) into where the X is in the first equation:  3 ( 8 -- 2Y) -- 4Y = 4<br>  Now you can solve.  You first distribute the 3 to the 8 and the --2Y so it comes out as: 24 [(3*8)] -- 6Y [(3*2Y)] -- 4Y = 4.  <br>  24-6Y-4Y=4    Now you must combine like terms.  --6Y and --4Y are like terms.  So to combine them will give --10Y, making the equation: 24 -- 10Y = 4   Now you want to isolate the Y variable.  To do this, you must subtract the 24 from both sides because 24 is positive which gives us:  --10Y= --20.   Now you must divide the -10Y by -10 on both sides to finally get the y by itself:  Y= -20/-10  which equals:  Y=2.  So, now that you have Y, you must plug the answer back into one of the two equations to find the answer to X.  I will do that for the second equation:  X + 2(2) = 8.   2*2 is 4, so X+4 = 8.  Then you must subtract the 4 from each side.  So the final answer is X=4, Y=2 or (4,2)  <br>  Try that for # 2 and compare it with my answer: X=2, Y= --2 or (2, --2)<br>  Hope that helps.  Happy homeworking.

He appeals to the senses (touch, smell, sight and sound) as he describes evocatively what he's experiencing.<br>  Even the first description of the enemy (in the third stanza) has a certain beauty to it - the soldiers must be on horseback and the overwhelming impression is of undless lines of "silver and blue horses" as they approach.<br>  He cannot hear them - he can only hear the sounds of nature and to his heightened awareness even the flutter of a little finch's wings is loud. <br>  He knows what he's supposed to do. He's meant to shoot at this beautiful, silvery column as it passes - but he can't. He's too immersed in the beauty of nature to allow the madness of war to intrude. It is a very beautiful poem which manages to show the effects of war on the soul of a sensitive, poetic soldier. He does not want to kill what he sees to be part of this wonderful atumnal scene.

If I had no spacesuit I'd either be burning or freezing depending on which side of the moon I am on.  That and I would be suffocating due to the lack of atmosphere.  In fact I probably would be dying because my blood would be "boiling" due to the lack of any atmospheric pressure.

3faz90KDaa	In American history, the Gilded Age refers to major growth in population in the United States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era, in the late 19th century (1870-1890). The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion. The businessmen of the Second Industrial Revolution created industrial towns and cities in the Northeast with new factories, and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial working class which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich industrialists and financiers such as Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Flagler, and J.P. Morgan. Their critics called them "robber barons", referring to their use of overpowering and sometimes unethical financial manipulations. There was a small, growing labor union movement, led in part by Samuel Gompers, who created the American Federation of Labor (AFL), founded in 1886. It featured very close contests between the Republicans and Democrats, with occasional third parties. Nearly all the eligible men were political partisans and voter turnout often exceeded 90% in some states.|`|ATpKrr2Oaa	read this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/Gilded~1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/Gilded~...</a>|`|L8TdPM0yaa	Why dont you stop talking?<br>  No one cares about YOUR NEEDS!

c2wXk6ntaa	i am a 12th grade teacher and i don't see any mistakes|`|XSPTQqAzaa	In the past I have exerted much of my negative energy into unusual, and not-like me actions. This as you know has resulted in my bad behaviors, which is dis-respectful, uncaring, irresponsible, and the list goes on. Yes I do have explanations and ways to explain the situation, but that's beside the point. The point is that I'm capable of ways to prevent these situations from happening. Every time it seems that I have a new excuse someone else to blame. Up until now I have not  taken constructive criticism constructively. To me its been hard listening to people that just point out all your flaws. What I now understand is that I just need to take the advice and learn from it. If not now, then when will I ever learn? <br>  I have upon recently figured out who the person is that is destroying my life. Just causing me all this pain and ill will that has been resulting in my head hanging low. It's like this person is inside my head controlling all my actions, making throw in the towel, and giving up. That person was this negative energy in me that wasn't allowing me to put in all my best effort, half *** work that no one benefit ted from. This person everyone saw was me. I was in complete and total control of my actions, but it was this negative energy inside me that made it so i was not able to think through my thoughts. With this I was fishing in the mouth of Poseidon. Meaning I was asking for a beating, cruising for a bruising. <br>  If I could say anything about my family it would be that no matter what they are always there for me, helping me out, and challenging me to meet my goals. My goals in life right now are to finish high school in the top of my class, and to succeed in everything I put my all in. This in the long run will put me in the right position to successfully enter a college or university of my choice. The dream is to go to college and do great things. Daily I when I wake up I have to choose to love myself or else I am giving up the right of myself to do my best. With these daily routines, long-short term goals, and my dreams I will without a doubt create my own destiny and make sure it's everything I want. <br>  Life is hard enough and it's even harder with no sense of direction. The only way I can prevent these festivals of punishment is to work with my family as one, one team, one heart. Singly I am nothing, just a kid with ideas and no sense of direction, but together, we all can accomplish great things. I am very superficial by myself, with the knowledge of us all we can find the deeper meaning. I very much look forward to these great things and WORKING TOGETHER with each other, sorting out all the problems we may face.

Xr7NvDP8aa	Aphrodite!!<br>  <br>  In Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty and sexual rapture.From the aphros ("sea foam") arose Aphrodite, and the sea carried her to either Cyprus or Cythera. After her birth, Zeus was afraid that the gods would fight over Aphrodite's hand in marriage so he married her off to the smith god Hephaestus, the steadiest of the gods. He could hardly believe his good luck and used all his skills to make the most lavish jewels for her. He made her a girdle of finely wrought gold and wove magic into the filigree work. That was not very wise of him, for when she wore her magic girdle no one could resist her, and she was all too irresistible already. She loved gaiety and glamor and was not at all pleased at being the wife of sooty, hard-working Hephaestus. Aphrodite loved and was loved by many gods and mortals.

All the daunting looks given to her by passing teenagers, the loud and monkeyish crowds at the bus stop, and the ever-growing bustle of people busily making their way to work, without a glance back as they humbled along cheerily, with no concern to the pensioner who could barely walk a few hundred metres behind them without tiring out. And this wasn't even the worst of it. This was only a trip to the post office.|`|LkuaUDKBaa	I am a lady pensioner, with arthritis. For the past few years I made the weekly trip to my local post  office, in order to cash my pension book. It was an enjoyable outing, I would take my shopping trolley, cash my pension and meet friends and neighbours in the queue, to exchange local news and views, and put the world to rights.Then a few of us would go into the little cafe at the top of the street for a cup of tea and a cake, (quite a nice little treat for someone such as myself on a small pension.) We could while away an hour chatting, and comparing our week, in the comparitive warmth and knowing that for a short time there would be no need to worry about the price of switching on the heating. Now, however, our local postoffice like so many others has been closed down. In order to cash my pension I would need to walk about half a mile to the village  centre, to catch a bus into the local market town, several miles away. Because of my arthritic knees I cannot walk so far, and the bus ride is an adventure too far, even with my free bus pass. Now I rely on my family to fetch my money, and pay my bills, bring my shopping, and generally see to all my needs. It makes me feel old and useless, and very sad because I cannot meet my friends as I used to do, and I miss their company. As I go out less and less my ability to walk becomes ever more weak, and soon I shall be entirely housebound, and I dread the long winter days, and nights, and sometimes I wish that my life was over.|`|9XTfoMlPaa	what do you mean?<br>  like describe the sights and smells and noises that you would hear on a walk. make it through a park and you can describe other people in te park.

I2Tw4zOAaa	1. c. Equilateral Triangles- They're always similar because it has strict definitions.  You cannot draw an equilateral triangle to look different than any others.  All you can do is change the size or rotate it.  It will always have equal sides and all the interior angles will be 60 deg.<br>  <br>  2. a. 39  if you add up all the original measurements they equal 30.  Since the perimeter is multiplied by three you just multiply each component by three.  13x3=39.<br>  <br>  3. d. A rhombus does not.  Here's an example of a rhombus and its diagonals. You'll see that they are not the same length. <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/ks3bitesize/maths/shape_and_space/images/shape_2.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/ks3bitesize...</a><br>  <br>  4. b. Isosceles.  Since each side is the same length you are assured that their midpoints splits the sides into equal parts.  When you connect two of the halves of each side you know that the halves are the same, but you don't know if the line connecting them is the same length as the halves.|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	1) C... similar means that all sides will be proprotional and angles will be congruent. so, and equilateral triangle will always have 60 degree andles since all angles are the same, and all sides will be the same length. <br>  <br>  2) A... set up a proportion. put the longest side of the first triangle(13) over the perimeter of the triangle (5+12+13= 30). then set that equal to x over the perimeter of the other triangle (90).<br>  it should look like.... <br>               13    x<br>               --- = --- <br>                30   90<br>  then cross multiply to find x.<br>  <br>  3) C... process of elimination... squares angles are all always 90 degrees, and same for rectangles. and rhombus will have the same angles diagonal from each other... just draw one and look.<br>  <br>  4) tough one... not sure but i know it's not D or A. <br>  <br>  I hope i helped a little! good luck!|`|k5tRK9Y9aa	1. Equilateral triangles are always similar.<br>  <br>  Explanation: Because they are equilateral, their side lengths must all be one given number. Because of this, equilateral triangles' angles have a unique measure.

Isosceles trapezoid, if I had to guess.<br>  <br>  Explanation: Rhombuses have 4 sides equivalent in length, as do rhombuses. Rectangles are symmetric.

Something like, "Hercules takes Pompeii in two nothing sweep.Pliny family visibly shaken."<br>  The two nothing refers to the two phases of the eruption and the Pliny family refers to a kid named Pliny and his uncle, who witnessed the eruption and tried to rescue survivors.

They guys who worked in the mine.. well some of them will feel terrible and like they are slaves.. others will be saying I'm so glad to have this job.  So no, not all diamonds bring misery.

Her interest, experience, and research on cataracts lead to her invention of a new device and method to remove cataracts—the laserphaco probe. When she first conceived of the device in 1981, her idea was more advanced than the technology available at the time. It took her nearly five years to complete the research and testing needed to make it work and apply for a patent. Today the device is use worldwide. With the kerato prosthesis device, Dr. Bath was able to recover the sight of several individuals who had been blind for over 30 years.<br>  hsj

EOZsYlZkaa	I think there is a problem with the question. You are being asked to find the lengths of 2 sides of a triangle with only 1 known variable (the base = 3 ft). The formula for finding the length of 1 side when the lengths of 2 sides are known is the square root of A squared times B squared. You can approximate it however and check the work. <br>   If it were broken at 6 ft, then the length of the hypotenuse would be 6.5', and the stalk is only 12 ft. The answer is somewhere between 5.6 and 5.7 ft., with the hypotenuse being 6.35 and 6.44 respectively.|`|3dUam68aaa	1ft?|`|AA10232635	12 ft <br>  divided by 3 <br>  ___________<br>  4

Your best bet is someone taking this NOW, but chances are slim..hey!

He also talks of how his time is soon near to walk the shadows of the earth forever, or something like this.

"Fair is foul and foul is fair"- the central paradox of the play. Basically, everything relates back to it. The witches are setting up the idea that 'nothing is as it seems'.

Foreshadowing is not necessary to mention in this scene.  I have not read it in over 20 years, but I can tell you distinctly from memory that what makes this scence perfect is its heavy use of the supernatural as the driving force behind the scenes.  The whole play is framed start and finish with the 3 witches.  And if you pay close attention to what develops in the play, it is as if they are directly responsible for influencing the actions of the characters.  Shakespeare used the supernatural frequently, as in Hamlet.  It was a feature of Elizabethan society in that most people believed in spirits and witchcraft, etc. in the sense that they believed it was real.  The three witches are seen basically casting a spell, and the along comes Macbeth, and he listens to the things that they tell him regarding his future.  Because he listens to them, he is hooked into their spell and as a believer in his destiny as delivered to him becomes like a pawn in their game.  Of course the mood that all of this creates is one of darkness.  The supernatural elements are what frame the whole story. These supernatural elements are spooky, and there is a palpable feeling throughout the whole play that the nightmarish world of the demonic is somehow manipulating and controlling the players, most especially Macbeth and his wife, because they believe the witches.  This is perhaps the most important element.  If you look in the book of Leviticus in the Bible, it expressly forbids the Hebrews from seeking advice or listening to people like those witches.  Why?   Because when you believe what they say, that is an act of faith on your part, and you becomes susceptible to the power of the demonic realm over your life, which always leads to trouble if not destruction.  In Macbeth's case, his willingness to participate in wickedness to advance his ambition is a sign that he is already wholly given over to the plan and the hex of the witches on his life.  I don't need to quote, that is your job.  But keep in mind that the witches are the Maquina Infernal of the play.  That is a Cocteau image, but it hails back to Greek tragedy, and it basically says that the gods control men's actions from on high as if they are puppetmasters manipulating their every move.  Keep that in mind when you write the essay, and you can't go wrong.

With the sequel, Twain took a different approach rather than the comical, boyish tone of Tom Sawyer. He used it as an opportunity to exposes the problems he had seen with society using one of the most powerful methods available to a writer: irony. The technique gave Mark Twain much flexibility in his writing. It was a subtle yet powerful way of expression; critical social commentary enveloped in whimsical humor. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn amuses the reader while expressing a powerful message about society.<br>  <br>  Using irony, Twain has created an entire novel that satirizes the foolishness he noticed about society. One wrong he saw with society was that man could be so cruel and inhumane to his fellow man. Take the irony that surrounds the situation at the Phelps' farm. The Phelps' were good-natured Christians whom were taught by society that slavery was morally right. Therefore, Jim is treated accordingly and locked up in a shed for running away.

dgQ4MciGaa	First off, take a quick peek at the site Renae gave you.<br>  <br>  I'll wait.<br>  <br>  Doesn't seem all that big a deal, does it?  But consider the setting, and the time, in which this play was performed:  The Globe Theatre in London circa the late 16th. century (about 1595 if memory serves).  The Globe was a circular wooden structure with the stage and the 'penny gallery' open to the elements.  The 'penny gallery' was just that, a place for people who paid a penny (pence, ha'pence, etc) to STAND and watch the play.<br>  <br>  This was a ROWDY bunch!  Cut-purses (pickpockets), whore mongers (pimps), the ladies being 'mongered' (ho's), gin sellers (EVERYONE in the 'gallery' was drunk on their... 'throne cushions') AND PROFESSIONAL HECKLERS sent by rival Theatre Companys to spoil the show.  It really was an exciting time.<br>  <br>  This was a problem that most all playwrights faced: How to get THIS crowd to settle down?  The short answer is SPECTACLE!  Put something/someone on stage so engaging, so SPECTACULAR, everyone will drop what (or who) they are doing and pay attention!<br>  Examples of such 'spectacle' include the 'witches' in the opening of Macbeth and the mishapen King Richard in the opening of Richard III.<br>  <br>  Seque back to your livingroom for a nonce ((a moment)... I'm really getting into this)) and think of a time when the program you were watching was interrupted by "Breaking News" or ""Special Announcement".  Usually something about Brittany?Paris?Lindsay? and a 'strategic lack of undergarmentry".  Point is, you stopped what you were doing and PAID ATTENTION!<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, back at the Globe, the miscreants in the 'gallery' suddenly get the Elizabethan equivalent of "Breaking News".  Two wealthy and powerful Families, the House of Montegue (Romeo's peeps) and the House of Capulet (Juliet's clan) are going to meet head on in a 'WWF Smackdown'.  Film at 11!<br>  <br>  Just about everyone was familiar with the story of "Romeo and Juliet" back then, just as everyone today is familiar (all too, if you ask me) with Branjalina, K'Fed, Brittany, Paris, J Lo, Jen, and Ben.  It was one of the favorite 'soap operas' of the time.  This 'announcement' that the two Houses are going mix it up' is the same as if you suddenly heard on TV that 'the Lohans were gonna shoot it out with the Hiltons'.<br>  <br>  The point is, it was exciting news and EVERYONE PAID ATTENTION!<br>  <br>  After all, that's what Prologues and "Breaking News" flashes are supposed to do.<br>  <br>  skep, who interrupts <br>  your regular Q&A with this "Breaking Wind"!<br>  FLASH!!! Two teenagers, Romeo Montegue, 14, and Juliet Capulet, age 13, have stolen a white Chevy Bronco and are being perused by police on the north bound 405 Interstate!  Their families refuse to be interviewed but a priest close to the young couple, who doesnt want to be identified because he may have a deal with The National Enquirer, says the two lovers may be heading to the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas.<br>  <br>  In an unrelated yet just as tawdry story, Brittany Spears 'dropped trou' on the Tea Cup ride at Disneyland.

fYcYPyR3aa	This is ridiculous, when I was that age I probably called people poo head all the time and it was fine, it's just something you call other kids when you are little but nowadays everyone jumps on the PC bandwagon, of course it's not racist but people don't want to be accused of tolerating racism so they take something innocent and punish whoever said it even if it's a 9 year old kid! If anyone was racist it was the headmaster who linked poo with the colour of skin.|`|M355qZK5aa	i think that some people need to take a chill pill. this is why some people feel the erge to shoot dumb people to cleanse the earth<br>  <br>  now my little rant it over, my opinion of this is that the headteacher was in the wrong, i got away with much worse at school (just left) and i mean i little kid of that age is not going to understand racism of he was guilty or not. i myself do not find the term poo head to be insulting.|`|G2S539eYaa	It is 100% rasist. Yepp no doubt about it. There is no way he was acting like a kid and said "Poo-head" because he wanted his toy. Nope he is definately racist. I'm suprised you even had to ask if he is rasist or not when he clearly is. Yepp he should be suspended for a week.|`|aY6EjDwjaa	lols no not raceist<br>  its like sh!t head/ shitforbrains.<br>  though if the kid shows some blatently raceist attitude id personally slap that asshat<br>  but as a teacher thats not quite the best plan. so just detention him or something you know what to do :P|`|YuWLcExJaa	I remember seeing it in Poltergeist the horror movie from the 80's.

The headmaster is more guilty of racism than the kid! He obviously assumes that coloured people are poo coloured!!

If you think of a truly racist comment, like Paki and the child said 'Paki Poo Head' then I would feel differently.  But it would be the 'Paki' I objected to rather than the Poo Head.  Kids say worse than that to each other day and daily.  The situation borders or lunacy.|`|dtXzOGoKaa	no definitly not racism. i dont tolarate racism at all but this is not a case for racism, and if it was a boy of 5 he cant be blamed for this but the parents x|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	poo head is the same as sh*t head.  how this could be considered race related i don't know.|`|Q7Sy9Cnraa	Hm mm, Chris,...that's interesting.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't call it Racist par-say,..but he is having a dig at the boy,..by bringing in his colour when there is know need to.<br>  <br>  Just ask the other Child for you're toy back,..there's never any need to bring in Race etc etc as that's were it gets very complex!<br>  <br>  These days everyone is scared to say anything that remotely comes across as racist,...the lines are blurring it seems. And  not everyone is sure of what is suitable to say or not!<br>  <br>  The Boy who said that would get a clip around the ear hole and a bit of a telling off,..nothing more.<br>  <br>  I would find out also,..where he's learning all this language from, His Parents/Guardians perhaps?

That's funny!|`|ibOD8ggDaa	to cute|`|0mcvCOfyaa	Some people aren't as smart as you, so they need to have the "day" part. Also it helps little kids understand better, and some of the words like Fri sounds like fry and Tues sound like two's. Without the "day" we would be lost!|`|OdovbvSYaa	never underestimate how many stupid people there are in the world. best to leave the "day" at the end so theres no confusion!|`|fKKcrT8Maa	I would say they all end with day because whoever named them wasn't very creative.|`|b6d429b7c23a1fc4d1e4fa1657d4b9cbaa	To remind people that they are DAYS.|`|g5jAQc8Xaa	Maybe so they don't get confused with anything else.|`|fMllzc6laa	I guess it has always been this way. they all meant something maybe(sunday was sunny)|`|DKieKSnfaa	cause theyk feel like it.|`|pNeakgzlaa	Well, 'cause they're days.  You need to realize that before you ask a question like this, but the words all probably come from some other language and is the root of the word meaning first second third blah blah blah.  But maybe not.  Otherwise it would be like... Different.  Well, you're not going to change the English language, so you're gonna have to live with it.  All the days of the week end with day.|`|F2qPNDpiaa	Because a particular Day was assigned to a particular God....eg. God of the Moon (mon)Day, The Norse God Twi (tue)Day, The Norse God Woden (wodens) Day, The Norse God Thor (thor's)Day,The Norse God,Freyr(Freyr's)Day, The God Saturn,(Saturn's) Day and The God of the Sun(Sun's)Day. It is odd...if you notice, most of the week days are named in honour of Norse Gods and the months are named mostly after Roman Gods.|`|45719b3d3ad274a0fde7f2081625f937aa	Yes.  That would sound weird.  Yes. It is obvious they are days.  However, Americans are paid by the syllable, so knocking off those "days" would definitely cost us.  Wait...are we really paid by the syllable?|`|1S2dDfXuaa	Well obviously because their "Days" haha <br>  <br>  :]|`|lDD9QKMIaa	Yea I have no idea why. Maybe its like when people say your shirt is red when you already know it. Its like a captain obvious thing|`|HurAky2raa	I think its heavily based on a mixture between astrology and Greek mythology.|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	yeah but if you took the 'day' off of the end of all of them it wouldn't be obvious that they're all days!|`|dc28f7eb32b79cb5f2dcd5a1121104b7aa	Thats just how its been!

For example (these are the ones I know), Thursday is the god Thor's day, Saturday is the god Saturn's day, Sunday is the Sun's day, and Monday is the moon's day.|`|479GOa7Oaa	because they are all days but to distinguish one from another they all have different prefixes.|`|QpkeD39haa	Because they're days|`|JOot3EHNaa	because they are days!!

tCsFxh5Aaa	Since a number of the absences are not excused, there are a couple of things that might happen to you.  In addition to not getting credit and having to repeat the classes, the school might start a truancy investigation.  This means that you (and your parents) might have to go to court and face possible fines and/ or jail time.  If  the principal is calling you in regularly to speak about this, he sees it as a big problem and is probably leading up to filing a truancy case.<br>  <br>  If you are legitimately sick that often, you need to make sure that you bring in the necessary paperwork to get each absence excused.  <br>  <br>  You might also want to look into other options.  If you are out long-term due to a serious illness, home-bound instruction might be an option.  If not, you might want to consider being homeschooled--then you can work at your own schedule, taking sick time off as needed without it disrupting your whole schedule.  <br>  <br>  If you are a "health freak", you might need to see a counselor to see if this is some issue that is out of control, that you need help in addressing.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	(1) They make you repeat the year all over.<br>  <br>  (2) You miss learning things you should, later education is based on things you missed, and the rest of your education/life is "damaged" because you missed when polynomials were covered, etc.|`|UAT38kYzaa	at our school (it might be different depending on states...) but if you get more than 5 or so absences in a semester then you have to do extra hours, which may be saturday school or during a holiday you have to come up and help clean or something. But you might have summer school and at worst you could get held back.|`|0WASp0bHaa	If you are ill then you should be able to get a doctors note. You if keep getting ill you should have your doctor write or talk to your school. You have 10 unexcused, if you were not sick then, then why were you not at school. Your parents should be involved in this.|`|RVUYBxhnaa	Well i didn't know where abouts you live. In the US, i think they make you re do the year you've just taken? Not sure, but i know here in England the worst that could happen is that you miss vital information from lessons and that when you apply for college, they wont accept you. Those with a really high absence level are generally overlooked by high class respected collages, however at the end of the day, the grades are more important, so as long as you catch up on your work whilst your ill and revise thoroughly, i see no problem :)

LsAArkUyaa	Sometimes I don't know whether to laugh or cry at some of the comments we get here. My favorite of course has to be the social comments. Then when I point out all the homeschool activities my kids participate in I am told we are the exception to the rule. Funny thing is how these people completely miss the point that my children attend these homeschool events with hundreds of other homeschoolers.<br>  <br>  The second most irritating is those who assume that homeschooling can't go to college and are academically behind those in public school. Both assumptions can  be easily disproved with a simple internet search.<br>  <br>  Up there in my top pet peeves is those who use  "well I know one homeschooler who...." to attack homeschooling.<br>  When I point out all those who are failed by public school, or abused by a teacher, or deemed weird by their friends etc  I am told I a getting off the subject.|`|Qxh1kPLfaa	I run into those assumptions all the time.  <br>  <br>  I have recently had one who is a certified teacher blame my 2 kids autism on the fact that I homeschool them.   I wanted to say to him that "teachers like you are exactly why my kids are not in public school".  They are monitored closely by autism specialists who are all excited about their progress.  Yet, we get this nut job and his crazy sidekick who sees the few autistic quirks that they haven't overcome yet and blames it all on me and homeschooling.  Every specialist we have been to has said they would not have made this progress in the average public school setting.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	When people don't have the facts or even experienced homeschooling, they base their decisions on hearsay or their OWN opinions.<br>  Homeschooling isn't the 'norm' and when if something isn't the 'norm', it must not be good.<br>  Homeschoolers lack social skills, are slow learners, can't adjust to public school, and are dumb. All comments I hear from the ignorance of others. REALLY?<br>  My daughter who happens to homeschool has tons of friends, is very well socialized, very intelligent, and is graduating a year early. Hmmm.|`|PIeSyhfkaa	I run into that both online and in real life, and I haven't even started homeschooling yet! My daughter is one month old, my husband and I decided we will homeschool before she was even conceived because we really care about the education and social upbringing of our child and feel that public school is lacking these days both academically and socially. <br>  <br>  I think that if people knew more about homeschooling and knew the facts and statistics, they would not be so ignorant. If I would not be educated about it, quite possible that I would be ignorant too and would put my kids in public school just like everyone else without questioning it. <br>  <br>  By the way - a great book that put me over the edge on the decision to homeschool - John Gatto's Underground History of American Education.|`|SATTX6egaa	Oh yeah. Of course. I am a home schooled and I get that from people all the time. It does get frustrating but I just have to let it go and understand that they're just ignorant about homeschooling. People seem to think that you can't learn without a certified teacher with you all the time. I have teachers I can contact with questions because I go to a virtual school but I don't need to ask them much. I am a self starter and self motivator so I basically teach myself. The school just tells me what I need to read and what tests, quizzes, projects, papers I need to do or take and I do them and sent them in for a teacher to grade. And I'm doing great. People just don't understand. Well, some of us do!|`|K0FabRAIaa	In my small rural area, most people seem to be very supportive and interested in homeschooling. I even had someone ask me if I would homeschool her grandson the other day..... <br>  <br>  I have noticed there does seem to be a lot of preconceived, yet incorrect, ideas on here.|`|5mS41lBXaa	I do run into ignorant people of these type. At first I felt compelled to explain myself and defend what I was choosing for our family, now I feel very different. I usually just express my gratitude of freedom to make that decision for my family and just go about my business.<br>  <br>  Everyone has the right to handle the situation however they so desire, but I despise the fact that we as homeschoolers feel somewhat *expected* or even required to defend what we do and prove that we are capable of doing it.<br>  <br>  If people really looked into what was going on behind closed doors at school, what is being taught and who is doing the teaching, they would be shocked. They would be shocked to find out that they LOVE getting special needs children because their income/program availability just went up. Most school teachers are not even teaching in a field they have a degree for. <br>  <br>  The cracks continue to get bigger and bigger and it's only a matter of time before public schooling is deemed *unsuccessful* and becomes a thing of the past. <br>  <br>  Whenever faced with the ever so popular *I know this one homeschooler who_________*, I remark by saying, "Well, I know a whole lot of public schooled children who_____!"|`|jtmXnJf4aa	I think we all do, at one point or another, especially when it comes to the "S" word: socialization. Any homeschooling mom who makes even half an effort gets in a lot of "socialization time" with their kids, which includes meeting and working with people who have different views. Come to think of it, anyone who has ever ventured into the DMV, stood in line at the courthouse or got tied up in the customer service department at a big box retailer has learned a valuable lesson on how to work around some of the most uncaring, ornery people in the world :P<br>  <br>  Then of course are the stereotypes, which I love this YouTube clip, because it features just about ALL of them:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM6uqj0_jQc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM6uqj0_j...</a><br>  <br>  Our family breaks just about every stereotype out there, but because we're not out in the media, it's us "normal folks" who get lumped in with everyone else. :(|`|AjqO1aJgaa	What concerns me is how many comments on here are along the lines of "I want to be / am homeschooled because I can't get on with people at school." And then the "oh of course my kids are socialised - we go to lots of events with other homeschoolers and friends". And I've lost count of how many homeschoolers I've seen on online writing sites who use "I'm homeschooled" as a reason why they don't have to bother with spelling and grammar, but only with being creative individuals.  <br>  <br>  When do these kids learn the very important life skill of getting on with people who they _don't_ particularly like, who they haven't hand-picked, who they don't have much in common with? When do they learn to deal with learning things that they aren't that interested in? When do they learn to do the boring, tedious, necessary jobs? Or are they all going to have to work for themselves, because they will effectively be unemployable?<br>  <br>  The other thing that worries me is the attitude to education level. How many times have you seen someone say here "oh homeschooling is wonderful, kids only need to work for three hours a day to keep up"? "Oh yes, my homeschooled kid graduated at 15." Huh? Why isn't the attitude "my kids can get so much further ahead in six hours of homeschooling than six hours of school"? Why isn't it "My homeschooled kid went to Harvard at 18"? It's so common to see people aiming for mediocrity and doing the absolute minimum - and this being described as a good thing.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	Not often.  But they are out there on occasion.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	I've never actually run into them in real life. Then again, since it's not something I say when I first meet people ("Hi I'm shiori_him and I was homeschooled"), they usually have a chance to get to know me for a long time before finding out I was homeschooled. As a result, they get to know that whatever stereotypes of homeschoolers they hold do not apply to me long before they learn I was homeschooled. <br>  <br>  Online yeah, I run into them all the time, but all things considered it doesn't really matter what strangers on the internet think.|`|1kOIXVHoaa	Ignorant assumptions in real life? No.<br>  Ignorant assumptions on Yahoo answers? Yes.<br>  Ignorant assumptions on the other websites I hang out on and where I'm known to be home-educated? No.<br>  <br>  The very worst comment I've ever heard or seen concerning home-ed or my being home-educated, outside of this board, is that I should maybe extend the curriculum beyond sheep, lol! (Thanks, J.)|`|Z5g7hCXraa	Yes, all the time.  People seem to think they are doing me a favor by letting me know that my kids need to get out and socialize.  They will say, "Wow, it must be really tough to make sure that your kids can go out and make friends, learn how to get along with people..."<br>  This is followed by a pause, while they wait for me to agree with them,as though I'd never thought of this, and they were the first to mention this.<br>  <br>  I could rant about this for a long time!<br>  <br>  I am my kids' best teacher, because I love them.  Add to this the fact that their education is completely tailored to their needs and personalities, and allows flexibility to pursue interests and questions that arise during the study of a text...<br>  <br>  Wait a minute.  You know all this.<br>  <br>  The definition of the word ignorant is not knowing.  People don't like stuff that they don't know!  And maybe if someone honestly inquired about homeschooling, they would find out how good it really is, and that could require changes...  <br>  <br>  Do what's good for your children, and openly, kindly, honestly answer the questions that come your way.  Smile when you answer.  It starts there!|`|yJSPecgoaa	Where I live, I don't encounter this sort of ignorance as much as I used to.  <br>  <br>  However, I encounter it quite a bit on Yahoo Answers.  Just the other day here, a responder who claimed to be a public school teacher gave as ignorant and as uninformed an "appraisal" of homeschooling as I've ever heard. <br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I do think people are starting to "get it." I was just tonight speaking with a friend of ours whose very bright twins are Freshmen in a top-rated public high school.  Their math teacher, though allegedly very nice, is so ineffective a teacher that 85% of her class is receiving private math tutoring outside of school.  The remaining 15% is either failing the class or barely getting by.  My friend pays $300 a week ( @ $75/hr.) to have her twins taught, by private tutor, the math material the teacher has failed to teach, and she is furious about it.  As she said, "for that kind of money I may as well just have them homeschooled."  Interestingly enough, this same friend was incredulous when, several years ago, I withdrew my *own* children from public school.  At that time, she made the same sort of ignorant remarks I now too often find on Yahoo Answers.   Our friend is but one example of an increasing number of parents who  don't see their kids in public school getting "the help they need," unless they are in Special Ed.

cd7Yy4d7aa	Genetics (from Ancient Greek γενετικ?? genetikos, “genitive” and that from γ?νεσι? genesis, “origin”[1][2][3]), a discipline of biology, is the science of heredity and variation in living organisms.[4][5] The fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding. However, the modern science of genetics, which seeks to understand the process of inheritance, only began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the mid-nineteenth century.[6] Although he did not know the physical basis for heredity, Mendel observed that organisms <br>  inherit traits in a discrete manner—these basic units of inheritance are now called genes.<br>  <br>  Genes correspond to regions within DNA, a molecule composed of a chain of four different types of nucleotides—the sequence of these nucleotides is the genetic information organisms inherit. DNA naturally occurs in a double stranded form, with nucleotides on each strand complementary to each other. Each strand can act as a template for creating a new partner strand—this is the physical method for making copies of genes that can be inherited.<br>  <br>  The sequence of nucleotides in a gene is translated by cells to produce a chain of amino acids, creating proteins—the order of amino acids in a protein corresponds to the order of nucleotides in the gene. This is known as the genetic code. The amino acids in a protein determine how it folds into a three-dimensional shape; this structure is, in turn, responsible for the protein's function. Proteins carry out almost all the functions needed for cells to live. A change to the DNA in a gene can change a protein's amino acids, changing its shape and function: this can have a dramatic effect in the cell and on the organism as a whole.<br>  <br>  Although genetics plays a large role in the appearance and behavior of organisms, it is the combination of genetics with what an organism experiences that determines the ultimate outcome. For example, while genes play a role in determining a person's height, the nutrition and health that person experiences in childhood also have a large effect.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped it helped me a bunch!|`|0Xyo4McXaa	heres a site that i love to use to refresh on that stuff, helped me a bunch back in high school:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/traits/blood/" rel="nofollow">http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/b...</a><br>  <br>  it uses images and explinations to help you understand<br>  how this helped!! =)

Honors classes expect you to do more work and pick up the subject faster - they aren't teaching all the same stuff.  Honors students are learning more.

If you want to take an honors class, go ask your counselor to put you in one next year so you can try it out.|`|eSqsYYoDaa	Honors classes just expand the learning youre doing in regular classes.

But they're pretty easy..... they all start out like this:<br>  r|s<br>  t t<br>  t f<br>  f t<br>  f f<br>  <br>  you'll always start them out like that because you need to match up all the possible combinations of true and false - so get used to that order of t and f for the first two columns.<br>  <br>  so now that you have the basic down, you need to figure out what the OPPOSITE of those would be, since that's what "~" is asking for, so we make 2 more columns to show the opposites (note: the dots i'm putting between is just to give space so that the letters are under the correct column - these should all be in a table but i can't make on on here):<br>  r|s|~r|~s<br>  t t .. f....f <br>  t .f.. f....t<br>  f t..  t....f<br>  f f .. t....t<br>  <br>  Do you get that? It's hard for some people to grasp - the only thing you're doing is looking at the column under "r" and putting the opposite letter under "~r" and the same for "s" and "~s". People tend to want to make that harder than it is - it's simple.<br>  <br>  okay, so now what you need to know is that when you're working with a V statement, both statements must false to be false... then with a /\ statement, both statements must be true to be true. So since we're dealing with V, we say that anything that is F V F is F... everything else is T. We have to add another column to show this:<br>  r|s|~r|~s| ~r v ~s<br>  t t.. f....f .... f<br>  t f.. f....t..... t<br>  f t.. t....f..... t<br>  f f.. t....t..... t<br>  <br>  See?

Q7lvSU03aa	I think the focus needs to go off the teachers.  They are working hard and most care about the kids and are good teachers.  The testing and benchmarks have turned our schools into something worse not better.  And the fact that it isn't working proves we need to try something else.<br>  <br>  I think we need to focus in at the community level on the parents.  A child's home life is a major indicator on how well they will do in school.  Let's get free parenting classes and offer more programs to help parents.  Let's get free programs that any kid can take part in, like after school help, tutoring or even just activities like chess club.  These are going to keep kids on the right path.  Look at other successful countries, what are they doing that we aren't?  I think one of the key things is the value that is put on education in the home.<br>  <br>  There is no easy solution and nothing is going to "fix" the problem.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Fully fund it.

We are only hurting them by expecting each and every one to do so.<br>  <br>  Also, we can't expect every student to be at the same level. This just isn't realistic. Some students are just slower learners than others and it is not fair to expect them to just magically catch up with their peers and never fall behind again.<br>  <br>  Test have to be dropped. Teachers have lost all creativity and freedom to teach important concepts. Instead, we teach the test and are castrated if our students don't blow it away.|`|AwXPybcfaa	1. Maintain accountability aspect BUT<br>  2. Give more realistic time periods for schools to make gains AND<br>  3. Take into account growth of schools and districts in order to acknowledge that hard work is taking place at the classroom, school and district level instead of simply punishing if a certain (grossly unrealistic) percentage/ benchmark is not reachers PLUS<br>  4. Fully fund Title I, Title III, IDEA and other federal programs SO THAT<br>  5.

An easier method would be using your calculator and make the conversion to decimal values.

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Be careful with the term "online college".  There are online programs from established, reputable, universities and then there are for-profit companies that offer degrees.  The difference is vast -- the established program from a university will offer you the same services as if you were a classroom-based student so it is just as good as the school's name.  On the other hand, for-profits don't care about your education.  They simply want your money and cut corners all over.  For instance, the counselors at for-profits are just commissioned salespeople. They don't necessarily even have a degree themselves!

wO56y9BYaa	The answer is that stem cell research should NOT be discontinued.<br>   <br>  Medical researchers believe that stem cell therapy has the potential to dramatically change the treatment of human disease. A number of adult stem cell therapies already exist, particularly bone marrow transplants that are used to treat leukemia. In the future, medical researchers anticipate being able to use technologies derived from stem cell research to treat a wider variety of diseases including cancer, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and muscle damage, amongst a number of other impairments and conditions.<br>  <br>  By the way ... the controversy is over human embryonic stem cell research (as opposed to the use of adult stem cells).  This was becuase starting a stem cell line requires the destruction of a human embryo and/or therapeutic cloning. However, recently, it has been shown in principle that adult stem cell lines can be manipulated to generate embryonic-like stem cell lines using a single-cell biopsy similar to that used in preimplantation genetic diagnosis that may allow stem cell creation without embryonic destruction.|`|AA10439008	That seems to be the only reason.  Maybe people are afraid that women will get pregnant on purpose just to have an abortion and sell the fetus for stem cells.|`|2r4kfcJmaa	abortion is essential for the research and some people are against abortion.|`|AA10739434	I am all for furthering science. If there is concrete evidence that it will benefit humanity, then go for it.  I would not like to see it stopped.<br>  <br>  I do not let church get in the way with science. I say that because that is the biggest argument about stem cell research. [Church VS. Science]<br>  <br>  Do good on your paper.

But most schools eat up new kids like "candy" and just being new earns you the right to meet and talk to everyone. Everyone always wants to see the new kid, and don't be put off by english sense of humour either - what we find funny is what you find offensive, so if someone says something that seems horrible and nasty, its probably a joke and you should just laugh hahah.<br>  but really, three rules of getting though school alive would be-<br>  Be confident and talk to people.<br>  Don't get on ANYONES bad side (this includes teachers)<br>  And really dont put work off till the last minute because good old karma will bite you on the ****!|`|jV99kgWbaa	Aww, don't let our weather put you off.

There is more to getting into a college than just filling in the bubbles. The kid who did great on the test but doesn't study and gets the B will not show up as well as the kid who did average but worked really really hard and gets the A.<br>  <br>  And there is a lot to consider besides just the bubble in tests. They don't tell you all there is to know about the individual person. Colleges also look at things like how involved the kid is in extra curricular activities, community, etc.  Tests can only tell a thumbnail of who that person really is.

f1gmEmUTaa	College will be the best time of your life IMHO. A lot of how it will go depends on whether you live on campus or off campus. I believe personally that all incoming freshmen should live on campus. The benefits of living on campus include shorter walks to class, free sponsored activities (many colleges have pizza and soda nights, movie nights, dances, balls, intermural sports etc.) and meal plans (off campus students can buy these too).<br>  The benefits of living off campus IMHO are mainly that you answer to no one. On campus you'll have to follow certain rules and answer to an RA (Resident Advisor, basically a big babysitter). RA's are a mixed bag, some can be cool as hell and let you do whatever, others are strict disiplinarians. <br>  <br>  Academic wise, most classes are set up so that the professor doesn't care whether you attend or not. If you fail, fine. The professor doesn't get in trouble and doesn't give a damn whether you pass his/her class or not (Which is the COMPLETE opposite of high school) What is also cool about college is that you can schedule your classes according to what's available/what you prefer. In other words, you can pick morning classes or night classes whichever you prefer, and whichever is available. And no, not all majors/minors are four years long. It all depends on what kind of degree you are going for. BS's go to school for longer than BA's for example. Four years is the basic schooling, if you go on to med school for example, you might be in school for another four years (Eight total). Hell some majors don't even require minors.  You won't have the same class or the same teacher for all those years. In fact, it'd be rare to have the same professor more than once. People often choose certain classes based on the professor rather than the time. Another luxury affored to you at college.<br>  <br>  Overall, my advice to you is go out have a blast, but do so in moderation. I have seen too many people who came had too good of a time and failed out their first semester. You're there to learn first, have fun second. Always remember that, and you should be just fine. Congratulations!!|`|ac8569ed983ea4e96af4844d5b3f6ad8aa	You can have as many majors and minors as you want.  The only thing required is one major.  Minors are just specialties to include on your resume.  Some people double or even triple major.  But I think that is kind of pointless.  It takes a lot more time and money to do that.  <br>  <br>  The average student spends 4 years completely all his/her classes required by the university for a bachelor's degree in a certain major.  You change classes and teachers every semester.  Generally, you will have brand new teachers for every brand new class every semester.  (A semester is a half of a school year.)  So generally you get a new schedule and everything 8 times during your college years.
I7mBG3Dnaa	Im almost positive it is 16|`|8ekoa6szaa	It isn't the age factor, it's the lack of intelligence involved.  did they really want to flip burgers for a living the rest of their lives making minimum wage?  the lack of an education in today's world is, in effect, suicide plain and simple.  An education opens doors for better wages and more prestige.  Quitting school is just plain stupid.
YfTJyj5aaa	well angle x is 65 degrees because 90 + 25 is 115. you subtract that from 180<br>  <br>  xz is 38|`|y7ccm0Nfaa	You need to use sine, cosine, or tangent.  Since you know the angle Z you will use that as your angle.  Then you need to determine which function to use.  For sine, you use the side opposite the angle over the hypotenuse, for cosine you use the side adjacent to the angle over the hypotenuse and for tangent you use the side opposite the angle over the side adjacent to the angle.

n5DlXdsCaa	It's a good statement, but I'm not sure if it really pulls the paper together. It's hard to know, not having read the rest of the essay, but it still seems it needs a little re-wording just to make it feel like an end. Maybe <br>  "The feeling of satisfaction that one is looking for when carrying out their revenge is unreal, and when it's unpresent, the one taking revenge ends up more empty than before." <br>  I don't know if "the image of justice" is exactly what you're looking for.|`|AGfl6mpgaa	I don't really care about your question im just doing this so i can get some pionts but bood luck with what ever your problem is.|`|1Z11ySWaaa	Its pretty good|`|Gojbv3Nraa	Justice conflicts with revenge. <br>  <br>  It sounds good, like something someone would narrate at the end of an indie film that wins lots of prizes. But...how is "the image of justice" ever "questionable"? When justice...is not revenge and revenge is not justice?<br>  <br>  It IS a good ending though. Your teacher will think you are doing some deep thinking....|`|YUjVFkocaa	I like it, except for a few things:<br>  <br>  1) change unreal to illusory- its "real", in the sense that the feeling is there. Therefore "illusory" is better, because it means its something that feels real, but in reality, isnt as you thought it was.<br>  <br>  meaning that the feeling of satisfaction was there, but in reality you wont be happier through the path of revenge. u follow me? lol =)<br>  <br>  ===========<br>  <br>  2) justice and revenge are 2 entirely different things.  Justice is imposed by a society, and is universally accepted as necessary and good; revenge is instituted by an outlaw or somebody taking matters into his own hands.  Revenge is also not fair, balanced, and systematic, like justice; revenge is out of emotion and anger, rather than clear thinking and evidence.<br>  <br>  unlike justice, revenge is ALMOST UNIVERSALLY accepted as bad or unnecessary.<br>  <br>  Therefore, it would do you VERY WELL not to associate a noble act, such as justice... with a mostly ignoble act, such as revenge.<br>  ===================================<br>  <br>  3) The final thing would look like this, in my humble opinion:<br>  <br>  The feeling of satisfaction that one achieves through revenge is fleeting and illusory, and quickly transforms into guilt, worry, and regret.  Rarely is true justice achieved through revenge, and it is near impossible to achieve justice without people impartial to the matter at hand looking at the evidence first.<br>  <br>  Lol its kinda long... but yeah :P|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	I like it.|`|X3NhQfnBaa	Love it.|`|rLXNwqbFaa	nice|`|xgui1LAFaa	sounds really good. u must be a good writer.|`|XaTieBwqaa	it sounds professional<br>  <br>  but add more than that<br>  like:<br>  <br>  The feeling of satisfaction that one supposebly achieves through revenge is unreal, making the image of justice questionable, even though most will never go back to the thoughts/emotions through their phase of revenge. The reason for is that if they've gone through the pain, they feel the satisfaction, and to rethink this situation logically, that would be to tear yourself apart mentally. Also, it would explain why so many don't have second thoughts, they just want it to be over after they've watched their victim of revenge suffer enough to their liking.|`|8t24Xmm9aa	I would say that it is not specific enough.  Of course, this depends on what else you have in your conclusion paragraph.  What is your reason for saying that the satisfaction one gains from revenge is unreal?  Also, why do people perceive that there should be satisfaction in the first place?|`|v84c9XTwaa	Revenge belongs to God, save your soul while you sill can, while it's not too late.|`|9Jhdj7Yqaa	depends on what the rest of your essay talked about but I think it's okay.|`|w7XNcmihaa	I think it's a very strong sentence, so it's pefect!

YfIm4IqSaa	I think it's mostly something that guys do. It qualifies as a type of masturbation basically since you are stimulating yourself. <br>  <br>  You place the pillow between your legs, get on top of it and just press into it as if you're f-------. Don't count on it for really good arousal. If you're a girl then use a dildo. If you're a girl under 18 then just make your own. This is assuming you're interested in masturbation and not so much real sex.

RiPk2rVLaa	First of all, slow down… It's good that you're checking it out before jumping right in and providing your personal information etc.  That shows your smarts!!  My son also got a letter and I'm researching it myself.  I strongly suggest you get your parents involved and let them help you along the way. From my research the National Youth Leadership Forum is a non-profit organization that hosts secondary school (High-School) students at forums targeting upper-level educational interests, i.e. doctors, lawyers, political science.  Troubling to me though is first, they have told you that you have been nominated, but decline to say by whom.  I think that's important simply because it would justify how they received your personal information (Mail at home), and would also attach a name of someone you are familiar with.  Secondly, in order to even view the scholarship and financial assistance information you have to register.  That is a big warning sign to me. The cost of the tuition for the course in 2009 is $2,465 and that does not include transportation to and from the venue.  The course is only 10 days and that is inclusive of the first day, which is registration as well as a meet and greet day.  Basically, what I'm saying is that it seems to be a legitimate organization that will basically provide an educational summer camp filled with guest speakers talking to motivate you into seeking the career they have chosen, and perhaps a particular college.  For you it would be the field of medicine and maybe becoming a doctor. They probably got that information (Your interest in being a doctor) from one of the boxes you checked on some of your high school testing entrance exams.  I don't think that attending the forum would help with any college enrollment; however, it might help you spread your wings a little and become a little more independent and self confident.  It might also be a little fun, since you would probably meet some people from other cities and other schools, do some sight seeing if you were to attend at a city you don't live in, etc... But it's a pretty costly venture for that.  Good luck!

They need to look up homeschool requirements in your state and follow what ever procedure is in place for pulling you out of public school. Then *they* are in charge of your education, providing your curriculum, etc. You are no longer linked with the public school. <br>  <br>  If you mean homeBOUND education where you're still a student at the public school but temporarily do the same work as your classmates at home by yourself due to injury or illness, then you need to speak with a doctor and be evaluated. No, they do not always say yes, but if you are diagnosed with depression, they likely will. This is only for a short time though, and it's just like being sick for several days and doing your school work at home with a teacher who occasionally comes to collect it and bring you more. <br>  <br>  Home schooling is better, in my opinion. At least then you can get out of your house and participate in community activities or homeschool group extracurricular activities and things. And instead of doing the same work you'd be doing in school you can actually do more creative, hands-on stuff guided by your personal goals and interests.|`|K0FabRAIaa	I don't know about homebound for depression, but I do know many states offer an online public school option.

It alternates with the much longer interphase, where the cell prepares itself for division. <br>  <br>  Interphase is divided into three phases, G1 (first gap), S (synthesis), and G2 (second gap). During all three phases, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the S phase. Thus, a cell grows (G1), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G2), and divides (M).<br>  <br>  Mitosis is a continual and dynamic process. For purposes of description, however, mitosis is conventionally broken down into five subphases: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  LOOK AT THE SECOND WEBSITE THE ABOVE TEXT IS FROM THE FIRST!

The Polish army was defeated within weeks of the invasion. From East Prussia and Germany in the north and Silesia and Slovakia in the south, German units, with more than 2,000 tanks and over 1,000 planes, broke through Polish defenses along the border and advanced on Warsaw in a massive encirclement attack. After heavy shelling and bombing, Warsaw surrendered to the Germans on September 28, 1939. Britain and France, standing by their guarantee of Poland's border, had declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. The Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland on September 17, 1939. The demarcation line for the partition of German- and Soviet-occupied Poland was along the Bug River.<br>  <br>  In October 1939, Germany directly annexed those former Polish territories along German's eastern border: West Prussia, Poznan, Upper Silesia, and the former Free City of Danzig. The remainder of German-occupied Poland (including the cities of Warsaw, Krakow, Radom, and Lublin) was organized as the so-called Generalgouvernement (General Government) under a civilian governor general, the Nazi party lawyer Hans Frank.<br>  <br>   Nazi Germany occupied the remainder of Poland when it invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Poland remained under German occupation until January 1945.

Cj4i2pbTaa	Okay, so the affirmative tu commands are the el, ella, usted form of the verb.  There are only 8 irregular affirmative tu command verbs.<br>  So, the affirmative tu command of comer=come, hablar=habla, escribir=escribe, and so on.<br>  If you want to add a direct object pronoun, add it to the end.  In most cases you will need to add an accent in order to keep the stress in the correct place.<br>  We will use the direct object pronoun "lo".  So, come becomes comelo, escribe becomes escribelo (with an accent over the "i"), and habla becomes hablalo (with an accent over the "a").

What should be the basis for animal rights?<br>  <br>  It is in the nature of animals to assert themselves in the animal world but this in itself has nothing to do with having rights. At a certain point in time man conceived the notion of 'rights' and it is man alone that employs such a concept.<br>  Why then do we speak of animal rights? The answer is quite simple: animal rights are meant to set limits to human behavior. If we fail to set clear legal limits to human behavior in relation to animals, it will be impossible to initiate legal proceedings against those who exceed these limits. Animals are vulnerable, defenseless and completely in man's power.

Albert Schweitzer stated that ethics should be rooted in compassion. A right without compassion cannot be implemented as a justifiable action. How these issues interconnect will be elaborated in this article.<br>  <br>  The concept of animal rights can be interpreted in widely different ways. On the one hand, some may exercise the right to kill animals for the purpose of consumption or sports. Some people, on the other hand, will deprive themselves of the right to kill even the smallest animal by mistake.<br>         <br>  <br>  What is the basis for granting rights to animals?<br>  <br>  Topics:<br>  <br>      * Is there a satisfactory basic principle?<br>      * Can freedom be maintained as a fundamental right if it is infringed?<br>      * Isn't being an owner of an animal in conflict with the right of freedom?<br>      * Advocating animal rights should be financially rewarded<br>      * Should all wrongful actions towards animals be prohibited?<br>  <br>  Animals are only capable of expressing themselves indirectly in case of abuse. Therefore it is up to us to answer the question above.<br>  Concepts that are eligible for forming the basis of animal rights are intrinsic value, welfare, respect, freedom, equality, compassion etc. Many of these concepts seem appropriate but are less suitable if we apply them in practical situations.<br>  <br>  For criticism on animal rights click here.<br>      <br>  <br>  We will now test the workability of each concept according to a number of important principles:<br>  <br>     1. The formulation of animal rights should be a workable and practical concept that can be legally reviewed.<br>     2. Animal rights are meant to benefit all individual animals including all species from wildlife and agriculture e.g. domestic animals, mammals, but also insects.<br>     3. Considering the diversity of those species we should take into account their specific nature.<br>     4. Animal rights apply to people and should be called upon by people.<br>     5. Death holds a distinct position in animal rights: the slaughter, hunting by experts for the purpose of wildlife management and professional fishing. Regulations should be enforced to ensure a fast and painless death, which must serve a purpose (in contrast with undesired extra fish to the catch). This also applies to killing off harmful vertebrae, which can otherwise not be stopped.<br>     6. Rights of the species outweigh the rights of the individual (if a plant or animal threatens to become extinct people should be forbidden to disturb its life). A certain species (e.g. sow or salmon) has the right not to be produced or caught in excessive numbers for export purposes. This mass production is unworthy of an animal and it is m|`|qnDYiquFaa	Animal rights, also known as animal liberation, is the idea that the most basic interests of animals should be afforded the same consideration as the similar interests of human beings.[1] Animal rights advocates approach the issue from different philosophical positions, but they agree that animals should no longer be regarded as property, or used as food, clothing, research subjects, or entertainment, but should instead be viewed as legal persons and members of the moral community.<br>      Which concept of animal rights is the best?

d46f610a60316733e6c17cc867554da4aa	It does get a bit technical, but you should look over the source I listed (a literary site would be the best source). There are people on here that could answer this question better than me, but, generally, the narrator is the person or type of point of view or perspective presented within the work that is relaying the story. And yes, if a work is written in the first person, that person is the narrator (although some works have multiple narrators, or change from first person to third, etc)  There are reliable and unreliable narrators, third-person omniscient, etc. I don't believe that a person reading the work aloud would be considered a narrator.|`|3Fejbe0naa	The narrator is the person who is telling the story. The story is always from the narrator's perspective. In your example, if you read Harry Potter out loud, technically, you're not the narrator, but you act like you are. (think of it like channeling a spirit. You aren't the physical spirit, just an outlet.) The narrator of Harry Potter isn't even the author. The narrator is omniscient, like someone observing outside the story, without a name or form. If the story is written in first person, that means it's like an autobiographical account, where they talk about their experiences using "I", even if it's fictional, and it's not actually the author having those experiences (in this case, it's more like the author assuming a role, like an actor in a play, though sometimes, the story is told from the perspective of the actual author, in real life.) The only time you encounter books written in second person are things like instruction manuals and cookbooks, or like those "Choose Your Own Adventure" books. In short, the answer to your question is that the narrator of third person books aren't actual people in real life, and they usually don't have names, and almost never appear in the storyline, but they're like observers, that already know everything.|`|FmvnC8keaa	Well generally the narrator is the person telling the story in the text. For example, if there is a story about a grandson and a grandfather who go fishing, and the story is told in the grandson's point of view - then the grandson would be the narrator. Sometimes narrators can also be the person that explains things more in a play. <br>  <br>  Example of narration in a play -<br>  <br>  George - Mindy I need to go!<br>  Mindy - Oh no George, please do not leave me!<br>  Narrator - Mindy was distressed, and although she did not  want George to leave, he had no choice. Mindy was all alone now.<br>  <br>  In that case the narrator would be the author, not George or Mindy.<br>  <br>  Here's another sample where the narrator would be one of the characters in a story.<br>  <br>  My name is Cade and I live on the southwest border of California. My mother is Janet, and she spends most all of her time at home looking after out family. One day I wish to move away and become a proffesional wrestler. My father tells me that I can, for I am strong.<br>  <br>  In that scenario Cade would be the narrator.|`|XhirXRkpaa	Narrator does not refer to the person reading the story.  It refers to the person telling the story.  For instance, Harry Potter is told from third person point of view because a person who is not involved in the action tells the reader what happens.  A book that is written in first person is told by a person (character) who is involved in the action.  For example, journals and memoirs are written in first person.|`|l0HlqDDMaa	the narrator is the character that tells the story. so most often the narrator is unnamed and is assumed to be the author. Otherwise it can be a character, like in the movie Big, the grandfather is the narrator. Stories written in the first person do not have narrators.|`|MPAgjvaAaa	listen to her ^^^|`|wdlxkT9baa	If you read Harry Potter out loud, you are not the narrator. As you have defined for yourself, a narrator is a speaker of a literary work. Thus, the speaker in the book that is talking about the story is the narrator. It is not the author either. Rather it is sort of like an invisible person unless it is explicitly stated. <br>  <br>  If a story is written in first person, then yes that person is the narrator. <br>  <br>  It is the person talking in the book that is the narrator not the person actually physically reading the book out loud. <br>  <br>  Usually the narrator of any third person written book is the "invisible person" in that book that tells the story.

sz52D7WDaa	Definitively speaking, a theory is a unifying principle that explains a body of facts and the laws based on them. In other words, it is an explanation to a set of observations. Over time, many theories have been found to be false, usually when additional observations or facts contradict the theory. For instance, the theory that the earth was the center of our solar system was supported for many centuries by the scientific community.<br>  <br>  A 'unified field theory' is a type of field theory that allows all of the fundamental forces (gravitation, electromagnetism, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction) between elementary particles to be written in terms of a single field. There is no accepted unified field theory yet, and this remains an open line of research. The term was coined by Albert Einstein who attempted to unify the general theory of relativity with electromagnetism.

AtjlmByAaa	Human, common name given to any individual of the species Homo sapiens and, by extension, to the entire species.

Humans have a highly developed brain, capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection and problem solving.

IXgPHYbDaa	drop out now.<br>  <br>  you wont learn anything new in the next couple weeks that will help you on your GED.<br>  <br>  my little brother took the GED when he was only 16. and dropped outa school in 7th grade!!!! and got a HIGH score on it. <br>  <br>  its very easy. <br>  <br>  if my brother can pass it anybody can.<br>  He didnt even study either.|`|WpsVEeUtaa	nope! I mean that is if you want to. I wouldnt drop out, you only go to high school once, besides it would be kind of boring without all the drama. And think of all those cute guys that will break your heart, the funny friends that are always going to be stabbing your back, or the retarded people making jokes while the teacher talks... Great huh?|`|kzbEWqgLaa	I know this isn't the answer you wanna hear but you should just stick it out for 2 years... TRUST ME, i'm 16 and these 2 years are flying by for me... I remember when i was in 9th grade and it seems like it all went by so fast... Just please at least get your diploma... I don't want you to regret this later in life when you don't get a great job...|`|HCWkdk4naa	the GED is a tough test.  it covers all the math, scienc, english, writing, history, and social studies that you would learn in 4 years of high school.  you can drop out and get a GED study guide, and theoretically you can even ace the test because standardized tests are beatable, but a GED is sort of looked down on by many employers and colleges.  <br>  <br>  If you can make it through two more years, I would strongly suggest finishing high school. good luck

bnJPvsVWaa	Generally-speaking, when the budget gets tight, the teachers axed first are the teachers, who don't teach a 'necessary' course.  <br>  <br>  You might want to lean toward something more  likely to be considered a core class, like math, English, etc.<br>  <br>  If you look in my answers, about a week and a half ago, there's a question by a student, whose drama teacher just got the budgetary axe.|`|aqto0hJTaa	There will only be one drama teacher in a school, while there might be 10 English teachers.  If I were you, I'd major in something else and minor in Drama (with secondary certification).  That way you're more marketable.<br>  <br>  As for elementary--not my cup of tea.  Whatever you decide, you need to make sure you like the kids you'll be teaching.  I love smart aleck teenagers, but I'd lose my mind with clingy little ones.  You need to decide whom you'd rather spend your day with.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	No, it isn't a secure job.  And it would be hard to find a full-time job in just drama.<br>  <br>  There are few drama teaching jobs (in comparison to say, English teachers).  And when budget cuts come, "frills" like drama often get cut first.<br>  <br>  You could be an elementary teacher, with a drama background, who puts together great school plays, or runs a drama club after school, or who gets the kids to put together great skits to act out things that they are learning.  Or choose to teach drama and English (or some other core subject) at the middle or high school level; English seems a natural fit since you can study Shakespeare and other famous plays in an English class.|`|TEWPuPgpaa	It's as secure as any other teacher. I'm a high school theater teacher--BTW, we are no longer called drama teachers because we teach so much more than just drama. We teach tech theater, playwriting, theater history, theater production, dance & movement, voice & diction, film, etc. In most states, students are required to have a fine arts credit to graduate--making theater arts teachers just as secure as other teachers. Most programs are extra-curricular so the hours can be long and physically challenging. Several states (like Texas) now require schools offer Creative Drama classes for elementary students. Finding a position can be challenging.

QD54HVsPaa	Since a thesis statement basically "lists" the points you will discuss in your essay, only you can write the thesis statement based on the research you have done on why organ donation is/is not a good idea.<br>  What have you learned in your research? (A,B, C below)<br>  <br>  Start with an attention grabbing sentence.(and don't just ask a question, that's so overused by students).  Then, your topic sentence where you introduce organ donation.  Lastly, write your thesis statement.  <br>  Something like 'organ donation is important because A, B, C'.

D3ZBmYnUaa	You are on overload. <br>  At the very beginning of your story, you state briefly that the man was leaving to get away from the drug problems of your daughter. <br>  Whether this was just a convenient excuse to get a love nest of his own is beside the point right now. <br>  You need to focus on yourself now, and stop running around after other people. You may want to check out an Al Anon meeting, where I can guarantee you that you will find a surprising number of people who are currently dealing with or have dealt with situations such as the one you describe. Al Anon has a web site, or you may find them in the phone book, or call your local crisis clinic and they will surely have the local Al Anon information number. A volunteer will answer your phone call, and be able to direct you to a meeting near you. Your anonymity will be strictly protected. <br>  You can't help anyone, or get any sane picture of what is going on, until you stop and take a look at what is actually happening with you.

743fefee670c746380c4e67fe325cdfeaa	Hey, great question!<br>  <br>  I did NYLC a while back, and if it's within your financial budget, I would definitely recommend that you seize this educational opportunity. It is so much fun, and you really do learn a lot. I am not sure about internet access, but I remember that my dorm did not have cable tv. Though we do have free time (not a lot), I suggest you leave your Wii at home, but I don't see a problem with the handheld Game Boy (however, I am almost positive that you will leave that in your room once you start befriending all the people there).<br>  <br>  And yes, you are allowed to hang out with boys during free time. However, you are right about not being able to enter their dorms. When I went, there was this great rec-room where everyone hung out during leisure time.<br>  <br>  As for your last question, I'm stumped! I never discovered the percentage of people accepted, but I am sure that you will get in :)<br>  <br>  Best Wishes.

Wfvgj62vaa	2x-y+14<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  o ya standard form of a linear equation is Ax+By+C=0|`|tTg1XU8faa	Slope-intercept form: y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept<br>  <br>  Parallel lines have the same slope. The given line y = 2x - 3 has a slope of 2, so obviously the line you are looking for also has a slope of 2. Therefore, its equation so far is y = 2x + b. Now solve for by by substituting the point (-4, 6) for x and y into the equation:<br>  <br>  y = 2x + b (substitute -4 for x and 6 for y)<br>  6 = 2(-4) + b<br>  6 = -8 + b<br>  14 = b<br>  <br>  And so the equation in slope-intercept form is y = 2x + 14. Now rewrite it in standard form Ax + By = C, where A, B, and C are integers and A is positive:<br>  <br>  y = 2x + 14<br>  -2x + y = 14<br>  2x - y = -14 <===ANSWER

I'd suggest you start by apologizing to the teacher.  It won't be easy, but it will be the right (mature) thing to do.
