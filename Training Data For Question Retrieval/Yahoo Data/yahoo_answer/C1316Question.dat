20071015223959AAd2YxG	Science & Mathematics;Physics	A physics question, maybe?	I recently read a book by the comedian Tim Allen called "I'm not really here".  In it he makes some statements I myself would like to see clarified by an actual scientist.  (Sorry, Tim.)   One:  muons can be in two places at once?  Two:  muons can move backward or forward in time?  That's it.  Could some one tell me if that's true?  I thought muons were just the breakdown of cosmic rays in our atmosphere.

20080328063642AA79O0I	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Interesting "battery life" question...?	This is something I'm trying to figure out....the formula(s) behind the question in order to get an approximate answer...      1) you have an item that runs on batteries.  It will last 5 days (120 hours) on standby with fully charged batteries.  Standby is where you are not using it, or "pinging" it - at all.  It's just "on."      2) Conversely, if you "ping" it continually, which is 1x every 5 minutes, the batteries will last 150 pings, or just 12.5 hours.      What formula will calculate how much battery time you have left if you ping it XX number of times every XX hours?  So if I wanted to know ROUGHLY how much battery life was left after pinging it, say, 10 times within first 24 hours of use, what would that formula be?...      I'm using Microsoft Excel, but I think I can just follow the logic and translate to a formula if anyone can explain?...      Thanks! :)

20090131095149AAwftYG	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Horsepower, acceleration, resistances relationship?	I basically need to know if a car has enough HP to increase its speed by 20mph in a 1000ft span.  The problem is that the total resistance will change with changing speed. I know how to find each of these values, just don't know how to combine them.      I know:      Energy = 0.5 * mass * v ^2   Power = Energy / time      How do I figure in the resistances? Do I replace the mass of the car with the mass of resistances? (It's in pounds). How would I find the time when including the resistances?       s=(u+v)t/2      where s=displacement, u=initial velocity, v=final v, t=time      Thanks!

All of the following important concepts of population genetics are due to random events or chance except    mutation.    natural selection.    the bottleneck effect.    the founder effect.    sexual recombination.        I am pretty sure that the answer would be "natural selection", but I wanted a second opinion. THANK YOU!

20090131102222AAB5Cx6	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Which of the following is NOT a function of bones?	Which of the following is NOT a function of bones?   To protect organs    To allow us to stand    To provide places of attachment for muscles    To help transport blood          2: Which of the following is a difference between bone and cartilage?   Bones are more flexible than cartilage.    Bones are harder than cartilage.    Bones are larger than cartilage.    Bones heal more completely than cartilage.          3: All muscles pull rather than push. How, then, is it possible for you to push a table or a chair across a room?   Because muscles are strong    Because muscles are arranged in opposed groups    Because muscles contract in different directions    Because muscle fiber has many different layers          4: How does heart muscle tissue resemble voluntary muscle tissue?    Because the heart has cross-striations    Because the muscle tissues have one nucleus    Because we can control our heart beat    Because the heart is made of smooth muscle tissue          5: What is a function of plasma?   To allow blood cells to flow throughout the body    To bring food to cells of body tissue    To help fight disease    To carry hemoglobin to muscle groups          6: What is one way the blood is adapted to resist the invasion of micro-organisms?   By carrying hemoglobin to all parts of the body    By creating lymph out of plasma    Through white corpuscles    The blood does not resist invasion, other organs filter blood to remove micro-organisms          7: Describe the pattern of blood flow through the heart, body, and lungs.   Blood passes through the left ventricle of the heart to the arteries, through the muscles, into the veins, into the right ventricle of the heart, into the lungs, back into the left ventricle, and begins again    Blood passes through the lungs to collect oxygen, into the right ventricle, into the veins, into the left ventricle, and into the arteries which lead to the lungs for replenishing the oxygen supply    Blood passes from the left ventricle to the veins, through the muscles, to the arteries, to the lungs, into the right ventricle of the heart to begin again    Blood passes from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs, through the arteries, through the muscles, and back to the lungs through the veins          8: Distinguish between an artery and a vein.   An artery is carries much more blood than veins, which branch off of arteries    Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to muscle tissue; veins return blood with waste be replenished with oxygen    Veins carry oxygen-rich blood to muscle tissue; arteries return blood with waste be replenished with oxygen    A vein carries much more blood than arteries, which branch off of veins          9: What is meant by "blood type"?   The kind of cells that make up blood, varying with the ratio of red to white blood cells    Hemophiliacs have a different blood type than healthy people, which is why their blood does not clot normally    A classification of blood based on inherited differences on the surface of red blood cells    A classification of blood based on inherited differences in the chemical compounds that bond to create blood          10: How is the action of a hormone similar to that of a nerve?    Because they both bring about responses    Because they are both delivered through the blood system    Because they are both issued from parts of the brain    Because they are both essential in puberty          11: What is diabetes and how is it treated?   The pancreas does not supply enough insulin and excessive amounts of sugar collect in the blood. It is treated by controlling diet and injecting extra insulin into the blood.     The thyroid gland is overactive and can cause weight-loss, irritability, and protrusion of the eyes. It is controlled through various medical procedures to reduce levels of thyroxin.     The pancreas produces too much insulin and breaks down the sugar in the blood too fast. It is treated by controlled diet and injecting insulin-suppressors into the blood.     The thyroid gland is under-active and people tend to become obese and slow in reactions. It is controlled by diet and injections of thyroxin.

20090131095950AAKYCdZ	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	How can I improve math/buzzer speed?	In about 1 week I will be in a math competition in which groups on 3 are given buzzers, and each group is given a set of questions. Each question is projected on a board and first person to buzz gets to answer question.      Correct Answer=10 points   Incorrect Answer=-3 points      If the answer is incorrect, the other two can compete for the same number of points. Again, if an incorrect answer is given, the third has a chance to answer.         Any hesitation and it is wrong.   If you buzz and do not answer it is wrong.   If you answer before you are called it is wrong.         I believe it is 3 (or maybe less) seconds in which you must answer the question.      Of course, there will not be any yes/no or true/false questions.      Units must always be stated in the answer unless it says something like "How many centimeters are in a meter?" in which case the answer will obviously be in cm, so "100" is still correct.            Here are my questions:      1) What topics do you expect would be covered in the competition (it is 7th/8th grade)?   2) How can I improve my skills in each of these topics?   3) How can I improve my speed in answering these types of questions?   4) How can I improve my buzzer speed?   5) Can I have a list of tricks that may be useful for speed?   6) Can I have a checklist of topics that I should review?      Again, the competition is in one week. If it helps, I already won last year, and I want to maintain my title.      Most helpful answer gets 13 points (2 for answering, 10 for best answer, and 1 thumbs up).

20081029181128AATN4hS	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Simple Question; Work Vs. Force when using spring?	Say that you have a mass of "m" suspended vertically by spring with constant K. You want to find how long the spring will stretch.      If I use Work, the decrease in potential energy should be used to stretch the spring      0.5kx^2 = mg(delta h)      But the amount the spring stretches and the amount of delta h is the same. Therefore   0.5kx^2 = mgx   0.5kx=mg   x = mg/0.5k      However, using force, and makign weight equal the force that the spring exerts,      kx = mg   x = mg/k      How is it that when using force, the distance is 2 times as great?

The heat capacity of steam is 2.01 J/g * C and of ice is 2.09 J/g * C.      I basically just need to know how to do the problem, the steps required so i can use it for future referece, if you give the answer than it will be help full too, so anyways...      Im most certain you have to use q= m x Cs x T for the equation and I have tried that, but i get a bit confused with the two Specific Heat Values, how would I apply them into the equation?      Thanks

20090131084615AAnvrVw	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Statistics:  Need help identifying frequencies of classes.?	Maybe someone can explain this better to me. My calculations are not coming out right. I need to create a frequency histogram and relative frequency histogram, however before I can construct those graphs I need to get my class frequencies right. For some reason, my answers keep coming out wrong. I asked my instructor about it and he also told me that I am wrong and the book is right, but he didn't elaborate (online class).      Here are the math exercises from my book:      In Exercises 3 and 4, use the following data set.The data represent the actual liquid   volume (in ounces) in 24 twelve-ounce cans.      11.95 11.91 11.86 11.94 12.00 11.93 12.00 11.94   12.10 11.95 11.99 11.94 11.89 12.01 11.99 11.94   11.92 11.98 11.88 11.94 11.98 11.92 11.95 11.93      3. Make a frequency histogram using seven classes.   4. Make a relative frequency histogram of the data set using seven classes.   ----------------------------------   I determined that the class range was .04. (Since the upper limit is 12.10 and the lower limit is 11.86. So 12.10 - 11.86 = .24 and 24/7 = .034 but you round up to .04)      Now when creating my classes I got the following (Sorry about the underscore, it was the only way I could space them out):      Class__________MyFrequencies______Book... Answer    11.86 - 11.89_________3_______________2   11.90 - 11.93_________5_______________4   11.94 - 11.97_________8______________10   11.98 - 12.01_________7_______________6   12.02 - 12.05_________0_______________1   12.06 - 12.09_________0_______________0   12.10 - 12.14_________1_______________1      So here's my problem, the Book reads the frequencies totally different. Why?      According to the data set, the book says the first class' frequency is 2. But that doesn't make sense because there are three items that can be included in that class:   11.86   11.88   11.89      So, can someone please explain to me what it is that I am doing wrong. I just don't understand why 3 is not correct.

20090131100908AAIEvsk	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Math symmetry question?	Does the equation y = -x^3 have symmetry about the origin?   i guess you are supposed to plug in a negative x and negative y and see if you get back the same equation. which, if you did that then   -y= -(-x)^3    so you would have -y= x^3 right? because the two negatives would cancel??   the reason why i am confused is because in the book there was a sample problem of y= -10/x and they said that it was symmetric about the origin, but i though that when you plug in a neg y and x than   -y= -10/-x the two negatives (-10 and -x) would cancel and you are not left with the same equation. but they say that the -y and -x cancel and that it is symmetric about the origin.       so in the y= -x^3 is there symmetry about the origin?

(Hint: express the area as a function of angle CAB.)      So is the maximum area when the 2 shorter sides are equal, so they're both square root of 8 so the area's 4? If this is right, then how do you justify it by expressing the area as a function of angle CAB? When they say angle CAB, is that the angle at point A (and therefore the same as CBA) or is it the right angle at point C? Do I use the area=1/2 *a*b*sinC equation?      Thanks for any help

Ever since 8th grade, ive had this fear of going outside, like simply to the store/supermarket because i was afraid of getting jumped/beaten up. i dont have any reason to get jumped, but one time i almost got jumped in front of my school. that was when i was 13. i think that itll go away after like next year but should i really be scared of getting jumped at age 15, for no apparent reason. i think its a post traumatic syndrome thing because i almost got jumped that time. please respond especially if you know this area.
20090131091017AAXsbYR	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Mathematics help please...?	A survey of sexual attitudes and behaviors in Britain between 1999 and 2001 contacted 16,998 households and interviewed 11,161 respondents aged 16-44. the frequency distributions of ages of men and women respondents were the same. The following results were reported on the number of heterosexual partners individuals had had over the previous five year period.      Men: Sample Size, n = 4620 Mean = 3.8 Standard Deviation = 6.7 Standard Error of the mean = .0986   Women: Sample Size, n = 6228 Mean = 2.4 Standard Dev. = 4.6 Standard Error of the mean = .0583       1)  A mysterious result of the study is the discrepancy between the mean number of partners of heterosexual men and women. If each sex obtains its partners from the other sex, then the true mean number of heterosexual partners should be identical. Considering aspects of the study design, suggest an explanation for the discrepancy.

Can you please help!    *not to complicated   3x + y = 0 → minus 3x from both sides? →to give you y= 0 - 3x? is that right?      Here's what the original problem is. x - y = 4   I think you sub "0-3x"  in for y because above, i switched it to y = 0-3x.   So now you have x - 0 - 3x= 4   now i solve?   i know... this seems messed up to me too.
