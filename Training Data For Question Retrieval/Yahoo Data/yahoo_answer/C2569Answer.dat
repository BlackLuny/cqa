YrxLbfiIaa	If this is your daily driver then forget the header....

If your thinking of getting an exhaust, I would definitely get a header. There relatively easy to install and will make the exhaust tone more menacing. Horsepower will increase due to the increased airflow too. I would recommend a highend tuner like HKS, or Greddy if its a tuner. Or Flowmaster or Borla  if domestic.|`|FsT54qh1aa	The header itself will increase horsepower and torque, but it will also let you take full advantage of the gains offered by the free flowing exhaust system. So in short, yes, headers are an excellent upgrade for performance on just about any engine.|`|vRnmthihaa	what kind of car? what size motor?  headers are okay if you can keep the bolts tight, and not burn your spark plugs wires.  a free flowing muffler will help,anything with less back pressure.  the same goes for the air cleaner set up, more flow.|`|GXfgRE24aa	for max performance, yes!!

They are cheaper than the BFG's (by about $120 total), can be had as a load range E (like you really need one that heavy), pre-drilled for studs if you want to run them, have good handling characteristics, and had a very good mileage life.<br>  <br>  I have the BFG's now, also a good tire. I'm running a load range D ( a C range tire is available). <br>  <br>  I get the same fuel economy, and look to be getting a similar life out of them so far. I would be running the Generals on my truck right now if they weren't on back order (and I was hurtin for tires pretty bad).<br>  <br>  The generals were great in the mud/snow. They have a tiny rib inside the tread that helps with keeping 'stuff' from sticking between the lugs.

FsT54qh1aa	If you are asking on here, you probably shouldn't buy it. The reason I say that....is that you aren't going to get the same Honda reliability from it that you would from a factory stock Honda. Turbo cars and cars heavily modified like that are going to require a lot more attention and a lot more repairs than something that is stock. If you are prepared to really dive into it, and to learn all about the mechanics and how to make repairs and adjustments yourself, go for it. If not, you should probably pass on this car and just buy something that was more fun from the factory to begin with...|`|pcV6EgUMaa	I have to agree with Jordan C.  Chances are this person has run this car into the ground racing it (because obviously that is why he/she put the aftermarket into it).  I wouldn't buy it if it were me?  I mean yeah, the price is ok for what it has, but, you may put more money into it fixing what may be wrong with it than it's worth for a 12 year old car?

5FVyVS9vaa	At thec rate they do things in this country, we will still be fighting about gas prices.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	no<br>  <br>  already in 2010 and 2011, a couple of "major" manufactures are planning on releasing fully electric vehicles. after that, there will be many more.<br>  <br>  but there are also a few small manufactures releasing electric cars. for example, tesla is a small manufacture that currently only makes one car which is an electric sports car called "tesla roadster". but this march, they're releasing an electric sedan that's supposed to compete with the BMW M-series. its gonna cost around $60 000. after that, the money from that is going towards another sedan that they're making that will be avaliable for the average person for around $20 000.<br>  <br>  so i would say that the future will be electric. gasoline will be a thing of the pass. with high gas prices and horrible air quality, gasoline engines have their years numbered.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: why would electric cars be a bad idea? they will always be cheaper to run than anything liquid fueled. plus, you could always fuel it for free if you supplied your own electricity. also, you could always plug it in at home. waaaay more convenient than going to a filling station. also, there's no other mode of transport that's more efficient than electric motors. besides, zero emissions. even biodiesel emits some emmisions. hydrogen has no emissions, but its not as efficient as electric motors.|`|jyRZIS3iaa	I'm sure we'll see something different.

Los autos importados a Mexico son 10 a?os anteriores al a?o actual y mecanicamente dieron ya "sus mejores a?os" antes de un mantenimiento mecanico TOTAL.<br>  <br>  Esteticamente se ven mucho mejor cuidados que en nuestros paises pero basta ver el kilometraje, son autos arriba de 90,000 millas (144,000km)  ?Que confianza te daria un auto asi en tu pais? ?Te imaginas el costo de reposicion de piezas mecanicas? Te comento:<br>  <br>  -Revisa si tiene tratado comercial Argentina con USA o Mexico, es la base para que lo importes directamente o via Mexico.<br>  -Si el caso es desde Mexico puedes hacerlo OUT_BOUND y no pagar impuestos en Mex.<br>  -La importacion seria pues via maritima desde el puerto de >Manzanillo, Col. Mexico<br>  -El costo es de aproximadamente $680.00 Usd mas gastos de tramitasion aduanal y llegaria a tu pais en 6 semanas(hablando de un transporte con 2 escalas)<br>  <br>  Suerte y como ves sera un problema logistico!|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Creo que es mejor comprar un auto en tu país con ese dinero.

Judging by the amount of accidents each year, and some posted questions here on yahoo (nothing personal against anybody) it's still pretty challenging for some people.  They put safety features in cars because not everybody is a professional race driver.  A lot of people really don't know what they are doing when driving.  So they make safer cars for the safety of the driver and people around him/her.|`|8a3b8c2d0bf2588ca36da8204c43602caa	The new cars are crap. They aren't a real driving experience. They have traction control and power steering and power brakes and front wheel drive and four wheel drive and they are packed with safety features. That is why people who really enjoy a good ride tend to gravitate towards something like a Dodge Viper. It doesn't have any of the wimpy features that modern cars have. And the inside of the car doesn't have any stupid features such as cupholders. It drives like a muscle car should drive.

M2ISWWIkaa	I drive a 1997 Ford Expedition and that happened to me too. Supposedly, it happens on a lot of Fords that old. Mine turned out to be a loose wire going to the odometer; I don't know how that happened. But if the odometer actually WAS broken in my case, then the only thing I could have done was to get one from a junkyard from the same model (because Ford had discontinued making the odometer part for my model). I would've also had to live with the mileage reading on the junkyard odometer, which all read different mileages. Try calling your dealership to see if they have a '94 5.0 odometer in stock. If the part is discontinued, you will just have to start calling around the junkyards! hope I could help; good luck.

rcWvvU79aa	Jeeps have an engine immobilizer, wont let you  start the engine if the alarm is going off, nice anti-theft feature there. Put the key in drivers door, turn left then right, see if that disables the alarm. If it doesnt, go to the passenger door and try turning right then left. If that doesnt work, do the same with the liftgate. Either of these should disable the alarm, or at least it has on all the previous models. The reason it may not work in the drivers door is because its the most commonly used door lock and so it wears out faster.|`|FKjXQWNGaa	Did you unlock it from the drivers door or another door. the key shouldn't set it off if from the drivers door.  check and replace the battery in the remote.

Didn't know what size or type and told me that all motorcycle wheels are the same size. He did, however, know he had a Honda.

Nothing wrong with the bike he just didn't like it any more. When I explained that he couldn't do this he stormed off threatening me with legal action. <br>  <br>  The final straw was a customer (another Kawasaki rider !) came in because his ZX10 was a bit wobbly. I looked it over and told him his forks had been put together wrongly and were out of line.

AA10724010	Easy, the Hyundai Sonata is by far the best value among these.  1st its 4 years newer and still has factory warranty, 2nd it has 1/2 the miles of the other 2, 3rd Hyundai is more reliable then Nissan/Mazda.  A bumper cost a few hundred to replace, not a big deal.  All these vehicles are well priced, depending on the engine and features.<br>  I would have a mechanic look at any used car to check for what's really wrong and in need of maintenance/repair.  The newer and less miles is always better.  We own a 2000 Nissan Quest SE and it was perfect from 49,000 until about 105,000 miles, then we starting needing to spend money on repairs as parts wear out after 6-8 years and over 100,000 miles.|`|6bP9CEqMaa	All of those makes/manufacture are good quality cars and should last a long time with regular preventative maintenance.

SOfbIOzUaa	If it is an LX sedan and it is clean then it is worth $5250 at it's trade-in value. Clean Retail is $6625 where I live in NE PA.<br>  <br>  This is according to NADA book which is what the insurance industry uses.  <a href="http://www.nadaguides.com/usedcars.aspx?LI=1-21-1-5013-0-0-0&l=1&w=21&p=1&f=5014&m=1195&d=582&y=1998&c=16&vi=8014&z=18458&da=-1&mi=85000" rel="nofollow">http://www.nadaguides.com/usedcars.aspx?...</a><br>  <br>  I recently paid $5300 for a 1996 Accord LX wagon with 42,296 miles on it. I also know a fellow that was looking to sell a 1995 Accord EX wagon for $3000 with 80,000 miles on it. I would have bought that one in a New York minute if I needed a car.<br>  <br>  Try to verify the mileage with <a href="http://www.carfax.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.carfax.com</a> or <a href="http://www.autocheck.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.autocheck.com</a>  That's what I did before I bought my '96.<br>  <br>  The car should last you another 170,000 miles if it was taken care of and if you continue to take care of it.

Try to find out if it's been done yet or if you are buying it from a dealer tell them they have a deal only IF they put a new belt on it.  That's why I paid $5300 for the '96 I bought. I paid $300 extra for a new timing belt. It may have already been done because Honda says to replace it every 90,000 miles or every 7 years. Better to be safe than sorry though.

While an iceberg probably could do enough damage to a ship to sink it, the likelyhood of a ship hitting an iceberg is much less than it was in the times of the Titanic. Ships now have radar and don't need any light at all to be able to see objects in the water. If a ship was in distress, new guidlines put into effect ensure that there is enough life boats for the capacity of the ship, and lastly, there are many more ships at see and many more ways of communicating a distress call so the likelyhood of being rescued would also increase greatly. While it might not be impossible for a ship to sink at sea from something like an iceberg, I think it's safe to say your odds of survival are very very good. And the odds of getting into such an accident are very very low.|`|AA12136768	Absotutely!!! <br>  <br>  As recently as Nov 2008 --- <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/photogallery/travel/cruise-ship-sinks-off-antarctic/20081113-5y2m.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theage.com.au/photogallery/tr...</a>|`|4KvLIa6Saa	If not sunk they can have extreme damage> But with today's electronics> Radar> and spotters> They have a lot of warning of Ice bergs>And Radio is the best> So not to worry they are well protected>|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	Yes they can but the chances of them hitting one is very slim to none.|`|DrMDxlWMaa	Most certainly! Please know that any vessel afloat can be sank. Vessel weight and speed equal forward momentum or velocity. Icebergs come in many shapes, sizes, configurations. Impacted at the right speed  and direction of impact can and will cause it to sink<br>  Although improvements have been made since the days of the Titanic; there are no "unsinkable"ships or floating vessels! To calm your fears though, they are much improved and it is not nearly so likely. Modern vessels have Radar, Sonar, GPS, Loran, and numerous other electronics. These all tend to forewarn of any potential disasters far in advance of them occurring. These were not available to the Titanic.
YqBFguzpaa	Is that a HND you're studying for?<br>  Follow up the diploma by applying to do a degree in Aeronautical Engineering. I don't know if you'll be able to get funding from the government if you already have a degree, but you may be able to switch onto a degree course from your diploma. Or if you didn't get the maths/physics A levels needed to do a degree in Aero, you can do a 1 year foundation year at uni (or take just those two a levels intensively for a year at a sixth form college) and then go onto the degree course.<br>  <br>  If you do a sandwich course and then apply to all and any firms where you would like to design for your sandwich year, that will get you a big foot in the door for when you graduate. There are some good places abroad you can go to do work for Ferrari or other car designers and BAe Systems have lots of this type of intership style offer -- usually only to graduates or undergraduates though, so you need that degree. Search the internet and go onto company websites to see what opportunites they offer, and even if they don't offer any, write to them and apply.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, just do a degree with no sandwich year - preferably a 4 year Masters course, will make it easier in the end due to competition - and apply for summer internships with companies.<br>  <br>  Persistence wins out in the end. Good luck.|`|Tiph3lQcaa	Most aerospace firms hire many mechanical engineers. The difference in the curriculum between mechanical and aerospace is pretty minor - generally involving a course or two in propulsion and aerodynamics. There is no need to change majors. Keep your grades sufficiently high that you can pursue an internship during the summer months. Look for an internship at an aerospace or automotive firm. there is nothing like real experience to make you more valuable when you graduate. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, things are pretty tight right now - especially in automotive. Check out all the firms you can find on line. Perhaps Rolls Royce jet engines may be looking for interns. Good Luck.|`|0CkFC43raa	check th course curriculum for aerospace engineering. the last time i did this, there were only six upper level classes that were different between the two degree programs. add those to your current degree program and you may be able to get a double major. after that it is proving yourself to a prospective employer.

AA10620246	Unless your A/C compressor is run by a separate belt that you can just remove, I wouldn't risk it. I suspect that it is run by the serpentine belt, which also turns other pulleys (power steering, alternator, etc). If that bearing gives out, and the compressor pulley locks up, it could cause your serpentine belt to break. That could cause serious problems.<br>  <br>   If you want to try to drive all the way home before getting your car fixed, I suggest temporarily installing a shorter serpentine belt that will bypass the compressor. When you get home, you can get it fixed, and install a belt that will turn the A/C pulley, too.

AGQI3NuXaa	throttle, rudder, ailerons and the yoke. the basics.|`|YqBFguzpaa	For a small propeller plane the basics are with the control column, rudder pedals and throttle.<br>  <br>  There is a control column, or stick, that controls the ailerons on the wings, which is the main way to turn the plane by making the plane roll either to the left or the right (by changing the amount of lift produced on each wing).<br>  The control column also controls the elevator on the tail, which is the main way to control climbing and descending. It will make the plane pitch upwards when you pull it towards you, or pitch downwards when you push it away from you.<br>  <br>  Then there are two rudder pedals which do a similar thing to control the forces on the tailplane and makes the plane nose move to the left or right in flight, which you usually use to keep the plane from turning too much in a roll, or from turning when you change how fast the propeller is rotating (ie. by changing throttle settings).<br>  <br>  Then there's the throttle which controls how much power you give to the propeller, which controls how fast the propeller spins and thence how fast the plane moves through the air. This is usually adjusted to be high power in a take off or when the plane is ascending steeply, slightly lower power in cruising flight to save on fuel, and often lower power on descent so the plane doesn't go so fast it could damage the aircraft.|`|0CkFC43raa	the simple answer is very carefully, remembering these rules;<br>  <br>  thou shalt maintain thine airspeed lest the ground reach up and smite thee.<br>  <br>  the three things that are useless to a pilot;<br>  <br>  altitude above<br>  runway behind<br>  fuel in the truck<br>  <br>  beyond that you need lessons in flying an airplane as even the basic explanation is rather long and involved.|`|6jWChPf2aa	I hope you aren't trying to fly a plane right now...<br>  Anyways, it's a very complicated process to explain over Y!

b8cupXj7aa	Prior to starting the maneuver,  the flaps and gear (if retractable) should be in the UP position, power set to cruise condition, and the airspace behind and above clear of other air traffic. The maneuver should be entered from straight-and-level flight (or a shallow dive) and at a speed no greater than the maximum entry speed recommended by the manufacturer—in most cases not above the airplane’s design maneuvering speed (VA).<br>  <br>  After the appropriate airspeed and power setting have been established,  smoothly enter a coordinated turn with an angle of bank appropriate for the airplane being flown. Normally, this angle of bank should not exceed approximately 30°. After the appropriate bank is established, a climbing turn should be started by smoothly applying back-elevator pressure to increase the pitch attitude at a constant rate and to attain the highest pitch attitude as 90° of turn is completed. As the climb is initiated in airplanes with fixed-pitch propellers, full throttle may be applied, but is applied gradually so that the maximum allowable r.p.m. is not exceeded. In airplanes with constant-speed propellers, power may be left at the normal cruise setting.<br>  <br>  Once the bank has been established, the angle of bank should remain constant until 90° of turn is completed. Although the degree of bank is fixed during this climbing turn, it may appear to increase and, in fact, actually will tend to increase if allowed to do so as the maneuver continues.<br>  <br>  When the turn has progressed 90° from the original heading, you should begin rolling out of the bank at a constant rate while maintaining a constant-pitch attitude. Since the angle of bank will be decreasing during the rollout, the vertical component of lift will increase slightly. For this reason, it may be necessary to release a slight amount of back-elevator pressure in order to keep the nose of the airplane from rising higher.<br>  <br>  As the wings are being leveled at the completion of 180° of turn, the pitch attitude should be noted by checking the outside references and the attitude indicator. This pitch attitude should be held momentarily while the airplane is at the minimum controllable airspeed. Then the pitch attitude may be gently reduced to return to straight-and-level cruise flight.<br>  <br>  Since the airspeed is constantly decreasing throughout the maneuver, the effects of engine torque become more and more prominent. Therefore, right-rudder pressure is gradually increased to control yaw and maintain a constant rate of turn and to keep the airplane in coordinated flight. You should maintain coordinated flight by the feel of pressures being applied on the controls and by the ball instrument of the turn-and-slip indicator. If coordinated flight is being maintained, the ball will remain in the center of the race.<br>  <br>  To roll out  left, the left aileron must be lowered to raise the left wing. This creates more drag than the aileron on the right wing, resulting in a tendency for the airplane to yaw to the left. With the low airspeed at this point, torque effect tries to make the airplane yaw to the left even more. Thus, there are two forces pulling the airplane’s nose to the left— aileron drag and torque. To maintain coordinated flight, considerable right-rudder pressure is required during the rollout to overcome the effects of aileron drag and torque.<br>  <br>   to the right, when control pressure is applied to begin the rollout, the aileron on the right wing is lowered. This creates more drag on that wing and tends to make the airplane yaw to the right. At the same time, the effect of torque at the lower airspeed is causing the airplane’s nose to yaw to the left. Thus, aileron drag pulling the nose to the right and torque pulling to the left, tend to neutralize each other. If excessive left-rudder pressure is applied, the rollout will be uncoordinated.<br>  <br>  The rollout to the left can usually be accomplished with very little left rudder, since the effects of aileron drag and torque tend to neutralize each other. Releasing some right rudder, which has been applied to correct for torque, will normally give the same effect as applying left-rudder pressure. When the wings become level and the ailerons are neutralized, the aileron drag disappears. Because of the low airspeed and high power, the effects of torque become the more prominent force and must continue to be controlled with rudder pressure.<br>  <br>  A rollout to the left is accomplished mainly by applying aileron pressure. During the rollout, right-rudder pressure should be gradually released, and left rudder applied only as necessary to maintain coordination. Even when the wings are level and aileron pressure is released, right-rudder pressure must be held to counteract torque and hold the nose straight.|`|UO2R7Oruaa	Sorry Honey...

Also if the bulb is exposed, it wont last long.<br>  <br>  If you really need to keep driving, remove the bulb and drive with only the other headlight on, that way you are not blinding the other driver and less likely to get a ticket.  Although  depending on laws in your area, you might get one for having one headlight off but still less likely than if you blind the police.

Keep an eye on the level and top it up if you lose any (due to leaks) to prevent cavitation caused by sucking air when the level gets too low (damages the pump). If there is a sight glass in the tank you will be able to spot any contamination - the oil will show as milky and thick (whereupon change both oil and filter)|`|3TkdQD2Baa	Every 6 months, oil and filter change.

9fB4rrZgaa	Hi Jonny,<br>  <br>  This area can be a bit of a minefield. Firstly, you need to check your phone is compatible with the car. That is, phone model and software level (of the phone) for your model year and spec of car.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bmw.co.uk/bmwuk/bluetooth/compatibility/0,,1312___,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmw.co.uk/bmwuk/bluetooth/com...</a><br>  <br>  I understand that you say it worked ok before, but it can sometimes happen where phones that are not compatible work for a while and then suddenly don't.<br>  <br>  A few things you could try are :<br>  Making sure your messages inbox/sent folders are not full to the brim.<br>  Make sure your phonebook is only as large as required<br>  Use the BMW charge cradle in the centre armrest.<br>  <br>  The problem BMW have had in the past is that phone companies have not always been willing to give up vital infomation with regard to individual bluetooth software on there phones. It is a wide and common misconception that all bluetooth devices are compatible with all other b/tooth devices.<br>  <br>  It is also possible that a vehicle software upgrade (I mean only possible) might improve the situation if your phone is in the compatible list.<br>  <br>  I would be more than happy to help you further, firstly though would need to clarify your model of car/ year/ and vehicle phone package spec (ie do you have an SOS button).<br>  Also the model and software level of your phone.

dQrBlk4qaa	It actually looks like thinned undercoating! That's some crazy stuff they threw on that car. <br>  <br>  Start with straight orange-grease cutter and see if that removes it. Don't leave it on any more than necessary, and wash it off thoroughly after the experiment. <br>  <br>  Next, try some "goof off" or similar stuff that's used to take crayon/tar off of painted surfaces. Again, take your time and test a small area. Any more, and you'll start cutting the clear coat.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	I've never seen that either (and I've seen a lot of stuff).

I've never seen it in the engine compartment.|`|VItj8zdAaa	pretty much anything you spray on it will not only break it down, but also the paint below it.  you're going to be able to remove it with an acid based cleaner, heavily dilluted.  this is not my reccomendation.  leave it alone.|`|v8TWvtQgaa	1st off i'm 90% sure that was NOT factory applied by GM. 1 rust is not and never has been a prob under the hood in the engine bay of a strut type car with the sealed wheel strut towers.

cJPOs7Tsaa	By displacing a greater mass of water than the mass of the ship.|`|BJERgbM5aa	It's called the  "principle of buoyancy".  Google it.|`|U24VtSlZaa	simply put:<br>  <br>  the hull of the ship pushes down on the surface of the water with a force equal to the weight of the ship.<br>  <br>  the surface of the water pushes up on the hull with a force equal to the weight of the water that is displaced (displaced = pushed out of the way).<br>  <br>  when the ship is set down into the ocean, it sinks until it has displaced an amount of water that weighs as much as the ship, and that's the depth at which it floats.<br>  <br>  fresh water weighs around 67 lbs per cubic foot, sea water weighs a little bit more.|`|DrMDxlWMaa	Buoyancy over displacement! A vessel of any size or shape displaces water. Steel or concrete, etc. weighs more than water and will sink. The trick is to keep all exposed openings for water to enter "above waterline". Shape of vessel only allows utilization for certain usage. It does not matter as far as being able to float is concerned. Design criteria is developed around intended usage to make the vessel seaworthy are structural suitable for purpose intended. Oceangoing vessels as compared to dry docks etc. Vessels under powered propulsion must be designed to accommodate that usage. High speed pleasure boats are designed differently than ocean going bulk carriers. If you really want to peak your curiosity; visit a submarine some day. They will blow your mind regarding ability to float!|`|OMEmacEyaa	Any object floats when the weight of the water displaced by the object weighs more than the object.  That is why as a ship is loaded it sinks lower into the water so more weight is displaced.|`|n15cRcjfaa	The shape of the boat helps the boat displace water which has to be a greater than the ships weight.

WHAM and you should be able to just spin the fan off becasue the resistance of a cold fan clutch offers just enough resistance to turn the nut.  Should only take up to 3 smacks.

Try hitting the wrench with a dead blow hammer. If that doesn't work, you need a holding tool that fits over the nuts on the water pump pulley to prevent it from moving while you undo the fan.

hD25pT1Laa	The O2 sensor is part of the engine control system. It monitors that amount of oxygen left in the exhaust to determine if the fuel mixture is too rich or too lean so the computer can adjust the fuel injector pulse width. Running without one will cause a rich condition which will eventually kill the catalytic converter. It will also not run efficiently and is very unlikely to pass emissions testing. The car is not legal in many states the way it is now.<br>  <br>  Depending on the year and model it should be throwing 'Check Engine' codes like this too. If it isn't it makes me wonder what else has been done to the engine management systems.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it monitors the exhaust gases and then sends a signal back to the computer so it can adjust the mixture for it to run right. i would,nt buy it. he could be lieing to you. if someone cut the wire  from the sensor to the computer you would be in a mess and besides that how do you know it,s the 02 sensor. no! stay away from that car and keep looking. sure he would inspect it for you just to get rid of it.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	They help determine, in real time, if the air fuel ratio of a combustion engine is rich or lean. Since oxygen sensors are located in the exhaust stream, they do not directly measure the air or the fuel entering the engine. But when information from oxygen sensors are coupled with information from other sources, they can be used to indirectly determine the air-to-fuel ratio. Closed-loop feedback-controlled fuel injection varies the fuel injector output according to real-time sensor data rather than operating with a predetermined (open-loop) fuel map. In addition to enabling electronic fuel injection to work efficiently<br>  <br>  Tampering with or modifying the signal that the oxygen sensor sends to the engine computer can be detrimental to emissions control and can even damage the vehicle. When the engine is under low-load conditions (such as when accelerating very gently, or maintaining a constant speed), it is operating in "closed-loop mode." This refers to a feedback loop between the ECU and the oxygen sensor(s) in which the ECU adjusts the quantity of fuel and expects to see a resulting change in the response of the oxygen sensor. This loop forces the engine to operate both slightly lean and slightly rich on successive loops, as it attempts to maintain a stoichiometric ratio on average. If modifications cause the engine to run moderately lean, there will be a slight increase in fuel economy, sometimes at the expense of increased NOx emissions, much higher exhaust gas temperatures, and eventual misfires at ultra-lean air-to-fuel ratios. If modifications cause the engine to run rich, then there will be a slight increase in power, but at the risk of decreased fuel economy, and an increase in unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust which causes overheating of the catalytic converter. Long-term operation at very rich mixtures can cause catastrophic failure of the catalytic converter (see backfire). The ECU also controls the spark engine timing along with the fuel injector pulse width, so modifications which alter the engine to operate either too lean or too rich may result in inefficient fuel consumption whenever fuel is ignited too soon or too late in the combustion cycle.<br>  <br>  If It is only used as a show car, the overall choice is yours.|`|AA10562288	It senses the mixture that is emitted by the engine and adjusts the mixture to the specific criteria for that particular engine.

But that doesn't change the fact that attempting to put it into a '99 Grand Am would be stupid.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want a motor you COULD swap in, look at the GM 3800 Series II motor, which is also available supercharged. But you're going to need to do a LOT of learning before tackling any sort of engine swap like that.|`|JjiX0ghYaa	no adapter for this application but there are a few fiairo clubs i ve seen with small block chev motors in them so their is a adapter for that but for the 3.4 ?Them pont.motors are not tall but are wide and will not fit.if You want to spend the money convert over to rear drive and have fun.<br>  <br>  contact your local fiero club ive seen bbc to superchaged northstar v8 in those.i have a prostreet olds cutlass with a diesel that gos low 9's in street trim.let them laugh at that.the new GTO has limited ed.superchaged 392 LT1 sbc.|`|v15npNiUaa	A 5.7L V8 in a space of a 3.4L V6?<br>  whoa!

If it is low, the slosh of the fluid in the reservoir (going over bumps and around turns) can cause the light to come on.<br>  <br>  If the fluid is low, check for any leaks in the system. If none found, check your pad/shoe linings, they are probably worn and may need to be serviced soon.|`|BsMkp3nPaa	there is a switch on the handle or pedal that turns that on make sure the cable is fully releasing and the pedal  or handle fully returns. also check the brake fluid level, some cars light comes on when it's low.|`|cfJmx87Saa	Could be a bad connection or a short in a wire.

Is there adequate compression/check valve settings.<br>  <br>  Each step has specific tasks to determine what is not working in each system.

Yq2CUhtYaa	Good job.<br>  <br>  Taking the course would have gotten the ticket removed from your record.<br>  <br>  As it is, you failed to follow a court order. Which is not a ticket anymore, but a much larger fine. And depending on how they want to go with it, you can be arrested.<br>  <br>  It's no different than skipping a court date, or anything thing else that the court orders you to attend.<br>  <br>  And seeing as you had 90 days to do it....it's not like you didn't have ample opportunity. I say this, because I can almost guess your next question is whether you can get an extension, or forgiveness or something.<br>  <br>  The answer is no.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I would get it done and turn it in to the court ASAP.

You might fall through the cracks and they may not notice or if they notice, you may get arrested (or get a letter to appear in court) and have to pay a larger fine and you missed your chance of having points removed from your driving record by taking that course. If you get a letter to appear in court, I'll show up and explain your reasons for not completing this in time and you might get another chance.

kl6TlrcDaa	It definitely helps your case if you have the dated receipt (for one), and of course since he hit the back of your car it makes it even more so in your favor. depending on the coverage he has, it may or may not be included in the property damage section of the policy...it just depends on the insurer (though you would think by "property damage" it would cover all property damaged) I think there are sometimes fine print stipulations with some providers. Plus you know it also depends on the claims adjuster assigned to your claim, some are more reasonable than others so be nice and non accusatory but not a brown noser either because you were not the one at fault from what it sounds like. You could always take the other driver to small claims court if the insurance tries to screw you over and deny your claim or put it off on your sister's insurance.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	Let's see...you're rear-ended in an accident, both you and your sister sustain injuries (thankfully NOT life-threatening), and you're worried about replacing a HAT?<br>  <br>  The loss of the hat is the LEAST of your worries.

You can't take more than 1 person with you at a time. I mean yeah sure, if you use the car solely for commuting to and from work or something like that. But honestly what other purpose does it serve? My parents drive a Toyota Tercel to and from work 3 to 4 days out of the work week. They get excellent gas mileage and most of the time don't need to put gas in the car for 2 weeks. And when there are 3 of us going to work, there is the back seat for me ride in. 2 person vehicles are great, but that's the problem. They only accommodate 2 people. So say you need to get 3 people somewhere and you only have your little Smart Car. It's going to be times like that, that people would wish they had the car that can accommodate 4 people. There's nothing wrong with creating small economy cars that can take 4 people.|`|ndVtjPKYaa	Because insurance rates are higher for 2 passenger cars.  More importantly, most people don't want to buy a 2 passenger vehicle that is not a sports car.
bqLvWpcZaa	It really depends on which engine and transmission combination is in the Neon.  The 1st generation Neon ( 95-99 ) came with 2 versions of the 2.0L engine, the SOHC and the DOHC as well as 2 transmissions, a 3 speed automatic and a 5 speed manual ( there were actually different versions of the manual as well with different final drive ratios but just to keep it simple, I'll ignore those differences for the time being )<br>  The most frugal combination was the SOHC with the 5 speed manual.  The thirstiest was the DOHC with the 3 speed automatic.<br>  I have a '97 DOHC with a 5 speed stick and the best I've ever managed to get out of it was 42 MPG on the highway.  Just keep in mind that I was really trying for fuel mileage on that trip and that is much higher than average.  Average for me ( equal city and higway mix ), is low 30's|`|eSqsYYoDaa	25 city and 37 highway.<br>  Neons normally make pretty reliable cars and if you just need it for the summer, then this should be good.

Mejor valora la oportunidad de hacer ese viaje. De conocer otro lugar diferente, de vivir esa experiencia. Luego date cuenta que el porcentaje de accidentes de aviación es muy peque?o comparado con los accidentes automóvilisticos. Si piensas negativamente, es mas probable que mueras en un accidente automovilìstico, o en un asalto con violencia, que en un accidente aéreo. La noche previa a tu vuelo, solo piensa en las cosas bellas que te esperan para el viaje. Verás como el miedo disminuye al mínimo. El día que hagas tu vuelo, pide que no te den ventanilla por favor. Llévate un buen libro contigo, tu música favorita y relájate. Si puedes hacer amistad con tus compa?eros de viaje vas a ver como, aunque el viaje dure muchas horas, tu lo vas a disfrutar. Si eres una persona que se marea con facilidad, antes de viajar tómate pastillas contra el mareo. <br>  Espero que estas recomendaciones te sirvan mucho. Buena suerte y buen viaje!

AA12202706	I've been in the car business for 10 years at various levels and I can tell you that salesman work under a "pay plan" that can vary greaty from dealer to dealer. Most pay a % of the gross on the car deal while others may pay a "flat" for each car or they could even make a "mini" if the gross is at or below the invoice of sold car.<br>  Lets say you have a Tahoe that has an MRSP of $36K and and invoice price of $34K. You sell the car for $35K then you might make 20% of the gross on that deal. If you sell it at 34K or lower it's a mini which might pay only $100. If you are on a "flat" you would get paid the same amount on any car you sell.....usually $200.<br>  You can see why it's best to be on commision and sell as close to sticker as possible.<br>  Salesman are also paid unit bonues on a monthly basis.|`|RpJjDqg4aa	well there are two ways a salesman gets paid, there's pay by salary and pay by commission, usually when the company he works for does not know how well the salesman will do they will pay him by commission, that is he is paid by the number of products he sells, however when he makes many sales an the company has confidence in his abilities they may promote him to pay by salary so gets a certain amount of money regardless of how many products he sells|`|WGA54RwOaa	Let's say the sticker price of a car is $35,000.

An employment contract between the salesman and the car dealership dictates exactly how much of the cut from the sale the salesman gets.

Hitting 30 MPG is really good, above that is phenomenal.<br>  <br>  And like I say, it's all context. People are going nuts over Priuses, which, while advertising 50+ MPG, in practice get low 40s (and the cars cost so damn much, and the pollution created in building a Prius is FAR excessive to building a normal car due to the battery packs, which when they go bad are hazardous waste and cannot be recycled), and in the '70s Datsun (now known as Nissan) was selling cars capable of 45+ MPG that were just regular cars, not hybrids, and Volkswagen has been selling Diesel engined cars capable of 50+ MPG since the late '70s as well. <br>  <br>  But that's a whole different rant for a whole different day....|`|dc04176cb569575e20e39d30b185648aaa	Ride a Bicycle and don't worry about gas mileage|`|SOfbIOzUaa	Depends.

The small block Chevy will go into anything, with a little work. Stay away from exotic big blocks unless you have a lot to spend. Look for deals on parts, and subscribe to some catalogs like Jeggs and Summit for your HP parts. If you must keep the engine that came with the car, get it rebuilt by a reputable machine shop, and do not let your shade tree mechanic friends work on the car. Good luck, and welcome to a great club. I drive a 55 Olds super 88, with a 455 Toranado engine that will produce 600 HP.<br>  I have played with the ignition system and installed an MSD digital ignition box with an MSD 48,000 V coil, and street camshaft with Rhodes lifters, headers and cherry Bombs. I am getting 42 mpg highway, if i keep my foot off it.|`|berYSEW7aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao6rmu.jp6Cwa2_bc18SmiHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222114013AAJnAqb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|S4gKPOBOaa	whare are you going to find a 50s car for 5000 dollers?

AA10356243	I'd have it checked by a mechanic to make sure there is no other issues with the vehicle but I've worked, driven, and other many F-150s with 200k+ miles and other normal issues with something with that many miles we haven't seen any real serious abnormal issues as long as you keep it maintained|`|BsMkp3nPaa	i have a 2000 f150 ext cab with 135,000miles. i love this truck and haven't had any major problems. the only thing is there was a recall on the speed controller on all ford trucks from the early 90's till the present. make sure its been taken care of.. the dealer will replace it for free. (it may have been done already but check anyway)|`|AA11516198	miles are miles, makes no difference with the newer vehicles.<br>  someone has drove the hell out of that thing, walk away, now.<br>  it's not just the motor, the whole thing has been 160,000 miles, frame, suspension, everything wears, especially with that mileage.|`|qjg0g5WMaa	seriously just ignore the other person with same name as mine all he does is come to the ford section to rant about how much he hates them, yes if its in the shape you say and the price is good then go for it should run another hundred thousand miles<br>  good luck|`|dpL4YAIiaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

431f4f4660d05d452f7ab879b9cd3dcfaa	Does "full serviced" mean they checked the brake pads or shoes for wear?  Or, did they just do an oil change and chassis lube?   Grinding noise sounds like brakes would be the first place to start looking.   You don't mention how many miles are on the car--- but if you have more than 40,000 on it, and the brakes have not been replaced, I would suspect the brakes might need some work.|`|AA10331789	Even if you drove 15,000 miles a year and your mileage is less than 85,000 miles now, your rear brakes should not be totally worn out to produce the grinding noise. It may be the parking brake mechanism or you may have had a caliper or brake cylinder problem that needs special attention. You will have to have the rear wheels removed and the brakes checked.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://autorepair.about.com/cs/troubleshooting/a/bl302a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://autorepair.about.com/cs/troublesh...</a>|`|aRkYiXtGaa	sounds like your brake sticking a little bit, as you go along it slowly releases|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Sounds like a brake calliper is sticking a bit. Only thing for it is to take off the wheel and investigate. Apply the brakes then try turning the wheel by hand to confirm the noise.|`|O3qsmr82aa	If you have rear disc brakes, it could be a sticky brake caliper.  Clean and lube the caliper slider pins.  If you have rear drum brakes, they may need an adjustment.|`|a47cAPypaa	Sounds like your rear brake pads or shoes are down to the metal, this may have been caused by partially seized brake callipers or wheel cylinders depending on the type of braking system.<br>  GET IT CHECKED QUICK.

Beside worrying about the radiator, be careful not to bend a fan blade while getting it off.|`|d9ECb7N8aa	There are special skinny wrenches for this. The wrenches will fit in between the clutch and water pump to hold the pump shaft so that you can break loose the clutch. It is a real pain...<br>  <br>  I ended up just removing the water pump with the fan still attached (it took a little effort but it did fit). I had to redneck engineer; I opened up the bad water pump and welded the impeller to the housing so that it wouldn't spin, then a big wrench on the clutch got it removed without any damage. Sounds stupid, but it worked.|`|OKzU1TJraa	Just remove it from the water pump.It has been on there for awhile so you have to tap on it a bit.just dont puncture the radiator.
7d93fe30ca31c97a74c30356a5a2bb8eaa	8.5 mm will be fine. This is .334" and standard practice is to use a .339" or even .344". Pipe taps are not particularly fussy on hole size because the thread is tapered. If the hole is slightly larger, you just run the tap a thread or two deeper.|`|431f4f4660d05d452f7ab879b9cd3dcfaa	An 8.5mm would work, a 21/64 would be a few thousandths tight, and an 11/32 would be a few thousandths loose.  Actually the tap drill size for 1/8-27 NPT is a Letter "R".    Any of the ones below will work, but the smaller ones will require you to run the tap deeper a turn or two to get the right thread diameter (1/8-27NPT is a tapered thread)  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  21/64=    .328 thousandths<br>  "Q"=        .332<br>  8.5mm=  .334<br>  "R"=        .339<br>  11/32=    .343|`|ybezyTdSaa	If I were you I would use a bit as close to the size of the whole you need while staying under it.

OjuC3hqHaa	2395 might be a good price.  Depends what needs to be done to the van to keep it running.<br>  <br>  Does it need tires/alignment?  Check the tires for even wear.  A new set for that van will set you back $300-400.<br>  <br>  Are the brakes worn?  Does it stop without making noise?  A brake job on that van could get real close to $1000.<br>  <br>  Was the battery replaced recently?  If it sounds like it struggles to start, you might need a new one.  That's about $100.<br>  <br>  Does the engine look 'wet' anywhere?  Lots of greasy gunk or visible signs of leakage mean something isn't sealing properly, and that will cause the engine to lose oil, oil pressure, coolant, etc.  Replacing a worn gasket somewhere could range from $100 to $1000 depending on the gasket that needs fixin.<br>  <br>  If you do get it, make sure you replace all the cheap/easy stuff - air filter, fuel filter, plugs, plug wires, coolant, oil, etc.<br>  <br>  That van will haul quite a bit of stuff and tows well.  Expect normal mileage when the van is empty to be in the mid to high teens.  If it's fully loaded, you will probably be around 5 to 10 mpg.<br>  <br>  If you are planning on loading it up to the max, make sure the shocks and springs are in decent shape.  With 70k miles, it probably has the OE shocks in there - new shocks will run you about $200.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
nDcSY8UQaa	whats the application? Detroit is the big player in the 2 stroke market and would be your best bet, but be careful the emission laws are getting very stiff and some of the older ones are not going to pass the tier 3 standards, I imagine a new one will be quite expensive

(its free)<br>  <br>  If you have a fiberglass boat the first step is to wash your boat and then use a fiberglass cleaner to remove any wax from the surface.<br>  <br>  Then follow the directions for surface prep for the paint your using. <br>  <br>  One part or two part polyurethane paint works well and comes in many bright colors.<br>  <br>  We have had good results when two people paint at the same time with one using a foam roller and the second person following the first with a high quality brush to even out the paint.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|aw61Lu9baa	actually, it is probably not a good idea to paint your boat if it is fiberglass like most boats. I would recomend gettting some good wax or buffing compound and a buffer, or even better, buff your boat by hand, which is a much better job. My summertime "profession" is waxing and washing boats. I would recomend the Yacht Brite Line of products from Shurhold industries. (pro polish wax or buffing compund)<br>  But the bottom line is you should wax your boat, not paint. <br>  <br>  But if you mean bottompaint, go ahead. Interlux is a good brand of bottom paint. I recomend bottom painting if you keep your boat in the water all summer. <br>  <br>  I hope is answered your question.|`|JjiX0ghYaa	im assuming you don't have Access to spray booth so first sand boat with at least 400 paper first contact local marine sales and purchase.a good quallity paint.be shure to follow directions to the letter.borrow a garage or rent one for their is allot of new EPA laws.Out of sight out of mind.|`|BarjvQpTaa	go to shipshapetv.com they did an episode on a brush on product that seemed to work well. john (the host of the show) really knows his stuff, and if he endorses it, i trust it.

The boat will need to be registered with the state just like a car.  Some fish require a special license (tarpon tags) in order to catch them.  Most fish also have regulations for size and/or weight.  Be sure to read the rules of the state where you are fishing (home port) so that when you come back from your trip and get stopped by the Fish and Wildlife you will know the rules.  Otherwise you could end up having your boat confiscated and you could end up with Jail time or a fine.  <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|OMEmacEyaa	There is not currently an "operator's" license, but legislators keep making noises about requiring one, so that may change.  This is true if you do not carry passengers for hire.  In that case you must be licensed.

TdrgZwnoaa	Your oil will be fine for a 6,000 mile trip. Don't worry about it. We have one car that is driven regularly on the highway and we use 7,500 mile oil change intervals. Quite a few consumer groups are recommending this nowadays. All our other vehicles get their oil changed at 5,000-6,000 mile intervals.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Look in your owners manual and see what it recommends as the oil change interval for highway driving, You can probably find some sort of quick lube place along the way to get it changed.

Find some Quick Lube type place, along the way, somewhere with a restaurant in sight and have it done while you wash your face and hands, grab a bite to eat, play a video game and drop a quarter in the gumball machine.  By the time you do al this, your car will have been done fifteen minutes ago.<br>  <br>  You don't have to do it at EXACTLY 3,000 miles, but you don't have to wait until the end of the trip.  The thing is, that nothing will probably go wrong if you wait to the end of the trip, but it would be a shame if something did happen to spoil your trip.  And stopping to get it done while you eat won't "inconveinence" you any more that stopping to eat anyway.<br>  <br>  Be smart.  Be safe.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	older cars say 3000 or 3 months.<br>  newer cars are 5000 miles now.<br>  maybe mapquest where you'll be in 5000 miles<br>  and find a dealer there.  <br>  rent a car and leave it up to them instead of putting miles on your car.|`|6uOBkvXRaa	If you car is in good mechanical shape and is not an oil burner, then you may want to try synthetic oil.  Most synthetic oils can run 6,000 miles or more before an oil change is required.  You can also find oil filters that are rated for extended oil changes.<br>  <br>  I run synthetic oil in both of our vehicles and change oil between 6,000 and 7,500 miles.  <br>  <br>  I have experienced better fuel economy by running synthetic oil.<br>  <br>  Its also a good idea to check the oil level several times when going on a long trip, and carry an extra quart of oil in case you need to top off the oil.|`|AA11264416	well depends on when you last did the oil change, if it was recent then you'll be fine with going 6,000 miles and then changing it when you get back, if you have at least 2,000 miles on the oil you have now i'd change it before you leave and then again when you get back

It will pay to to also upgrade the ignition to an HEI setup, and a cam/lifter setup too.

'95 and older, stay away from them.  the '96 and newer are fantastic cars that will get you between 24 and 30 highway mpg.  but remember, it's all about how you drive it.  keep it light and unloaded, practice slow acceleration and learn to anticipate stops to conserve fuel.  change the oil every 3000 miles and keep an eye on your lower intake manifold gaskets.  take it to a dealership to get the maintenence performed and keep it maintained.  yes it's going to cost you, but in the long run, it's cheaper than dishing out for a new vehicle or costly engine repairs or transmission repairs due to neglect.|`|lh7RwPqcaa	Go to www.fueleconomy.gov|`|ndVtjPKYaa	go to www.vehix.com click on research and then compare.

Could be bad starter, corroded battery cable ends, corroded cables internally, bad battery, bad alternator, bad wiring, or an ignition switch problem. This is not a do it yourself job if you dont have the proper diagnostic equipment. As far as your second question, the threads in the head are junk. I'd put a heli-coil in it and sell it asap.|`|rvt7wlIWaa	Having the spark plug leads jumping off wouldn't help but it sounds like you probably have a problem with your starter motor. Which you will probably need a auto electricain to check and be rebuilt if that is the case. If you can roll start it is most likely to be the starter motor.|`|VrPTLsecaa	The spark plug problem could have something to do with it, but it sounds more like you need an alternator.

You can fab or buy the holding tool.  <br>  <br>  Sir Tools sells the holding tool, #3008.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Well your 32mm wrench is likely not going to get onto the "nut" becasue it requires a very skinny one.

ooTfG1e9aa	Wouldn't have a clue on how to make one at home. I own a unit I bought from Snap-On.<br>  <br>  One thing to remember when you build this unit - the pressurized gas that you use to force the smoke through the evap system needs to be an inert gas, such as nitrogen. Using compressed air is extremely dangerous, as you are flooding the fuel system with available oxygen and if there is a spark introduced inside the vapor field, a catastrophic explosion could occur, resulting in significant property damage, personal injury, and possibly death.<br>  <br>  I know of a few mechanics that said they didn't need to use nitrogen and have burned cars up and their shops as well. <br>  <br>  Be careful! It may not be worth the risk unless you take the safety factors into consideration. This is why I invested in a professional machine.<br>  <br>  If you want to make the repairs yourself, you may consider using a shop for the diagnostics and make the repairs yourself.|`|AA12095978	they cost around $400 and are worth it..<br>  they don't pump nitrogen or oxygen, they should be heating up baby oil and pushing that via compressed air.

The statistics about teenage drivers aren’t good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.<br>  <br>  For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.<br>  <br>  However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughter’s auto insurance in the future.<br>  <br>  The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.<br>  <br>  Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.<br>  <br>  Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.<br>  <br>  Did you know: If you’re adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.<br>  <br>  Go to: www.insurance4lessdirect.com|`|SJc2qlzXaa	Check out National Car Insurance.

The others scored 4/5. This was in Front and rear crash tests.<br>  All of these SUV's failed the side crash tests with 1/5 and 2/5 stars.<br>  <br>  Subaru Impreza, Volkswagen Jetta, Volvo S40 or S60, Audi A4 are all safer cars. The Subaru and Audi can come in AWD if you need an AWD car.|`|MekUlyGpaa	they are safe as long as you don't try to take a corner at 80 <br>  my boyfriend works at a salvage yard and he said that the one's that have come in there have been in wrecks are not badly damaged and that they hold up pretty good i think most vehicles are safe what is not safe is some of the drivers that are around us|`|iz9hzHN7aa	I'm not sure about crash test ratings. Buy all SUVs are heavy with a high center of gravity, which means they are harder to stop, less maneuverable, and more likely to roll over. If safety is you main concern, you should choose a car/station wagon/cossover that is less likely to be in a accident.

2yrEjfmLaa	you would be better off with a trailer camper. You have a short box ( not many campers for that) and you have the smallest engine ( they weigh alot.) not a good combo. your big cab and 4x4 is using up most of the real cargo capacity of that truck. Sorry but it is not really ideal setup for truck camper. cwr is what you can haul in the box not including the people weight. you are kind of stuck with the smallest lightweight models of slideins. you can haul more than they say but it is going to be harder on your truck.

OblSdMaaaa	Nope. <br>  <br>  You will save money buy getting your own transponder (2 per month or $20 per year).  Rates are based on your vehicle weight (cars/pretty city trucks, etc. are in the lowest category) and the time of day you use the 407.   They charge extra for use of the highway during peak times.  Check out their website for actual rates.  <br>  <br>  Ask your co-op supervisor if you can work earlier shifts that will allow you to beat the majority of the traffic on the 401.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	I'm not aware of the 407 offering any sort of monthly pass...

surVEjh4aa	We need more information. Is your family flying to FL (and driving only in FL) or are you driving a rented vehicle from Point A to FL?<br>  <br>  You really need to check with the rental company. My sister totaled my car in PA when I was 23 and I had to pay a ridiculous fee in order to rent. Your parents would have to add you as a driver to the rental agreement, but this could blow their rates out of the water. If you are not on the agreement, you have to be extremely careful since an accident could nullify insurance coverage and your parents could get financially hurt if you are pulled over and not on the rental agreement.|`|1OmSZUvLaa	For the major car rental brands, all additional drivers (other than your parents) must be 25 or over, with a valid drivers license and a credit card in their own name.  All additional drivers must complete and sign an additional driver form at the rental counter.|`|k10O80XYaa	legally you have to be on the lease/rental agreement|`|AA11792537	Jolly Wheels has pretty low rates for young drivers.

aeiP74PLaa	Let your insurance handle it. Your limits are fine based details of the accident(don't ever tell anyone your policy limits by the way).  You can apologize to the guy of you want but don't discuss the accident.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Are you asking, how badly injured was this person?  No one here can know. <br>  <br>  If you're asking, do you have enough coverage?  Probably not.  It's not too hard to wrack up $25,000 in medical costs, and that's the most your insurance company is going to pay, because that's your policy limit.  A week off work, a couple MRI's, a dozen visits to a chiropractor, and some physical therapy, and you're going to be writing some checks for the difference, however much THAT is.<br>  <br>  You can't do ANYTHING, at this point in time.  Now it's up to your insurer.  <br>  <br>  But you SHOULD call your company, and increase your limit of coverage to $100,000/$300,000, so that if it happens again, at least YOU don't have to pay for it.|`|5CPgTpXeaa	sorry to hear about that. but worrying about the other person is just a sign that you are human and have emotions. if you want you can get in contact with the person to find out their status through the officer that handled your police report.  if his claim goes over what you pay for in your premium then one of two things will happen. your isnrauce will go up, (but its best to change teh bodliy injury anyway.) or they will drop you

Even though you signed up on the 19th, it does not take effect until 12:00am on the 20th.  As far as the fraud investigation goes that is a normal procedure given your circumstances because so many people get into an accident without insurance, get insurance after the fact and then try to make a claim.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	It's not  a stall tactic,  <br>  <br>  No matter which company you had gone with, if you had gotten into an accident the first 24 hours, with ANY of them, they would all be investigating, to see if you were lying about the date of the accdent.  <br>  <br>  It's probably not going to take six months - but it probably WILL take six weeks.  As long as the police were at the scene of the accident, and can corroborate the date/time of the accident, this will be covered.|`|dip4oxB5aa	If you have any paper documentation including in an email that states your policy began on the 19th, and you have a payment record of paying for the policy before that time then......get a lawyer and go after them right now!

HwUfcYsAaa	Replace the engine with the exact same engine from the manufacturer.  It will be much easier and cheaper in the long run.  All of the parts are still available, and you can re-use some of the ones that are on the car currently (starter, alternator, manifolds, etc...).  A dealer would be the best bet, but it will cost you.  The replacement is probably going to be a re-manufactured engine.  You are looking at $5000 or more I would guess.|`|7Zw1cEmPaa	All details are on their home page.

WsKUEgQraa	Nope. Without a mandrel you will crease the pipe.Remove the pipe and take it to a muffler shop.Be aware bending it will ruin the chrome if it's plated.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Generally not. You will probably get cracks or flatten out the roundness and restrict the gas flow. In smaller tubing some have filled the pipe with sand and put a spring on the outside to keep a bulge from forming. This will take a stupendous amount of effort to accomplish however.If your pipes are Chrome plated the chrome will crack and peel off at the bend.|`|chHPoiThaa	The only way without a proper bending machine would be to cut out small V shapes, your cuts just slightly exceeding the centre of the tube, bending closed and take it someone that can weld because it will have to be welded with a specific type of weld.<br>  <a href="http://forum.doityourself.com/welding-metalworking/235960-welding-stainless-exhaust.html" rel="nofollow">http://forum.doityourself.com/welding-me...</a><br>  ___..___<br>  ___\/___|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	You can't.<br>  <br>  Heating it with an oxyacet torch might just about do it but you'd have to get it very very hot and without a former inside it would probably kink or narrow at the bend.<br>  <br>  Easiest soloution is to go to a place that makes custom exhausts and get them to bend it for you.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	to prevent the pipes from deforming or kinking fill the pipe with sand first them use brute strength to bend the pipe,but to be honest why not hire a pipe bender for a couple of days its real cheap|`|hbgHoZlTaa	you can heat it and bent it using another smaller pipe

U9bQgfY9aa	The insurance company as part of their service should arrange for a wrecking yard to take it away.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	What country do you reside in?  Every country's air force is very different in how they recruit potential aircrew members.<br>  AFA the US, yes you can get a student license at age 16, and start lessons at 14.  This is VERY different from joining the air force.  To be a pilot in the USAF you have to:<br>  1- Have a Bachelor's Degree<br>  2- Have completed an officer training program (only officers are pilots/navs)<br>  3- Be accepted into and complete pilot training<br>  The above are also true for the USN, USMC, and to a degree the USA<br>  In the US, one can't join the military at 16-you have to be 17 and have parental consent.<br>  No doubt the people you are reading about are taking civilian flying lessons.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	You can be a pilot (in the U.S.) at 17.  You don't need any special education; pilot training is self-contained.  It's like learning to drive a car, only considerably more complex and expensive.  You don't need a special education before learning to drive a car, either.|`|YqBFguzpaa	You need A levels(or equivalent post 16 qualification in your country) to apply for most schemes that offer partial payment towards your flight instruction. If you're paying for it yourself, you can start when you like it's not a problem to start lessons when you're twenty. I've known people start flight school when they're 70 and they loved it.<br>  <br>  You should check the age restrictions in your country for entry into the Air Force as a pilot, there's probably a maximum age you can apply at of something like 22. It is country specific.<br>  <br>  To be a pilot in the military, you do not first have to have done any flght training at all.

kjAWsDwLaa	Normally, only moving violatiions (speeding, red light, etc.,) affect your rates, but not getting a required inspection could affect your eligibility for insurance; it would depend on the company.  Bestter to put it down and not need it than to omit it and find out otherwise..|`|5CPgTpXeaa	yes. it shoudl be reported. its best to be upfront about it even if you don't have to be. because if they run a check and it comes back as a hit, then they can deny you insurance

FzdNZokxaa	when the vehicle CEL is warning you that the there is a speed sensor malfunction,it is then up to the technician to determine if the sensor is bad or there is a wiring problem.it is very unlikely for both the speed sensor and the instrument panel to go bad at the same time.I've been working on Toyotas for many years and I have yet to see both of these components to go bad at the same time.I suggest that you take your vehicle to your Toyota dealership and have it diagnosed by someone who knows what he is doing,and that has the equipment to make the right diagnosis.good luck.

NvCPwSGPaa	The dealer will have nothing to do with your loan.  They sold the car to who ever you have your loan with, so the dealer is out of the loop.  If you have a good salesman that you always deal with then I am sure he would be happy to talk to you.  <br>  <br>  It is always better to pay cash for your purchases unless you can get 0% APR then its like a free loan and who cares how long it takes to pay them off.  <br>  <br>  There are a couple of other things to think about.  How long have you had the loan and do you have established credit already.  If you have established credit then pay it off the loan will not help you.  If this is your largest loan and you have been good on the payments then you should keep the loan for at least 2 years so you season your credit a little bit.<br>  <br>  Creditors do not consider any loans in your past that were not paid on for at least two years, so this can help you next time you go to get a loan and what that 0% or a lower APR.  If you have no history then you are a risk.
bqLvWpcZaa	That depends on how good of a negotiator you are and what type of discounts the manufacturers' currently have.

Yq2CUhtYaa	Blown headgasket, is pretty much it.<br>  <br>  I've had three cars do that, all the exact same cause.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	If you had to replace a radiator, then you probably did over-heat the engine, too. If you are lucky, you can have a professional re-torque your cylinder head. This means loosening and retighteneing each head bolt, one at a time, to reseal the head gasket. If you are NOT lucky, you will have to remove the cylinder head(s), have them restretched and machined, and re-installed. If the smoke goes away when the engine warms up, you have a chance of doing the re-seal. Next issue, why did the engine over-heat in the first place. You must realize that ther is no universal engine coolant. Don't believ those adds on TV. Your engine requires the use of genuine Mitsubishi engine coolant, from the dealer!!! There are special chemicals in the coolant to prevent leaks, radiator clogging, aluminum and plastic melting, and other cooling system woes. Never use the generic green stuff, it WILL cause problems somewhere, I guarantee it. Did you have your water pump and timing belt replaced lately??? At 180,000 miles, you should be on your 3rd set by now. make sure that you have used only genuine Mitsubishi belts, pump, and coolants to prevent future woes. Get Smart!!!!|`|CvRscCrjaa	ya if its steamy white smoke its a head gasket or bad head, sorry.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	the whiteness is water vapor, there is an amount of water vapor formed from burnign gasoline, but excessive water vapor means water is getting into your cylinders and being expelled as steam after being vaporised.  The ONLY other body of water in yoru car is the wiper fluid, and there is no way it is entering the cylinders, the source of water is engine coolant.<br>  <br>  coolant flows through and around your cylinder heads and is kept out by the cylinder walls and the cylinder head gasket.  Thats the only way water can get in so your block/cylinder head is cracked, or your gasket has failed.<br>  <br>  if you replace the cylinder head/gasket, you might as well rebuild the whole engine by dropping the bottom end also, since it is so old, this way you will get much more future use out fo the car, maybe another 50-80k miles easy|`|O3qsmr82aa	Park it 'til you can replace the head gasket.  The white/gray smoke that smells sweet is coolant being burned in the engine.|`|ixbbbVtbaa	blown or cracked head gasket sound right could allso be a cracked blook|`|ybezyTdSaa	The head gasket is what I thought of as soon as I saw white smoke.

e9W9g5tzaa	By going from the stock P235/75R15 tires ( approx 28.9") to the 35" you have effectively changed your gearing by about 21%. Changing your crown and pinion to a 4.10 will bring you closer to your original gearing but still a little higher than original. If available a 4.30 would be a little closer to the original gearing. By putting in the 4.10 or 4.30 you will get more available torque and move your power curve down to the speeds where it is usable to you, right now you are probably finding your truck a real dog and have to step hard on the gas to do anything, lower the gearing back down will improve your driving experience and because you won't have to step so hard on the gas will probably gain mileage.|`|r9H8AXIsaa	You've got 35's and still running 3.55?  No wonder your offroading is light.  You must have to really get on the accelerator to get it moving.<br>  <br>  The 4.10s will help but with those tires, you may want to move to a 4.80 or even a 5.12 if you want better offroading experience.  <br>  <br>  You'll get better acceleration with the 4.11 and I don't think you'll suffer in your gas milage since you're spending a lot of time standing on the accelerator...  Might want to move up to 4.30 or so.|`|lli2UL21aa	It increases the acceleration by a bit. But it also is harder on your car(it wont last as long). 4.10 might be a big high, you might want to try 3.73. Also it will make your MPG go down a couple miles. When your driving at high speeds, your RPMs will be higher than they are now. I was going to do this to my stang until I found out my RPMs are going to be way up when Im on the freeway.|`|ndVtjPKYaa	It would accelerate a lot quicker and make it torquier, but would cut off top end speed and decrease fuel economy
M7G3MZb5aa	even easier, just jump start your car and put a voltmeter on your alternator, no sockets required, if it reads increased voltage when you rev the engine or read 14+volt, your alternator is good, if you see no change in voltage even when reving the engine you need a new alternator.<br>  <br>  USUALLY, to replace an alternator you need to....<br>  -Put wrench on belt tensioner and turn until the belt is loose<br>  -remove belt<br>  -remove clip from alternator<br>  -unbolt alternator<br>  -re-bolt new alternator<br>  -replace wiring clip<br>  -hold open belt tensioner with wrench and replace belt<br>  <br>  -alternator accomplished|`|ndVtjPKYaa	Either your alternator is bad or you have an electrical drain somewhere|`|DQPYoMg1aa	Try this; Take both battery cables off, and touch them together for a few seconds to clear the computer. Put the cables back on, and start the engine. while it is running, take off either battery cable. If the engine keeps running, the alternator is working, if it dies, the alternator is defective. Your local Autozone or Anvance can do a test also.|`|ybezyTdSaa	Jump start your car---- then disconnect negative battery cable, if car stays started than your alt. is good. If the car dies first check fuses and relays 1 may have blown. If those are good your alternator is prob no good<br>  a good auto parts store can test them for you if you take it off the car.
i5lk5eN2aa	Sounds like the gasket between the idle air control valve and throttle body is leaking. The dealer parts department can order that gasket separately from the idle air control valve but at a parts store you will likely have to buy the entire idle air control valve assembly to get the gasket. I suggest you try to tighten the screws which secures the idle air control valve to the throttle body and then smear some high temp RTV silicone around the gasket joint. That will temporarily stop the vacuum leak and if the idle air control valve is otherwise working normally your engine idle will return to normal rpm operation and you will not need to purchase the entire idle air control valve... just the gasket.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Locate and clean your throttle body and idle air control vavle. THese are the usual causes of idling problems. Power wash your engine to clean it to showroom new condition. It makes leaks easier to find, and it improves engine cooling and overall running. Check for the area that "whistles" with the hood open and the engine running. It should be easy. Noises like this do NOT inidicate a bad head gasket, usually. In intake leak is more likely. Good Luck!!!|`|DQPYoMg1aa	I agree, looks like a vacuum leak. check all vacuum lines, and look for leaky gaskets at the intake manifold, To check for leaks here, get one of these little oil cans with a squirter on it. Drop a little around the intake while the engine is running, if there is a leak, you will find it this way. Have someone watch the exhaust pipe while you do this, and look for puffs of smoke.|`|O3qsmr82aa	Could be a vacuum leak around your intake, or a bad idle-air bypass valve.  I doubt its the head gasket unless its blowing whitish smoke out the tailpipe.|`|57129a726b95061531a862a37ebbea17aa	check for a vacuum hose leak. as hoses will get old and break or leak.|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	look for a vacuum leak
RWjvcCYoaa	It depends on the model, options and overall condition of the drivetrain, interior and exterior. Is it an LS or an LT? If it's an LT does it have the 1LT, 2LT or 3LT package? Are there service records for it? Any dents or paint issues? Has it been in an accident? Is the interior clean and not worn, torn or frayed anywhere? <br>  <br>  There's a lot that determines what a vehicle is worth. If you supply that info, it would be easier to determine if it's a good deal.

LamVaAETaa	You need a 350 5.7L engine. If the suburban is an 96+ it will have the Vortec 350 which has more power. Check that the suburban is not a 2500 w/ the 7.4L 454 V8 or 6.5L Turbo diesel.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	look under the hood of both vehicles there should be a decal that says the engine size, either on the underside of the hood or on the rad support.|`|LLDv37qSaa	the above answers are correct........... or start by asking at a parts store like Auto Zone or Napa or any auto parts. They will tell you what varietys were used in your particular Tahoe. . It is very likely that your Tahoe uses a 350 cubic inch V8 motor with possably fuel injection and automatic transmission. or it is also possable that a V6 motor was used , in the above question you need to detemine if yours and theirs is a V6 or V8 and another complication may come in the form of features that either vehicle has ie. air conditioning different smog controls, carburator or fuel injected. however if they were within a year or two of each other, it is likely they have similar components or the same componants, and that IS important when switching their motor into your vehicle because if they lack a componant that your vehicle has as an option such as air conditioning or different electronic ignition components, you may find that the cost of those parts are substantial and its not a " just buy their Suburban and through their motor in your Tahoe"|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	As long as it's the same Liter size ( 5.7L for instance ) it will fit. Also, make sure it's close to the same year. GM has switched the basic design of the 5.7L since '86 and then again in '96 I think. So an older 5.7L wont work with your Fuel Injected '95 5.7L. Or call a junk yard, they will tell you what year vehicles engines will fit your '95 Tahoe.|`|deZdi8e9aa	there is a label under the hood or on the radiator support. You could also look at the 8th digit on the VIN number, if its a R, its a 5.7 engine.

RT8VHWRtaa	Yes the Madass is available in the US. They are distributed by Peirspeed. The 50 is very reliable with good brakes and handling. My only complaint about it is that it is a four stroke engine and VERY underpowered. The 125 model is coming to the US with expected shipment around the end of March early April time frame. I can not report on their reliability but I have been able to ride one of the few in the US. It had everything I loved about the 50 and had great power. I would ride both then decide for yourself which one fits your needs best. As an added note, some of the components are made in China. Over the last year certain Chinese manufacturers have really stepped up their quality. The factory that is making the Sachs parts is a reliable manufacturer. I would not let that scare you off.|`|DydFQ0fcaa	Yes you can and there's 2 engine sizes available, 50cc & 125cc.  I've heard many many good things about the Madass.  They get excellent gas mileage without sacrificing engine performance, have a great braking system and a very well balanced suspension (performance/comfort).|`|hSCcrSdbaa	Here are some links to where to buy them in US.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peirspeed.com/madass125.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.peirspeed.com/madass125.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gekgo.com/sachs_madass.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gekgo.com/sachs_madass.html</a><br>  <br>  I don't know a lot about good or bad, but I do know the engines and many parts are made in China.  This does not bode well for reliability.  Another consideration "Is there a a dealer near where you live?"  All bikes need repair parts now and then, if there is a nearby dealer that will be a positive in making your decision.

431f4f4660d05d452f7ab879b9cd3dcfaa	Additives really don't work all that well to fix oil control problems.   Oil control problems and smoking are usually due to bad/ leaking valve seals, or worn piston rings.   You don't mention the age of the vehicle or the mileage, so I would have your mechanic do a compression test to identify the problem.|`|W0ijrDcuaa	oil is getting into your combustion chambers dou to pistons needing new rings you can try using thicker oil it shouldnt burn as quick most additives thin out your oil letting it easily pass through the piston rings|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	Additives rarely work. Especially with an engine burning oil. Just change your oil and filter and expect it to burn oil a little worse. There is no simple fix for burning oil.
ivH8tRtsaa	While driving very slowly, turn the wheels as sharp as they will turn. If you hear a clicking sound or a waga-waga sound, then the CV joints are bad. In order to replace them, you need to be a fairly descent mechanic or very, very mechanically inclined. They can be a pain in the &%$#. If you feel confident in your abilities and you have access to a wide variety of tools, then I encourage you to give it a shot. The best and most effective tool I have found for these situations is a Chilton's or Haynes' repair manual for the make and model of your car. These repair manuals can be found at any large auto parts retailer. It will have a section detailing the repair step by step. It will also show what tools or specialty tools will be needed for the repair. If, after reading the CV joint replacement section in one of these manuals, you still feel  confident or even semi-confident about attempting the repair, then I salute you for being a like-minded individual. Usually, I attempt repairs even when my confidence has skipped town for the day. Good luck.|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	Click, Click, Click around the corner is a tell tail sign. I wouldn't replace the join as it is easier and quicker to replace the whole axle. I would recommend looking your car up at autozone.com and look at the repair procedure.

YTG3bCeDaa	Look the reality is most American companies got complacent during the 90's and lots of American cars started to look like crap. Look at the mid 90's Cadillac Devilles, for instance, they are literally boxes on wheels. Not a single thing about those cars compliments the Cadillac name, and it didn't help that the interior materials looked like they came out of a Chevy Cavalier <br>  <br>  Needless to say though, one of the best cars I ever owned was a 1994 Crown Victoria. Big, powerful, extremely durable, and surprisingly good on gas!<br>  <br>  Oh I just read your part about the 2007 Taurus-you stole that thing!

Compare that to toyotas. It's a depreciating asset.|`|Rwn0svq0aa	It is no longer clear to the buying public the American car. Cadillac builds a "World car" in its V Series performance cars. The C platform in the Ford Focus is a shared chassis with the Mazda 3.  Ford owns now 20% of Mazda, so isn't Mazda at least part American?  The globalization of the economy has blurred the boundaries of the American car manufacturer since they have chosen to build in Mexico, American cars. The dirty little secret in the automotive industry is that Mexico is now the former Detroit. <br>  To assume the buying public has the sophistication to sort out who is author and origin, would assume to much in this ever changing world. A person or family would have to become a constant reader to know the source and content of the materials of buying American. You would think that one of the most American cars is Ford's Crown Victoria, it is Canadian. And now Chrysler is Fiat and Fiat is Chrysler in someway shape and form to be determined.|`|JCaAqF1vaa	People stopped buying "American" cars when US-based car companies started building cars with crappy parts made in China and Mexico, and building more cars overseas. The people that were buying the cars got laid off because of all the outsourcing, so they could not afford a car. After 30 years of building crap somehow it's surprising that people finally got wise.|`|W7IKifoEaa	Yeah you do have all american cars. Reasons for people not buying the american cars is because Toyota and honda have the most reliable and fuel efficient cars.

Plus the fact that parts are cheaper|`|1SnI86BIaa	because they suck<br>  except for ford|`|SOfbIOzUaa	If you read between the lines, I think you answered your own question.<br>  <br>  Most of the American cars you bought didn't have many miles on them and still don't. Even the 111,697 miles on the Buick is nothing compared to the 250,000 that most Hondas make it to. And look at the prices you paid. Cheap. That tells you something about resale value. I wouldn't buy a new car either if it wasn't going to retain it's value.<br>  <br>  I just bought a '96 Accord LX wagon with 42,296 miles on it and I paid $5000 for it but I'll bet it outlast your 2007 Ford Taurus and I'll bet that when I get rid of it [if I ever do] it will be worth more than your Taurus that you paid more money for and will pay more money for in repairs.

cn0ALwwLaa	OK, I kinda know the answer to this without lokign at the pics. I am going to the New York International Auto Show, and will see a bunch of Lamborghinis.<br>  <br>  I also know a lot about cars, so if you like my info, please shoot me a Best Answer rating, as it is my goal :)<br>  <br>  --- You will not be able to afford a Lamborghini. Even if you lived in Beverly Hills, with your Dad trying to teach you the value of buying things for yourself (semi-effective at age 15, thats more like when you turn 18 and can get your own more, school is number one right now, anyway...) - would you be stretched to buy a Lamborghini -replica.- Yes they do have those, yes they are rare just like a Lamborghini, and they are stripped-down and rebuilt0up custom Pontiac Fieros, and they look like a Lamborghini. No way will you see a Lamborghini for under $40,000, but yes I have made it a point to someday, however it can be done, own one.<br>  <br>  You like the Ford Mustang? OK. Reliability is going to be Mixed, Ford makes that car 'ok.' There is nothing special about it. Looking at one with the V6 for you would make sense. If you like the Ford Mustang and need a sporty car like that, do not be afraid to consider the Chevrolet Camaro. You may not like the Corvette, even though it is faster and cheaper (when bought from around 1992 or the late 80s) than these cars, and looks better.<br>  <br>  Considering Volkswagen Jettas is usually a recommendation to a person looking for a sporty car for around $8000 you can get a decent one. They ARE Sporty, can be maintained and reliability is again OK - it depends on if the previous owner beat on it or not. You can make a car not work by abusing it. BMW M3 is the same thing... from around year 2001, is a very attractive car and very sporty.<br>  <br>  BMW 3-series is regarded as sportiest compact car from Germany, with Jetta 2nd sportiest compact. Audi A4 you may not like, and the Mercedes-Benz C-series is like all Benzes: Not a bad car, but probably too pricey. (Could be wrong on used, but it will be more than the other cars I listed. Guaranteed. For 2001-on, at least,,,)<br>  <br>  American cars, I am coming up short. You might even like an Acura RSX, that is the new Integra, and since it is discontinued, you may like it. Reliability is good not just OK (although the other cars may be Good too, depends on the ACTUAL CAR YOU LOOK AT, lol) and Acuras are girl cars. I caught myself liking the TL, but for someone 15 the RSX is most def a girl car. (Volkswagen Golf is still a better car and more luxurious, and from 1999 on, they are also kinda affordable,. Check them outm I recommend it! Sporty too, in either Turbo 4 or 6 cylinder!) -- Safer than any Acura, too. (size-comparable = Germany wins, Japan is just cheaper.)<br>  <br>  Fuel economy is also gonna be better with something German or Japanese.<br>  <br>  Acura, Infinita, Honda, Toyota, Lexus, Nissan, Subaru, Mitsubishi = Japanese,, might be made in America but they are Japanese makes.<br>  <br>  BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz. Audi, Porsche = German.

I have been doing it for over 22 years now and have worked with some of the biggest names in the business including custom spray jobs for FOOSE designs.<br>  <br>  If you prepare the surface correctly, remove any grease and / or rust before applying your primer coats you will be well on the way to a good finish.  never try to apply in one coat, several light coats is the way to go, and above all....always follow specific instructions provided with your paint.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck with your project.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Never heard of primer that can't be applied to bare metal, I thought that was the reason to have primer to make a bond between the metal and the topcoat.

e2tHoKNQaa	That is like asking if Chevy, Dodge, or Ford is better. But here are some facts...and I work at a quad shop that specializes in motor modification and we make some screamin drag quads and some built up MX quads.<br>  <br>  First off, if you are talking about drags, Banshees are built to drag. 6 gears, 2 stroke is easy to rebuild so you can beef them out, and have always been used to drag.  BUT they have stopped selling them in the US and you would have to buy used or go to Canada and buy one. Raptor700's have been known to make some CRAZY fast drag bikes as well, at my shop we have one that puts out 70+ hp...that quad will pull a wheelie at 60mph, no joke. <br>  <br>  As for a motocross track...any 450 out there on the market today is fast, and any of them can be modded out to be crazy fast. I myself have 2 yfz450s that I race. One has a lot of motorwork and puts out 57HP. If you are talking about all around fast racing then you need to take into consideration the width of the quads...that makes a HUGE difference when cornering. So as far as fast quads the wide ones are the suzuki LTR, ktm450SX, and yamahayfz450R (has to be the R). Those all come race width. As far as motors go, like I said before...all can be cranked out but the yamaha yfz and the honda trx put out the most power when modded out. Out of the box the best performing race quad would be any of the KTM's. <br>  <br>  I hope that answered your question...I can tell you more if you would like....specify your question to help me better answer it if you want more. Have a good one!|`|wCf5iFqCaa	BANSHEE!|`|2FT7sVkbaa	Honda Civic SI,  top speed around 160 mph|`|HfeSTtcPaa	honda trx450er, 450r<br>  banshees suck!!!! my dads freind has one and he soends more time pushing it then he does riding it theres so many problems with them its not even funny... well it is cause they suck yamaha sucks!!!! ride green!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! or red!!!!!!!!!!!!

RXMHqNhsaa	There are actually a couple of Aston Martin four seaters: First of all, there is the Rapide, which hasn't yet been released, but will be by the end of the year - it is a dedicated four seater, with four doors. There is also the DB9 coupe (not the convertible "Volante"), which although only has two doors, has four seats. Just don't expect the rear seats to be accomodating.<br>  <br>  In other brands, don't overlook the Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, which is very desirable, but the looks of it are up to personal taste. My favourite, and much cheaper four seater car that is still outstandingly desirably - the Maserati GranTurismo. It will actually seat 4 in comfort, despite being a coupe, and it's the only thing that looks anywhere near as good as the Aston Martin DB9.<br>  <br>  I've given you URLs to pictures below.|`|8xabuUl6aa	Aston Martin Rapide<br>  Maserati Quattroporte<br>  Bentley Flying Spur<br>  Brabus Rocket<br>  Porsche Panamera<br>  Porsche Cayenne Turbo S<br>  Bentley Continental GT<br>  Maserati GT<br>  Jaguar XFR<br>  Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG<br>  Ferrari 612 Scaglietti<br>  Ferrari California<br>  BMW M5<br>  Porsche 911|`|CSlZg5k3aa	the new ferrari california is pretty nice and barely fits 4 people. the old datsun z cars are verry nice and porsche and aston are making the panamera and the rapide|`|5mS4lMkGaa	Theres the Aston Martin Rapide, The DB9 coupe, and apparently there is a four seat DBS in the making|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	There is a new Aston Martin coming out called the Rapide.<br>  <br>  It will have 4 seats.

PLmfwr7Yaa	It would be almost impossible "to switch cars for awhile", as that would mean transfering ownership and re-insuring the cars. If you just switched, and the other person got into an accident on your insurance, you would be held responsible to pay.<br>  <br>  The best website, that is commercial free that I know is is Craigslist.org. It is a community based website that is specific to nearly every state/province. Alot of times in the car/truck section people are looking to swap vehicles. But do your research first. Go to Blackbook, find the wholesale value for yours, then find the wholesale value for the other vehicle. Make sure it is a fair trade!!
cn0ALwwLaa	They will not be allowed to fail, even if they mess up everything. GM is already asking for $16 Billion more dollars, and they took minimal steps to make better. (They stopped making the ZR1, said they would try to sell Hummer Saab and Saturn. Who couldnt figure that out, with gas prices they were gonna do that anyway,)<br>  <br>  The way the Democrats work is that they will say 'One last time,' until the last time comes. Then there will be a whole new offensive to save them again.<br>  <br>  GM should fky their corporate jet to Japan to try to sell Hummer to Honda. Government would pay for that too. All GM would have to say is 'We are gonna sell Hummer to pay for the Jet.' They would then call that restructuring.<br>  <br>  They should fail, and I am disgusted with the basicness they are calling brains. They asked for $16 Billion more dollars, and they are going to get it.<br>  <br>  Seems $27 Billion wasnt enough. Now that time has passed (2 months?, no one is the wiser.) Sales have not increased either. How is this working?<br>  <br>  Saturn has been GMs new Oldsmobile since Oldsmobile was killed. That is how many car brands GM has. They want to keep a piece of Subaru, yet they arent saying anything about that. They still make the GMC Trailblazer 9-7X (Saab.) Inefficiency at all turns.<br>  <br>  I want them to fail.

Again, nothing will happen.  If it were gournd switch it would have lit with one of the negative terminals.

RbsRpcIyaa	No, you signed paperwork and drove off. The car, the loan, the responsibility is yours. <br>  <br>  And no, you cannot sell the car back and take out a loan for the negative equity. In order for the dealer (or a private party) to take ownership, they'd have to pay the loan off completely before a transfer could take place.<br>  <br>  Unless you could find someone to pay you the amount you owe on the note (and as you alluded to, not much chance of that), you're stuck. <br>  <br>  Might not be the advice you want, but there is no easy way out of a negative equity situation. Unfortunately, Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge's resale value all took a steep nosedive when gas prices took off, and they haven't recovered. With Chrysler in serious financial jeopardy, they probably won't. <br>  <br>  **Side note - Don't set the car on fire. Hopefully you were kidding. Insurance companies are very wise to those situations, and will investigate any they think are arson. Also, you'll still be liable to pay the difference between what you owe and what your insurance deems the car is worth (I assume you don't have gap coverage).<br>  <br>  **Edit - to the poster above me --> No, you cannot go to a dealer, sell the car back for book value, and roll the negative equity into a new loan. The loan must be paid in full for any transfer of ownership to occur.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	You're still going to have to pay that loan, as far as I know. You will get $14,000 (if that, I would take a few thousan of KBB pricing now), and apply it towards your loan.<br>  <br>  You'll then owe $6,000. You can try to call your bank of the issuing loan, and ask them. Or refinance the $6,000 you owe with a new bank, on new terms.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're in this situation, I'm going back to school and just bought a jeep too, it's such an added expense!

There are several things that you have left out here:<br>  How much power do you want to increase?<br>  How much money do you want to spend? (approximately)<br>  What is your level of mechanical experience?<br>  <br>  Several people previous to my post have suggested running premium gas.  Unless your car already specifies the need for this gas, premium gas in and of itself is not going to pick up your power level.<br>  <br>  The first and easiest thing that you can do for a pickup is to install a power chip.  While I am not sure if anyone makes one for this car, you can search the internet to see.  If they do not already have one, possibly they can customize one for you.  We are talking about somewhere around 25HP usually.<br>  <br>  Exhaust system is another good way to increase power but you have to be careful not to put too big a system on this car.  You want to put something on here that will still allow you to have some back-pressure.  Be sure to talk with the tech support people at the mfg as they are a good source of information usually.<br>  <br>  Another relatively painless way to go is with either a turbocharger kit or a centrifugal supercharger kit designed for your particular car.  For performance increase you cannot beat either one of these but you will have to did a little deeper into your budget for them as well.<br>  <br>  Larry|`|3cFKfFifaa	Metalman56 nailed it on the head...

M79W3Ct9aa	You really answered your own question on which is faster.  Turbo usually wins over N/A.  And I consider AWD a big negative.  Adds extra, unneeded weight to the car that would be perfectly fine with a FWD drivetrain.  One thing to remember is that the Acura has a 6 speed tranny.  Honestly I think the Acura will be more fun to drive because of this.  Plus the DSM cars aren't exactly the most reliable of the Japanese.  You know what you get for reliability from Acura/Honda.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	The Acura is much more reliable. Made by Honda.<br>  <br>  And it is a bit quicker.<br>  But if the GSX was brand new, it would win in a drag race, but barely.<br>  Cars lose power after time.<br>  <br>  When the GSX was new, it went from 0-60mph in 6.5 seconds. The RSX does it in 6.7 seconds.<br>  <br>  Mitsubishi's are just as expensive to maintain as Acura's and both cars require Premium gas. The GSX requires premium because of the turbocharger and the Acura requires premium gas because of the high redline.

The can sue for what ever they want to, but that does not mean they will recover for the amount claimed.<br>  <br>  There is really no harm in disclosing your limits.   Your insurance company is not going to settle for anything other than what they feel reasonable.   At some point, if the other party actually files suit for damages which exceed your policy limits, your insurance company will send you "an excess exposure" letter anyway.  <br>  <br>  In NY and MA, the insurance company has to disclose the limits, and they do not need permission from their insured.   Other than greed, the attorney just wants to know if they have to file an Under insured Motorist claim for their client.|`|j3f8m6REaa	I would tell them to bite my a**.

It won't circulate if it's low, if the water pump is busted, or if you have air in the coolant lines that needs to be purged.|`|AA12261615	check the cooling fans on it if they don't work it will over heat no matter how cool it is out side,that or a stuck thermostat will cause one to overheat like that,good luck.|`|zp6FPqWDaa	check to see if the water pump is broken. usually the thermostat and water pump go hand in hand. it happened to me before I hada replace both

0O0YzRH5aa	I think guys in hard hats are hot.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	It's the other way round, faulty alternators damage the batteries. Sounds like the alternator or a wiring problem.|`|AA10331789	I think all the answers are good and you need to actually disconnect and reconnect all the wiring connections to the alternator, especially the ground wires. It's unlikely that all the alternators were defective assuming you have the right part number replacement and your installation is not causing the alternators to fail. I would first have the alternators tested to see if they're in fact defective. They may not be defective. You need electrical troubleshooting beyond your capability.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	This is not a common repair on this vehicle - 5 alternators in 4 months - something is definitely wrong.<br>  It's highly unlikely, but you may have been the lucky recipient of 5 defective alternators. Are these used? Rebuilt? Hopefully you're getting replacements under warranty. <br>  I can only suggest getting this one replaced and having the charging system, grounds and associated wiring thoroughly checked.|`|AA12261615	you may have something as simple as a bad ground wire causing this too happen,what it does is not allow the charging cycle to run a complete course and this over loads the alternator and causes premature failure,check all th ground connections real good on it,chances are you got broken ground wire,good luck.|`|AA11387815	I hope you are buying a quality life-time warranty alternator.<br>  If you have a volt/amp meter, you can check for undue drain between the battery and cable.<br>  Otherwise, I would change the regulator.|`|VoTAmfYLaa	sounds like a electrical problem.  Something is drawing allot from the alternator (which is what the vehicle runs on after the car is started) the battery only is meant to start the vehicle.  You should have a shop check for power draw.|`|zp6FPqWDaa	I'm thinking you should rewire everything that is connected to the alternator. make sure they're all ground properly. Your car might be overworking your alternator somehow...good luck!|`|WNDJR1YHaa	check the starter it may be shorting and check the ground cables tight and clean at all points on motor and body good luck
efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	check your oil pressure and oil pressure sending unit.|`|8AQw9xqBaa	Oil pressure switch is a good thought.  That vintage likely would have 2 senders, one for the dash gauge and the other is for the computer and fuel pump stuff.  The gauge one is typically a single wire larger bell shaped one fairly close to the oil filter.  The computer one will usually be 2 or 3 terminals and higher up on the engine.<br>  <br>  Other thing I would look at is where the ground wire is for the pump.  Its often at the top of the tank where lots of crud collects.|`|sDAFygMpaa	Maybe the PCM is bad.|`|kbcclL8laa	the timing could be off does it try to start but doesnt?
sP98NDi5aa	There is a capacities section in your manual. My guess would be 4-5 qts.

However, on the track Id put my money on the A4.<br>  <br>  TL - 6.7s 0-60   15.2 1/4mile<br>  A4 - 8.9s 0-60   16.5 1/4mile stock, not sure what you get with the APR tune|`|Wb1Kwm99aa	A4 because it's standard. If a person drives well a manual will beat an automatic anyday, as long as they are running similar numbers.
o0oYsQM7aa	If it is financed, you will pay year round for full coverage. Considering your age, it will be pricey. Probably $3000 a year.<br>  <br>  My 25 year old Yamaha FJ1100 cost $70 a year for liability and uninsured motorist. The older they are, the cheaper they are to insure.<br>  <br>  The best thing for you to do is call some insurance agents for quotes. Waste their time, they don't care.|`|246c4887a1d51a98dcfd5795d476a2fcaa	Go to progressiveinsurance.com  and get an on-line quote. Might be better to call their 800 number and tell them exactly what you've said here. The safety school will help.  Will your parents carry you on their automobile policy if you pay up front? You might get a discount doing it that way . Hang in there it's tough going 'till you're 25 or so. Have you considered something like a scooter? A good running 125cc  scooter can run 60 mph and get 90 mpg, it's a lot harder to get in trouble on, And the Insurance is reasonable!  Go to scootertime.net and look around, People used to laugh until gas prices skyrocketed! Now they're riding scooters too! lol!     Gabe|`|VoTAmfYLaa	Your not going to like the rates that any agency offers you because of your age group.  (Choice of machine only added to this)  To offset this cost I strongly suggest a Motorcycle Safety cource and a membership to the American Motocycle Association then if for no other reason so, you can apply they discounts that accompany them to your policy.|`|HfeSTtcPaa	proble a few thousand a year and a new ninja is almost 7k what is daddy gonna buy it?<br>  and if you dont even kow how to ride dont even bother|`|fl60KL8oaa	Anyone here is simply guessing.

If the truck's gross weight is 26,000 lbs or more he needs a CDL. If he hauls hazmat, he needs that endorsement too.|`|XSXg60Vqaa	actually it's a class A if the gross is over 26001 lbs, and by stating it's a HUGE truck I would guess it's a class 8 and needs the class A, it's against the law to have more than one license and it has to be issued from the state in which you reside, all he needs other than that is the endorsements that cover what he's hauling, haz-mat/doubles/tank that sort of crap
