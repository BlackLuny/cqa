AA10558731	It's a scam, and a rather common one. They would send you a bogus money order which you deposit into your bank account. You buy the software and send the rest of the funds (which is actually YOUR money) to the other recipient at which point all contact from them ceases. The money order bounces and you're responsible to the bank for the lost funds, while the scammer pockets your money.    If it was legitimate they would just send you the software & laptop and handle the finances themselves, right? Of course they would.    The only way to be sure would be to give the money order to the bank and ask them to investigate it to make 100% certain it is a legal document before transferring any funds.    But I can guarantee you it will be bogus.|`|393fe9fc7beb572e9469d5d7853f35e3aa	What you can do is google the company and see if there are any complaints against them.

I did transcribing for a doctor for a while from home.    Do not give any personal information out until you see their office and check out their credentials.

I would not give them this information until you prove they are a legitimate business. They should have a business license, and owner history through your city or county records.    Protect yourself, otherwise it may be a legitimate job offer.~~|`|v7Wflu78aa	The $1800 check will be a forgery - maybe good enough to fool most people, including you or me.    By the time your bank knows it's a forged check you will have already sent money to the "shipping agent."    I have actually seen these forged checks, and they looked real to me!!!!|`|qL3dGTXDaa	They want your checking account number. You know, the one that the $1800 will be deposited in. Then that is not the end of it. You will undoubtedly owe them $1800. Stay completely away. It most likely comes out of India.|`|4LsF70cjaa	THIS IS A SCAM!!!!  If you do decide to go for it, deposit the check in your account and forget about it until you have verified that it has cleared.  Then make your purchase.  But think about this.  Why would someone hire you sight unseen to type reports containing sensitive information regarding their customers and not even do a background check?  How are you going to get the "reports"?  By computer?  If they are already on computer, what, exactly, needs to be typed?  Anyway, why send the money to their "forwarder"?  You can buy a computer anywhere.  I am certain that after you cash the check and purchase the $30.00 program the rest of the $1800 goes straight to their pocket and you are left holding the bag at your bank.|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	There is a part of this that sounds suspicious. I have to ask myself, why are they sending  a check for me to buy software and make arrangements with a shipping agent, when they could just as easily do it themselves. Software and laptops are easy enough to send UPS/FedEx, etc.  Whatever you do, do not spend any of your own money on these supplies. Be sure the check clears and the funds are securely in your account before spending anything. That may take a week or so after the $1800m dollar check is deposited.  It may be totally legit, however, there are many scams going around involving worthless checks. They usually revolve around getting someone to pay/send them money that is supposed to be covered by the bogus checks.   Hopefully this is a legitimate offer, but just be careful. They should understand your caution if they indeed are above board.      Good Luck.

It was licensed to the "private sector" ( meaning private citizens and non-government businesses) and later produced as Tang. It became one of the top-selling products in the world 40 years ago.  Now they are transferring the military satellites to the private sector. All the technology to make satellites is now being used to broadcast XM Radio to people's cars and homes..

Errol Quinn  Enrolled Agent   Master Tax Advisor|`|l0uJlMaWaa	No, the early withdrawal will not be tax deductible.      As others have stated you owe tax on the money that is pulled out.  The reason for this is because when you put the money into the 401k it was income that you did not pay tax on.  Since you are now pulling the money out it will be considered income for the year that the distribution was requested.      Most 401k fiduciaries will withold a portion of your withdrawal and send it to the IRS to be credited against your taxes.  This witholding may or may not cover your tax obligations to the withdrawal.  You should receive a 1099 which will explain how much you withdrew, how much was witheld for federal and state tax, and if the money was taken out before age 59.5.

Yeah, it can play games with your credit score for a while, but when you try to borrow money, after you get past the credit score filter, then they check to see what level of indebtedness you can handle and then they reduce that by the unused credit line.

Closing it would eliminate the possibility of fraudulent charges.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Closing an account does not directly affect your credit score.  However:    If this is your only account, it will hurt, because you will be left with no accounts, which is bad.    If this is your oldest account, it will probably hurt, because you will be left with only new accounts, which is also bad, but less so.    If you have accounts older than this one, then closing it may actually help your score, and, if it does hurt, will probably not hurt much.  The only effect, in either case, would be reducing the total of your "available credit" (which can help or hurt depending on how much credit you are using).|`|DV4xyeChaa	another one of those Fuoked up deals...damned if u do or don't..keep it open and they may lower your score because you "could" go into debt...close it and they thing you are a fly by night opening and closing accounts....the World system is screwed...|`|00ad97897648101cc10f52e12966697daa	It's good for your credit to close off accounts.

I believe that to be true. The best in every profession are often among the best paid. Sure, not every job pays the big bucks, but there is an awful lot  to be said for loving your job and the people you work with. At the end of the day, when you can feel good about what you are doing and who you are working with, it makes your paycheck a lot more enjoyable.    I've had jobs where I've made a lot of money but hated the work, and have always regretted it. I've also had jobs where I've made a lot less money but loved the work. And those are the opportunities I recall most fondly.    You will spend about 1/4 of your adult life working - you will be a happier person if you like your job.
neuprBeGaa	Yes, that is probably true.  So far as I've heard, no one in Congress has even proposed a bill to authorize a new stimulus check for taxpayers.  After all, it didn't work last year, so there's little enthusiasm for trying it again this year.|`|G3P5htn7aa	To correct some thing some one said.....the democrats were the ones that voted for the stimulus while not one republican gave it their vote.    House OKs Stimulus Plan Without GOP Support  Bill Now Goes To Senate    Wednesday, January 28, 2009  updated: 9:04 pm EST January 28, 2009  Democrats have pushed an $819 billion economic stimulus package through the House.  The package of spending increases and tax cuts is at the heart of the Obama administration's plan to stimulate the economy.    Not a single Republican voted in favor of the plan, despite President Barack Obama's personal pleas for bipartisan support. The GOP says the plan is flawed.    It was a quick victory for Obama. The legislation includes an estimated $544 billion in federal spending and $275 billion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses.    Wednesday's vote sends the bill to the Senate, where debate could begin as early as Monday on a companion measure already taking shape. Democratic leaders have pledged to have legislation ready for Obama's signature by mid-February.    Obama issued a written statement after the vote, thanking the House for passing the package and promised to "continue to strengthen" the plan as it works its way through congressional approval. He said, in his words, "what we can't do is drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way."    Obama asked Congress to move "swiftly and boldly" to give the legislation final approval.|`|AA10491661	I would not be shocked. democrats historically raise taxes, not give rebates.

IRS personnel are aware of reports that errors in claiming the recovery rebate credit could delay tax refunds for as much as eight to 12 weeks. These reports are false. As the IRS detects and corrects return errors concerning the recovery rebate credit, refund delays are currently no longer than about one week."

0yqQg9CXaa	You are playing a dangerous game by paying the minimum.  Carrying higher balances can destroy your credit rating.  Forget the interest - you are destroying your future.  /|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Each month, the interest is added to your balance and the amount you pay is subtracted.  For example, if your balance was $1000 and then they charged $13 interest, that made your balance $1013, and your payment of $23 will make your balance $990.  If your balance was $1000 after they charged the $13 interest (which means that it was $987 before they charged the $13 interest), then it will be $977 after you pay $23.  (Note that, in either case, your balance after you pay is only $10 less than it was before they charged the interest.)    This assumes that you pay on time.  If you pay late, the additional charge for being late is approximately $35 and your interest rate is increased.|`|U4ABDwKPaa	Your calculation is right. More than half of that $23 is lost to interest, and only $10 is lowering your balance owing.    Actually 15.99% is not bad compared to many credit cards.    But you can see why paying minimum is NOT the way to go. If you have a spare hundred dollars today, put it on the card.   Unless you have no food in your house there is nothing so important that you can't pay down the card.
ig7XgUx9aa	you could tie your business to the area with a name like:  Smith Mountain Boating and Recreation  Smith Mountain Lake Boating and Recreation  that way you create some instant credibility...and it gives you an opportunity to deliver on the perceived credibility.  People are generally quicker to try a company that is tied to a local area or a name they are familiar with.  or...you can go with another name if this is already taken...like Lakeside Boating and Recreation.  Unless you are a huge business that get's a ton of exposure like Apple, Pepsi, etc, it is better to give the prospective customer some sort of clue what you do and what to expect from your company by your name.  If people do a search on the Internet for local companies and get a list...they are more likely to contact a company that you know nothing about based on what they can first anticipate by what they can gather from the name of the company.

The last year's stimulus check's deadline was October 15, 2008 for filing the tax year 2007 taxes. You do not qualify at this point. However, the exception to the rules is that you could not file due to problems such as natural disastars (fire, flood, tornados etc.).|`|AA10469473	With a little luck, if you file tomorrow and get direct deposit, you could get it as early as  Feb. 13.

If you want another credit card, it would make more sense to look for something that offered a rewards program or some other benefit rather than just apply for a brand name.

What is really happening is that the RAL doesn't include any rebate recovery amount, to when the IRS sends you refund to Block's bank, they'll take out the RAL amount and send you the rest.|`|3vHGjuBgaa	Something does not sound right about that. I know that if you received a RAL last year then the IRS would mail your economic stimulus payment, EVEN if you got a direct deposit. BUT, according to this news update from the IRS, they stated that they will only mail out 1 refund check and NOT a separate stimulus check when you file your return this year if you are due the rebate:    "One payment: In addition, the IRS notes taxpayers will receive a single refund that includes any recovery rebate credit to which they are entitled. The IRS will not be issuing separate recovery rebate credit payments."    You should read the whole article, but for that bit of info, scroll towards the bottom of the page!  http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...    I would go back to H & R Block and make sure she actually did your return right.

Then, you need Pay Per Click. It is a powerful tool.     1. It gives you direct response. Sometimes in minutes.    2. You control your budget.    3. You create the ad targeting who you want, naming the city, country etc.    That's one.    Second is a blog to show transparency and brand yourself, as the people's montain lake etc etc. Share your expertise on the blog not your sales pitch.    That way people see you know what you're talking about. Share knowledge and put it in an ebook and make sure your domain name, contact details are in it.    Then give this to people for free by saying, "put your email address and get this ebook packed with solutions to etc etc.    Write articles and submit them to directors. Articles that don't sell your business but your skill. People look for someone who can give them solutions to heir needs.    So what are the problems go through, with lifejackets, anchors, oils etc. Share tips of the day in one of the article, leave a link at bottom of your article and upload to as many article directories.    Do that often and you'll see it work. I get 5,00-10,000 leads just on article writing. Huge more from PPC. I combine both and it works.    Because Blogging, brands you as the solution, the fixer, the one people need to go to for carts, boating supplies, life jackets etc. They know this by seeing your tips, knowledge on your blog.    The more you brand you, with knowledge, the more you're ahead of your competitors who think people care about logo and a website name.    Those days are now becoming over.    PPC (Pay Per Click) takes training but if you're serious about your business, then combine it with a marketing strategy. Because that is what you need really to attract leads, people, customers and the right ones who....won't waste time.    People ready to buy and not just searching for information. Then PPC is the one for you.    That stops gimmicks, lots of time on blogging, lots of time on article writing. But when you got Pay Per Click done, and it runs on its own, then you can combine article writing, videos of yourself, of your business, etc.    Both go hand in hand but PPC is the done for internet marketing and attracting traffic to your website.    Good luck with your business and whatever you do. I can see your business will be needed and you can do it, and attract a lot to your website, everyday.

They should never ask you for any money up front. A great modeling agency can take care of the primary cost up front and they usually work out something with the payment of your head shots in a contract. At your age they will probably start you in something small. Don't worry about acne cause they do a lot of touch up work on the computer and they put make-up on you at the shoot. What they are looking for is someone who is willing to work and learn. Be flexible.

For gaining traffic to your website without cost, you will be looking at some time being spent.    Back links are very important and can arguably be the best way to increase your website exposure. Effective back links are one way links (meaning not a link exchange) from other websites to yours. For example, had you put a link to your website in your question, you would have created a back link as yahoo instantly indexes the Q&A section of their website. Even Google picks it up. You can build back links in placing your url in ads such as craigslist, creating or comenting on blogs on wordpress and myspace as well as other blogging websites. These are all methods that give you white hat back links.    There is also a new website that has grown in Alexa (an independant website ranking company) by over 18,000,000 in just three weeks called www.SayItAloud.com that allows you to write articles that, if they are sponsored, will actually pay you for your article.  They have a sales staff that prmotes your writings to related companies who would be interested in advertising on your site and pay you up to $135 per article.  The site is not officially launched but several people have made money and they have over 200 people writing right now.  You can promote your website in both your profile and articles.  You can use the money you get from there to utilize some paid methods.    Caution: do not pay for your back links through back linking companies. This is considered black hat SEO and will actually drop your ranking or get you suspended all together from the big boys of search engines.    As far as paid methods, look at pay per click as a great option. PPC is the process of advertising your business on a search engine within the sponsored results. You choose what keyword phrases you are willing to pay for being in, I.e. Website design.For cost effectiveness, consider narrowing your results as much as possible. For example, Sacramento website design instead of website design would be a more focused result and would by proxy cost much less than the broad term.    SIA Professional Services has an articles section in their website which has a ton of website marketing tips that should help you at www.siaservices.net just go to their blog or their articles section.    Be sure you are submitting your website on a regular basis, especially whenever you are doing some good updates on your site. The search engines will see your site being updated on a regular basis and index you accordingly. There are some free submission sites, but I have seen in my experience that those don't nearly perform as well on a regular basis as professional SEO and marketing companies.    There is plenty more that you can do, but hopefully this give you a good starting point.    Good Luck and hope this helps.

As an experiment, someone working for a television show once printed a batch of obviously bogus checks that, instead of having a name everywhere it belonged, actually said on them (where a name belonged) that they were counterfeit, and had no problem cashing them at most banks.

After earning an associate's degree (if you start out at a 2-year college), it usually takes 2 additional years to obtain a bachelor's degree, followed by another year and a half, or two years to obtain a master's degree.<br>  <br>  You can read more about how to become an OT here: <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos078.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos078.htm</a>  This is the Occupational Outlook Handbook, an online resource developed by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. <br>  <br>  If you read the entry, you'll also find out what the average salary is. According to the OOH, "Median annual earnings of occupational therapists were $60,470 in May 2006. The middle 50 percent earned between $50,450 and $73,710. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $40,840, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $89,450." <br>  <br>  I am a former speech pathologist who worked for many years with OTs and PTs and assistants.

Generally, you must keep your records that support an item of income or deductions on a tax return until the period of limitations for that return runs out.<br>  <br>  The period of limitations is the period of time in which you can amend your tax return to claim a credit or refund, or that the IRS can assess additional tax. The below information contains the periods of limitations that apply to income tax returns. Unless otherwise stated, the years refer to the period after the return was filed. Returns filed before the due date are treated as filed on the due date.<br>  <br>  Note: Keep copies of your filed tax returns. They help in preparing future tax returns and making computations if you file an amended return.<br>  <br>  You owe additional tax and situations (2), (3), and (4), below, do not apply to you; keep records for 3 years.<br>  You do not report income that you should report, and it is more than 25% of the gross income shown on your return; keep records for 6 years.<br>  You file a fraudulent return; keep records indefinitely.<br>  You do not file a return; keep records indefinitely.<br>  You file a claim for credit or refund* after you file your return; keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.<br>  You file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction; keep records for 7 years.<br>  Keep all employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid, whichever is later."|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	1040EZ, no credits, no deductions, 4 years.  (The law is 3 years from when you filed, but round to 4 so you don't have to think about exactly when you filed during the year.)<br>  <br>  1040 with self-employment income, stocks, bond, deductions, credits, family, etc, 7 years.<br>  <br>  And note, if you have an asset, you keep the records until 7 years after you sell the asset.|`|a25b07195c87675c64d24ddb7cd54d00aa	The IRS recommends 3 years but most CPAs I know say 7 years.|`|a9Syspyiaa	Keep them for 7 years.
UO2R7Oruaa	A resume is not necessary at this time. The restaurant, store, or theater should have an application form online or at the location. Just fill it out and follow up with calls.<br>  At this age there is little you can put on a resume so just fill out an application and follow up.<br>  Good luck.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	It will be quite a short one, but do it anyway for the practise!|`|X8ntjNO6aa	Ashley, It is not necessary to have work experience included in your resume. Honesty, works well with others and other such tags are things that all employers are looking for in a job applicant. I am sure experience in school, church or community activities listed in your resume would be very attractive. You may want to document it with letters from people who know you through these pursuits. At very least it will prepare you for the future. It is a good idea to have a resume and will put you ahead of others who do not.  Best of luck.|`|AA11315360	No LOL. You dont have a resume anyway. You cant make one.<br>  <br>  A resume shows education (you dont have a HS diploma yet or any college so you have no real education to put on it). And also a resume has past work history which you dont have.<br>  <br>  No you walk into a store and fill out an application.|`|cj32tL1Yaa	No, you don't need a resume and shouldn't use one (yet).  The places you are talking about will have job applications for you to fill out.  They generally will require you to fill out one of their applications anyway and will not accept a resume in its place.  Just fill the application out and turn them in.  Restaurants, theater, etc are not expecting resumes from applicants, and since you have no previous experience it may be viewed strangely.  <br>  <br>  A resume needs to be tailored to the position that you are seeking.  For example, most dishwasher  positions at a restaurant are not going to need a resume (they will just have a job application).  But for a manager position for the same restaurant, it might be more appropriate to have a resume.  Resumes don't generally work for entry-level positions.  They are also pointless when you don't have any experience or specific education to support it.<br>  <br>  I
t57Gp7MEaa	If you fund your business with your personal credit cards you would be 100% responsible for any outstanding balance even if your company fails since they are your personal cards.     If you want your personal assets to be protected, setup your business as a corporation, LLC, or LLP. Then fund your business with cash or some other form of capital separate from your personal funds.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Matt using a credit card to fund a business start up is crazy, the interest rate on credit cards is punitive.  Unless you want to be a window cleaner or something like that you will start your business with a big debt at a high interest rate and in a time of grave economic uncertainty.  Don't do it mate.|`|Ct8UtbnUaa	Very strongly recommend you speak to your bank manager/financial adviser or similar before going through with something that already sounds destined to fail and potentially leave you in a desperately miserable situation, (I'm hoping there's no other family you're dragging into this).    This question shows little understanding of any kind in terms of establishing a business, however good the product or idea you have might be.  Get help or advice from someone who can help you or get on line, go to some kind of business study group as an evening class or similar.  Whatever you do, don't secure loans against property or stick loans on credit cards, if you have something the world is waiting for things will happen.|`|tI7Ovsq5aa	Starting a business with credit cards is extremely risky and is more likely to leave you flat on your face. Have you tried putting together a business plan and talking to the banks about a business loan? If you went bankrupt you would lose more than the credit cards or business as they would want to know about your personal belongings too. Anything you own is liable to be sold to pay them back. I looked into bankruptcy as my business at the time was struggling but decided against it as there was too much too lose. Thankfully, I have pulled myself out of a hole and am back on track with lots of hard work and determination. The only way it wouldn't affect your personal stuff is if you were a limited company. (As far as I understand it) The business assets only would then be affected.|`|f0NFwXxwaa	Hi,          I have had a business and it didn't work out and I eventually went bankrupt.  I am glad I did go into business as I have been able to take a lot of experience away from it and thinking back that's probably worth more than I lost money wise in it.    However even I knew I had to have the money behind me and that money was ours that took five years to accumulate. I know it's real tempting but unless you can and know you can repay your credit card loan back with very little or no interest then I would save up or go and speak to a bank.     You will need to put a business plan together and look at the short, mid and long term projections of the business and not just rely on your gut feelings and enthusiasm for your new venture.    Please take your time and look at you and your responsibilities, the people you may have to contract in and your prospective customers and their expectations and their financial limitations.    When you have done this then ask yourself is it a viable option to put it on a credit card? Remember this...if it falls flat on its face very quickly your funding for the business could be looked upon as fraud and that my friend is worse than bankruptcy.    I pray you take this advice on board and I know one day you will be successful|`|6jcvt7Qqaa	yo ma man. starting your own buisness is cool, but the credit card angle is so wrong. you are looking to rack up major debts with that. i have come across a coaching strategy that looks very promising. for a small investment (under a $100), you get a large amont of tutorial videos showing you many backdoor, ninja techniques used by leading internet marketers to make money. so this can be a very good means to start your business. to learn more go to mentalphysicalvapor.com. good luck on raking in the dough..;>

NwkZ5OmCaa	Unless you had a ton of student loans, are you sure you supported yourself?  (Do the support test worksheet in pub 501, page 20.)<br>  <br>  If YOU only made $2500 last year, YOU do not owe taxes.  On your tax return, a credit is worthless because all a credit does is get your tax bill to zero--and it already is.<br>  <br>  Your refund is merely the tax that was withheld on your W-2.|`|NzKaYTiQaa	If you made less than 9000 then it doesn't matter.  All of your income is tax free.  The best option for your family as a whole is to have your parents claim you as a dependent.  If you're claimed then all of your income under $5450 is still tax free.  So either way you get the same amount of money back.  What changes though is that if your parents do claim you then they get to take a personal exemption for you and your education credit.  You are eligable to take the hope credit, but it is entriely worthless to you.  So if you claimed yourself you get all of your federal tax back.  If your parents claim you then you get all of your federal tax back and your parents get an additional $2500 in their refund.
AA11616170	I went to www.revenue.ie, put in a search for Rent a Room, and this is what I found<br>  <br>  Budget Summary 2009<br>  Rent-a-Room Scheme The limit of the exemption from income tax, which applies to rent, received, where a person rents out a room or rooms in his or her principle private residence, remains unchanged at €10,000.<br>  <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/revsearch/search.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.revenue.ie/revsearch/search.j...</a><br>  <br>  For 2007 and following years 'rent-a-room' relief cannot be granted to individuals in respect of accommodation provided by parents for their own children. In circumstances where there are non-connected persons paying rent for rooms in the family home, these payments will still qualify for 'rent-a-room' relief.<br>  <br>  The relief is available to individuals only. It does not apply to companies or partnerships. This income is not liable to either PRSI or the 2% Health Levy but it must be included on an individuals annual income tax return.<br>  You must keep full and accurate records of your lettings from the start. You need to do this whether you send in a simple summary of your profit/loss, prepare the accounts yourself, or, have an accountant do it. <br>  <br>  If you a rent a room in your home, then you are not covered by the landlord / tenant legislation in Ireland. So you are not bound by the rules covering landlords in Ireland. For example, you don’t have to register with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) as a landlord, you don’t have to provide a rent book to the tenant and you don’t have to ensure that the room you are renting meets any minimum physical standards. Your tenant does not have a tenancy agreement but rather a Licensee Agreement and is only entitled to “reasonable notice”.<br>  <a href="http://www.myhome.ie/lettings/advice-centre/1171-1171-2502/rent-a-room-scheme.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhome.ie/lettings/advice-cen...</a><br>  <br>  I'm surprised at the last paragraph, because when I rented out a room in my home, my solicitor told me it was obligatory to register with PRTB.  The renting was very short-term, to meet the needs of a friend who was "stuck" at the time, and I never did get around to registeriing it.If I ever do rent it out again, I now know I don't actually have to register.|`|wtQY6VEwaa	Not sure how taxes work in Ireland, but in the US renting a room is just regular old income.
LpVwWJVsaa	You are correct in your understanding,  That is one of the downfalls of being on a month-to-month contract, your landlord can raise the rents however he sees fit as long as it's in accordance with your state laws, he can also charge you the pet deposit and pet rent.  You can try to negotiate with him, but it is just that, negotiations.  As you have the option to not agree with the new terms, he doesn't have to agree with your negotiations.<br>  <br>  I would suggest talking to your landlord and talking about your concerns.  If he refuses to talk with you or you don't like the answers you are given in response to your questions, the choice that you have is to give proper notice (per state landlord/tenant laws) and move or to stay and put up with it.  You could TRY to google your landlord/tenant laws for your state and see what is written about hospitable conditions (ie: carpet) but chances are that it's just going to prolong your misery.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|EXJfoGtAaa	It's very simple.

Are there any "rent control" laws in place where the property is located.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	You can suggest any revisions you like, but the landlord has no obligation to agree to them. And there is really no way to MAKE the landlord do anything if they are just a bad landlord and not fulfilling their responsibilities. At that point your options are to move out and to sue in court to break the lease without penalty. You can also deposit rent into an escrow account with the court, and the landlord will not get it until they address the issues. That might make them sit up and take notice. But really this landlord sounds like a lost cause to me.

AA10259042	The Conservative Growth fund does not have the safety that you would have by having 1/3 of your assets in money market so there would be some additional risk to investing in it, about 1/3 more risk.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	It is similar but not the same.<br>  <br>  (1) The primary difference is that the LifeStrategy Fund invests more broadly than your choices (included international exposure).  You could make arguments both pro & con as to which "plan" is better fundamentally.  In most financial discussions, the Vanguard approach would win hands down to yours every time.  However, from a practical standpoint (funds vs $$ vs time), I'm not sure there is much difference.<br>  <br>  (2) The secondary difference is that the LifeStrategy fund automatically rebalances on a regular basis.  This is a significant benefit, but one you can manage on your own.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	The all-in-one-fund puts a certain percentage of its money into each type of investment.  And if you agree with such allocation of the money between these investments.  Then investing in the all-in-one-fund is better.  Because you will pay a lower management fee for one fund instead of for three separate funds.<br>  <br>  But if you disagree with how the all-in-one-fund allocates the money between different investments.  And you want to do it in your own way.  Then you can allocate your money on your own by investing in each fund separately.|`|edTnv8q2aa	Another consideration for keeping the funds separate is that the money market fund offers check writing, a quick and convenient way to access your money if desired.  This also makes the tax consequences easier to deal with, as money market funds are always $1.00 per share.  If you redeem funds from a Life-strategy fund, you'll have calculate a capital gain or loss.

Of course the radio news stations, classical music stations and cnn, espn and on buses and bus benches (why on bus benches you ask?) Maybe people with brains are reading while busing to and from work and not vegging out, riding the buss to a place of unknown consequence.

I would suggest joining a local credit union and establishing a checking and savings account. Local banks and credit unions are more likely to extend credit than national brands. Once you turn 18, the credit union will consider your history with them when you apply for a loan.    Other than getting emancipated from you parents, waiting until you're 18 may be the only way to secure a loan under your own name.  You should probably calculate how much money you can save between now and your 17th birthday and just pay in cash. Good luck!|`|2i9bSh7uaa	you cant get credit until your 18 it sucks. you should just keep working and buy a decent looking used car for now thats what i did its definitely worth it. i payed 2k for a 1999. When owning a car you have to think of all the fees to register it, insurnace, gas, and then any repairs you might have. you dont want to add credit card payments ontop of that unless you limit your spending and pay it in full. when you are a little older you will have good credit and can get a loan and a nice ride.

sI3krJULaa	It depends.  It sounds like they're planning on hiring you as a contractor (which is pretty normal for janitorial services), which means you would receive a 1099 from them at the end of the year.  However they do still need your social security number.  Sometimes, especially if they're not really on top of things, they won't ask for it until they need it at the end of the year.<br>  <br>  But if they never ask for it, then, technically, they can't deduct it.  They can certainly try, but the IRS is pretty strict about deducting either wages or contract work without the 1099's having been filed.  If they do ask for your information, then, yes, your name and the amount they paid you will be provided to the IRS.  If they don't, then, no, it won't.  But remember- if you don't report your income, regardless of whether or not this office does, YOU are committing tax evasion, which is a felony.  Report your income, even if they don't.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :0)

2N6oTOLQaa	Cat is right. You need to file a 1040-X to amend you return. If you receive a refund from your first return set it aside because you may have to pay some or all of it back after you factor in this extra income. <br>  <br>  Like Cat said, the 1099 form represents income that did not have any tax withheld from it, so you have to pay the full amount of the tax now. <br>  <br>  If it was your tax preparer that told you "tough, you have to pay it" then he's probably right. Make sure he filled everything correctly and make sure you deduct everything you can, but there is no way around paying these taxes (except maybe by dying before April 15th). <br>  <br>  If you're trying to say that the 1099 is for more income than you actually received and the person is telling you that's too bad, then you certainly can demand better documentation. If the company or person is lying about what they paid you in an attempt to take a bigger deduction and reduce their own taxes, then you have a case of tax fraud on your hands and you've been thrust into the middle of it against your will. If that's the case then I would consult an attorney for advice and your options or talk to a CPA about what steps you can take to get the IRS to review the situation.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	You file an amended return to include the income that was left off the first return.<br>  <br>  1040X is the form - but get help in preparing it, as it's confusing.<br>  <br>  Also - if you're getting a refund, and you receive it, set aside the money until you know what you owe with the amended return - as you'll owe tax on the money not included the first time around.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  Not sure I'm following you with "he is way too high" and "his comment is tough you have to pay it".  Who are you talking about?  <br>  <br>  I'm going to take a wild guess that "he" is your tax preparer.  And that he figured out what you owe with this new income included, and you're shocked at the amount.  <br>  <br>  You don't say what amount was on the 1099 - but that is income that you earned, and NO TAX was withheld.  And you'll owe self-employment tax on it as well as income tax.  And it might possibly reduce any earned income credit you though you qualified for on your first return - which showed less income.<br>  <br>  It might be a shock - but you will owe the taxes.  Did you have any expenses associated with the 1099 income?  If so you can reduce the taxable income a bit.  But any way you slice it, paying self-employment tax will not be fun.<br>  <br>  -------<br>  <br>  Upon a third read-through...are you saying that the person who paid you the 1099 amount is reporting more money that he actually paid you?  If so, I hope you kept records and receipts.   If you can PROVE a difference - then just file your tax return for the amount you were actually paid - and then be prepared to defend yourself when they send you a letter asking for more money because of the discrepency in amounts.|`|5203612d842a45744262b29372d343b3aa	You will have to be able to prove that the amount you reported on your tax return is correct and that the number he reported is not correct.<br>  If he won't change the 1099 then you can wait until you receive a matching notice and then meet with the IRS and show your proof of what was received and let them know what he stated to you.

Its acquisitions  of Wyeth will make it even larger.  Its a cash rich company and probably good as a long-term investment with a high dividend yield of 8.78 increased annually and future expansion with Wyeth and other acquisitions on the horizon.    http://www.pfizer.com/investors/    http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE...      Since the stock has gone down after its quarterly report was released on (2/26/2009) and some investors believe it paid too much for Wyeth, I think for the its best left for now until we see some rebound in its share price.    There are two other listed health/pharmaceuticals companies listed on the Dow, Merick and Co, and Johnson & Johnson.  I think the best one is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at the moment.    JOHNSON & JOHNSON (JNJ)  JNJ has been increasing its dividends consistently on an annual basis for the last 10 years.  Long-term investors looking for an dividend income stock related to a profiting company should really consider it.  Current yield: 3.19.      http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE...    JNJ increased its net profit in 2008 from 2007 and has mostly done so over the last 10 years.  You can find this out by studying the companys annual reports.    http://www.investor.jnj.com/annual-repor...    JNJ has established a $55 support on its daily charts.  Traders can use this for risk management.  So if the stock fell to $54 or lower that could be the point where they cut their losses.    On JNJs daily charts and many others at Fridays close, JNJ made a bullish flag pattern suggesting the stock could go up during Mondays session.      Also, theres no negative US macroeconomic data being released that day which favors the US market.  The DJIA and S&P500 are more likely go up.     I think JNJ will form an up-trend in coming weeks.  I have a bullish view of this stock.  Already Dow component IBM is on an up-trend and I think JNJ will soon follow.|`|e0a81333aa57f8661514f1fcf591fc64aa	I would invest rather in JNJ.

a1efb39ce972b6f3dc75c44b815f368daa	Well it depends on the landlord.    But for me, a landlord, if I see a bad credit score I take a deeper look at the credit report.  For ex. they are trying to make payments etc.  But the one next big thing I look at is job/income.  Do they have a decent job/career and have they had it for awhile.  That to me is one of the most important things.  I then call old landlords or current bosses and go from there.    If you have steady income and good rental history you should be fine.    I know some people who are millionaires who have horrible credit.  They just always pay their bills late due to laziness, busi ness, etc.|`|IO1JRcl0aa	Depends on who owns the apartment building.

Now each state, city is different so I would call the police department and ask them.|`|b85YIs3daa	Because there is no signed lease, it is effectively a month to month lease.     You need to give him one months notice to vacate...in writing. Since he has not paid for the last 2 months, you can file eviction papers now. but since he has paid something, and you agreed to it, it may be difficult to convince a judge that you didn't work out new rental terms with him (if that's what the guy claims). It's a big he said she said legal battle because you did not have a signed lease. Unless this guy is a complete nutjob, expect the judge to side with him when it comes to verbal disputes. Since he would be more adversly affected than you if he was kicked out. Judges typically like to give the benefit of the doubt to the tenant.    I would not throw him out on the street. If this guy knows even a smidge of the law, you would be in a world of hurt.|`|3FEetxrEaa	You would need to evict him even if he never paid rent.    This is his legal residence.    You do not need a lease to be a legal resident.   If he had a lease you would have a hell of a time evicting him.    Since you do not own the house and do not have a lease with him he is your landlords tenant.   You do not have any right at all to evict him, the landlord has to do that.    I hope you did not illegally sublet, otherwise you need to find a new place too.|`|w4OGnyn8aa	Listen, even without a lease he is considered on a month to month verbal lease. You HAVE to give him 30 days written notice of eviction. If you kick him out tomorrow, he can take you to court, and it WILL hold up in court. There is no reason to be an asshole to people who are trying to help you on here. So give him WRITTEN notice of eviction tomorrow and make sure he gets it. In 30 days he needs to be out. If not, you will have to take him to court. You are looking for legal trouble if you throw him out or change the locks. He can sue you and will probably win. Especially if your lease states that you can't sublet.|`|bmP4NdKuaa	You can't make up your own rules. You have to follow the law. When there is no lease, the tenant has the basic laws set by your state and city. If you do not know what these are, you can't make up your own. You need to give him notice to vacate which depending on the laws as I said, could be 30 days or 60 days. And then take him to small claims court.    You were acting as a landlord without any knowledge. Don't blame us -- you are yelling and getting insulting. Your proof of rent and an agreement is his payment and his stuff IN YOUR APARTMENT.

You want to use non generic keywords that are high in demand and low in supply. If you just built the website remember like fine wine it takes time. There is a process to building pages for the search engines. For instance: You want to use your main keyword in the first 90 characters of your text. You need to use your keyword in the text but not too much or it will appear as spamming the search engines. You want to use your keyword in 1 text link within your page. Your keyword needs to be in the title and headline. As you can see there is more to it than loading pages. The process is CTPM. Content- Traffic- Presell- Monetize. In that order. You can also earn some extra money by adding google adsense to your pages after you have 30-35 pages is recommended.  For advertising you can apply to google local search for getting listed. I believe it takes 5 or 6 weeks from the time you apply before you can get listed. Another great idea would be to add an ezine to your website and within your ezine provide free information on Italian cooking, recipes, interesting stories, tips and tricks, etc. Maybe include your website and e-zine address on your guest check. If your customers sign up for the e-zine you will be providing them with a constant reminder of your restaurant. A good trick for getting them to sign up would be to offer a printable coupon for a discount on their next meal. Feel free to e-mail for more ideas and info

BIopVZrqaa	If you picked it up as ordinary income in 2007, and had to pay it back in 2008, you can take a deduction for this amount on line 21 of the 1040.
8uqbNrICaa	What you will get back depends on a LOT of factors. Since we don't know all the details we can't be of much help with the actual numbers of your return.    First, your child is a dependent of yours unless someone else can claim it. (Who provided most of it's support)    Second,  whether or not you can claim "head-of-household" (you probably can.)    Third, what you've claimed on your W-2 at your work-place. (how much taxes were with-held) IF you want to get more back next year lower the exemptions on your 2009 form.    Forth, which form you will be using 1040 long form, 1040 short form, 1040ez, etc. And what your deductions for each will be. (own a house, have a 401k plan, an IRA, interest from investments, lots of medical bills, gambling winnings/losses, etc. etc.)    Either use one of the on line tax prep websites or go to a service like H&R Block (especially if you are not comfortable doing it yourself)    Hope this helps.|`|JXJvxhZPaa	No, that sounds about right.  $3500 should be taken out of your taxable income for the extra exemption.  That does not mean you get $3500 back in taxes, it just means you don't have to pay any taxes on $3500 worth of income.  If you qualify for a child credit (if you have daycare expenses, for example) you can take off some more, depending on your income.  Overall, $1900 is a decent amount to get back.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	do you live on your own ? if so did you file head of household or single?if you live on your own you should have filed head of household if you didn't and most likely you would have gotten a bigger refund,because if you claim single you don't qualify for some credits.|`|AA11284831	There's no set amount.  It depends upon many factors.  How do you reckon that you're entitled to more?    You pick up $475 from the EIC and the Child Tax Credit saves you $1,000 in tax on top of the $3,500 reduction in taxable income for the exemption.  Depending upon how much tax was withheld from your pay that could easily be correct.

Howabout using them again?      As far as using your previous landlord as a reference, your new prospective landlord will be getting in touch with him regardless.    He will ask your previous landlord what type of tenant you were (pleasant, compliant with rules, quiet) and whether or not you paid your rent on time.  He may or may not mention anything about the one late rental payment.   By the sounds of it you are a reliable and responsible tenant.      Your prospective landlord will also want to know how long you have been working and if you can handle the rent, so he may contact your employer.    As far as references are concerned these are used as character references.  Put anyone down who will say nice things about you.  The longer they have known you, the better.  Good luck.  You'll have no problems- especially in this economic climate.

375ffaceecee2420f9e38aba060fb989aa	Every commodity is an essential product and all are in the financial markets.  The commodity markets ensure liquidity and that makes for the lowest price and the most stable prices.  Without farmers and producers having the futures markets there would only be the spot market.  That would be far more subject to manipulation and volatility.  The move in crude oil has been a function of supply and demand along with geopolitical issues etc.  No one called for investigations of the big oil companies when the price fell did they?  The rise in corn was due to government mandates on ethanol.  With demand back down corn prices have fallen also.  Like all markets they overshoot on the way up and then again on the way down.  Crude oil, for instance, bottomed out around 35 before coming back to a range of 42 to 48.  The markets are fine.  It is government that screws things up.

Explain what happened to the IRS and IRS would determine who gets to claim (most likely it's you). He will not just owe back child support, he will then owe the IRS as well because he'll have to pay back the tax benefits that he got by falsely claiming your daughter. He'll be having fun dealing with the IRS.    And he said it's payback, more like he is asking for trouble. What the heck was he thinking messing with the IRS??|`|F08HDRvraa	Since you both have claimed the child, IRS will eventually contact you in regard to the discrepancy.  In your case I would not waite for that to happen. You need to call IRS first thing Monday morning and report that you have just found out that your ex claimed the child on his taxes even though she has lived with you since birth and that he has never paid child support.  Yes there will be penalties.  He is receiving money that he is not entitled to.  I'm not sure criminal penalties may not be involved as he obviously committed fraud and he knew it.

Then you will have 2 options.      Option 1 is to mail in your tax return with the child on the return.  The IRS will eventually send you and the EX each a letter to determine who had the higher right to claim the child.  This could take months.  Then when you prove you have the right they will send you your refund and the EX will have to pay back.      Option 2 is to take the child off your return and file to receive whatever refund you might have.  Then you will file an amended tax return to add the child back on.  Then the process with the IRS starts.    I'm afraid to say this happens way to often and repeatedly year after year.  I wish the IRS had a solution to this happening, but they don't seem to.

Make sure you can document that you provided more than half of your nephews total support for the year. Compare the amount you contributed to his support with the entire amount of support he received from all sources including from his own bank account.

Be able to document this amount with, say, room-for-rent ads in the newspaper for comparable rooms in your area.

b85YIs3daa	If both parties signed the lease, the check will be split between the two. If the damages exceed the amount, both tenants will be legally responsible according to the landlord. Though Tony could sue Matt for 1/2 of the deposit because the letter they signed together is also enforeable. Does Tony still have this original document?     Tony should have been at the inspection as well as gave his forwarding address. Without this information, if there is a refund in the deposit, it goes to the forwarding addressess given. If Tony is concerned how much damage there is, common sense says he should speak with the landlord directly. There really is no reason to deal with matt.     Bottom line, Tony needs to get his *** to the landlords to, at the very least, provide his forwarding address. And ask about any damages. A list of damages must be sent to the forwarding addresses within 45 days or the landlord is not permitted to keep the deposit.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	The deposit is going to go to Matt after Matt moves out.    The deposit was made for the apartment, the landlord can not get involved with a he said/she said.    If Tony is still on the lease Tony is legally liable still, his contract with Matt does not effect his contract with the landlord.    Now, after all is said and done Tony can try to sue Matt, but Matt is not the landlord and techinally half the deposit is Matts as they went into the lease contract together.   It does not really matter how they across it 1400 required.    From what you have stated I am willing to bet there is more then 1400 in damage and cleaning to be done, there will be no deposit refund to fight over.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	Sounds like a lot of drama and I bet Landlord is right|`|W5JjCD9gaa	It depends whether Tony is still a party to the lease? You cannot contract out of a lease by creating a second contract with one of your flat mates. If Tony is party to the lease (which I assume he is because at no point did he received his damage deposit back) he may well be responcible for the damage too. However, if that is the case, and the letter/contract the Tony and Matt agreed re: responcibility for damage prior to Tony moving out, Tony may be able to take Matt to court in order to remedy his losses from his damage deposit and to reclaim his share of the remainder.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	The deposit doesn't go to who remained in the end, the deposit is supposed to be returned to whom ever's name is on the lease.

Despite paying the deposit, and being the one to remain in the apt. alone, my brother still got half the deposit when I finally moved out (even though he never paid a cent of the deposit and moved out 6 months into the lease, his name was still on the lease.)
79b265d392525b206ff870687ec9a303aa	Wow, you have done a lot in your life.  Looking for job advice on here can be perilous.  You will get countless people telling you haw to use their system that makes them so much money.  Which of course you have to wonder, if you're making so much money on your system, what are you doing here?    But given your situation and your skills I would suggest you see about putting your writing skills to work.  There are several good ones out there that pay a decent wage and you can write about your experiences ( which given your travels, employment, etc.  I think would be quite a bit).    Associated Content, and Blogfeast are both sites I have made money off of.  I think my total checks from both combines were a few hundred dollars in six months.  There is a new website that I'm actually pretty excited about called www.SayItAloud.com that has a team of people who actually try to sell sponsorship on your article and pay you 50%.  They say right now it's up to $135 dollars for a two page article.  So I am excited to see what happens there.    You can also make money by filling out surveys but beware any site that requires you to pay an up front fee.  True survey sites are paid by marketing companies and should be making their money from them and not you.    Hope this helps and good luck.|`|OFZh3GlVaa	Get euthanized.|`|AA10377023	OK, I'm going to be frank. 70 jobs?! That's really a problem!

I'm guessing that you're easily bored.      If you want to put your skills together and take the current job market into account, you could write a series of articles--or a book--on how to live the good life when the economy goes down the tubes.  Or how to balance several part-time jobs when full-time jobs are few and far between.      You could go back to school and learn a new set of skills.  Nearly anything related to the health care industry is going to be recession-proof.  Or you could get certified to teach several of the things you already know how to do.     Good luck with whatever you DO decide to do.  And 48 may be fat and frumpy, but it certainly isn't old!  I once complained to an aunt who was 30 years my senior about feeling old and creaky (and I did have some serious health issues going on), and she responded, "Old?  Old?  You're not old, you're just a child.  Why, you're not even 50 yet!"

I don't think you can list 1 as the best because it all depends on what you are passionate about. Create your own work from home business. People do this everyday by building their own websites about a passion or hobby and then adding affiliate sales, google ads, and other forms of income generators. It all boils down to multiple streams of income. But first you have to identify what your site will be about and have a blue print to follow. Once you know the process you will get free targeted traffic through the search engines. The internet is about information, information, information. Deliver free useful information, warm up your visitors to your monetization model, presell them by being unbiased and then you will make sales and money. This is a process so don't expect to get rich quick. In time with some brains and motivation you will own a nice little corner of the internet and have more freedom to do the things you love. For starters it will require work for little or no pay. The payday will come in time with patience and keyword focused content pages on your site. First you need to find a good site builder that is wysiwyg. Unless you are good at HTML, etc. When looking for a site builder be sure to research it as well. What kind of support system do they have? What tools are available and do they cost extra money to have the tools etc.? Next you will brainstorm a site blue print. A good site builder will have this tool available. The blue print will basically be profitable keywords for your pages that are non generic. Profitable keywords are ones that are high in demand and low in supply. Then you build keyword focused content pages about your sites theme. Giving away free information. The beginning is all about building credibility and visitors. Your keyword focused content pages will get you free targeted traffic through the search engines. Once your site is building in size you can start to presell your monetization model and finally monetize. There really is no such thing as get rich quick so be patient and focused.

The best bet for this sum is a ROTH - since you can take out as much as you want without tax consequenses.  The gvt provides medicare for everyone - I think.  It's just some people think the out of pocket is too much and they take out extra insurance. - don't quote me.    Google  "retirement calculator"  aarp.com  and bankrate.com have some  I think msn money has one too.  /|`|tdQTZPI7aa	At the age of 65 every citizen is covered under Medicare part A  Part B you pay for. Part D prescriptions also paid by recipient.  Low income citizens have these expenses picked up by Medicaid  The remainder also pay for a supplemental policy. All told about 300 a month out of pocket for full coverage.  No one needs to declare bankruptcy.  Advice for the future is save.  At least 15% of your income.
eACZ1Rhjaa	As a young person you need to save for retirement. At 65 you will get medicare and you can buy a policy to cover the shortfall in benefits. If you run out of money in your old age and need Medicaid to pay for a nursing home you need to spend all your money before you can get the government assistance. The final years can get very expensive and people can run out of money to pay for nursing homes and assisted living but you can't just give away your assets then expect the government to pay your expenses.  My mom is 82 and living with my brother she gets a payment on a house she just sold and her pension and SS but if she needed a nursing home that cost say 6K a month she would only have enough to last about 15 years then would have to go on Medicaid. Her mom was almost 99 when she was in assisted living and only had enough left for less than a year when she died. The more you save the better chance of not having to go on government assistance.

So basically, it would cost you at LEAST 10 dollars to have the stock for any period of time.

If you do lease from this landlord before you sign the lease make sure it states that you provided your fridge and will be taking it with you when you move. You might want to talk to other renters from this landlord and ask questions about maintenance upkeep and if all renters were asked to provide own hot water heater and fridges.  I would be very careful dealing with this landlord and do a little research about them before signing a legal contract with them that you might regret later on.
X368wIVuaa	A Real Estate Professional generally speaking, is a REALTOR and a person who buys or sells real estate can only be identified as a REALTOR if they subscribe to the National Code of Ethics. If they do subscribe to the ethics guidelines and are officially recognized as such, they can legally be called REALTORS.  As in any 'profession' it takes specialized education and training as opposed to someone who practices that profession without the education and training.|`|K1ahDOoeaa	Are you talking about "real estate professional" as in when figuring your taxes?  If so, that has nothing to do with being licensed.  Mainly it's someone who works at least 50% of their working hours in real estate and a minimum of 750 hours total (per year) in a real estate field.  It could be a licensed sales person or a full time investor or a property manager, etc.  Licensing helps prove the point with the IRS but certainly isn't necessary.    The designation is there as part of the process of allowing or disallowing real estate losses to be taken off your other income.      Hope this helps.

It depends on if he is a nice guy or not.  If he will not let you out of the lease, you are free to move whenever you please, but you will still be responsible for the rent on that apartment/house, then you will be paying two leases.  Perhaps you can find a friend who would be willing to move in and take over the lease if it is okay by the landlord.  Make sure it is someone you can trust, because if they do not pay, you are still responsible because your name is on the lease.  Your best bet in these circumstances is to go to the landlord and work something out.|`|a1efb39ce972b6f3dc75c44b815f368daa	Call them and ask for a copy.  Yes it is binding!

Maybe you could sit the landlord/manager down and ask if you could be out of your lease or maybe find a new renter for your unit and sublet it, if allowed.

You wouldn't think it at first, but it is the best bank out there, let me explain.... Schwab is first and foremost an on-line brokerage company. They have a bank component (FDIC insured), that you can utilize. They provide free checks, no minimums, no fees and free ATM fees at any ATM (you can use any bank's ATM in the country and if there are fees, Schwab will refund them to you at the end of the month). Most on-line brokerage accounts have bank components, but people turn away from them because they think there is a catch, well there is. To use the bank you must open it with the brokerage account: meaning you will need to deposit $1,000 into the brokerage account on the first day. Here is the good part: on the second day, you can transfer all $1,000 into your bank account (on-line, one click). To deposit, Schwab provides free direct deposit and free envelopes to send checks to their bank in Reno. The only bad feature is if you are someone who likes to go into a bank branch and talk to people. This bank is for someone who is money savvy and wants to cut costs and time spend in bank lines and drivers.     To understand why Schwab does this: Its simple, Schwab makes money through trades and margin interest. They want you to keep your money close to your brokerage account so you will be more likely to trade. But, because you know this going in, you will be able to utilize the bank and not loose money in the stock market (no minimum trade restrictions).|`|e0a81333aa57f8661514f1fcf591fc64aa	wells fargo and JP morgan
OacSIfSiaa	Yes this is legal.  Once the original creditor charges off the debt it will be listed as such.  Some may show is as "charged off/sold" and under the FCRA it will remain on your report for because as of December 29, 1997 the reporting period runs 7 ? years (7 years plus 180 days) from the date (month and year) of the last delinquency (known as "last missed payment:).  They will then sell the debt to a collection agency who will also report the debt as they now legally own it. However, the collection agency can not renew the dates!!! to keep it on your credit report for a longer period of time.    That is why it is important to keep tabs on your credit report.  Many junk debt buyers will report it but not notify you for a while doing even more harm to your score.  Others have been know to serve what is called "sewer service" court summons.  Which in some states is legal.  They simply send it to one of your older addresses and then come court day, you fail to show then they are awarded a default judgment and could possibly garnish your wages.    It's a lousy system so you have to be one step ahead of them.  This all falls under the FCRA rules.

CvkTOBZGaa	I'm Susan, and I work for TurboTax.    New York has a high individual income tax rate, so you may want to investigate what deductions are available so you can lower your overall liability in future tax years.    Your withholdings through the year amount to pre-payments to the state for your tax liability.  Most states, including New York, require that you pre-pay (either via withholding or estimated taxes) a certain percentage of your overall liability, or risk facing an underpayment penalty.  When you owe money at the end of the year, as long as you're not subject to the underpayment penalty, it essentially means that you have given the government an interest-free loan.  When you get a refund, it means you have given to the government more money than you actually owe them, and so your "refund" is your own money that the government has borrowed from you.    Some people like the enforced savings of overwithholding.  For these folks, it's best to estimate your tax due, then file a new W4 with your employer to withhold more state income tax from each paycheck.  For the W4, I assume you are already claiming 0 allowances on line 5, which is the highest withholding based on allowances.  You can enter an additional amount on line 6 to withhold from each paycheck in order to raise the overall amount of payments you make to the state.    Hope this helps,  Susan, TurboTax Tax Compliance Service manager|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Yes, you can do something:  have more state tax withheld.|`|AA10283296	You live in New York.

Next year you won't owe as much.|`|yAvOmQrkaa	New York City has its own income tax. If you live in Queens and work in Nassau County, your employer might not be withholding New York City income tax from your paycheck. I'm willing to bet that's why you owe money to New York. If so, ask your employer if it can withhold New York City tax from your paycheck.
rhs9Y407aa	Your friends are not very nice telling you that!  I did my taxes today, too!  We are the early birds!  I doubt you will get your money on Monday, but if you did your taxes electrically and requested direct deposit of you refund, it can take less that 2 weeks to get your money.  I think I got my refund last year in 6 business days using direct deposit and electronic filing!  You need to get your friends back for this one!|`|8yQYmxVOaa	Your friend is fooling with you but no your check will not be there Monday takes a few weeks|`|zqmwmK13aa	Maybe CA, not the IRS.
Pjm9pg7iaa	I get lots of letters every week to buy my mortgages (carrybacks).  They will pay 70% of face value. I only sold one and wished that i hadn't. You can get the names of buyers by contacting the local title companies. They all have "servicing departments" that collect money for the carrybacks. They know the names of everyone in your town who buys loans..|`|b4751c132f82aabe6e11b8e5a37225b5aa	Do you own the lien ?
Pjm9pg7iaa	The contract becomes valid when there is a meeting of the minds. Both parties give something up; both receive something.  In some cases, the party or parties makes a mistake. Usually in their reasoning. They did not mean to lie. They made a mistake. But the mistake is "material" in nature. It really affects everything they agreed upon. That mistake can cause the contract to be invalid.  In real estate the mistake might be the square footage which was listed as 2,000 sq ft but is actually 1,400 sq ft.  Someone made a mistake. They didn't mean to do it..
b85YIs3daa	I think it is incredibly stupid to buy such a large house during these times....regardless of what you do for a living. You could be fired at any moment. You should reconsider and live WAY BELOW YOUR MEANS|`|AA10283296	Approximately $1650 a month.    But, depending on how high the closing costs are you could end up with a substantially higher payment    Are you sure your home will appraise for 20% more than the loan will be for?|`|K1ahDOoeaa	At 4.75% it'll be $1,648.41 (principal and interest).  You can run various amounts and interest rates on online mortgage calculators like the one below.
FfPUhCuiaa	I do mortgages & there is no set DTI ratio.  Best bet is to go to www.fha.gov & find a lender near you that can pre-qualify you.  There is no charge for this- nor obligation to purchase.  It will tell you what you need to do to qualify-  Generally we like to see no more than 40% DTI- that includes house payment, taxes, insurance, revolving debt, and installment debt.  Does not include lights, water etc.  Now is a great time to buy using FHA - you will need 3.5% down payment.    Oh we base it on gross income- not take home pay.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Your new loan is going to cost you $8 per $1,000 borrowed. A $100,000 loan will cost you $800 a month. Add your current debts. The bank won't want the house payment and the monthly debt payments to be more than 50% of your income. You can figure that out..|`|ej9ijnS7aa	The more perfect you scores the more the Mortgage Company will tolerate in debt.  IF you have lousy scores the more they want to see paid off.    You should have no credit cards with more than 30% of the credit limit being utlilized that is for each card not the total.     Sit with a lender/broker and go over the figures and find out for sure.
KxxkOPeTaa	A C -    In 2008 you had what's called a "paper loss".  Your investment had lost value but it was only "on paper" because you hadn't yet sold the investment.  Once you sold in 2009, you realized the loss and that is the tax year which you can take the deduction (up to $3,000 in losses).     Even though your investments lost value, they still posted dividends and capital gains which is what your bank sent you the form on.    You may also want to consider eliciting the help of a CPA to make sure you have everything on your return in order.      For tax preparation help, there are many CPAs online that you can use.  Plus, CPA's are probably the most knowledgeable in terms of tax law and regulations and during this time of year, many charge extremely competitive rates - sometimes better than HR / JH or the software packages.|`|yAvOmQrkaa	If you sold the investment at a loss in January 2009, then you can't deduct the loss from the 2008 tax return you're filing now.     Instead you'll have to wait until 2009 is over, and then deduct the loss on your 2009 tax return.    Don't forget to include the dividends and capital gains on your 2008 tax return though.
QlzFoBS3aa	Yes I know, go to a credit counselor or bankruptcy court.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Everytime you apply for credit "left and right" you damage your chances of getting a loan by each application.|`|AA10072911	Every time you apply for credit an inquiry is placed on your credit report showing future lenders that you had applied for credit.  Too many applications for credit in a small time period will raise a red flag to future companies and make them reluctant to issue you credit because it shows them you are desperate for credit. The more applications for credit you make the less likely you are to pay back the money.  If your having a hard time getting approved because your credit score is low then you may consider opening a secured loan at your local bank for a short term (8 months or so) and make your payments on time every month.  This will help you built a positive payment history with the bank and also improve your credit score because the loan will be reported to the credit bureaus.
Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes.  They have learned that some customers return almost 90% of all items purchased. It is almost a form of Obsessive-Compulsive behavior and thousands of people have it. Once the item is opened, they can't resell it at the normal price..|`|AYLRIMZJaa	I'm not sure if they will deny your return, but all retailers track how much you return things.  It is for fraud purposes and loss prevention.

Setting up a business on eBay is easy and a fast way to make money online. The first thing to do is look about the house for any unwanted goods. You can then sell the unwanted goods on eBay and keep 100% of the profit.    This will also give you some positive feedback if you ship your items off fast and are a good seller. This will make people trust you so you can them take your business to the next level. And the way to take your eBay business to the next level is to find wholesale products to sell for a profit.    You can find wholesale products at esource.com and salehoo.com them two sites are all you need for finding wholesale suppliers in the UK. If you would like to source your products from china you can go to a website called alibaba.com here you can find product at below wholesale price and can make very good profits.    So now you know ways for teens to make money on eBay. But let's take another look at ways for teens to make money online. You're probably not aware of the business I'm about to introduce you to but it's a really big money maker.

If you set up a website, no one is going to advertise on it until it gets good traffic which will take several months, to several years!  If you're going to go in to online marketting, you're going to need to build up lists. If you're looking for money making schemes, they're going to cost you an arm and a leg.  You could get free hosting and set up a web site with a free domain name, then sign up with google adsense and put google ads on, but then you're lookingat getting traffic. The good thing about this is long term, because their are ways of promoting, but quick money, forget it.

k3EObSxwaa	I would say that both are useful depending what your future holds. Working shows that you are interested in making a better person in your life. Volunteering shows that you are interested in your community and willing to help others that need help whether it be helping the old or working with the kids in the Little League. I have a daughter that volunteered in a hospital as a "Candy Striper" as they were known, and went on into nursing with a scholarship for two years.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Either.

They will then try to send a letter to get a copy of the W-2 for you and will instruct you on whether to use your paystub to make an estimated tax payment (and file for an extension) or just file by April 15th.    You may also want to consider eliciting the help of a CPA to make sure you have everything on your return in order.      For tax preparation help, there are many CPAs online that you can use.

Keep cool head and avoid spending is the way to go at first.    Then think what your necessities are and do not spend all but try to invest or save part of the money.    I would not spend a single penny because you will soon find that it was not enough to pay your bills or that you have paid or spend buying or investing in "x" when it comes "y" as a priority expense to cope with.    A worldwide crisis is hitting us and financial institutions will try to encourage investment and savings that may result not as appealing as buying thing, but is keep your money safe and producing some interest earning.    I consider is not a good moment to invest in any type of business and much more less on those online that offer hug amounts on money for a little investment.    Unless you know the market and how make a business grow, a bank safe is the best place to put your money and then spend it as you need it and not all at once, no matter if you buy toilet paper, food, etc. etc.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|NNTPnhZgaa	You usually can't get an actual job at 13.

It's great that you want to start working at such a young age. I think though, because you're so young, you have limited options. I was going that say that babysitting is best... Odd jobs for people in your neighborhood are good too, pretty much anything under the table. You might be able to get a part time job at a small family owned place where they would pay you in cash. I folded boxes at a bakery for a couple hours after school when I was 14... Just keep your eyes and ears open, and maybe talk to your parents and see what they know of in your neighborhood. That's how I got my bakery job.|`|hPXu5RzTaa	You could alway be an escort.
d0f8f9f47a5fe84a5b9ae938244ac600aa	I am a business banker with a very large secure bank and I could give you some tips. First of all if you plan on starting your own business, SBA   (Small Business Administration) sba.gov could give you some information regarding business plans, business filings, and finances for start up and purchase acquisitions of businesses.    Step 1: Contact SBA (sba.gov)    Step 2: they will recommend that you take business classes to assist you creating your business plan and they would also want some type of industry experience in this field and would give you great information on starting your own business, they will also assist you with a business loan, however they do require a down payment to secure this loan    Step3: Contact publishing companies for wholesale pricing on products if your doing new books and they will give you some advice on distribution and other information that  you will need    Step4: Contact other companies that are in the same business or one that is selling their business, which might be plentiful at this time due to hard economic times. They can really give you some hand's on experience knowledge.    But if does not answer your question, you may not find the answer you want on the internet because most businesses will not disclose financials online and each business entity is different, you have to take in consideration each state has different tax laws which affects all businesses, leasing the building cost will cost plenty, employees or no employees will require insurance. The bottom line is not simple anymore since a lot of small businesses are actually failing at this time.    Do you research well, Take a look at the Wall Street Journal, get familiar with it and find out if it is actually worth opening up the business at this time.

No owner of a neighborhood book store is going to post her profit and loss statement on the internet. Your only hope would be to go personally to a bookstore and talk to the owner.   You are going to be aiming for a 10% profit margin. That is what a Borders was making in the boom times. Now they are closing stores so we know that the profit margin is negative. They are frantic to shave costs to survive.  One interesting note is the recent increase in self-published books. It is the only category of publishing that is thriving. Those authors would wholesale their books to you at less than half the cost of a major publisher.

You are taking the EIC without a qualifying child for 2007 and the only reason your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the earlier year was because the IRS determined that a child listed on Schedule EIC was not your qualifying child.

While some lenders have increased their score requirements for FHA loans there are other wholesale lenders that will do FHA loans down to a 500 mid score.    The best approach is to apply.

I paid what I could, but with the lawyer bills and paying the land and house note alone one of them went into collections.  It was with Sears, and they sold the debt to Mann Bracken LLc to collect.  They are lying scumbags.  They told me that they would drop the court thing if I would send them 300 bucks "earnest money" toward the debt and would set me up a payment plan of 100$ a month untill it was paid off, and I agreed, as I wanted to resolve the problem.      Well, They DIDN"T drop the court thing, and won a judgement because I didn't show up in court, thinking they would honour our agreement.  That completely ruined any credit I had after the divorce. Now they keep sending me letters to pay them "as agreed", but they refuse to send me any agreement in writing.    They are lying scumbag ripoff artists.     I want to resolve this problem, and get my credit situation back as it should be, but now, rather than paying them, I have to pay a lawyer first to protect myself from them and thier greedy lying business practices.     Get a Lawyer.  Mann Bracken are lawyers. evil dirty ones, and you cannot defend yourself from thier decietful practices without a lawyer of your own.    They are not the only ones. From what I can gather scanning the internet, the majority of these collection agencies are run by dirty lawyers.       I want nothing more than to pay my debt and salvage my credit, but now, rather than paying my debt, I must spend money that they would otherwise recieve (If they weren't horrible greedy lying lawyers)  to hire a lawyer of my own to make sure I don't get screwed anymore by them.

dV9YT8GDaa	"Anesthesiologists must first complete the basic training that it takes to become a doctor. After high school, students need to finish a minimum of 2 to 3 years of undergraduate university education, including the successful completion of several required science courses, and then 4 years of medical school.    Admission to medical school is very competitive. Most applicants have a 4-year bachelors degreethe minimum requirement for some schoolsand some even have a masters degree. Generally, those applicants with the highest marks have the greatest chance of being accepted; however, medical schools also consider things like leadership qualities and extracurricular activities when making admissions decisions. Some schools also require prospective students to achieve a high score on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Applicants may also be required to submit an autobiographical essay and participate in an interview.    The first 2 years of medical school are usually comprised of course and laboratory work; the next 2 years are spent working as an intern at a hospital or other medical setting. Graduates from medical school receive a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Those who want to be anesthesiologists must then complete a 5-year anesthesiology residency. The residency includes basic clinical training, as well as training in adult and child anesthesiology, obstetric anesthesiology, and chronic pain management.    Once the anesthesiology residency is completed, MDs must pass the qualification exam of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) or the College des mdecins du Qubec (CMQ) in Quebec. They must also be licensed by the appropriate province or territory."

I will assume it is fully paid.  Generally one house and a car (that are fully paid and are no collateral to any loan) are protected.  If thay are a guarantee for a loan, this protection does not apply.    Good luck my friend, bankruptcy is tough.|`|sPr2HhYEaa	in chapter 7 you can reaffirm on the mortgage and the car and continue payments to both.

For tax preparation help, there are many CPAs online that you can use.  Plus, CPA's are probably the most knowledgeable in terms of tax law and regulations and during this time of year, many charge extremely competitive rates - sometimes better than HR / JH or the software packages.

NP6ES2GPaa	Pay your bills ON TIMEand if you can't pay your bills on time, cut up your credit card.    Credit is one of the hardest and most time consuming things to repair.

Open a secured credit card and pay the account on time every month.  A secured credit card is where you give the bank money in advance for them to hold onto and they issue you a credit card with the same credit limit as the amount you gave them.  Just make your payments on time every month and eventually they will return your security deposit and make the account unsecured (assuming you pay the bill on time each month).  The second way to fix your credit is to open a small secured loan at your local bank for a short time period (12 months is best) and pay the loan back on time.

If you are $50 overdrawn, they may just forget you.|`|sPr2HhYEaa	yes. Even if the bank goes out of business whenever you owe a bank money it gets reported to either check systems or a collection agency so one of these or both would have the debt on their records.|`|aKDPrPlkaa	The debt is not clear, debts are never clear until full payment.  It is very likely that your loan will be purchased by another bank (at a discount), so you would owe them.
124497556bfb4613dd2c9273ba87e2f1aa	If the house is listed go ahead and call the agent and tell them you want to look at it. Don't tell them you are not interested as they may not want to show it to you. Simply tell them you are interested in the house and would like to see it.     If the house inst listed and the bank still owns it call the bank and tell them you are interested in making an offer but you need to see the inside. They should be willing to make a appointment and show you the house.     In reality you are in the market for the house, if the price is right and everything is right you would in fact buy it so don't feel sham in asking to see it. The banks WANT to show houses in today's market that will more than likely be dying to show it to you.     I look at dozen of houses a week and many of them I am not convinced I am willing ot buy them either and an up close inspection is what ends up making my decision for me.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	You shouldn't be looking at homes until you are pre-qualified for a loan amount.  It isn't to anyones benefit to look at something you may not even be able to afford or get a line of credit on.  You are certainly free to look at model homes or open houses in your area to see what you may or may not like when you are ready to commit, but don't waste anyone's time if you are not pre-qualified for something you see on line.  If you believe you are ready for this home and are pre-qualified, go ahead and set up an appointment.  Otherwise, you are wasting everyones time including yours.|`|EPc8Wvkpaa	Depends upon the realtor.  Some will not show a home unless the potential buyer has at least been prequalified.  I would check to see if there is an open house coming up and go to that.      Even if the realtor will show the house without you being prequalified, I would think twice about it.  It does no one any good for you to get attached to a house you might not be able to buy and it wastes the realtor's time showing a house to someone that does not have the intent to purchase one soon.|`|X368wIVuaa	Theresa,  Some of the previous answers are quite valid, from a REALTOR's perspective. To some REALTORS it can be disturbing to show a home to a customer that really is just window shopping with no intention of buying. This can also be annoying to the homeowner that may need to make preparations to leave the house, maybe make arrangementss for the family pet etc., in order for a REALTOR to show it to you, only then to discover you really were just a curiosity seeker. Although many REALTORS do not mind showing a few homes to a not yet qualifiedbuyer, they will not keep up any pace with showing you homes unless you indicate you are a serious buyer. The best bet for you, if you are not ready to take that next step in purchasing, is to limit your shopping on-line and not in person. It's not a bad idea, and in fact is highly encouraged, that you do shop on-line. This way you can keep track of the homes that seem most attractive to you by way of amenities, locations, etc, so when you are ready, you will be more familiar with your local market.  When you think you are prepared to take that step, get pre-qualified with a lender and contact your REALTOR of choice.|`|bghPNGjMaa	Presumably the house is being handled by some Real Estate Agency or Real Estate Agent.  Usually they have some open houses on the weekend where you can just go in and look.  However, if they aren't having any open houses, all you have to do is call the agent and say you want to look at it.    Any Real Estate Agent worth anything will be glad to show it to you in this market, in case you really do become interested, or in case they can convince you to become their client, either one of which would benefit them.  You are not obligated to do either just because you looked.|`|8f21a30add887a52f192f6bec742ade6aa	You have every right to simply take a look at a home that is on the market. You do not have to be pre-approved for a loan. That being said, be prepared to resist strong sales tactics either from the real estate agent or any mortgage broker you might encounter.    Shopping for a competitive interest rate & getting pre-approved for a loan only matters when YOU are ready to put in an offer on a property.

I know you want your money now, but until its Feb 1, you just have to be patient. After Feb 1, then you can start freaking out.  Er Feb 1 is Sunday. I'd wait till Monday mail runs.

OacSIfSiaa	Forever if they want, but they can not seek legal action if the debt is "time barred" or otherwise known as being beyond your states statute of limitations.  You can find your states SOL on debt at this web site  http://www.bcsalliance.com/statute_of_li...    If the debt is time barred then simply send them a cease and desist letter via certified mail/return receipt.  It need not be anything fancy, simply a letter stating the debt is time barred and that if they continue to harass you, you will seek civil action under the FDCPA.

r52rfBkeaa	You need to call the 1-800 number on your monthly bill - I literally just went through this same issue last month with with my Corolla.  We've been overpaying $200 each month for the past 8 months and my husband noticed that on the bill it says that it goes towards the next payment due and not the principal.  I called the number and they said that although the bill states this, the overage is really going to the principal.  They reassured me by sending me a statement breaking down how much of each of my payments went to principal and how much went to interest and sure enough, they had been going to principal.<br>  <br>  Call to make sure and have them send you a similar statement about your payments.  If your overage hasn't been going to principal, they can make the changes to all of your prior payments so that they do go to principal, all while you're on the phone.  They may tell you that you have to send your overage payment to a different address, but that's bologna, especially since they can fix it over the phone.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	be sure you have a pay any day loan , if it is you can pay it off any day without a prepayment penalty .if not you might incur fees for early pay off.generally loans are paid interest first ,with the largest part of the payment going to interest ,and a minor part to principle ,and the percentage changes as you pay it off. check your contract ,principle only payments might not be allowed.|`|LiGWTLpSaa	The terms of your loan (including payment terms) are set out by contract.<br>  <br>  You can't just hand them a check and demand that it only pays principal.

Mortgages work the same way.|`|o4T0dScfaa	Make the principle payment with your next "actual" payment. They won't even have a due date, in their system, for your next payment. Call TF and make them denote, in the system, what you are trying to accomplish.|`|I7egS27waa	yes, i don't pay mine with check i go directly to those dudes.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	After you make your principle only payment and you see that the check is cleared, Call them and make sure it was applied to principle only. I just went through this with Chrysler Financial. My wife and I are in the process of paying off all of our debts as quickly as possible. When I made a huge payment in August, The next months statement came back saying I owed nothing for September. I called them and they said that was because I made such a huge payment and that I owed nothing until October and it was only like $50. Yes, I made almost a triple payment. We made another huge payment in September even though technically we did not owe anything until the next month, but this time we were smart about it. We sent in the payment for $50 bucks with the statement, and sent in a separate check labeled principle only. Once the check cleared the bank, I called back and told them I wanted it applied towards principle only and they took care of it. Then we got a payoff amount in November and paid off the car. Almost a year early. <br>  They will not change the terms of the loan based on your payments. You signed up for so many dollars for so many months. Just because you send in double payments every month does not mean they will drop a payment off the end of your payment cycle and move everything up 1 month. They are not that honorable. The longer they can keep the account open, The more you pay in interest on the amount outstanding. If you pay it off early, they will not make as much money. Make sure that once your check for principle only clears your bank, you call them. Every month. <br>  I can't tell you how nice it is driving cars with no payments. This frees up about $800 a month for us to apply to other debts. We now own both of our cars outright. It sounds like you are on the right path. Keep paying more than the minimum every month and keep on top of them. If you don't they will apply your payment to interest instead of principle. Good luck and I hope you will not have a car payment soon. Keep it up.

wQJBFcluaa	It just means the IRS has accepted the return.Lots of people have been bumped to the 2/24 date so I wouldn't start getting all worried just yet.Check the WMR tool Monday.It should have updated by then and you may have different info by then.I got bumped to the 2/24 date also but I called my tax preparer today and they looked it up and said I was showing as getting a DD on 1/30 and I should have it credited to my account by Tuesday at the latest.They told me the 2/24 date people are getting is not accurate.I think a lot of people e-filed early this year because they needed the money and it has just overwhelmed the IRS.    Kris  I called Taxcut and spoke with them.1-888-482-9288.She was able to see a DD was sent so I don't imagine the WMR date of 2/24 is valid.Thing is it goes to their bank first so they can deduct their fees and then to my bank.So if it was DD Friday it probably will be Tuesday before I see it.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	A DCN is a "document control number" and in this context just says they have accepted your return into the computer.

gtgJTFOoaa	I feel guilty that I have a job (a sixteen year old) when even my teachers are losing their jobs.  It does not make much sense, but teenagers need to save up for college if their parents have no savings set aside for their education.  <br>  I got my job as a sunday school assistant by just going to church and being social.  So I would suggest you contact as many people as you know and get connections.  People helping other people :)<br>  Good Luck.  <br>  It's going to be hard for the youth of today to find jobs in this economic situation, but hopefully it won't last long.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	When I was a teen I got jobs by applying in person and asking Jesus to help me to get the job He wanted me to do at that time. Always answer every question an interviewer asks as fully as you can and answer as fast as you can. Delaying in answers makes people think you are trying to hide something.<br>   Learn as much as you can every chance you get.  The more you know, the more you can do for employers and the better your chance of getting and keeping a job.<br>   Nevewr tell an interviewer that you need whatever job you are applying for. Tell them you want the job instead, and have some reason why that job would help you improve your skills and that you will help the company make more money by working for them. Telling them you need the job makes them think you are desperate.<br>   Never give up. You will have a better life if you keep trying.|`|PRg9UgOlaa	I have heard a few people being declined for a job because they are over qualified. Maybe that is the case with you?

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

ZeDjn4cVaa	It is neither a IRA nor a Roth IRA.  You need do nothing about the 401K because  the amount you contributed to the 401K has already been subtracted from your wages and will not be taxed.  If you are single and your income is below about $25,000 then your 401K contribution could generate a saver's credit for you and save you between $200 and $1000 in  taxes.    Richard K  Master Tax Advisor  Enrolled Agent    This advice was based upon my understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts described by you.  See my profile for more information.|`|atTYPPsQaa	401(a) Money Purchase Plan is a retirement savings plan that allows you to set aside money for retirement. Your 401 Plan may allow contributions to be made by your employer, you, or both.    Your contributions may be made on either a mandatory or a voluntary basis. The employer decides on the method of participant contribution, as well as whether participant contributions will be made on a pre-tax (picked-up contributions) or an after-tax basis.    The most common method our clients use is direct employer contributions with mandatory participant contributions with the "pick-up provision." Under this scenario; mandatory employee contributions are made on a pre-tax basis. Your plan may also allow you to make voluntary contributions on an after-tax basis. These voluntary after-tax contributions are limited to 25 percent of your compensation
eACZ1Rhjaa	I am a saver too making sure I make the investments first. Doing things like buying a home when you are young help your net worth grow. Spending less than you earn is good but you need to have that money earn money too. Invest in things like a education first so you can earn more and you can save more. Lock in some cost like housing and you can live on ever smaller percent of your income. Getting new streams of income like rental income helps too.|`|4f3GfrN6aa	Saver.  I'm a tight ****.      I always take my own lunch to work, and grow my own vegies.  I also shop at factory sales outlets for bulk food products.  I buy a lot of essential stuff second hand.

Years ago when I was first divorced I had major surgery that kept me out of work for two months. I used up all my vacation and sick time and had to borrow on a life insurance policy to  pay rent and keep my car. After that I said never again will I be that close to being homeless so I am a obsessive saver. Not to say I never spend or am a tightwad. I save  20% of my earnings (of course that was after I was making a higher salary) and most of the money left over after paying all my bills (which are few) I put that in savings too. All tax returns go in savings.  If I need  money I can always withdraw it, and often do for large purchases, rather than financing.

YIy9yu4qaa	As far as investments, both aparments and cars are the worst things. A car is always costing more money, even if you buy it new, and they lose their value at exponential rates. The minute you drive a new car off the lot its worth half what you paid for it.   The key to cars is to pay for them upfront, don't get the convenient loan that the dealership will offer. That $200 quickly becomes a thorn in the side.   If you can pay $1000 for a car that breaks down after 1 year, then you are 100 times smarter than the guy who just bought a new car with a car loan.     Here is what I would do. Find a running car that will get you from place to place. Make sure to keep the oil changed every 3000 miles etc. Take care of it. While you work a job to earn a little extra cash, find a friend or family member who will let you crash on their couch or in a spare bedroom for a month or so. During this time, you can save up your money and get the apartment.   If you can't do this, try to find someone you know who can roommate with you and split the rent.|`|TKnnt90qaa	well if u can afford a couple more months then a car definatly! u dont have to ask people for rides or anything and if worst comes to worst u could proboally stay with your parents till u can get an apartment. but id get a car good luck!|`|Zn8A9vWdaa	If u cant live in the street or have a friend to stay with, u need an apartment for sure.

This would beat the heck out of owning a car, and having to sleep in the car since you don't have an apartment.     If you are able to stay with a friend or family member for a SHORT amount of time until you are back on your feet, then I would say spend part of the money on a used car and then save up for getting your own apartment.     Me personally, having lived on my own for 10 years now would definitely prefer the apartment over having a car.|`|AA11907945	I have done without a car many times, but having shelter is pretty mandatory.  My take, see if you negotiate a better arrangement with your perspective landlord, if not, definitely go for the apartment, then put away a little each week toward your future car.    AND... whatever you do, don't go into debt for a car, save up and pay cash.  Might take you a few months, but not having a payment is a very good feeling.    Like another answerer said, use public transportation, or even walk if you're close enough, it's good for the soul.    Keep a good outlook, save for a rainy day and move forward with your life.
2N6oTOLQaa	That would be pretty hard to do since you would not have the proper 1098 forms from your college.<br>  <br>  Here's a little story to make you think twice before you cheat on your taxes. In a recent book, an author studied deca-millionairs. He only studied people who had at least $10 million and an annual income of at least $750,000 sustained for several years. He interview these people and everyone around them (friends, family, business partners, their employees, etc). He looked for common characteristics among this group of super-rich people. In his research he identified 38 common character traits. He ranked them from most common to least common, with number 1 being the one most likely to be found in a deca-millionaire. That number 1 characteristic, found in every person he studied, was integrity. Keep that in mind while you cheat on your taxes to try to make a few extra bucks from your fellow taxpayers.|`|57IDs4byaa	I hate people that cheat on taxes.

e9YFTyzZaa	When someone Dies and you are IN their Will, you will receive a Letter from their Lawyer. In the Letter he will give you any particulars to the Inheritance, amount, how it's to be delivered and any papers needed to be signed.<br>  No, signing any papers does not mean the Will was/has been changed. It merely states 'you are the Recipient the Will says you are'!|`|GyPNO47gaa	I think you hae to sign it to legalise it - otherwise the banks keep hold of it.

ZxCLrB1Taa	Some collectors will let you set up payment plans, and for the most part they are reasonable, but if you have no income, then you can write a letter, and submit it to them, stating that you would like them to stop calling you and they will but it doesnt make the debt go away. Another option is bankrupcy, which you would have to speak with a lawyer about.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I hated to do it, but I just went and talked to an attorney and decided to file chapter 7 bankruptcy. We had huge medical bills and my husbands pay was just cut, due to the economy. We are barely surviving. Most bankruptcy attorneys will accept payments.

Good luck|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Easy, file for bankruptcy that is what it is there for.

It was free to call them so i said why not, and I'm glad i did :-\|`|xoqQbHi1aa	You cannot be sent to jail for nonpayment.  There is no "debtor's prison" in the United States. As far as the rest, you need a plan.<br>  <br>  Please do not consolidate. It is not free, they will lower your payments by increasing the length of time until you are debt free, and you will take a hit on your credit score. Or they negotiate your debt down after telling you not to pay for awhile adding another hit to your credit score. There is a better way.<br>  <br>  A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.<br>  <br>  B.If you aren't working, get a job.  If you have a job, get a temporary part time job.  If you have a full time job and a part time one, get another. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:<br>  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.<br>  <br>  3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:<br>  <br>  To start :<br>  Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment<br>  Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment<br>  Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: paid off<br>  Debt #3:Mimimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment.<br>  <br>  That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.<br>  <br>  4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.<br>  <br>  5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.<br>  <br>  5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.<br>  <br>  You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think. Just follow the plan|`|YyXtxeNGaa	I have a similar problem.  I was kind enough to offer credit to lots and lots of people for my house painting service.  Now they have left me hanging out to dry.<br>  They now have nicely painted homes and the bank has started foreclosure proceedings against my family.<br>  I guess dishonesty has its rewards.<br>  Honesty and kindness sure doesn't pay.

bY58V3oraa	I have been doing affiliate marketing for three years now.  I work a full-time job and have a family so I can't invest the time into affiliate marketing that I'd like to but I am consistently making an extra $300 monthly and I'm seeing more and more traffic to my websites.  I know if I could do it full-time, I'd be making a lot more money.  I really enjoy it...it's a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  And, yes, you can make good money.  It just depends on how much you put into it and how badly you want it.  I, too, became extremely frustrated and was ready to quit but then I'd make a sale so I know I can do it but it's a lot of work.<br>  <br>  I actually pay a monthly fee ($39, $29 if you pay for a full year) to be a member at Wealthy Affiliate.  They teach you everything, and I mean everything, you need to know to become a successful affiliate marketer.

But I am working with a previously developed skill. I go on elance.com and bid for projects for regular, average pay. :) I bid against others who may have more experience than I, or who may bid lower; there's no guarantee of receiving work. The only way to increase my chances of getting more work is to work harder, work better and produce great projects. Just like outside-the-home working.<br>  <br>  The things you're trying are--forgive me for putting it this way--all the "get rich quick just by pushing a button or being funny!" ways. And they DON'T work for the majority of people. If they did, don't you think, particularly in this economy, that you'd know at least three people IRL who are making good livings that way? Or two people? Okay. How about one? That should tell you something.<br>  <br>  Develop a skill (writing; website development; etc.), or create a resume and portfolio (if applicable) based on a skill you already have, and actively seek work, talk to prospective clients (yes, you have to talk to them)...act, in short, like a professional in the outside-the-home business world; because that's the only way to be a professional in the inside-the-home business world.<br>  <br>  There are no quick fixes. If there were, trust me, people wouldn't be losing their homes en masse and lining up in droves at the Unemployment office.<br>  <br>  It blows my head that so many people want to sit around pressing buttons and have money fall from the sky.|`|98db9265e124fe3bdd587062c20209e2aa	I've been marketing online since 2002, I have had a lot of success through creating my own products and selling them online. On a good week I make a couple of hundred bucks. Sometimes I've made that much in a day. I think it all depends on having a good sales page and autoresponder and of course a good product in a niche area.

Much more than what I was making before.<br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong. I am not an expert. However, I've bought the Craigslist Secert Code guide, follow their instructions and guidelines.

If you don't have any charges on the card then most of the time it is free to have it for emergencies, as long as there is no annual fee. If you don't have any previous credit history, you should go for a visa. You can apply online for any company.|`|AA12141397	Don't get a credit card if you don't understand the responsibilities that comes with owning one.

yOmxDFJOaa	Economics focuses more on theoretical practices, research and topics related to potential application.    Finance focuses on the application of these theories in the real world-like how the stock market works, corporate practices, and government practices.    For example-I am an economics major, and I have had a large number of opportunities, however now I am a Financial Analyst.  One might think it would require a finance degree, but and Economics degree is very adaptable to many different situations.  Of course- I am partial to economics!

There are procedures to follow.  Google landlord tenant laws in TX.  Also, re-read your lease regarding non-monetary breaches.  You may have to take your landlord to court if repairs aren't made.  <br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	I definitely think you have given reasonable time.

The normal repair time would be within 30 days.<br>  Now put in writing if it is not fixed within the next 30 days you will have it repaired and deduct it from your rent.

A week or two might be considered reasonable for the vent and before it gets warm for the A/C repairs.|`|XNZpfrOPaa	Generally in matters of apartments or leased housing two weeks is considered reasonable time. You have provided written work orders, which I am certain is probably there preferred method of communication. I would document all the dates of correspondence you have sent them, as well as document what there response has been. <br>  <br>  I would definitely take legal action at this time considering that these things were clearly stated in your lease. After the certified mail I would wait two weeks. The fact that this has not been functioning since you moved in is a point that will strengthen your stance in any legal proceedings. As well, the fact that these things are affecting your comfort level should be stressed when you send your work order.|`|evB63qWvaa	That has been more than enough time.  You pay them to live there and maintain it and if they are not doing so, then they are not holding up their end of the contract and, if it came to it, you would win in court for that.
bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	Probably not, because the response you're getting isn't from TurboTax, it's from the IRS.  The IRS is declining the filing because someone else already claimed you as a dependant.  Even if it does go through, you'll get a notice from the IRS later asking to review your taxes...specifically the claim as a dependant.    Your only option is to get your parent to file a corrected return (if hers is wrong) AND for you to file a correct paper return by US mail with a letter enclosed indicating the error and why you believe you are correct in your filing.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	It will never go through for 2008.

Well, it turned out to be that both transaction went through, and they had both payments in hand!!!  It took them forever to refund me.   They finally did refund me and even paid interest, because of the overpayment.  But it sure was not fun.

You claim "head of household" etc.... However, you CANNOT claim head of household if your parents or some other person is claiming you as a dependent.     You CAN claim your child, but make sure the child's other parent isn't already claiming the baby b/c 2 people with separate filings cannot claim the same dependent.    Oh, and be sure that if you are living with your parents, or whomever, that they aren't claiming your child as a dependent b/c then you can't claim the baby, too.    You really should have someone help you file your taxes b/c they're pretty confusing.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Only if you aren't not eligible to be claimed by someone else.    Who do you live with?  How much income did you have?  Can you show you supported yourself, including paying for room and board?|`|m06TDTtTaa	There are other factors that need to be taken into consideration.     Are you still in school?  Do you live with your parents?  Do you have a job and pay more than 50% of your care?      Claiming head of household would mean that you take care of yourself and your child financially.  That means household bills, rent and such.    If you live with your parents and they care for you and your child they can claim you on their taxes and get your and your childs dependency and may even qualify for the earned income credit.      Hope this helps
Pjm9pg7iaa	Bankruptcy is worse. It means you walked away from all your debts.   Letting 2 accounts go into collections means that you did pay on all your other debts.  But there is a twist. If you let 2 accounts go into collections, the creditors have the right to go after you in court. If you don't pay that judgement, they have the right to ask the sheriff to sell your belongings to settle the debt. If you declare bankruptcy, they can't do that.  (they don't do it very much because it is a pain and they have to try to sell your sofa and towels)..|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Whatever you decide make your mortgage payments you first priority. Especially in your case since your mother, if she doesn't have the money to keep up the payments, you would lose the home.  If I were you I would go see a professional certified money manager and take their advice. If you see a bankruptcy attorney he will automatically tell you to file bankruptcy, that's how he makes his money. A money manager is objective and will give you the advice that is best for your situation.  Just remember mortgage payments first. You do not want to lose your home or leave your mother stuck with the mortgage payments. Also, if you file bankruptcy is basically shot for the next 10 years unless you can establish new credit in good standing.
Ge2Fyrgkaa	Side jobs are common and varied.  Often medics on my job will work with other EMS organizations, one medic just went back to school to get his RN and will be in the emergency room locally.  Many firefighters run their own business on the side: plumbing, electrical, tiling.  Blue collar jobs are common and schedules are easy to work around.  Several bartenders are on the job as well.  Others rely on overtime as their side job, but that can be unreliable depending on the year, economy, number of people on the job, contract, etc.  Salary is usually decent, but with days off at a time why wouldn't you get some extra $$?
ZeDjn4cVaa	You must declare all your income.  If all your income is below the filing requirement then you generally don't need to file.  You may decide to file to obtain a refund  of taxes withheld or obtain other tax benefits.

If you live together and don't file jointly, her filing requirement starts at $3500 for wages and $400 if self-employed.    If you file a joint return, you MUST include ALL of her income.  That starts at $1 (one) dollar.|`|AA11555162	You have to combine both your incomes to come up to 17900.

Can I direct part of my refund into my tax professionals checking or savings account to pay my tax preparation fee?  You can direct your refund to any of your checking or savings accounts; you cannot direct your refund to someone elses account (except for your spouses account, if this is a joint refund).|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Not a good idea.|`|1H7aNVT3aa	Not allowed, it would bounce and not go in.

GGAgxzJNaa	Yes, confront him.  Tell him he's not fooling anyone, including the president.  And tell him that if he has anything else to say about you, he should say it to your face.  He sounds pretty gutless.|`|AA10305589	Missing info here.  If this guy is so worthless and unproductive, as well as a disruption to the workplace, and the President is well aware of the scenario - why is he still working there?  What did the President say when you presented your complaints? There must be a reason they don't just up and fire him, so you should tread carefully.    Don't be surprised if talking to him has no impact on his behaviour.  It's not like he doesn't know what he is doing is wrong, he just doesn't care, and the powers that be seem to lack the will to discipline him.  But if you feel it will make you feel better, go ahead.      Keeping that in mind, you should have a professional and courteous discussion with him about your concerns.  Have a third party present as a witness to the conversation - H.R. should be present to mediate the conversation.  It they are not willing to assist you that's another big red flag, but at least get a co-worker to be present.  Keep your cool and keep the discussion on business, don't make it personal.  No name calling, threats, or mud slinging.  You want to stop the trouble, not make yourself into the troublemaker in the situation.
3mAgM405aa	Having a degree in business administration may appear to be worthwhile, however, simply working with a caterer and various religious organizations, temples, will provide sufficient training to become a wedding planner along with developing some marketing skills involving menu planning, table settings, flower arrangements, liaisons with wedding photographers, etc.    I'd recommend that you look for a wedding planner internship.    Good luck!|`|01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	yes,, I think they have to take Business Management   Courses because Weddings involve lots of maht, Budget costs, Organzing, Clothing costs, Food, Musicians, Limo Rentals, Flowers & Reception Hall Rental costs, etc are at stake....

fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	A personal bio is more of a short summary of your life in a paragraph form. It gives the reader a mini snapshot of your life. If this is for a job in the U.S. be careful about listing anything that shows your marital status, whether you have kids, etc. It should list something that demonstrates a fact about you that would be of interest to the reader.     A resume is a listing of your qualifications towards a particular position. It lists your name address and contact info. The jobs you have had, and within those jobs, what skills you have that relate to the new position and your education.
5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Yes it is OK they just can not put the donation on their taxes.

d9HK9o9maa	It depends on how quickly you want to double your money. I know you said you didn't want to buy a stock, but I'm going to suggest it anyway. There are some great companies that have really really cheap stocks right now. When the economy finally turns around these stocks will jump. I'll give one example: Union Pacific (UNP). UNP is a great run company, but the stock is being driven down with the rest of the market. Right now the stock is at $43, but the 52 week high is $85. When the market gets better this stock will be back up to $85 or even higher. Double your money.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You moved in together way too early.  That and the other things you describe are classic red flags for an abuser.  It will only get worse.  I suggest you find out what shelters there are in your area and get out now.      It also looks like you're repeating the mistakes of your mother.  It was the only example you've had, so it's no surprise.  It's good that you can see there's something wrong here, and that normal, loving, respectful relationships do not go this route.  You're in danger.  I don't mean to sound like some stranger messing with you online, but it's the truth.  Your best bet is a shelter, and if you tell them the same things you've written here, they'll recognize the problem, too, and help you out.  You can start with a YWCA, or search for domestic violence shelters near you.    Good luck!|`|AA12291184	you don't know how many people are in the SAME shoes you are in.    and i know, that job market sucks hard core and i'm 29 and i work in retail and they havent been giving me crap for hours.

Maybe they can give you tips on how to get out and provide you with a safe place to stay.  Also, if you are going to leave.  Do not inform him of your decision.  Act like everything is normal.  Forward your mail to your mom's place immediatedly.  Wait until he goes to work or school and arrange to have a moving van and a police escort ahead of time, if necessary.  My friend left her boyfriend this way.  She got out without any drama.  Never tell an abusive man that you are leaving.  You could end up dead.

And for your sake, be more choosy the next time you decide to shack up.    Aunts, Uncles, Brothers, Cousins, Friends--these people all have places you might live while you go to school. How about your father? Do you know who he is? Ring him up!    Try the battered women's shelters or YWCA for temporary housing so you can get out safely.    Also, what about the college dorms? Colleges have work-study programs that defray the cost of room and board.    You don't have to rely on some dude for housing. There are institutions to help you stand on your own two feet.    Oh, and your mother's fiance had better learn right quick that blood is thicker than water. Ring up your mom and have a private chat with her.

I know how it is to be in your situation.

From your description you have the classic abusive boyfriend, and you know where this is going to go. In the meantime contact a relative or close friend that lives outside of the dayton area and see if you can stay with them for a few weeks until you can get an apartment for yourself. Also you need to keep your plans to yourself and not tell your friends or others where you are moving too. Because once you leave your boyfriend is going to try and track you down, and he will contact your job, friends, & relatives trying to find you. He will also have his friends keep an eye out for you if you remain in the area you live in. Since you are only 20 and are worried about being on the streets, I would seriously consider joining a branch of the armed services. Once your accepted you will make good money and have benefits, and get to travel to different places. And you will have broken the cycle of your relationship with your abusive boyfriend.|`|jI2frGsraa	I agree with the comments of jaysgirl & the bitter auditor, their advice is good. My comments are pretty much the same as theirs, and don't tip off your boyfriend that you are leaving. If you have a cell phone get your number changed, and have all your mail forwarded to a different address or get a post office box. When you leave your abusive boyfriend wait till he goes to work or school, then get your stuff together quickly and get out fast. Also be sure and not leave behind any personal information & credit cards that he could use in retaliation against you. Good Luck.|`|4yq5ZrCDaa	Sweetie, Mcdonald's is hiring in your area!

If she meets the qualifications to claim you then two things are true:  1. she can claim you if she wants  2. you cannot claim yourself even if she does not    You stated you living situation for 2007.  What about 2008?  If you lived away at school, that is considered a temporary absence.  So even while at school you lived with her.  And the qualification of a qualified child dependent are if you lived with a parent and you did not supply at least 1/2 of the cost of your support yourself, your parent can claim you.  Since she can claim you, whether she does or does not, you cannot claim you.    You can still file your own return.  You just cannot claim your own exemption.|`|AA10469473	If your mom meets the rules to claim you, she doesn't need your permission, and if she doesn't meet the rules, you can't "let"her.

But you can still file your own return, you just have to check the box that says someone else can claim you, and you don't get an exemption for yourself.  But if you have a refund coming, you'd get it.    If you are a dependent, you aren't eligible for an education credit, your mom would get that.  But if you are payiing back student loans and piad student loan interest, you can deduct that.

3mAgM405aa	Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:    1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.    In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file.     Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.    Good luck!|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	I put into www.google.com "how to build a resume" and found several sources.

pt6wIlS1aa	No, it doesn't mean you can never receive unemployment. They only look at whether you quit or were fired from the most recent job. So if you were fired, then got another job, then got laid off from that job, it wouldn't matter at all that you were fired from the previous job.    Even if you are fired, you can still sometimes get unemployment. Even if you quit, same thing. Sometimes people quit for good reasons. Maybe no bus goes there and their car died. Maybe they were being harassed by their boss. If you are fired and make a case for yourself, often you'll get unemployment as long as the company doesn't fight it, and often they won't fight it.    But if you are ineligible for these reasons, you don't become eligible just by waiting. You'd have to get another job and be laid off from that one to qualify.

If you are interested in purchasing the property you can leave a message with the management company that you want the owner to call you regarding a purchase offer.  Or you check town records for the lien holder to make an offer if they foreclose. You withholding rent is your own choice but has no legal basis.

fyFyKHHjaa	Debt settlement can be a great way to get out of debt fast but it does have some consequences on your credit score. Here are some things to consider. Your credit score will drop but it may not be as bad as you think because paying off your debt looks good on your credit. There are also numerous things you can do to build your credit up again after.  Do you plan on making a big purchase soon that would require good credit?<br>  <br>  If you do decide to settle I have some good news for you.  BofA has been known to settle for 20% of the account balance.  You could get rid of 20k in debt for 4k.  This may sound to good to be true but it is.  You will have to stop paying for about 5 months but in that time you can save money to pay off the rest of your debts.|`|5BTKscZraa	Any settlement of credit card debt is going to be a big negative factor....Something doesn't sound right here to me. Credit card companies will usually only settle on accounts that have either defaulted or are just at the point of default. I've never heard of this sort of settlement on a current account before....Maybe this bank is going under and they are desperate for money<br>  <br>  * Get all terms of any settlement deal you reach with debt collectors/creditors IN WRITING BEFORE you give them your money. This letter should state the settlement amount and that the account will be settled/paid in full upon receipt of this amount from you. Make multiple copies of your settlement letter and keep in a safe place. Never accept settlement deals over the phone without following up with a written agreement...If you don’t, the debt collectors will deny that any settlement was ever made once they get your “settlement” money and will come back demanding more money.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	If you do a settlement it will negatively effect your credit score for seven years.  If you like your high credit score I would suggest that you aggressively pay off the higher interest rate one by making even $5 or $10 dollars more then the minimum each month and hitting it hard with any additional money coming in.|`|8f1i9DWyaa	My take on it is this: You can't really save until credit cards are paid off. Then there's the risk inherent in carrying debt. What if something unforeseen - God forbid - happened. You lost your job or something else. (Don't talk about it.) It's risky to carry debt. I paid my off and feel so free. I don't have interest to pay; I am liberated and can save and have interest accrue in my account, not theirs.   I am all for paying off credit debt. In fact I will be paying cash for a house. So I am not worried about my credit score.  If it were me, I would settle those credit cards, get them paid off and never use credit cards again. It has freed me, screw their credit scores and their mess. Credit cards and mortgages are instruments of slavery that banks use to get you to work for them the rest of your life. So are the loans for college. Students never go into credit debt to get an education. Not at the rates they want to charge you. When I went to school, the government loaned students money at 2%. You can't get ahead paying interest on college debt. Not at the rates the banks charge. The country needs reform that will favor student loans at 2%.|`|VkpQJ0LSaa	The decision is only yours, but if you see that you are struggling to continue making monthly payments, and even minimum payments are a challenge every month, then you have to look for a way to relief the stress that debt can cause you, and of course to have more money available for the important things.<br>  <br>  As you had mentioned, if you decide and have a way to continue to making monthly payments, your credit score would remain as it is but it will take you a lot longer to pay for the total balance since you will keep on paying interest over this long period. If on the other hand, you want to eliminate this debt in a matter of months or just few years depending on your funds, then Debt Settlement would be the greatest alternative out there, also remember that you do not pay the full amount of your debt therefore you will save some money. I wish I had heard about this type of solution before.<br>  <br>  If your accounts are current at this point, then your credit will decline during the settlement as the accounts go delinquent and then as each one is settled, your credit should improve. The positive effects on your credit report is that your future ability to pay goes up and the late marks can generally be removed from your report after settlements are done with a credit restoration company. And a settlement means that you have paid back an agreed amount to the creditors.<br>  <br>  What I think is that if they did offer you a settlement for a payback of 60% on the overall debt, you can actually save more by using the services of a Debt Settlement Company that has experience in negotiations with B of A. I know that settlements done through a settlement company can result in savings to the consumers that could range from 50% to 75% on the overall debt and sometimes even more.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you to check out some different companies to see who can represent you the best. You can check with the BBB, TASC and the Chamber of Commerce respectively to obtain excellent feedback regarding the company you look at and also to find out who the best on the settlement industry is.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is of great use, and I wish you the best of luck on any decision you make.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.curadebt.com/forum/blogs/david/130-debt-settlement-just-continue-pay-my-bills.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.curadebt.com/forum/blogs/davi...</a>

You have 4 or 5 months to make a decision, however you could move to another place but might be going into even a worse situation.  I would explain to your landlord that you desire to continue to live there but you need to see who moving into the adjoining apartment before you make another year commitment. <br>  <br>  Also, consider buying a house.....Real Estate prices are at a 10-15 low in most areas.

4f942cf8ec22187c3294b18e55c8486baa	Since you're still allowed to claim your daughter and you're now single, you might be allowed to claim Head of Household.  Here's a quote from the IRS website:<br>  <br>  "You may be able to file as head of household if you meet all the following requirements.<br>  <br>  You are unmarried or “considered unmarried” on the last day of the year.<br>  <br>  You paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.<br>  <br>  A “qualifying person” lived with you in the home for more than half the year (except for temporary absences, such as school). However, if the “qualifying person” is your dependent parent, he or she does not have to live with you. See Special rule for parent , later, under Qualifying Person ."|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	You need to realize that 50/50 custody on paper is meaningless and if the IRS can't determine which one of you actually had the child living with you for more than half the year, the IRS will rule that neither of you did, neither of you gets a qualifying child and all you will get is the $3500 exemption.  Plus, with the new focus on audits, the IRS will look back at 2007 and earlier years and fix those as well.<br>  <br>  Let me repeat this.  50/50 paperwork is meaningless.  You need to keep a calendar that proves the child lives with you.  Oh, I think she stays with her mother 5 nights a week during the school year and I have her weekends, holidays and the summer isn't going to cut it.<br>  <br>  If the IRS decides the mother is the custodial parent and you aren't, you can only claim single, the exemption and the child tax credit...and then only if mom signs a form 8332 and you attach it to your tax return.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Best you worry about going back and correctly filing those tax returns where you were married and filed as HH as that is not a bracket availableto you.<br>  <br>  I suspect the tax bill will be substantial on that mistake.

All employees laid off will get a second enrollment chance but it will only be effective from the date you enroll during the second chance offer. <br>  <br>  You have 60 days to elect COBRA (this date should be in your paperwork). After that you have 45 days to be paid current. So, wait until close to the end of the 60 days to elect.

If you are on reasonable terms with the other parent, ask them about it and if you have the child 50/50, suggest that you either split the tax benefit from whomever uses the exemption most effectively, or alternate years when one parent or the other claims the child|`|4f942cf8ec22187c3294b18e55c8486baa	First thing I'd check is to see if the other parent is trying to claim your child.  If that isn't the case, get a credit check done on your child's SSN and see if it was a victim of identify theft.

3eEddbreaa	if you split the money into 6 month terms you will not obtain the rate for a 12 month term.  The 6 month rate at GMAC is 2.60%.  The higher rate is reached with the longer term CD.  You may also want to consider other options, not necessarily savings accounst since the rate on a savings account is variable not fixed, such as other high rate CDs offered by other banks in the state you live in.  For instance, Atlantic Southern Bank in Florida offers a 7 month CD at 3.00% and a 13 month CD at 3.25%.  National offers like GMAC do not always offer the best CD rates.

Not because it's a scam...<br>  <br>  The high failure rate is due to the horrible marketing tactics that they use and teach.<br>  <br>  Your going to hear stuff like;<br>  <br>  Everyone is your prospect! - Anyone can do this! - We have the best product ever! -We’ll build your business for you. And just too many others to put here....<br>  <br>  The bottom line is this... Most of these guys have no clue how to market anything to anybody.<br>  <br>  So yes, if you do it their way you have only a 3% chance of getting anywhere.<br>  <br>  Here's the big secret to vastly improve your chances.....

Then they blame the MLM and say it's a scam. Those are your skeptics and the people they infect with their negativity.<br>  I just joined a new MLM that pre launched in October and is set to launch globally in March. There are no start up fees. It simply cost $40 per month. I have made a profit every month since joining and expect my next check to be around $300. It continues to rise every month. We expect to have over 1 million members by this time next year all of which will be beneath me earning me thousands every month. This is the only MLM of its kind in the world. We have no competition! I'm loving it, especially since I don't have to sell any products, I just promote the concept. I'm making money and expect a few years from now to be making in upwards of 5 figures a month. If you do nothing, you get nothing!!!!!!

It is also illegal for them to take your lock off, because then the unit is unsecured.<br>  <br>  Send them a certified letter that if they do not stop this illegal activity then you will legally break your lease.<br>  <br>  A lot of landlords either don't know the laws or hope that their tenants don't.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	They can NOT come into your apartment without 24 hours notice in any state!

E7IPy6cDaa	omg... who did your taxes? but you just have to pay em back. if you wrongfully claim something you are not entitled to the money that was refunded to you from the incorrect claim. also if you claim medical expenses you have to have bills to back em up or you are out of luck.<br>  <br>  call the drs who did the services. they should be able to provide you with the copys of paid bills.<br>  <br>  it is your responsibility to have these things if you are claiming them. if you dont you have to pay the money back.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Set up a payment arrangement and pay.<br>  <br>  Your tax return had an bogus schedule A claiming medical expenses and travel expenses that you did not have.  The IRS is disallowing it, forcing you back to a standard deduction.  This is causing you to owe tax (as it should).<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that your preparer inflated the refund on so many tax returns, that as soon as one return was audited, every return he did was.  You are lucky only 2 returns were affected.<br>  <br>  And, no, you cannot blame this on the prepaprer.  You were expected to review the tax return for errors.  If you knew you didn't have these medical expenses or travel expenses, you participated in this fraud and are just as guilty as the preparer.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	For starters, you need to never ever deal with your tax preparer again. Anyone who knows the difference between a 1040 and a 1099 knows that you can't deduct rent for your personal living space and that you need documentation in order to deduct medical bills. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the burden is on you, because you are technically responsible to ensure that your own taxes are filled properly. You should contact the IRS and set up a payment plan for what you owe. Offer whatever amount you can afford monthly plus any amount you can pay them right now. If the debt is big, I would suggest taking a part time job to generate a little cash flow to get this taken care of. You don't want to mess around with owing the IRS. They have a lot more legal authority than a typical creditor, and in fact if you can get a personal loan with interest rates that aren't much higher than the IRS rates, I suggest you take the loan to pay the IRS because I just don't like the idea of messing with a government agency that literally has the legal right to come take the TV out of my living room and sell it to pay off my debt.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	You must have had one hell of a taxpreparer they allowed you to deduct your rent on your tax return.

VpjQpAOYaa	Your offer is most likely going to be ignored by the lender.  The lender apparently is going to allow the property to foreclose and not accept a short sale.<br>  <br>  Once the auction happens, your offer is no longer valid.  You can try to buy it at the Sheriff's sale, but be sure you know what you need to bring if you are the successful bidder.  (Some require proof of funds, or a pre-approval letter from a bank plus a certain percentage of down payment with a set amount of time, etc.)<br>  <br>  It may be a good thing, you may get it cheaper and a foreclosure is MUCH easier to purchase than a short sale. <br>  <br>  If your Realtor does not know these things, you may want to think about using a different Realtor.|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	I think a Sheriff sae cancels out all other previous bids...call the Sheriffs office and ask|`|U6ShYDGbaa	once the sherrif sale is commplete, your offer is void! it no longer belongs mto the people you made the deal with! then they have a repemtion period! 6 months in mi.  in which they can come up with the full amount owed plus legal fee's and intrest! you can make an offer to the bank after that!  go on line to the h.u.d site! its a very good site for buying forclosed homes!<br>  <br>  <br>  dave the real estate guy
