20090304180602AAEBqyz	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Watts RMS on speakers : just how good is 2x 5 watts RMS, compared with 240 watts RMS?	I'm looking ot invest in a new midi or micro system, but having trouble getting one with everything I want built-in. The most important thing for me is sound quality. So...      Do I get this one :   2 x 5 watts RMS   FM/DAB tuner   MP3 playback   CD-R/CD-RW playback   Single cassette         Or sacrifice the DAB for this one :   240 watts RMS   FM/MW/ tuner bands   MP3 playback   USB port   3 carousel   CD/CD-R/CD-RW/MP3-CD/WMA-CD   1 cassette   Incredible surround is an audio technology from Philips that dramatically magnifies the sound field to immerse you in the audio.         There's a price difference of about ï¿¡50-, but that isn't relevant.   The reason I want a cassette deck is to tape radio ~ especially DAB radio, but as both have that, I'm willing to forgoe the {sometimes temperamental} DAB in favour of the sound quality.       Or do I just say "what the heck!" and buy both?      Help!      Thank you :)

It isnt detected by itunes, so i cant restore it.  I used the cywood jailbreak helper, which one time i tried to reboot and the command prompt would close rapidly.  After, i noticed that my ipod was still off, so i tried to put it into DFU (recovery mode).  After every attempt, i got a message saying "USB DEVICE NOT RECOGNIZED, then something about a malfunction."  I have two options, either one of you guys tells me how to fix it or i can take it in to the apple store.  If i take it to the apple store, will they be able to tell if its jailbroken, and not replace it?  I ask because i figure if i cant turn it on they cant either.  PLEASE HELP IM REALLY SCARED.  If anyone knows how to make itunes detect it, i can restore it.

Last time I turned my XBOX on, it made a different sound; a higher pitched sound rather than the normal low, loud humming. Everything looked in order so I continued playing.

Do you think the fan has stopped working property (see the noise comment) and that's why it overheated?   What could have caused this?

Im trying to get the best sound i can on my ps3 but i know nothing about the different sound types, i have a hdmi cord and the default audio settings are on    linear pcm 2 ch.44.1 khz and   linear pcm 2 ch.48khz   is that good or should i change it to dolby digital 5.1 ch. and there are higher linears up to 7.1 192.khz but the first time i thought about switching to higher linear it said if the device in use does not support the frequency selected, the speakers may become damaged but if the default settings are already on linear 2 ch. doesnt that mean that i can go higher or is that bad too or is linear a bad choice and i should use dolby digital 5.1?

I'm having trouble with my MP3 player, and I was hoping someone could help me.  You see, I've had it for about 2 weeks now, and it has ceased functioning after being rolled over ontop of on the bed.  What the crap.  When I plug it into the computer with the USB cord, it isn't recognized on 2000(it won't even start up), but on XP, it's recognized and needs drivers.  Why is this so?  Why wouldn't it be recognized on 2000?  I'm confused.  So, if someone could give a girl a little bit of help.  Should I just try to install drivers again or..what?      Thank you!

20070409171521AAXjgnN	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear	Why does anyone like xbox 360?	How could anyone like 360 more than PS3? It's impossible. Because it's cheaper? Let's think of all the things that PS3 has that 360 doesn't. BluRay, DVD, and Cd player. 360 can't play their HD-DVDs unless you get an expensive add-on. PS3 has a web browser, 360 doesn't. PS3 online play is FREE! Playstation store is better than xbox marketplace. You use actual money and no gay-*** points. Everyone remember when xbox said that using a big HDD and HDMI was useless. Why are they now using them in the Elite? Cuz PS3 did so good with them. F U C K XBOX!!!!!!!!!!
