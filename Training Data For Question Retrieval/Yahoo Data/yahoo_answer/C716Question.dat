20071118161240AA9LItX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Everythings getting old.?	I'm in high school, & all the boys at the school totally bore me. They flirt with me and talk to me, but not one of them do I like.   I dont like one person at my ENTIRE high school. It's crazyness. I just really want to like somebody, to feel that feeling you get when you really like somebody.   I've had it before, but now I havent felt it  for 6 months.   However, yesterday I was walking around the mall, & I started talking to this guy.   He amazed me.   He was so perfect.   I talked to him for hours.   & then I got a call.   I needed to come home.   He turned out to be 26 years old.   Too old for a high school girl.   I gave him a hug and we parted ways.   I will never see him again.   And every minute since I met him, I've thought about him.      It's not because I just met him. No thats not it I meet new people all the time and they dont have this effect on me.    I'm really depressed about it, & I just want to be with him again.   What should I do?   Should I give up on him, & get over it?   whatt

20071118194137AA5XWDC	Family & Relationships;Friends	Anyone have advice on how I can stop being shy?	I am very shy. You will never in your life see me approach other people. I will either wait for them to approach me, or for them and I to be introduced by a mutual party. If that doesn't happen, I won't speak to them. I will most likely remember who they are, but I won't speak to them the next time I see them, because I don't think that they'll remember me, and it's embarrassing to explain to someone where I met them at, when it's obvious I didn't make that much of an impression on them to begin with.      Do you guys have any recommendations to fix this?         By the way, I'm a female, and I'm 19 years old, going on 20. And as for the whole "just go out and talk to people" thing, I've tried that, but I can never seem to make that last, because I always feel as if those people don't rally like me...      Immature, yes, but it is what it is. That's why I'm trying to get over being shy

Wir sind 11/2 zusammen, es gibt viel Sch?nes das wir teilen und doch, vor 3 Monaten hat sie mir gestanden, da? sie mit 3 anderen M?nnern intim war. sie sagt das w?r ohne Sex abgelaufen, Z?rtlichkeiten halt, zusammen im Bett kuscheln und so. 2 von den Jungs waren "Ex" von ihr wo es noch etwas abzuschlie?en gab, der dritte war Verliebtheit. Nachdem sie dann gemerkt hat, da? ich doch "besser" bin als er war das für sie auch erledigt. Das alles hat sie mir lange verschwiegen. Heute noch ist sie nicht bereit, n?hers zu diesen Ereignissen zu erz?hlen. Ich hab jetzt schon ?fter die Trennung gewollt, sie will aber mit mir alt werden. Ich liebe sie, kann ihr aber nicht mehr vertrauen. Die TRennung durchzuziehen tut furchtbar weh. Was denkt ihr? Soll ich die Beziehung beenden oder lohnt es sich an der Beziehung dranzubleiben? Mir ist Treue sehr wichtig und der Schmerz betrogen worden zu sein ist rie?ig gro?.

20071211112052AAxk8uA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If you were me, will you give him back the money?	I am in a relationship with this guy for almost 2 years, am still very much in love with him. I suspect that he has been seeing other women and cheating on me, could not find him many nights in the past 2 years with no resonable explaination. He is not going to change, as what he told me: if you love me, accept the way I am.   He helped me fiancially when I needed help, loaned me middle 5 figure money with no documents signed. Holiday is coming and I suspect he made plans with other women, he wanted to be free from me questioning him. And now he asked me to sign some legal documents and pay back the money.    If you were me, will you sign the documents and pay him back the money? I am not trying to take the money, but I feel like when I hold the money, he is nicer to me.

20080213182411AArFc0j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the deal with men and the "hard to get" game?	Ok so, i've been asked out by a lot of guys (not anyone i was interested in, unfort.). So, in the past i have taken it upon myself to ask guys i actually like out...well not "out" but to "hang out". Nothing good has ever come from this. I use to refuse to believe that every guy likes a girl who plays hard to get..now i am questioning this. So what is the deal? Do most men really like to pursue or are most men just plain scared to ask women out?      I know this is somewhat of a silly question, but i'm looking for some serious answers...from guys or girls in their 20s..      thanks!

It was great, she was pretty, and so we decided to give it a shot by dating. The first date was awkward, as always, but as time went by, we got to know each other better and things looked real good for us. During the third week of dating,(be aware we went out like 3-4 days a week)...we were holding hands, kissing, like a couple....so I decided to ask her out and make it official. I understand it was only three weeks, but it seemed like the perfect time, and I even asked her if it was going to fast then we could hold. Well, she said yes, so it looked good for 2 weeks, when all of a sudden, she starts canceling dates on me for other reasons, but I didn't take it in any wrong way. On easter Sunday, we start talking online, when all of a sudden, she bust with a question that if I thought we may have went to fast and that she would like to just be friends for now. Told me that we were different, and that this decision would be best for us.

She is again teaching physics 2 and im in the class.  I try not to let her beauty to get to me but I cant get off her in my mind.  I dont plan to tell her because it is very unappropriate for students or teachers to say they like each other  .  However I would like to know what to do to get this off my mind.

She just arrived from overseas and is living with me and already notices a difference in culture and has been having neg experiences with particularly them.   NO JOKE   I don't know what to tell her bc I faced similar things, she's talking mostly sexual creepiness...and I don't want her to have a tainted views of Americans.   BTW - she is from a reserved culture - dress and behavior.      What to do?
20090131110907AAf9nGx	Family & Relationships;Family	Why do dead beat dads always get away with not paying?	How come when a man chooses not to help support the child/ren that he helped create it is always up to the mother to figure out how to take care of the kids? How come the father can just go about his life like no one else matters and work underneath the table or not work at all and its ok. The courts never even really try to get the father to pay. They just say you have to wait until he gets a job. And when he doesn't, it takes months and months to suspend his license and months and months for anything else. (if they even decide to do anything) Meanwhile, the mother is working numerous jobs and struggling the whole time, while he is spending his money how ever he sees fit and not worrying about having to help. What kind of world are we living in? Its no wonder we have so many children today without fathers and In trouble. And so many mothers that cant provide the proper kind of life for their children. If the judicial system would just step it up and set some new guidelines we wouldn't have this problem. I think because there is no real structure to child support so many families are falling through the cracks and our kids are the ones who ultimately pay the price. Im disgusted...any thought or insights?

20090131093108AAM4TBq	Family & Relationships;Friends	PLEASE TELL ME UR OPiiNiiONS! ?	Ok, I know this is long but please read it:   Me & my bestie have been "friends" with this girl since 9th grade and she wasn't really that great of a friend the whole time, only in the beginning. Over the months, she started changing;; pretending to joke around/argue with us but she always took it 2 far. She said hurtful things and pretended like she was kidding when we would get mad. Then one day in  spetember last year after school, me and my best friend told her we were in a rush to get home but she was taking her sweet time and we just left her. Later that same afternoon I saw her on the bus and when she got on, she saw me, rolled her eyes and took a seat far away from me. I told my best friend what happened & that girl hasn't talked 2 us since then. Now she's always acting like a *****, twisting the story around and getting people involved in the situation that don't have ne thing 2 do with it.Her so-called "new best friend" doesn't talk to me and my best friend anymore either because of what happened--and she wasn't even there! Its none of her business! 2 this day, me & my bestie r constantly "competing" with them bcuz they're just immiture and stupid. What do you guys think of all this??
20090131103619AAkg4ZG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Guy problem, help me please?	okay, so i was hanging out with my two friends and at the time i hadn't told any of them who i liked,but they kept bugging me, so i finally did.  I talk to him a lot in math, which is the only period I have with him, and we get along great, so I was not thinking I would be able to get him to like me.      A week ago, my friend who I told I liked, messaged me on myspace and said "i know your going to be mad at me for this, and i'm really sorry, but i like ______(same person i like), and he likes me."      i felt heartbroken, destroyed, torn apart, ready to faint/cry/scream...   i didn't say anything back, so my friend just completely acted and still is acting like everythings absolutely fine between us.      we are on the same bus (my friend and i, not the guy) so we always walk out to the bus together, but lately, even when i'm with my friend, she'll ditch me to talk to the guy. doesn't she completely realize how that makes me feel? and i think she'll try and make it subtle, so i don't realize, like for instance --      yesterday, we were walking in the hallway and i saw the guy was at his locker, and my friend was walking slowly. i was like "cmon, we're going to be late for the bus" and she was like "ugh, i dont feel like walking," so i just kept walking, thinking she was behind me. when i loooked back, she seemed completely fine walking with the guy both of us liked, and i felt once more, heartbroken.      i'm at a loss. i know i shouldnt like the guy now that theres really no chance, but... i don't know.. help??

20090131102722AACj8t4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: do you just forget about mistakes?	I had a small fight with my boyfriend today for the first time of our 2 year relationship. I was texting my friend about me being annoyed at my bf and I accidentally texted it to my bf instead...  It wasn't over anything big, just him not calling, but it's our first fight. I apologized and explained things and he said yes when I asked if he still wanted to see me tonight. I've asked questions on here about it and people have said that I should act like normal cause guys just drop these types of things after an apology cause it doesn't really matter. Is that true? If it was me I'd be thinking about it for a really long time, so I don't see how guys don't.
20090131094837AAu8WD9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Told him I was pregnant and he left me. Now what to do.?	I put this under the marriage section because we were suppose to be getting married in 2 weeks. I could really use your adivce Please help me.    I found out yesterday that I'm pregnant. I told my fiance last night and he went off the deep end. Basically I ended up begging him to believe that I did NOT do this on purpose. I would never do that. I don't' want someone to stay with me just because I'm pregnant. I'm mailing him this letter..    Any suggestions? What would you think if you received this? Men, do you think he'll come around? How would you have reacted?       You shocked me tonight. Because I mentioned a name I liked and because I didn't want you to leave you think I did this on purpose? That is the dumbest reasoning I've ever heard. Just because I like a name, doesn't mean I wanted to have a baby.       Wow how shallow minded you are. First of all, why the hell would I get pregnant on purpose? I have a morality clause in my contract at the university. That means if I'm pregnant and unmarried I WILL lose my job.         How dare you question my integrity and sincerity. I have never lied to you! NEVER! Do you seriously think you're that important that I would get pregnant to try to keep you? Please! I'm a smart girl, I have a great job, and a bright future ahead of me. Why the hell would I ruin my future by getting pregnant by a man who has apparently lied to me constantly since day 1 of our relationship. And obvious I didn't want our relationship to end, so why would I intentionally do something that I know would make you end the relationship? If you seriously think about it, you know deep in your heart I didn't do this intentionally.       I can't believe how cold hearted you were tonight. Instead of comforting me and acknowledging how scared I must be, you put this the blame on me. I took my birth control everyday. I never missed a day. You showed your true colors tonight. A MAN does not act like that. A MAN doesn't run a way from a problem. We should have been figuring out what "We" should do.. Instead you're leaving everything up to me. I'm sorry that this happened, but it's just as much your fault as it is mine. Oh and thank you for making me feel like nothing by sayin "I never loved you." I really appreciate that. It was unneccesary, even if it's true, you only said it to hurt me. You proved to me that everything you have said to me has been a lie.       In the end you're the one who will regret what has happened. I can't have an aborition. It's not the babys fault and I will not end a life because it's an inconveience. I will have a life time of memories and the blessings of this child and you will have nothing. I'm terrified! I'm nervous! I'm scared. But I would rather feel all those things and do this alone than have someone like the man I saw last night in my life.

20090131105525AA8MzkB	Family & Relationships;Family	College and Family Problems - Do I Have the Right to be Angry?	All through high school, I worked my butt off. I took seven AP courses, was VP and Pres of several clubs, and worked hard to still do community service.    So I should be going to a great college - but I'm not. I got accepted into a college that only takes about 100 students a year, but I can't go because of money. My father makes a lot of money, but my mother has always spent it on frivolous things - so we can't get anything out of FAFSA and yet we have no money to pay for college.     So instead of going to the great college, I'm going to a really crappy one. I'm angry, and usually, I'm pretty good at controlling myself. But now I have a right to be angry, don't I?    I mean, it'd be one thing if my father told me to shoot for the stars, but since I started applying for college he's told me that I need to be "realistic" and should just settle for where I'm "going to end up anyways". If he would at least get behind me and support me TRYING to get a good education, I would be angry at all. I want someone to support me...even if what I want is "unrealistic"....is that too much to ask?

20090131104905AApZCwc	Family & Relationships;Family	What to do? I need some guidance?	FIRST OFF: THIS IS ALL TRUE, SO PLEASE NO RUDE COMMENTS. IT'S TAKEN ME A REAL LONG TIME TO POST THIS, BECAUSE IT IS A VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT.       So I'm stuck. I'm really lost and I need some help, but it seems as though nobody will listen.       Let me tell you what's going on:       So my great-grandparents were mentally ill. They were seriously sick. They both ended up in a mental institution.    They also abused my grandfather.       As a result my grandfather turned rebellious. He got kicked out of school and had to join the army.    He got fired from the army because of very, very bad behavior. He met my grandmother.    They got married. My grandmother became obsessive with her weight. Very obsessive. Sickly obsessive.      They got one child, my mother. My grandfather took all of his hatred out on her.       My mother turned rebellious, just like her father. She got kicked out of school as well. Started using drugs, lots of it. She met my dad and he made her quit.      My fathers parents were both very religious. Almost like they were involved in a cult or something. I don't have anything against any religion, but they were both way in over their head.   My father refuses to talk about his family, so most of the family history I discover at the rare family 'parties'. He has 7 brothers and sisters, and something is very off about them.   It just seems as though something happened when they were younger. I do know they were very poor and had barely enough money for food and such. I think I've seen his family about 4 times.       So here's me. I'm a girl, 16 years old. I have one younger brother.       Everybody loves him. They don't like me, at all.      My mom thinks I failed. My dad is abusive. If he is around, that is. I think the reason why they don't like me that much is because I always stood my ground.   If my dad hits me, I hit back. Always have. Sometimes with the result of police showing up .       I had a shitty childhood, and made wrong turns. I started using drugs, I became very agressive. Got into fights. Developed an eating disorder. Got kicked out of school.   Changed schools. Got kicked out, again. And many, many more things.       But one day I had enough. I checked myself into rehab and decided to change.       Now I'm out. Everthing is over and done. I'm clean, I'm healthy, I'm ready to live.       Problem is, my family is not. My family is far from ok. And now I'm stuck in the middle. I don't know how long I can keep it up. I can't handle this anymore. They refuse to admit that they have problems.       I tried to get out and get help, but it feels like everybody is just looking the other way. I'm just so sick and tired. I feel like the whole family history came down on my shoulders and I need to shrug it off!    I don't really have any friends either, because I cut contact  with them the moment I checked into rehab. I wanted a fresh new start.   But I'm also scared. I feel like people will judge me. I don't want that. What should I do?         And how?       Does anybody know how?       Thank you for reading !
20090131105600AAHwd61	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should i split up with my husband?	my husband comes home from work every night and sits in front of the television with a beer. sometimes he goes out to the pub and doesn't come home until the early hours. i have tried talking to him about this but it is like he wants to avoid it. he changes the subject. once i pursued it at breakfast but he threw a glass [that had oj in it] at the wall which narrowly missed my arm and told me to shut my mouth or it'll be worse next time. he walked out and didn't come back until about 10p.m and didn't say anything to me but he did cuddle me in bed when he thought i was asleep. i couldn't sleep. then in the morning he apologised.. but that is it. he said nothing else. he never does any chores around the house. it is always me that has to clean up after him and cook for him. he doesn't even wash his own dish. he just leaves it on the table. when we have sex we are not talkative. sometimes he just comes up to me and has sex with me, we don't even discuss it. the passion has gone. he did try and get passionate on christmas eve with a romantic dinner but he stormed out because he claimed i was being difficult and a stupid wh-re which seemed to come from no where. there is one thing i have not told any body but i am pregnant with this man's baby. i don't want him to be a father to my child. he doesn't understand me. do you think it is a good idea to tell him about my pregnancy? i am 24 he is 29.

But then, a friend showed me how cool life actually is and that I don't need to sit in a chair all day. So we started riding our bikes, and we found some cool practicing spots. We had MTB's but we thought BMX's were better. Everything was so cool but my parents told me that if I want one, I'm gonna have to wait because I chose an expensive one(actually is 600$). And while I'm waiting now, the WOW ghosts came back..... Now I'm thinking about buying a new pre-paid card.... What do you say? Should I wait 2 months for my BMX or buy a pre-paid card right away?....Sorry for my bad English.....I'm from Romania

20090131110944AAdrYUS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell my parents that I have a boyfriend that's 21?	I've been with my boyfriend officially for almost three months and I still haven't told my parents. I don't even want to THINK about how my father would react to it! It my state, it's illegal until age 18. I spend the night with my boyfriend sometimes and I know my parents are suspicious and never believe me anymore. My mom asked me a few months ago if I had a boyfriend and I just denied it, and she told my father and I could tell he wasn't please with even the idea of it. I told my boyfriend that I thought my parents knew and he said I should just tell them. I told him no, because then they would think we were having sex. He said they already knew. I turn 18 in about 4 1/2 months and my boyfriend doesn't have a problem with our age difference. What would you think if you were in my parents situation/ my situation?

20090131094920AAyfaZ0	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need some serious friend advice...?	okay so my friend thinks she's fat. she isn't though. one of them is 5'2 and 109 and the other is 5'4 and 130. they always joke about throwing up after they eat, and i didn't think anything of it cuz i thought they were just joking. then last night my friend accidently let it slip that sometimes after they eat a lot the go and throw up. i started yelling at her saying it was stupid and all this stuff and she was like "it's no big deal, we don't do it all the time" but i'm afraid doing it sometimes will lead to doing it more times and they will become bulimic. i don't know what to say to her cuz she won't listen to me, that what she's doing is bad. any advice?
20090131094934AA1lRsM	Family & Relationships;Friends	A true friend??????????????	Is my friend Esmeralda a true friend? Yesterday we got into a fight, and  it makes me question her.  Ok so like for the past 2 days (thursday and friday) she has been doing this annoying thing. Screaming in my ear. She's Puerto Rican and she says that Puerto Rican's are loud but shes never being serious but its very annoying. For example, when me and her were walking in the morning when we got to school, I accidentally bumped into her because these girls were going our direction and there were like five of them and i didnt want to get slowed down by then so i scooted myself to Esmeraldas side and in front of everyone she yells "YO what the f*ck stop getting in my way". I didnt make a big deal out of it but i told her that that gets annoying. Friday morning she did the same thing and screamed something at me and i was really pissed but i didnt say anything. So friday at lunch line, I got in line and there was my ex friend Karla. (Karla got mad at me at the beginning of the school year and now she doesn't talk to me. But she's friends with Esmeralda. Or so she acts like it). So I got in line, and then Esmeralda got in line and said hi to Karla and then said hi to me. Then she turned away from me and started talking to Karla. (She always does that. Makes me feel like a piece of sh*t and ignores me,and starts paying attention to Karla. Although she's known me longer and barely talks to Karla.) So she starts talking to Karla and then she turns to me and screams in my ear "Did you hear me?!" I think what she meant by that was that she was telling Karla about something that happened with her bf and she asked me did I hear her story she was telling Karla. So i scream back at her. "NO I DIDN'T HEAR YOU". So she turns to Karla and starts talking to her. Just to fill you in a little: If it weren't for me, she wouldn't have met Karla, I don't know why Karla got mad at me;she gets mad at someone for every little thing.. Karla doesn't really care about Esmeralda. She only talks to her and acknowledges her, because if it weren't for Esmeralda she would be lonely during lunch time. Esmeralda is only company to her. But when Karla's friend Cynthia comes and sits down, suddenly Karla ignores Esmeralda and walks off with Cynthia somewhere. But Esmeralda doesn't seem to notice that because Esmeralda sucks up to Karla. When Karla gets mad at her, esmeralda says "aw i love you karla.!"and blah blah blah. She's a kissas*. But take Friday for example, When i got mad at her and yelled at her she just turned around, and on the bus she kept rolling her eyes at me. How come when Karla gets mad at her she's a suckass but when I get mad at her FOR THIS ONE TIME she b*tches? She uses Karla to get me jelous because me and Karla were best friends, and now she hugs Karla right in front of me, and walks away with Karla and leaves me by myself... :/ No this isn't elementary school drama. Were all in our junior year. Im sorry if i wasted your time but I need advice. It takes SO LITTLE to make Esmeralda mad. And Esmeralda is always yelling at me, and makes fun of me around our guy friends. But she would NEVER do that Karla. And she's only known Karla for like 6 months. She's known me since 7th grade. Should I tell her all of this? Dont refer to me as a pushover because I really do not want to be mean to her because her mother just died and I guess that'll just put more negative things on her shoulders. Any advice on this?

(Obviously this hypothetical situation stems from my situation.)  You find out some of their kinkiness is not compatible to you, like, they are turned on by degrading you.  Other than this fetish, they're totally normal and respect and love you.  Would you mind, would you break up with them, would you adapt to them, would you just try and avoid the types of sex acts that cause an issue?

20090131130426AAxhGmS	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom won't buy me new clothes.?	I have no clothes for school, me and my twin sister have a tiny closet to share between us, really tiny. my mom has 4 closets to herself.. and 5 times the amount of underwear I have. whenever I mention to her that I need new clothes she says either shouts at me, calls my dad to hit me, gets really angry and pretends to "cry" and just acts dramatic, then it makes me feel like I'm being bad by telling her I need new clothes.      yesterday she ordered herself 4 new tops online.   I told her if she won't buy me new clothes I won't go to school and she just doesn't care. omg its soooo embarresing because I wear the same clothes to school nearly everyday and people keep mentioning it to me.      a few months ago we went shopping and we went into a clothes shop and the whole time she was looking at things for herself so I just said "forget it" the thing is I don't want designer clothes like most kid these days, I just want normal clothes. but It's like she just won't buy me none. my aunt has said to her like 100 times "you really need to get them new clothes" BUT SHE WON'T; she has said for the last 8 months "I will buy you new clothes" and then when I mention it to her she says "another time".      its simple for her to get new clothes. why is she doing this? my dad gave her $60 to buy me clothes but she spent it alll on herself.      I know this is really awkward to say but I have been wearing the same top and pants everyday for the past 3 weeks. I've been cleaning them everynight but thats not the point...
20090131123408AAtJxya	Family & Relationships;Friends	FRIENDSHIP PROBLEMS!?	My so-called friend sent me this email when I asked her why she was giving my dirty looks at school:      bc. The following reasons.       A. U bascially called all da ORIGINAL homies nerds (which we know we are, but still offensive from someone else opposed to self proclomation, and u were bascially one of us)       B. u r not a prep. Just bc u wear hollister does not make u a prep. u r the Mariah u have always been, just slightly altered with fashion changes, etc       C. a prep is (in my mind) a wanna be popular. Not you (I do hope we dont go through the whole 4th grade incident again)       D. I liked the nerdy Mariah. Even the hippie wasn't so bad. But prepish? Not cool that u called Em and Christina immature.       Be wat u wanna be, but remember, i dont have a choice. i dont fit in Hollister or (hardly) Aeropostale or American Eagle, but i dont wanna be like that anyway....      ISN'T THAT MEAN?!?!?!   She's my longest friend! She thinks she's fat!   I told her we couldn't be friends anymore because she treats me like this a lot, but this is the worst case... She called ME cruel!   She's going to exagerrate everything and all my friends will be super mad! What do I do?
20090131121239AAtLGwP	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you think of the woman in California who had Octuplets?	I was reading in the news that the woman in California who recently gave birth to octuplets already has 6 other children and that she lives with her family. Now, I personally don't think that there's anything wrong with someone wanting to have lots of children, I just think that you need to be able to afford them and it would concern me to have a lot of children at once because of the need for assistance in caring for them. I also think that you need to have a plan for your family and children just in case something were to happen to you. When you have a lot of children the likely hood that someone in the family would be able to take all of them or would even want to would be somewhat challenging because there's just so many. I mean I watch the Duggers and they have a bunch of children, but they get a lot of assistance in taking care of the younger children from the older ones and because they live a simpler life than many other people they seem to be able to afford it. So there is a difference because she lives with her family. What do you think about this?

20090131121027AA5JF7d	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife wants couseling now? After cheating for 18 months but now ants divorce two days later?	wife left me and the kids...I am now a single father. Short story. She went kind of looney...dated guys...some half her age. Some older then her. Got addicted to alcohol, cyber,webcam sex some with 17 year olds..she is 35. She is currently in lvoe wiht an 18 year old from teh UK who she plays xbox live with and cybersexes with. Anyway she said this past tuesday that she lost feelings and trust for me and wants to go to counseling to try and sort this out and if it helps we can stay together if not move on. I dont know what trust she lost in me since I have been faithful? I filed for divorce about a yr ago. She was diagnosed bipolar in rehab but is not gettign treatment since she thinks she is fine. She also barely sees the kids and got a tattoo on her lower back after she left saying, " Enjoy the Ride"    Anyway I said no to counseling since I am trying to move on....I think she needs help 1st.

Do you think she will want to stay marreid in two days? I just dont understand...its been this way for the apst 17 months!

20090131124646AAf3jvc	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Question for the guys..?	This question is for the guys...   Please, no rude answers.   Why do men think it's ok to cheat?   Not all do but a lot have the attitude that as long as their girlfriend/wife and children are taken care of, it shouldn't matter that they cheat.   This really bothers me because I don't think cheating is ok under ANY circucmstances.   So why do men think it is?

20090131123032AATCoXI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with him? Read the story...?	I have been thinking about it for a week. I have been praying to God to give me an answer. So, me and this guy have been dating for about 3 weeks. This is the 4th time we've been a couple. Last Friday, we went on a date, and I just didn't feel a connection with him. We sat next to each other, and when I sit next to guys I like, I get ''butterflys'' haha. But, I just didn't feel any spark with him. He tells me he loves me, and I'm gorgeous, but I still don't think I like him. When I don't do what he wants me to do, he gets mad. For example; on Facebook,I put that I was single when I signed up. I never changed it, and he got mad. I said I'll change it later and he was like whatever. And if I dont do other things he wants me to he'll be like, ''fine then.'' It gets annoying, and he's really clingy. Today is his birthday, and his party is tonight, but I don't even want to go. So, should I just break up with him right now? HELP!

First of all  I have never been in a relationship and never had feelings in this way for anyone else.  The problem is my parents would never approve of this person and i really love them also.  He is older then i am, from a different nationality and religion.  And at first glance not the kind of guy anyone would envision their daughter with.  What would you do?
20090131130629AARqrEi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Christians who hate marriage?	I'm 21 christian and i'm really not a big fan of marriage. I'm not really seeking a wife. But what ever happens, happens. I recently went to a youth service. At youth service's they always talk about sex and relationships. My problem is, they always say not to have sex till your married. But they never tell you anything about marriage. They say value your virginity, but they don't tell you the value of marriage. How can you save your self for marriage if you don't care about marriage? The youth see's the high divorce rate, they even have shows on t.v.  It seems that the church is not doing a good job convincing people that marriage is "good" thing. Most males in there teens and 20's hate relationships, so what's makes the church think they can make them want to get married. Personally I hate having a girlfriend so i'm definitely not eager to have a wife. I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one. So what should the church tell people who don't want marriage but still want kids?

Modern females nowadays are very stuck on a man's head as the rest of his body. If a young man their age have a receding hairline or is completely bald, they'll say that he looks like an old man.      I was also watching a video asking if men should shave their body hair, that also means down there.

20090131112517AATw7aE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she really my friend ? or why does she behave so ?	Okay...she's my friend since 6yrs. She was in my class at high school.Now we don't meet very ofter cos we're doing our graduation in different colleges. But what's worst is, I'm sad whenever i meet her. Normally when I meet my friends I'm happy. but this never happens with her. The reason is she always says something which hurts me.     She says that she heard rumors about me...and she scolds me for that. She is the only one among all my friends who introduce me to other new boys and then she says I go about moving with new guys all the time.[I'm just friendly with whom I like. And I'm most of the time with 2 guys only - 1 my boyfriend n 2 my best friend].Even then she talks as if I'm flirting. She does this even in front of new people which hurts me. She talks bad even amongst all the friends. All then I become low and mood out. I don't understand why she behaves like this. Yesterday was her birthday and she invited me.There she started this again.I started disliking her now. Should I leave her ? or tell her directly or what? Or is it my mistake?    But then, she always keeps saying that she loves me.Does she really love me? Or what is she up to ?
20090131130717AA1R5lR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confusing behaviour of a shy guy.. help!?	There's this guy in one of my classes at college. I have a big crush on him but we are both shy. He appears to be more shy than me because i have to say hi for him to say hi back, he will smile first though, but as i've said extremeley shy- even in my class he will only speak if spoken to even though we've been in there months, so he's had chance to get to know the people around him ( i sit very close to him btw- literally 1 metre away). anywayyy...   quite alot of people found out i liked him, ( i told my mates, hu told some of his friends :S) so im pretty certain he knows. In class he will turn around quite often and kinda join in and listen in with convos with our mutual friend but he will completely avoid eye contact.. once we did briefly make eye contact and we both went bright red, but im sure i can sometimes see him looking at me in the corner of my eye. We've said hi in the corridors but ONLY when we are alone, otherwise when im with my friends he looks down and walks off really quickly. The other day he was sat nearby with his friends and they were making quite a scene and kept looking over, so i just tried to ignore it and he would not look at me either but he was blushing ( he does seem to blush alot but im not sure whether this is just shyness - i have been told that he doesnt blush alot when im not around but i dont know...). As i said earliar when he sees me and my friends he completely avoids the situation and will walk really fast, but he's done something really strange twice now.   He saw me coming up the road and he began to walk really slow, so slow that i had to catch up with him ( even tho i tried my best not to without making it obv) and when i caught up with him he was stood realllyy close ( so close i could smell his aftershave lol) and kept looking over- i just gave him this half hearted smile but he looked away quickly when i did it. He then continued to walk ded slow in front of me so i would have to walk past him. The second time it was the other way around ( i was walking really fast, but he still managed to catch me up). I do want to have a conversation with him but i feel a bit clingy if its me making the conversation start, and when i think i will , i just completeley bottle it. When i look at him he looks away, even though he was clearly staring at me first, so i just feel stuck. Im confused whether he is being shy because he may like me back, or he's shy because he knows i like him and he's just embarassed or just being a typical shy guy :(

20090131111701AA9mYQN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are some nice things a guy can do for a girl?	I'm seeing this wonderful girl in college. We've only been together for a week, but I love her very much; however due to our schedules and her shyness we haven't exactly been out on dates and stuff, though we spend a lot of time in the studios together. I'd like some ideas on what I can do for her to let her know she means a lot to me.      So far, my repertoire includes:   - Holding her hand under the pretense of 'helping her relax her fingers' when she is practising.   - Helping her with homework. (Not, of course, doing it for her.)   - Letting her share my locker so she doesn't have to fork out for her own.   - Buying small packets of snacks and tidbits and dropping them in her bag. (She is prone to low blood sugar and gastric attacks.)      What else do you think would make her smile?

20090131120806AAj4ZFA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think she's going to forgive me?	Basically we used to be workfriends and we've known each other for 3 months. Before she used to stare at me, broke the ice by chatting to me, asks me questions and asked for my number and email address. When she approached me the first time i wasn't that friendly and she was kinda disappointed. I did apologize to her saying ''I'm sorry i haven't chatted to you in a while'', and that was when she asked for my number and email address. First time i called her she was kinda shy but the more we chatted on the phone she opened up.      She called me on a Sunday and asked me ''What do you think of me?'' I said ''you're chatty''. Then she said ''We can keep each other company'' and next week she said ''We should go out sometime?''. I kinda of messed up cause i was asking her ''When you do want to link up?'' about 3 times and she kept saying ''We are friends nothing more that's if you're curious lol''. 1 month later i said ''What do you think about the friendship?'' and she wanted to speak about something else but i didn't and i ended up upsetting her. Now she is still angry with me because she hasn't chatted to me, call me, she can't even look at me sometimes and now she's deleted me on msn. I added her facebook it took her 1 month to make a decision and the second time she rejected the friends request.      When i'm on holiday she does ask for me, gave me a sad look once, my supervisor said ''when they chat she's always giving me glances'' and she likes me cause she has asked for my number and email address.      Do you think she will forgive me?   What should i say to her?   Have i got a good chance of sort things out with her?   Do you think she misses me when i'm not at work?      Help me out plz!
20090131112855AACb7lh	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How does Poetic Justice wedding theme sound?	I'm a poet and my fiance is a mix-tape rapper. So I thought of Poetic Justice the movie since he reminds me of Tupac, he's the hip-hop and I'm the poetry. I plan on sending out invites that look like pages from a journal. The notes will have a "handwritten" note. My wedding colors are lavender and red, so I wanted the card stock to be lavender with red ink. I'm reading a poem during our ceremony.  Continuing the theme, my guest book will look like a writing journal and the reception music will have lots of early 90s R&B, with a dash of hip-hop. So what do you think? Is my idea too street?       Note: There is a difference b/w rap and hip-hop, a very noticeable difference. I do not like gansta rap and will not play music with inappropriate lyrics or language during my ceremony. Instead the ceremony is about embracing the message of hip-hop.

I know it is proper that you should hand address each envelope for a wedding invitation, but my handwriting is terrible!  I don't want to spoil the beautiful invitations I got by having ugly writing on them.     Would it be better to follow etiquette and hand write them, or print them off of the printer and go for the aesthetics?

My step sister is 23 and I am 15 and was wondering if it is normal to feel attracted to my step sister at my age? She wears really provocative clothing and I can't help but look and stare at her.

20090131121545AAQ3lSf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Jilted Couple's Revenge?	My wife and I are going to visit a couple where the woman once wanted me and was rejected and the man once wanted my wife and was rejected.  Call me cynical, but I feel uncomfortable around them sometimes, certain that they'll want to establish some sort of parity by taking little digs or imagining themselves as somehow superior to us, while our guilt-ridden duty is to acquiesce to be "nice".      My wife disagrees.  She thinks that they don't think anything of the past.  Am I being too jaded?  Is she being naive?  Mabye I'm prideful, but I don't think I'd want to spend a lot of time around a woman who made it clear I didn't make the grade, especially when the man who upstaged me is now her husband.  Can anyone understand why this situation would make me uncomfortable?

20090131115425AAHBZL1	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do or what would you do?	A sister-in-law has a sick kid and one healthy kid. When we found out she had to go to another state for the treatments I offered to quit my job and move to help her out.Her husband has to stay here to work. I'm really close to her and wanted to help ease the burden. She appropriated my offer and said she could use me and set the day she needed me to come down. I handed in my letter at work and packed things up. A week before I was suppose to come down I was told by her I was needed anymore her mom was staying and they didn't need me. It hurt me a lot and I have been taught to tell the truth even if it hurts. Now I being told I can't tell her that she hurt me because it will add unneeded stress and cause a problem. I don't want to cause a problem and I want to still be close with her but I don't think its right for her not to know that she hurt me.

20090131124726AAr1qRs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Immature girlfriend, but I love her.  What can I do?	My girlfriend and I are in our early 30's. We communicate well, share similar social/political views, and are the best of friends. But when it comes to some of the fundamental basics of an adult lifestyle I feel like she becomes an emotional/intellectual child.   She doesn't meet me halfway when it comes to basic chores and household responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, tidying, leaving lights on, etc.    She is a survivor, sweet kind woman, physically attractive, and totally unobtrusive. Very easy to like. But she's indirect, conniving, and incredibly needy. Needy in the sense that more often than not I have to do all the interpersonal work, carrying the conversation, problem solving, and so on.   Worst off when it comes to sex, she has this elaborate fairy tale ideal that it's always some prize to be begrudgingly given at the end of a crusade. I'm a spontaneous, creative, expressive articulate lover. Her misconceptions about sex do nothing but frustrate and infuriate me. Once again, she doesn't meet me half way by engaging in a mutually beneficial and enjoyable adult experience.   We both entered into this relationship with lots of problems. I'm a deeply flawed person and her love and friendship means a lot to me. What can I do?

20090131112614AAGURqV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Getting mixed signals from a guy - does he like me or not?	There's a guy I really like at school, but he's in the year below so I only ever see him around school at lunch or breaks. (We're 16 and 15). He's came up to me before about 5 times to talk to me, and he asked me to help him with some work once. He's also playfully taken my work and held it up so I had to jump and get it. He asks me how I am, etc too. Whenever I'm walking about 5 metres or so behind him on my way to a lesson he'll look behind, but I'm not sure whether he just does that a lot anyway. Reasons why I think he may not like me include him not having spoken to me for a month. But we don't have any classes together and whenever I see him it's usually from far away when I'm with friends. Is he just being friendly when he sees me or does he like me?

Why do short people have trouble making friends and meeting people compared to their tall counterparts? Why do girls tend to not introduce themselves to short guys they haven't meant, or are not receptive to short guys who simply try to meet new people, but warm up to new but taller guys? Why are groups of guys less likely to take short guys into their clique, but are more open to tall guys?

This is complicated and hard to explain but I'll try my best. I used ot be shy and I never used to talk much, but about a year ago I woke up one day and decided to change. I am now a much more confident person and I can talk to anyone. HOWEVER my problem now is fitting in. I have been trying to get people to notice and show an interest me. My plans to go into town and meet up with people usually evolve around my two best friends (I've known them since I was in a nappy). However today for the first time ever I organized to meet up with people that I have met up with before but without my two best friends. It didn't go well because I didn't fit in. There were about 5 people there and they talked alot and I didn't feel that I could chip in because I was afraid of not saying the right thing at the right time. So basically I didn't talk much I just followed along. It's not as though I don't know them, I've been in town with them before and I'm not scared to talk to them. I have this problem all the time, even at school. I am really really confused! what can I do?

I am trying to stop this girl from falling for him instead of me, any advice. We both sleep together (not sex) but lie down on a bed with her in the middle and me on one side and the other guy on the other. The girl seems to have an intrest in me more so than the other guy, and would be around me litteraly all the time if she she didnt have other friends.

My dad lost his job recently so neither of my parents have jobs as of now. I was talking to my mom today and how I wanted to go see the Uninvited with my friend Natasha. I told her how Natasha probably couldn't go see the movie soon because her mom doesn't have a job either and money is really tight at their house. Well I was thinking about how bad it would be if I were Natasha because our family has 2 cars (she has 1) , 9 people in our family (she has 4), and we couldn't pay for our house either. (she recently moved into a much smaller home.)    Do you think I should be concerned with the money getting really tigt at our house too?

20090131113111AAGXvbZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	What were some fun and crazy things you did as a teenager?	I was just wondering what other people have done while they were teenagers with some friends or something that was just so much fun. You know how teenagers are, and how they have there fun. Me and my friends used to play ding dong ditch. It was kinda scary but fun. lol. Then there was a house that was empty next to my best friends house. We would climb up the balcony and get in the house. (the doors were unlocked) We would walk around inside and turn the lights on until the owner who happened to live across the street would call the cops on us. Other times we would have parties and would play man hunt in the woods behind our houses. We're all older and we definetly don't do illegal stuff anymore. But they are some good memories. Lol, always good to laugh at. So what are some things you and your friends did as teenagers?

20090131115511AAeo0fN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think I have a reason to be pissed?	There is this guy that I have been sleeping with. When we met I told him that all I wanted was fun and wasn't ready for a relationship (I had just gotten out of a long term relationship) that I wasn't really for anything like that yet and that I didn't care if he slept with other people b/c I was likely to. We started seeing each other more and more. He ended up telling me that he really likes me, that he loves the way I listen to him and that I like him for him. And that he really wants to be with me. He also told me that I was the only women that he had been with in a year and the only girl he had been with since we started "sleeping" together. Then today I find out that he lied to me and he was "sleeping" with another girl and had lied to both of us about it.   Now I'm not pissed that he "slept" with her what I'm pissed about is that he lied to me? It just make me wonder if he lied when he told me about liking me. Do you think I have a good reason to be pissed? Do you think I should just say **** him and stay away from him or should I talk to him to see why he lied and give him another chance?

20090131124745AAusO01	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Military Man deployed send divorce paper in the mail?	I'm deployed and my wife and I haven't gotten along for a long time. She doesn't email, send packages or write. I've gotten use to this because this is my 5th time over here and she has never send anything.   I don't think shes cheating (really don't care if she is).    I don't think I love her anymore and the last two times I've talked to her I haven't told her.       It sounds like I'm just upset because she's not sending me anything but there's a lot more going on. Cheating (her), Does not respect what I do (she thinks I can say I don't want to deploy and I don't have to)NO SEX, doesn't cook and for the past 4 years I wash my own clothes.I pay ALL the bills even though she works. I've ask her over and over "what do you do for me as a wife?" Her responce "I take care of your kids." I don't think that's wifely duties. I think that's motherly duties.     She treats me like SH** when we are alone but when shes with her friends or family she hangs all on me and tells everyone how wonderful I am.      Would I be wrong if I sent divorce papers to her while I'm over here?

20090131113129AAHCiMJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about my ex? =\?	A few weeks ago my ex dumped me, I was completely in love but it was an on again off again relationship so when he dumped me I asked if this was the last time and it would be off for good and he said yes. I was devasted for a couple of days but then thought about it and how I wouldnt go back with him because it wasnt worth the pain of the off again breakups. About a week later I began seeing someone else and am head over heels for him. The day we became formally together I imed my ex just to see how he was, we made it clear that we still cared for eachother and wanted to be friends. Randomly out of nowhere he freaked out that I was seeing another guy, and I said 'you broke up with me, cant I see other people now?" and he basically said that he still liked me and couldnt talk/bare to see me with another guy. I feel terrible and I do still care about him in a brother sorta way, I dont know what to about it, i wish we could be friends but he wont even give me the time of day now, we dated for a long time and I cant see not having him in my life. What should I do about it? =\

20090131112600AAEtpiB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my crush a player?	I've been cheated on before even though I'm only a sophomore in hs. I refused to let myself go through that again and promised myself I'd be careful so I wouldn't get hurt. But it has happened again. I've been talking to this junior guy since december. He told me he liked me a lot and we talked every day. He always texted me when he said he would, he came to watch me at all my home high school swim meets, and constantly called me beautiful and amazing. He said I was different then the other girls and recently said he was crazy about me. Sure he had a reputation as a player, but I gave him a chance because he promised me he had changed and even our mutual friend assured me he changed. But last night at a school-sponsored event< he ignored me for the first two hours. He saw I was there, looked at me, and walked away. He made a point of talking to every other girl except me. So when he came to give me a hug later in the evening I told him I didn't want to talk to him and walked away. He then texted me and asked what he did wrong. I told him he made a point of ignoring me. He said he didn't mean to and didn't want to be clingy. I said there's a difference between being clingy and not even bothering to say hello. I said I felt like an idiot for wanting to hang out with him and he said he tried. Then I said you can tell yourself you did but you didn't because I wouldn't feel this way if you had. I never got a reply text. Maybe he fell asleep (it was late) but today I have not heard from him. All my friends say he played me and planned this. I'm trying to protect myself from getting hurt again, but this hurts. I'm conflicted over if he really is a player or if he just made a mistake last night (but I think ignoring someone you "like" is unacceptable). Words and actions should correspond. But last night they didn't. I called him a jerk. I figured if he really does like me then he'll try to fix this and if he's a player then he won't. What if he doesn't? Or what if he thinks I hate him and won't try while he still secretly likes me. I don't know. I have no idea what to do and if what he has been doing means he's a player. Please offer some help. Tell me how I should react when I see him in school also. What if we never talk again? He always did say he couldn't wait to get to know me and that he was looking forward to spending the summer with me. I also told him I wasn't going to have sex with him and he said he doesn't care and he just liked me for me.

I have always worked hard but nothing I do is ever enough.  I get A's and B's on my report cards and an occassional C.  When I make a mistake I fix it and make sure that it doesn't happen again.  My mom always thinks that I am struggling in school.  She forces her help on me when I don't need it.  At the end of every marking period she yells at me and hits me.  I try to control my anger but sometimes I just lose it.  I wish that she would just let me be myself.  I am always miserable because of her.  At school I have to put on a smile.  I am only allowed to have fun a few days of the year.  Even when I comes to just watching a movie or a tv show.  My mom forces me to study even If I have nothing to study for.  I just want to be free.  Even a taste of being independent would be nice.  Somebody....please.

I love my boyfriend of 18months so much but feel like im not allowed to. I have a 7 year old and my bf has met him and is part of his life but my bf has 3 previous children that I havnt met as he doesnt want to upset his ex while the house they lived in is on the market. Therefore I havn't met any of his family yet his pretty much part of mine. The house wont sell due to the recession and he works around the clock due to the recession. I miss him, i want to be part of his family and I want more commitment. he says it will get better but to be patient but I have already waited 18months and I have got to the point where I feel rejected by him because Im a secret from his family. Am i being silly should I just wait as his reasons are genuine and he tells me he loves me all the time and that he cant wait till things get better so that we can be together properly.

When I am around,people do laugh a lot..but most times its a joke built upon me..
20090131115331AAY2we3	Family & Relationships;Family	My brother lost custody of his children because he's in the Marines?	A judge awarded full custody to my brother's disgusting ex-wife.  He told my brother that he was a neglectful father who abandoned his children to go to Iraq and he cares more about the military than being there for his children.  His ex also lied and said that my brother's new wife abused their children and the judge believed her without any evidence or questioning.  My brother was injured while in Iraq and can't sleep much do to nightmares he has because of his experiences over there with the Marines.  Now he gets told there is a punishment for serving his country and fighting for his children.  His ex cheated on him while he was deployed, did not take care of the children and the house, and spent his money on herself and her then boyfriend now her husband, who is also a Marine.  She is moving the children in with her and her husband who she is pregnant by too.  Her husband is mean to my nephews so my family contacted his unit and reported him.  We also contacted CPS on both of them due to situations such as the children being left in soiled diapers all day, problems with lice and severe skin aliments, and disgusting living conditions.  I wanted to know what can I do to help my brother.  Is there anyone he can talk or write to that can give him assistance?

Okay so me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 8 months and all we do is fight i just turned 16 and hes going to be 18 and we fight everyday. its always over something stupid though like sometimes i get mad that he is going to hangout with his friend because ever since we have been dating i kinda ditched my friends and we dont hangout as much cause im always with him but i get mad because if i ask him to hangout he always says i dont know i have to find out what im doing but if his friend asks him to hangout he says yeah with no hesitation it really gets on my nerves and i dont know why, but asked him why he does that and he said that his friend is easier to make plans with because he does fun stuff like play football and video games. but other than that we just fight over something stupid and its everyday, and i dont know why. and lately its been phyiscal for me and him both he hits me and i hit him but i think its more me cause when he says something stupid i always hit him. but he complains for things i do and say but he does them to i just dont want to loose him because he is my first real "love" and he was my first so i have a connection with him and i dont want to loose that what should i do?

I have one year old son, and at present dna tests are taking place because the father disputes paternity...typical of him this is his 5th child he has never paid for or bothered with..just a way of him trying to get out of letting go of his cash.

20090131120945AALsULm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel really embarrassed. He made out with me when i least expected it.?	Me and my boyfriend have been going out for a week now. He's 16 and I'm 15. We hung out last night. We usually just kiss. He made out with me last night though. I really did not expect it and i basically freaked out. It was my first time actually making out with a guy. It wasn't such a great experience, i mean freaking out in the middle of making out and like not knowing what to do anymore. :S We kind of talked about it later. I told him he really caught me off guard, which is pretty much why it didn't go so well. I'll probably see him soon again, but i'm not sure how i'll react. He told me he didn't want to make out if i didn't want to. But i actually do. I just dont want to freak out again. What should i do next time, or what should i tell him?
20090131121056AAwopCx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i make him care?...10 points?	Me and my boyfriend, have been going out for 6months. Its complicated because its long distance. a few states away. And lately we've been having arguments over silly things, and he never seems to care about if im hurt or not. i've been cutitng myself for a while, way b4 i even met him. and i told him this hoping he would try to help, i told him, being w/ him makes me do it not so often, he tells me he loves me and cares for me, and always tells me he would never break up w/ me. and he could see us having a family and stuff, but why would he say this if he continues to get pissed off about everything i say, and freaks out....what usualy happens is, we will get in a argument, and i will be practically begging him to stop and telling him hes hurting me, and he will continue to insult me, and make me feel worse. Then he will just leave and say sumthing like "dont even think about contacting me", then about an hour later he'll call or text or get online..since we can do anything in person..i just wanna know how to prevent him getting mad in the first place!! im seriously lost. i dont understand his emotions
20090131121149AAbLFw9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have been confused for seven months with my wife, and i know that I am at fault?	Hi, last year I came home drunk and high, and i hit my wife because she was already mad at me. I was arrested on that night. i spent one day in jail. After i got out of jail I decided to get some help for me and to save my marriage. Ever sinse I have been helping my wife the bills and working on my recovery and spending alot of time in church classes. I have been clean for seven months. My wife took out a restraining order for one year. she is also in co-dependency classes. For the first four months of the restraining order, my wife allowed me to spend time with her and my stepkids. I would come over and pick up my stepson every weekend and go over there every evening after work. Every week I would give my wife $400.00 for the bills and all I had left is gas money and food money. this went on for four months, I lost my job last october and thats when everything changed. My wife became more bitter. She stopped talking to me, she went to the church and told them that she had a restraining order out on me and I should not be there. the restraing order states that we can talk about financial obligations, and yes i would talk about the bills in the e-mails but i would also ask my wife about our marriage. I still help my wife, I am paying for two trucks that I drive that are in her name, the insurance for her car and the two trucks and the cell phone bill that we have and if I have extra I would give her money for misc. items. i also, pay for credit card bills. she is constantly blaming me for ruining her credit, and maxing out credit cards. She has just recently filed an affidavit saying that I violated the restraining order by not just discussing bills in the e-mails. my wife is'nt telling anything about a divorce. why did'nt she file for a divorce while she was down to the court house as many of times that she was? I am really getting my life together and she claims in the affidavit that she is scared of me and she don'nt want to see me, and that I am takinf advantage of her because she also has been out work for 8 months. I work a part-time job from 2:00A.m. In the morning until 8:30a.m and i am doing all I can to help my wife with what I got. I can;nt even give my parents rent where I am living. i am not complaining about helping my wife. i just want answers to this situation. Why don'nt she file for a divorce if she is so scared of me, I am no danger to her. i love my wife and I have accepted full responsibility for my actions. i have seven months clean and doing better every day. Should I continue to hold to my marriage? or is it over even she is'nt telling anything? Please help me.

20090131130144AAMTFd7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex Husband Claiming child without permission on taxes?	Ok, my ex husband has been claiming one of our children on his taxes for the past 4 years. In my decree and separation agreement, it says nothing about taxes. I have never given him permission and he mails the tax forms in. He has no proof that the kids lived with him because they were with me the entire time. The irs has never contacted me about this and I am guessing have never contacted him because he keeps doing it. This year he e-filed and now I can't because he did it again! So, do I mail it in, go to the IRS about it? There is a statement in the parenting plan about him claiming a child but no one ever signed it. The decree only says that the parenting plan is in the best interest of the child. that's it. So what do I do about my taxes this year?

20090131142409AA4VGte	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Men or Women: Advice on purchasing the engagement ring please?	Greetings:      I'm looking to finally make "the purchase". My dilemma is, I'm about as comfortable in a jewelry store as a bull would be on ice. Are the sales people gonna see me as some sort of "easy commission" should I come in not knowing anything? Do engagement rings have their own section within the jewelry store? My only request is to not suggest bringing my g/f because I need the surprise factor (we're traditional). If the ring really stinks we're cool like that and she can trade it back for something she likes better after the proposal. Thanks!

We are not engaged, but marriage is in our future.        I just want to hear from people who were in a similar situation before marriage and how is your marriage working out this far?

20090131133001AAO7rEz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just a good friend or potential lover?	i met this girl and she and i have been talking from novemberish... to now.   in the beginning she told me some personal things and told me i was different from other guys because i was mature and "sweet".   i asked her to go hang out with me and she said that was fine but she was busy with her sport, another time tho we could. i waited about a month, she said she couldn't because she was going out of town on vacation. things seemed to settle down around late decemberish and she  became more outgoing, more sociable. (shes very shy) and recently about 2 weeks ago i asked her to hang out again more formal and direct. she said no it was nothing against me it was really her and she wasn't feeling herself. moments later she came back apologizing saying it sounded really rude and misleading, as if she didn't like me. she said she will defiantly let me know when we can hang out. since then i noticed:      1)she wants to be my partner in class   2) when she sees me walking she waits for me to catch up to her so we can walk together   3) she is more outgoing, laughs at what i say and we have an inside joke that she included me in on.   4) when were sitting next to each other she brushes her desk and her hand usually crosses over and seems to touch mine.   5) she taps my hand when she wants my attention.   6) she has told plenty of people she doesn't like to be touched but recently she has allowed me to hug and touch her.

20060613191629AAxanAl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHY might your boyfriend of 2 WEEKS say he is intimidated by you?	He told me that its different with me and I am everything he is looking for.We jumped into this relationship without being friends first. There is this incredible attraction physically and this great connection just talking to him. We hug and stuff all the time but we haven't kiss or hold hands yet and it's been almost two weeks! He said he used to very aggressive all the other girls but for some strange reason he can't be like that with me. He said he wanted ever moment we share to be special.  (see my other question about chemistry to get a better idea).  What do you think? What should I do?I really like him but I don't want to get used. He know I want to be a virgin until marriage and is very respectful. Is he just BSing?Should I believe him?Help!

20060723001038AAsxzFI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need advice?	A really old friend of mine has a crush on me. I haven't seen him in a long time but he came over tonight and after a long, nice, but awkward night, he tried to kiss me and I didn't let him. I feel bad for hurting his feelings. I still want to be his friend but he will always like me as more and I don't want to lead him on. I don't have a lot of friends. Do I continue being his friend, and he might continue trying (I have a boyfriend who currently lives out of state, plus I would never consider dating this friend), or do I stop hanging around him?

20060719132154AA472F6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can people vilify you just to avoid acceping that you have been ice to them?	I know a person who never expresses gratitude. She has no other faults but never expresses gratitude. Even when she gets a gift, she says 'thanks' in a tone that suggests that the all the person who was giving the gift really wanted to do was to hear a 'thank you' so 'here is your thank you, now get on with it!' She never uses gifts given to her -many times does not oven open them.   Even when a really big favor is done to her that would chance her whole life for better, she actually finds fault and ulterior motive and goes to the extent of vilifying the perosn so she does not have to accept that she has been done a favor.   Has anyone else met people who would rather make everyone else feel small and guilty than accept that they have been done favors?   I am just trying to understand this person's personality -is there a trait like that in some otherwise pleasant persons?

20090131133736AA8nWjf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls-would you be mad if a guy did this?	There's a girl at school and we've known each other for a while and we also have a running joke that we're going to "get married" near the end of this year. Yesterday she asked me, "Are you going to the prom this year?" (we are both seniors). I told her, "Only if I can find someone to go with", which is the truth-I haven't been to a dance in almost half a decade because I've never had anybody to go with and I'd feel awkward going to a dance alone. She then said, "Well you could go with me", which kinda caught me off guard because she has a boyfriend (albeit he's in college, but our school lets college students come to dances as guests so it's possible that he could go to prom with her).  At the time, I figured she was joking and changed the topic of discussion.  However, after thinking about it (and from answers on YA) I think she might have actually been serious about us going together.  If a guy did this to you and it took him ~3 or so days to figure it out and apologize for thinking you were joking would you be mad at him?

He buys me dinner, opens doors for me, tells me that he wants to get married to me as soon as possible and have kids together, he and I each have two kids from our ex's, tells me about his deepest thoughts, we have talked about opening our own bakery together, etc, but then sometimes his behavior is off like not calling me when he says he will. He works very hard at his job 72+ a week, so that does play a factor, we haven't had sex yet. Does he honestly like me or is his just passing the time with me?

I have this friend and he's really cool sometimes...i used to consider who i would and would not go out with and i never thought i would like im so i just said it was a definite no....i know that he kinda likes me cause he always tries to impress me with his charm, but it's not really charming it's really cheesy, but it's so cute that he tries. he has a good personality too.   he's on the wrestling team and i love wrestling.  i hadn't been to one of the meets yet though.   then a couple days ago a friend said that the opposing team was really hot and then she brought up howsurprisedd she was when HE came out of the locker room with out the top of his uniform on and how he was amazingly buff and he had nice abs....this was a shock to me too!!  it was also a shock to hear her say it because sheAbsolutelyy hates him and it would take a lot  for her to say that....ever since then it re-opened my eyes to him and now i realize he's kinda got the whole package....is that shallow?   i still love his personality though and i have yet to see his nice abs that everyone is talking about...i should feel flattered by him liking me because i'm not like, strikingly beautiful or anything.  hmmm...i need help on what to do....Help!!

So recently me and my boyfriend broke up, I found out he dated me for a bet, but once i talked to him about it, he said it wasnt just because of the bet he also kinda liked me too, and how he felt like a jerk etcetc. We talked on the phone right after we broke up, and he asked if we were still friends, and i said yes. He's really sweet, and he told me not to bother crying over him, because he wasnt worth it. So after an hour of talking on the phone with him i let him go, & i thought about it.. Would he ever want to be more than friends again?    This is really confusing, but i didnt want to explain EVERYTHING to you guys, so yeah, hope you can help(:

20081015070433AA7KFtt	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding Advice - What to give my fiance on wedding day?	I have a question for all of you.  My fiance, ever since we have met, has always wanted a little puppy.  I used to joke around that we do not need one and the only way I would agree to one is if we got a pet snake (She hates snakes so I knew it would always be a no).      We are getting married next July and one of the ideas that I had was to buy a puppy before the wedding and then to get on the mic at the reception and to arrange for someone to bring it in while I have her attention.  I have run this by a few friends who love it but would like to get a wide variety of opinions.  I cannot ask any of her friends because they would be bound to tell her.      Your thoughts???  Oh, and her Mom would babysit the dog while we are on our honeymoon the week after.      I will award a best answer as well so you will get some points for your advice :) !  Thank you all VERY much!!!
20090131145342AAgzUBb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce, I'm my own attorney, Ex lied about residence of sex offender at daycare providers home. How to prove?	Daycare provider is her mother and the sex offender is her brother-in-law. He's registered there, but also registered in California. She says he actually lives in California, but I've had many indications that he lives there and doesn't just visit on rare occasions like she says. How do I prove that she lied about his residence? Is there a particular government organization I should subpoena like workers comp to prove employment? Driver's license division? I'd prefer not to go subpoena happy as a form of investigation though. Is there something I should request from the Judge?

20090131135135AALE9pG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I over look my boyfriend sloppy habits?	I recently moved in with him. I always pick up after him, he drinks soda's  , leaves his dirty plates everywhere, comes home and throws his clothes all over the living room. He won't even bother to fold something or put it away so I have been doing it for my own peace of mind because I like a clean house and living space or else I can't think straight. He also ALWAYS eats what's on my plate. Like this morning he ate two pizzas and didn't offer me any or ask if I would like something for breakfast. I ALWAYS ask him if I can make him some breakfast or get him a drink while I'm in the kitchen or fixing lunch and he takes his pizza and eats right in front of me, doesn't even offer me a bite. And he knows I was upset over it, I make myself some breakfast, some eggs/hash browns and sausage and he comes around and eats half of my plate like what the hell, I'm hungry and he just had 2 damn pizzas! I'm trying to over look it because I love him and care about him a lot and overall he is a good boyfriend and person. But now I've notice I get angry over it and annoyed, irritated because he leaves a trail of clutter and mess EVERYWHERE he goes, we have been together a year. What can I do to help my situation?

20090131142849AAgf6YU	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad is a total nuisance and somewhat of a jerk, what do i do? This is long but PLEASE,PLEASE read it!?	Ok, brace yourself this is long but please read it! So my parents got divorced when I was like 6, im 14 now, it didnt have much effect on me at all. I was too little to understand. And im perfectly fine with them being seperated, but my dad drives a semi truck so I only see him like 3 or 4  times a month. Me and my mom live in a house by ourselves and thats fine. We argue sometimes but i thinks its pretty normal for a teen and a parent argue. So my mom is tolerable and I love her but My dad is a total ***hole at times. Whenever he comes to visit he will stay a few days then he will have to go back in the semi truck. Whenever he is here(at our house) he does all these "chores". He's just trying to help but all he ever does is screw things up even worse than they were. Its extremely aggrivating. He acts like he lives with us. He's pretty much just a mooch. I can tell he just wants to get laid by my mom (eww) and that makes me feel somewhat mad and uncomfortable. And whenever me and him go on "vacation" (my mom thinks we should spend time together) or just anytime when my mom isnt around all he ever does is talk about how great his life would be if I didnt exist or if i wasnt born. This is just the tip of the iceberg, what do i do? Whenever I confront him about this stuff he gets mad and somewhat violent. My mom wont confront him about it AT ALL, im the only person who ever holds my ground against him. What do I do?

We went to see a film and wondered around a shopping mall untill she went home, but when we were waiting for her parents to pick her up, we went to the multi story car park to go to where we would meet them, at the staircase she called her mum and as soon as she hung up she just randomly kissed me, not a friend kiss, this lasted at least 20 seconds. She is in a commited relationship with her boyfriend and has been dating him for over 1 year, we both love each other, but as far as i know only as friends.   Does she like me in any other way? as far as im concerened she's my best friend even though i hardly ever see her, and before then she was just acting normal. we then walked off to find her parents and she said "this didnt happen, ok?". i was thinking, yeh great, my first kiss, but i feel like that shouldnt have happened and i sort of know her boyfriend and he's a really nice guy. What should i do and does she have any other feelings for me?"      but now i just want to add some very extra detail   this is the convo over msn (no names)   Me: so if you dont mind me asking... what was with the kiss   Me: as much as i enjoyed it lol   Her: meh   Her: said i would (jokingly the day before)   Me: however i didnt think you were being serious   Her: oh lol   Her: i dont lie   Me: lol   Her: dw it won't happen again         thats the start of it, then later on i asked the question:   Me: might sound like a weird question, but did you enjoy it?   Her: err   Me: no lol   Her: not really xD was dirrerent         yes, i know it sounds insensitive, but she is the nicest person i no, and it was a first kiss, so its gonna be crap. But what do you think? do you still think she likes me? i would really appriciate some help on this. oh and also since i asked that she has stopped talking to me a bit, still talking, but i have to start any topic. for example "how are you?" "im fine, you?" "yeh, im fine" "lol"   normally she's really really chatty and just says random things out of the blue, a famous one is "lala" or "rawr", has this changed our friendship too?

20080707115630AARMadN	Family & Relationships;Family	Good idea or not?	me and my bf are struggling to live on our own, we are paying all the bills on time but just bairly have any extra money after paying bills.  Our bills total are about 800 to 900 per month, we have been asked to move-in with his grandmother and help her out around the house and with yard work and the bills for us will be about 600 per month. It seems good as far as the money goes and it would be great to have someone around while my bf is out of town, I hate being alone while he is gone.  I am just wondering if this will affect mine and his relationship, we hardly ever argue or disagree, I know that no one knows if it will affect our relationship but us....thats not what I am asking, I am asking that if anyone has ever done this or has know anyone that has lived with bf's family and it was a positive experience?  We are only planning on it for 6 months to a year, just till we can save some money up.  I dont want smart comments, just real honest opinions please!

20090131140236AAVbnUG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How and where should i tell him i like him?	i'm currently a sophmore in high school, i met a senior that i really like. we're pretty close- he'll do really nice things for me like leave cough drops&chocolates in my locker when i'm sick and cookies&coffee when i have a big test. the second week i met him, he drove half an hour to the animal sanctuary where i volunteer to bring me a homemade birthday cake&christmas present. we're both on varsity tennis and we always play with eachother during the weekends. i feel pretty strongly about him, but it's not an "i truly love him" situation-its too early for that. and i'm also not looking to be in a relatinoship for it can become too demanding. basically, i'm trying to keep it the way we are now, but i really want to tell him how i feel.   so my question is: where and how should i tell him? where as in should i do it in a special place? i was thinking about doing it in private because i'm a bit too embarassed to do it in public. and how should i tell him...i want it to be really original. thanks!

In my class there is this sweet nerdy guy and he is always talking to me. Well the other day he nervously asked me if I would want to get coffee with him sometime. Well I hate shooting anyone down, it always makes me feel bad plus his friends were standing a few feet away watching and I didn't want to embarrass him so I told him sure we could some afternoon. Well he got my number and called me that very day. And the next day. I didn't answer because I wasn't sure what to say. I have a boyfriend and am not interested in this guy whatsoever except that he's nice and I don't want to hurt his feelings considering he's in class with me AND lives one floor above me in my apartment. Should I just be friendly and go have coffee with him one day or would that be giving him hope for something more? Or if not, how could I tell him it isn't such a good idea without hurting his feelings? I know I got myself in this situation but I hated shooting him down since he seemed like he got his courage up

20090131143306AAtbE0Q	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How will i grow up... Will i ever trust anyone again do you think?	I read somewhere that kids who grow up in an abusive household are more likely to become victims or abusers themselves... From the age of 6 to 12 my mum was with this guy who turned out to a total psycho, he had a serious alcohol problem and was pretty abusive to my mum, he never hit me or anything but he manipulated my mum and turned her against me - he made out that everything was my fault and that i was a selfish little ***** and that i was ruining my mum's, his and their daughter's ( my half-sister) lives. I grew up feeling lonely and unwanted as sometimes my mum would even run away and leave me with him and my sister. After six years and numerous nights going without sleep due to his drink problems my mum finally told him to leave. However i don't think i'll ever be able to get over it. I find it hard to trust anyone, i hate my sister because i know that if she was never born then he would have left  earlier and i wouldn't have had to be put through it. I still have nightmares about him coming back to get me. I don't like myself and as i get older i'm so scared that i'm turning into the 'selfish *****' he said i was. i'm also petrified about who i'll i grow into as i can't seem to get over it... anyone got any tips about how to let it go? please x x

20081024064940AAKGShb	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I be worried about my suicidal friend?	Hey all this may be a little long but please read      Usually I find I am good at giving advice but when it comes to my own problems I get stuck.      Last year I made a friend who had a ruddy tough year she got in with the 'wrong crowd' almost got kicked out of our college, self harmed majorly and attempted suicide.      This year now she is with less influential people and she just seems to have gotten much happier.      Anyway lately something seems to be bugging her, she seems short tempered, constantly has this dark look on her face and she has short-term memory loss, like, everything you tell her she forgets. Something as simple as "Can you get this for me" she goes upstairs, comes back in tears and has forgotten it.      I found out she hurt herself the other day she didn't tell me I found out because we were mucking around and I grabbed her arm and she flinched and I caught on.      I know she isn't attention seeking because she doesn't tell anyone she always tries to act happy and help people she keeps her depression to herself.      Anyway what REALLY worries me is lately she had a bit of flu and her mum was just commenting that a lot of pills were going missing... and I had this HORRIBLE paranoia that she might be "collecting" pills I also found a razor in her room the other day, (the type you shave with) but she had taken the blades out of it...      Not sure how to approach the subject with her       Not sure if the self harming was a one off...      And the pills could be cos she just really is sick and other people could also be taking them...      Should I tell the dorm staff when I get back to college or just leave it?

20090131132912AA3kbNj	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Making a low-sex relationship work?	I'm 21, gay, and have been with my current boyfriend--also 21--for 7 months.  Everything is great in our relationship except the sex:  I want it all the time, and he rarely does.  He says he used to have a higher sex drive a year or two ago, but it's been downhill ever since.      We're both young and attractive, and we're pretty much best friends.  We've talked about it many times, and I'm at my wits' end.      I want to approach this from a *relationship* point of view rather than a *health* point of view--I've tried asking him to eat better, take weird herbal supplements, exercise, etc., and he rarely follows through with any of it.      I love my boy and want to make it work, but him not wanting sex is killing my naturally high self-esteem and causing far too much of a mental distraction for me to pay attention to all the good parts of our relationship (of which there are many).      To the point:  I would love to change his sex drive to match mine, but if I can't, how can I keep that from destroying our relationship?

I mean it’s just that I am attracted him. There is has been countless times where I have said that I would ignore him and move on. But it’s harder than I thought. I did manage to ignore him on few occasions, but soon he started doing his own thing and not talking to me. And I found my self bothered, and upset by it, surprisingly.We are slowly started talking agian, but there still a little tension between us. I think it is more than a crush, it is has gone longer than expected. I know that now, I just want to tell him how I feel, but I am scared. I can barely look him in the eye when we come into contact. It’s Valentine’s Day in 2 weeks, my heart really wants me to do something, but my conscious won’t let me do anything. Sometimes it is like I know that there is something between us, but other times he just acts like I am jus insignificant and just some it of fun.  I just don’t know, I don’t want to get hurt, I mean what if he treats every girl like how he treats me. I want to get this sorted b4 I go to university in September.

My boyfriend was a virgin the first time we had sex (I wasn't) and he was really nervous. It lasted about an hour and he didn't reach climax but I did. We had sex again a few days later for an hour and a half...still no climax for him. We do a lot of foreplay and build up the excitement over a few days but still I can't get him off no matter what I do to please him. Could it be his nerves still? Any advice?

20090131141225AAYTPpG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I dump him or not?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 months now.  Ever since October 17th.  He cheated on me twice with two girls over the internet and I found out in November when I got on his myspace and checked the messages.  Then he kissed my best friend right around that time because he says he couldn't keep in his feelings anymore.  But he admitted to both, and I think he is really sorry for it.  I know he loves me and it has been about two months since then.  SO do you think I should dump him or not?  We really love each other and I just don't know what to do because my friends tell me different things.  Some of them say I should dump him for a non-cheater, whereas others say that if he really loves me and he hasn't cheated in 2 months then he won't do it again.  Any help could result in best answer...

20090131144435AASgKWA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband will not communicate with me?	My husband and I have been married for 2 months.  When we first started dating he loved to go and explore new things.  Sometimes he would even initiate them.  Now he would rather sit at home and do nothing.  I ask him if he wants to go out and he always says no.  However, his guy friends are always wanting him to do things and he will usually go with them.  Throughout our relationship we have had limited communication.  When he gets upset about anything, he runs to his buddies house and will not return for hours.  I usually have to call and find out if he is coming home.  Even when he returns home, he still refuses to tell me what is going on.  I will ask him if something is upsetting him or if I did something to upset him, however his answer is always no.  I know that something is wrong though, because he will pull away from me, wont want to touch me or be around me, will not talk to me, and is usually very rude too me.  These actions make me very angry, because all I want to know is what the heck is going on.  What am I doing wrong and how can I get him to communicate with me?

20090408150934AA2wtcl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help sorting my feelings about him?	I broke of with my wonderful boyfriend of six months last week. He is a great guy. He is sweet, nice, loyal, loving, happy, and handsome. I feel bad because during our relationship I didn't treat him as well as he deserved, but he didn't even care, it bounced right off of him. A lot of times I would tell    him things about himself that I didn't like, and he always told me he would work on them. I often got irritated with him for minor reasons, and it persisted for a long time. He never criticized me, though. And the only time he ever got mad at me was when I said things that could threaten our relationship.      Despite all the things I told him I didn't like, even if he changed what bothered me, it would make me feel better but then I would just get frustrated again and focus on something else that bothered me. I don't know why. I don't know why I can't accept him how he is. He's a great person, but something keeps me from being satisfied with him. Even now, when I look back on our relationship, normally people would miss those good times, but I think of a moment and just go 'eh', while if I mentioned the moment to him, he would go on about how great that was.      I can't really explain why I don't like him. Is this what you consider a fated lack of love, or can I change the way I act toward him so our relationship could have another chance? The poor thing really misses being with me and I feel really bad for him. Am I able to love him like he deserves? He loves me so much and would do anything for me and I just want to return the love, but I don't feel it for him, and wish I did. Please help. =/
20090408151056AAXVU6F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need relationship help.?	Okay, so me and this girl have been dating for 1 year and 1 month. currently we are "taking a break" according to her. Her and I have gotten pretty serious. We are both 15. I know I am in love with her because I have dated a few other people throughout my life, I'm normaly a reserved person but around her I'm more open than I am with family. I can tell her absolutely everything. She told me she needs a break because I was her first everything... Her first kiss, her first love. She's in softball for the high school, and she keeps skipping practices and she gets rides "home" (i'm not sure if thats where she's really going.) with a guy named Brandon. 2 months ago, her and I got into a fight and she ended up hanging out with Brandon. She called me that night and she said she kissed him... this was on valentines day. our 11 month anniversary. It broke my heart... She promised me that we would get back together and we try our very hardest to not break promises. I know I still love her. But I'm afraid of Brandon takking her away from me. She thinks I'm controling because I like knowing where she is at all times, incase if she needs help. I can't help being concerned about the only person I'd ever die for. I love her with everything I have. I'd give anything up for her. I'm trying to not worry alot but it's natural... I can't help it... we've been taking a break for 2 weeks now. I cry myself to sleep every night and I pray to God for her to come back to me. Even though I'm athiest. I miss her so much.       The only thing I can tell people for trying to keep their special someone is:   Never go past making out until you are emotionaly stable and you're not a teenager.    SEXUAL ACTIVITIES RUINS RELATIONSHIPS WHEN YOU'RE NOT EMOTIONALY STABLE.      Please help me...

20080705075925AAJsHX1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I stay or should I go?	My husband and I have been married now for just over 2 years, and we have a son and I am currently pregnant with our second. On the outside our life together seems okey, but behind closed doors its a living nightmare. My husband physically and verbally abuses me... and while I do my share of name calling, his is way out of control. And honestly I have been scared for my life several times. I have tried to take pictures of the after affects of what he has done to me, but he deletes the pics. Why am I still with him you ask, well he says that I cant take my son if I leave, and since I am a stay at home mom, he wont just let me use his money to escape. I am at my wits end with him, and I know that we still love each other very much, I just dont know what to do anymore.

20081004150356AAGDwLF	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you meet new people?	Although I've made a few good friends at work I don't like to get too close to lots of people because it's too close to home.      And I do do classes for a hobby, but it's a case of people coming after work, doing the class and then going home. No one seems to hang out after and chat or go for a drink.      I've never been to school so I don't have old classmates to fall back on.      I'm not desperate for friends, because I've got a few lovely people round me, but I would like to widen my circle of close friends. How would you recommend doing this? 
20081007113534AA9KIF6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend of 2 months has pictures of his ex still on his facebook?	Should i say something about it? He goes on time to time because i send him video's and other things. I would think by now he would take the pictures off. I know his ex because we use to all work together. They don't talk anymore because of him getting with me right after they broke up.  I guess my question is does it mean anything if he still has a bunch of pictures of them together. I don't mind if he had them on his computer were only he could see them.  i just don't like the fact that he is with me but portraying on facebook that he is still with her it make me feel like i don't exist as his girlfriend. What do u think?

20081014211244AAJD7bI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i a stalker? Does he think i'm weird?	Well i already asked the question if he liked me and people said yes...      Yesterday he came up to me after school and was all, Hey i did like 42 situps in my last class. And then he asks to see my hand and he grabs it and puts it up to his stomach and was all, "Do you feel anything?" and i was all... umm hehe no? and then his friend whacked his stomach and he chased after him so i walked away.      Then he wasn't here today at school but i messaged him on myspace saying, Heyy whats up? :) Yes, i'm bored otherwise i wouldn't be messaging you.      But i was joking.       Anyways i message him a lot saying hey! and then sometimes he replies with just a mere NM.      So i continuously check my "sent" messages hoping he read them.      And when he does he never replies... ):      It kinda makes me sad because i really like him and SO many people say we would make a cute couple. (Like 10 people)      So... do you think i'm a stalker ish? and does he think im a total weirdo?

20081017082756AA1tu01	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice on someone I like please please?	Well ... this is a little hard to describe. But I'll have a go anyway.   There is this boy I met in school that I liked from the moment I saw him. He's not at all a "player" type and seems to be a really nice person (judging from the way he acts though I hardly know him) but I've liked him for a year and he is a very special soul ... well, the thing is he does have a gf and I have no plans on taking him away.    But I wanted to ask - do you consider looking at someone forcing him to stray? A lot of people think so, and yet I looked at him quite a lot   (just because I really like him). Is that wrong? Should I stop it completely and ignore him? I couldn't say if he likes me, he's looking at me often as well but is that just because I do and he finds it annoying or something else or is it because he thinks I'm interesting?      That's just for my own information. I like him, really, but I feel so bad for simply looking at him and thinking people would hate me because I'm doing something wrong.    So - boys - if someone looks at you a lot, do you think the person is odd or do you find it annoying? Why do you think he is looking back? And, well, generally, should I never only look again because he's dating someone?   I would never ruin a relationship but it's tough to stop yourself looking at someone you like. What's your opinions? x
20081020084114AA7qFsf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help i am trying to hold onto my marriage of 15 years and it's getting harder everyday... i love him so much?	My husband goes through this thing every couple of years where he wants to move out and get a divorce and he can never give me a good reason, just that things have to be my way and I don't let him do anything, honestly he has more freedom than any married couple we know, and I never tell him no about ANYTHING so i am very confused and do not want to lose him. Ordinarily he's a great husband, but he's putting me through hell right now and I am trying to hold on, he hasn't moved out yet but is talking about it and i am scared to lose him he's my everything. he is doing alot of things that aren't in his character like getting tatoos and staying out late, but says there is no one else (and after 15 years together I believe that) but that he wants out.

My little brother is a half brother, and he's 4. She's told me that I'm a "bad influence" and that I'm not allowed to see him anymore.      I skipped 8th grade, I'm a straight A student taking college level classes as a Sophomore. I never cuss, I've never so little as kissed a guy. The most rebellious thing about me is that I have a messy room and I'm unorganized. How am I a bad influence? I feel very hurt. I love my brother very much and I miss him.      (She just told me this over the phone, when I asked if I could take him trick-or-treating tomorrow since she doesn't want to. She wouldn't even let me talk to him.)

20060612160758AAknrWu	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do I have the right to pick and choose my boyfriend's friends?	Recently, a woman my bf has known for years, who wasn't much more than an acquaintance, moved in next door to him. Through a series of quirky events and simple geographical proximity, she and my boyfriend grew very close. When her marraige began to fall apart a few months ago, my bf was the person that she trusted enough to ask advice of and to confide in. They are now best friends, her marraige just ended and she is alone for the first time in years. She's a great lady - smart, nice, capable, a good mom - and I like her very much. The trouble is that my bf gets so many of his emotional and intimacy needs met through his intense friendship with her, that he and I are growing distant. I don't want to do the bitchy gf thing and tell him he can't have female friends, but I also don't believe a) that he can emotionally disconnect while remaining friends with her or b) that this friendship will remain platonic (though I have no solid evidence of this, just a gut feeling).

I know a lot of people told me to be myself and go talk, but it's easier to talk than to act.   i don't know the best approach to overcome this challenge. ladies plz tell me wut u think and if you have some advice plz lemme know.

I started out as his boss,which I am no longer.We began as very good friends.I found myself telling him things about my private life that I rarely tell anyone and vice versa.We have amazing chemistry.I intimidate him, since I am quite independent and strong.I guard my heart and he knows that.I realize I would not acknowledge my feelings for him although I felt for him as he did. He then met someone and was confused since at that same time, out of the blue we kissed.It was incredible but still I was cautious. Finally he got involved with his now girlfriend, and I with someone else. 7 months later I am done with that other guy I was seeing and although he remains with his girlfriend he still looks at me in "that way" and now throws hints on how he should of taken that risk and fought for me.There seems to be a chance for us,but am not sure what to do,he's still with his girlfriend, even if he claims to be unhappy.It's like he is waiting for me. Should I ignore this? I care for him deeply

If you could take back the first time and every time inbetween that you said the three words that society takes so much for granted would you?  Give me some reasons...      I would in a heartbeat...wouldn't it be quite the gift to give to the person you truly love beyond a doubt...and be like "baby...i've never ever told another person this..but I love you...I love you more then you will ever know!"        This is something for you kiddies to think about...before you drop those three little words prematurely...think about it...don't throw those words around...just think about all the brownie points you could score by saying what I wrote above...and truly meaning it.  So if its to late to save sex for that special someone...maybe you can still save this virginity?      *Sigh* where was yahoo answers when I was 12...

He's everything you could look for in a man and i don't know...since then i've noticed that all of his girlfriends started talking to him again and i get nervous and a bit anxoius. do you think there is any hope in this situation? i want to be with him but it seems like i can't GOSH this sucks.

What would you do if you had a child and a lovely partner who loves you to bits and you met the love of your life when least expected? would you leave your family for the one you have been in love and can't leave without going out of your mind every day, knowing that you will most likely destroy your partner that you had given your word in front of God "till death do us part", you had given your word to your partner besides and you've been trying to be decent but it hurts too much to cope? while your love has been sending you mail and suddenly disappeared after the last not so clear message with an equally not so clear answer. You start going insane not knowing if you are now unwanted or been left alone for your own sake, which you dont' want. You can't get an answer to your mail no matter what you'd say.

Why is it that only when  a guy is interested in a woman will she start to develop feelings herself, why doesn't she have feelings at first ?

20090131095830AArXEvc	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to break the personal space barrier?	Well there's always like a touching barrier kinda thing. I have this guy friend, but I really like him. We've only known each other for a while, but we're pretty close. I keep getting mixed signals, like a lot is just friend stuff, but then occasionally there's something that makes me think he likes me.      I'm a pretty shy person normally, though he's managing to have me not be AS shy. I still am but talking to him and everything is not a problem.. it's everything else that's harder. So anyways, there's always a personal space barrier, and I'd like to break it. A bit anyways. Like, I hope you understand what I mean. I just want him to be comfortable with me and maybe think of me as more than a friend. So anyways, I know girls are supposed to have an easier time breaking the touching barrier because, for guys it's the whole assault problem occasionally.      All I'm really looking for is some simple casual ways to break the barrier. Some subtle ways that may imply that I like him, but are also just kind not to creepy stuff. Hope that makes sense! All ideas are appreciated :)

20090131095425AA0Bx5Z	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My children are suffering, PLEASE HELP!!!!!  (long, sorry) But PLEASE STILL HELP!! WE NEED YOU!!?	I am a single mom and I have two girls ages 4 & 2. Both girls have the same father. We were together for 5 years. When we had our first daughter he was there and everything was good. 2 years later I got pregnant again. When I found out I was so excited (everything was great with us) but he wasn't. He asked me not to have it. I told him I wasn't going to abort the baby. (I have had an abortion before because when I had our first daughter I got preg 3 weeks later and a genetic counselor told me it was better not to have it and an ultrasound showed it didn't have a heart beat yet and that was the only thing that got me through it, I know it was still wrong) So he told me it was him or the baby.  I chose the baby. So he was gone for the entire pregnancy and when I had her he wanted to be there and said he wanted to be in their lives. So we tried to make it work. I allowed him to take the girls to his house for visits and we were on ok terms. Until one day he just never came back with them. He moved, changed him number and I couldn't find him. It took me 3 months to find him and follow his gf to a park and basically got my kids back with the help of the police. Since then we have gone to court and I have 2 restraining orders on him (domestic violence) and he has supervised visits at the courthouse on sats. It took him 9 months before he even showed up for one. Which his new girlfriend comes there to fight me in front of my kids. I cant get a restraining order on her because she hasn't hit me. But for the past 3 months he hasn't shown up for a visit. I still have to bring my kids up there because I'm court ordered to. Every time we go I already know hes not going to be there. Anyway,  we go, wait, and when he doesn't show I have to say the same thing EVERY time.."Daddy's sick today". Well it is to the point where my oldest daughter (4) thinks its because he doesn't love them. She has said she wore the wrong color skirt one time, and now she  says she doesn't like him anymore and he died. My youngest (2) cries from him daily. I tell them everyday he loves them and hes just far away but he would be here if he could. My oldest argues about it. Every time someone brings up someones "daddy" she gets mad and yells and just acts out and says she doesn't want to see her daddy and even calls him by his name and not "daddy". What do I do for my babies? I dont know how to handle the situation and make sure they know they are always loved and its not their fault, etc... I cant afford a therapist. PLEASE HELP ME!!
20090131094453AATcMlR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Here is why i can't get over my ex boyfriend - any advice?	I can still visulize the first time we met, our first date, his smell.       We met from the Net. He came to my school to meet up with me. I now work at the university I attended back then and I can still feel the butterflies that I felth that day as I pulled into the parking lot...because I knew this was "the" day that we'd finally meet.  It was Fall and the leaves were yellow and orange. I can still hear my car drive over them. I can see his car in a distance.        Now he's gone out of my life....2.5 years later....gone.  And he is very very sick now.  The lifestyle he once had is gone. I hope he is OK.  I would love to be around for him, to support him, to hold his puke bucket, etc...I truly loved him. But I just don't think he loved me the same way even though he says he did.  I feel like I wasn't pretty enough, and we were total opposites.  Ahhh. How I miss him.

20090131095112AABea2y	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do you do after a fight?	I've been with my boyfriend for over 2 years and I think we just had our first fight. I accidentally texted him when I was venting about him to a friend. It wasn't anything too bad, just about him not calling when I asked him to and that I was gonna be mad if he didn't call today on his break because my parents would be really annoyed if we didn't make plans till 8, when he gets off of work. But it turns out he didn't get the text and he was upset that I was blaming him for something that was out of his control. I explained that I didn't know he didn't get the text and apologized and said it wasn't a big deal. I asked if he still wanted to see me tonight and he said yes. But I've never dealt with this before, cause he's my first boyfriend. I'm 15. I'm kind of scared that he's still gonna be upset and act different towards me. How do you act after a fight? We haven't exactly made up cause it was through texting before he went to work, and I can't talk to him till at least 5. I'll see him around 8:30-9. How do I act? How will he probably act? I just don't know what to do...

20090131102839AAWAtmV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need some advice...please help? (I'm sorry its long).?	Last April, I found out that my dad was having an affair. I found this out through reading an msn conversation which he did not know had saved onto the computer. It had been going on for almost 2 years. I told him and we had a long conversation, the whole afternoon about it and he promised to me that he ended it the minute I told him. He said that they had been arguing all the time and he wanted it to end (the nature of the conversation was obvious that they were having an affair but also that it was an argument). He told me that the affair had escalated from when my mum and dad were going through a 'bad patch' and they were drunk and the affair started. I guess it was selfish, but I just couldn't have my mum and dad split up- so I didn't make him tell my mum.      Anyway, he used to go to play football with his firm against other firms every Thursday and then said that he was going out for a couple of drinks with the team after but he used to meet her instead afterwards. If ever, although not frequent, my parents argue, I also get angry with my dad and protect my mum- I suppose it is just natural considering the circumstances.      However, he has know said that he thinks it would be best to sleep at his friends house after Thursdays because his commute is 2 hours long to get home and back and it is midnight before he gets back and he has to get up at 5:30 the following day. My mum and dad argued over this, my mum saying how she enjoyed the 10 minutes in the morning that they would see each other for. But, the whole after Thursday thing is just coming back to me and I am afraid that one day I will just explode and do the wrong thing. What advice can you give me on what to do?      If you want to know I am 14, 13 when I found out.      Thank you in advance.

We're really good friends and I don't know if i should tell her how i feel. She's a really nice girl and It's hard to tell if she likes someone since shes so nice. But she hugs me alot, I've only known her for maybe 3 months and shes invited me to many things. She chats to me alot on msn and txt. And when i asked her who her crush was she said its complicated, and she's shared some things with me tht she doesnt share with just anyone. And sometimes wen i have to go away from the computer she sais tht shell miss me.   I don't know if I should tell her because it might ruin our friendship and i love her as a friend      Do you think she likes me? And what should I do?

20060909142110AAB4EN4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do?	I was at my boyfriend house one day and we was sitting outside. This girl pulled up and asked my boyfriend to come here and he went over and was telling her to leave. I came up to the car and asked the girl "why was she mad?" she did not respond to me. She said that she is here to talk to my boyfriend and not me. Me and the girl started arguing and then she left. The girl told me before she left that she had sex with my boyfriend. She said that he did oral sex and physical sex with her. When she said that I got even madder. I left my boyfriend and didn't talk to him for about 2 weeks, But i miss him and I love him and forgave him and i came back to him. Do u think he will still continue to have sex with this girl? What i am really concerned about is, this girl lives RIGHT up the street from my man. She could come and go at anytime. cause she lives no where from him.. What would u do?

20090131093150AA0T8py	Family & Relationships;Friends	Okay. I really need everyone's help. Its this friend problem...?	well tonight is a bar mitzvah, and me and my 3 friends didnt get invited, so we decided to have a sleepover and my friend cathryns house. now my friend olivia is going to the bar mitzvah, but shes our like best friend, so like we didnt invite her to the sleepover since she was going. she overheard us talking about it, so she was like oh, i can go too! so we were all like uh...?      anyways. cathryns mom only wants the 3 of us *me, my friend erin, and my friend nicole* to sleep over, but we dont have the heart to tell olivia that she cant sleep over. cathryn sent a text around to the 3 of us and olivia saying the sleepover was cancelled, but we still could come over but leave at like 930. but its really still on, that was just so olivia wouldnt sleepover.       i think we should tell olivia that its really on but we just couldnt like, have her sleep over, but cathryn thinks olivia will be mad, because she probably will be. she would want to sleepover anyway, or likee stay later or something, but cathryn canttt have her sleepover.      what should we do? tell her? if we should, what should we say so it wouldnt hurt?      thanks guyss.

Okay, so i have this friend. a kind that you love being friends with and sometimes hate. Well the problem is i have been dating this guy for a year and a few months and well my friend doesn't like him, i don't know why exactly. But she has been telling me he's homo and stuff. well he's really not. they just don't see what i see in him. She told him that he would be better of with this other girl. My friend has been bugging him about this so he went with it, just to make her stop. But he realized that he loved me more than anything in the world, and i really wanna get back with him but my friend has been pressuring me not to. But my other friends have told me to listen to my heart. My friend is kind of popular so she has the power to influence people to hate me and the guy. I really want my friends too, but i still want the guy because he makes me happy. i don't know what to do. Also she has made us break up three times already because me and my ex listen to what she says about us.

20090131093129AAgRqIU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS: What do you think of this guy?	There's a guy I really like at school, but he's in the year below so I only ever see him around school at lunch or breaks. (We're 16 and 15). He's came up to me before about 5 times to talk to me, and he asked me to help him with some work once. He's also playfully taken my work and held it up so I had to jump and get it. He asks me how I am, etc too. Whenever I'm walking about 5 metres or so behind him on my way to a lesson he'll look behind, but I'm not sure whether he just does that a lot anyway. Reasons why I think he may not like me include him not having spoken to me for a month. But we don't have any classes together and whenever I see him it's usually from far away when I'm with friends. Is he just being friendly when he sees me or does he like me?

20090131102042AAZ5Hgt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A good guy needs a woman's opinion?	Ok so I have TERRIBLE luck with the opposite sex. Im very charismatic and have kind of a dark sense of humor. My problem is I just don't understand what women really want.      Ive tried just about everything from being the chivalrous gentlemen to being more distant and secluded emotionally. Im mastering in psychology, but even that can't explain why I still find myself in an awkward state when it comes to females.      I'm not a player and have never tried to be. In fact I scorn my room ates who practice that lifestyle because its so trashy. No offense to anyone.      But heres my dilema..I need to know what women really want and in those first 15 seconds into an hour meeting them what should I do to not scare them? I feel like sometimes intelligence works against me and that my intuition is what makes the opposite sex seem intimidated by me..Should I dumb it down a little bit or am I just one of those "Hopless Romantics?"
20070519182916AAK1wzI	Family & Relationships;Friends	PERVERTED freaks?	There is this guy that wanted to go out with me, but I didn't want to go with him and my 2 'friends' kept teasing me about it. At 1st, they were just innocent jokes, and I was just a little annoyed, but then they started making all these perverted sexual jokes about us. (They were REALLY, REALLY, SICK jokes. They were about me being a porn star and other crap! I'm only 13!)      I kept telling them to stop and gave them a bunch of chances, but they wouldn't, so I just left and went to talk with some of my other friends.      Now one of them got on I.M. and cussed me out and called me a drama queen cuz I didn't like the stuff they were saying about me and the guy.      I explained to her why I didn't get why she was mad at ME cuz I didn't do anything to her but tell her and the other girl to stop making their little jokes. She said that I was overeacting, but all I did was tell them to stop!      WTF did I do?!?      P.S. She is probably going to answer this question. She is the one that goes by Perk

20090131093610AAkfoZg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	It's been few weeks... would you call this girl back even if it seems like she can't find time for u anymore?	BEST ANSWER WILL GET 10 POINTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I need an answer.  A good one too.      Okay firstly, she has two kids... one is 1, the other is 2.  I didn't want a relationship with her, but she sure WAS my fooling around partner, and she was attracted to me, had fun around me, and really liked my company, and I liked her too.  But eventually we fell out on bad terms, she found a new boyfriend, and acted like she didn't care at all to hear from me anymore.  So I gave her what she wanted... I didn't call her for NINE weeks!  For nine weeks she didn't hear from me or see me.      When I DID finally call, the same girl who acted like she didn't care to hear from me anymore was wondering why I stopped checking for her, and she still wants me to call her to check on her and see how she's doing, and there was that fun vibe and laughing and goodness between me and her again, as if that fire was still slightly burning.  The good tension between us was still there.  She still wants me to call her.  She wants to hear from me.      But then I noticed a trend.  I started to be the only one who was calling her.  She wasn't returning ANY of my calls, and I wasn't even showing any neediness.  She was saying we could go out, she just need to find a babysitter for the kids, but she was never able to.  She said her cousin was off the island, and when she finally reached back, her cousin wud be out or doing something.  Trying to go out with her was too hard.  Boyfriend still on the scene.      Now, I ALWAYS try to keep in mind that she has two really bad children that keep her really busy, and a boyfriend now, but I still feel like she could find some kind of free time to call me, so when I saw she wasn't calling me back, or I started to feel like I was just a little too much after her, I stopped calling her completely once again.      I haven't called her in three weeks.  I don't have time for this.  I have places to go and other people to see.................................. but that doesn't mean that she isn't still always on my mind... and honestly, she was the first person to give me some real physical and intimate experiences... that boost of confidence, and I really miss the fooling around we did, but I don't run behind ANYONE, even if she WAS the first.      Am I doing the right thing by never calling her again, or should I call her again?
20090131100248AA4OzGg	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would that be considered cheating? Am I wrong for giving him an ultimatum?	So... That female my guy had been hanging out with consistently... Well I had gotten emotional (I asked a couple questions regarding this situation).. He said they are just friends and he doesn't like her that way. Then he broke up with me almost a week ago, but we were going to work things out through counseling and then I found out I'm pregnant.. He was out with her til 4 am this morning from 1:00pm yesterday.. He told me he really likes her. And he kissed her. So then I'm like WTF? You told me over and over again how you don't like her and she is just a friend etc. He still wants me to move in with him since we are long distance, but I told him this morning that he needs to choose her or me. their 6 month long friendship, or our 3 year long dating. Is what he did cheating? Am I wrong for giving him this ultimatum?  He asked his dad for advice and his dad told him everything I thought basically, and took my side.. I'm very upset, and I don't even know what to do with myself. He has only kissed 2 ppl ever before her including me, he thinks it is a very special thing. But he did that with her.. How am I supposed to trust him till I move if we do still try to work out? Idk.. So confused, and hurt.

20090131083835AAlKGit	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I get her to grow up and stop being such a wench?	There's this girl I know. We're "friends" but she constantly makes bitchy blogs regarding me when I haven't done ****.      The last one just really set me off.      I'm a Christian. And she just says "**** all Christians, you're all fat and no one likes you blah blah blah."      I might be taking it up the butt, but I'm really offended. And then she kept going on.      I recently got a boyfriend, and I love him with all my heart. She doesn't have a lover. But she's all cocky about how SHE knows what love is and I have no idea what I'm talking about.      What she writes is, "Love is retarded, and so are those who are in it. They're ******* brainwashed. Nothing lasts blah blah blah."      That's what REALLY got to me. Then she said at the bottom, "This isn't directed at anyone."      ...What kind of an idiot does she take me for?      I've tried talking it out with her. She only acts like a bigger *****.   I don't know what to do at this point.      How can I get her to stop? I don't care if it's bitchy, to be honest, because she doesn't deserve another chance.      And why is she doing this anyways?      Thanks for your time.

20070402102624AAsKMom	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I contacted my ex now wat should i do- was I wrong?	Okay- well long story. I met this guy right b4 i graduated out of college. For five months we were in a relationship...and both of us had deep feelings for one another. Then in october i got pregnant and i went to have an abortion which we both agreed. Becuz we could both not afford a baby.  He was angry @ the fact my mom was the first to know. He just acted really distant and we got in2 fights everytime we saw each other. So through a txt message i broke up with him-cuz i knew i just couldnt do it with him near me. Well- anywayz for three months i acted like a hermit and didnt really talk to anybody. I text messaged him happy holidays for thanksgiving and christmas but never got a response. Then a few days ago i had a discussion with my friend and I realized some of the things he said were right about me. so i decided to txt message him "u know u were right about me" ...well 5 min later he called me back asked me wat i meant...and now i think i opened somethin i shouldnt have.

20081029183801AAv7cCD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	At 36, I am still single, what is wrong with me?	I grew up thinking man and woman are truly equal. I did what I can to excel and compete with men. I succeeded accademically. After I graduated, I worked for various high tech firms and made a descent living. During which period, I was chased by a couple of guys, however, I think I was vain at the time -- I am pretty and smart, I thought I should get somebody smarter than me and good looking too -- a prince charm. This turned out to be as unrealistic as it can be. In my early 30s, I started to feel dissatisfied with my career and went back to school for top finance degree. It didn't work out either -- though I landed a job with a top firm, I had to quit my job as most guys there would give me a hard time. They said I am minority demanding majory treatment. Now I used up all my savings, in my late 30s, still single, limited job prospects -- what should I do? What is wrong with me? Is it the case that I don't comform -- this is a man dominated world -- I am trying to be independent and I am attractive -- that is the exact package man hates?      Sorry for all these gibberish, please give me some good advice.

Then a couple will come over and start to have flirty dialogue, tease me etc, even one of the female managers does, it's crazy!  I basically feel like I'm in some kind of anime or something!   Apparently they even call eachother on their cell phones after work and talk about how cute I am!!  Its so crazy because I like all of them and I want to pick one though I'm pretty sure the rest will still like me and I want them all to be very happy!!!
20060811145441AAhl0tD	Family & Relationships;Family	I know a guy that has a fat fetish. He loves fat women and men. What causes this?	This guy he masturbates rather strangely, he told me this, I don't know why.    He has these 2 pillows, the biggest pillow he stuffs down his oversized sweat pants, then he adds about 5 blankets along with the pillow. He then adds the small pillow, then adds 2 more blankets.     He then puts on a t-shirt and pulls it over the blankets and tucks it in and then adds another t-shirt and this forms a tight snug fit.     He says it makes him feel wonderful and sometimes he says he just falls asleep with it on or he fantasizes of being someone heavyset and masturbates. He tells me it is a great feeling.    He only told me because I found a bunch of blankets with stains on them.    How strange is this or has anyone else tried some weird masturbation techniques?

20061020112621AA7H3xm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can a man only love one woman at a time?	How is it possible for a married man to have kissed and made out with another woman who was also married at the time.  Then a year later those two are still emailing each other about anything and everything general to stay in touch.  But it seems that the married man has some new lady friends who he flirts around with and dances with and publicly leaves open comments to in myspace.  How is it that he cannot initiate or start a conversation with the woman he kissed even though he writes back to her weekly, sometimes more, and here he is flirting with another 2 women telling them the dance was fun they didn't even need a pole and stuff.  What kind of man is he?  Does he love the woman he kissed before and he is still in touch with, does he love the 2 women who he flirts with separately now, or does he love his wife, or does he love everyone?  Is there any difference.  Would you think the married man and married woman who kissed and all still like each other when they are in contact ?

20090131102559AAGyRL6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Slept with my bosses Son?	Im 20 yrs old, and in college full time, but I clean houses for extra cash a few times a week.  Well I clean this huge house about once a week, and I love being there because of the son, he's 21, in college, and works for his dad, maintaining company databases.  Anyway my boss, pays me alot for cleaning the house, "really big house", but said not to distract his son, he siad it like this "he is getting paid to work, not to talk", "You are an attractive girl, don't let that get him fired"   Well yesterday when I came to clean the house, I wlk in everything was spotless, and the son was laying on the couch.

20090131095118AA3nQBo	Family & Relationships;Friends	I can't seem to make friends?	The counselor transferred me out of a class that I had with a ton of friends and now I'm in a class where everyone has already formed all their little groups. Everyone there is really outgoing and they already made friends in the week before I wasn't there. We've got assigned seats and the teacher made me sit where this other girl was sitting so the other people at the table resent me for that. One of the girls at my table called me weird because I didn't talk much on the first day because I was hoping to get switched out and yesterday she just said "I don't like you." Almost everyone else is nice and funny but they won't talk to me anymore because that girl told them not to, so I don't really want to be friends with them anyway. And the guidance counselor said I absolutely canNOT switch into a different class. I'm not that good at making friends anyway and I don't know what to do?

If I am wrong tell me I can take it.   My girlfriend is coming to another country to live with me. She is flying next Monday. She has a lot to take care of since she is leaving her country.      I had a simple request, I said, I don't want your EX boyfriend to give a ride to the airport. I hate to wait for you here knowing that you hugged and kissed him goodbye before I do here.      He doesn't know she is in a relationship with me. And moving in here for me.      It was a request that she thinks I am being very irrational about and says that she doenst want to pay $50 for a taxi and he will be the only one offering a ride. This $50 bucks mean nothing to her. And I am saying this to you all and don’t say it to her, I am spending thousands of dollars without her knowing to make her stay here a comfortable one and arranging for everything for her including a job.      She did many things previously against what I felt. All insignificant for her, but was for me, avoiding them would've made me feel ok, but she refuses

Don't take it like im sheltered, but im in my mid-twenties. What the hell is going on?     Last week I went out with this cool girl, and we really clicked. She and I were very comfortable around each other and I asked her out for this weekend and she said she'd love to. This was about a week before christmas. I have not heard from her since calling her a couple times since. We were supposed to go out tomorrow night. I know she is buying a house and is running around it's the holidays, but really........I get it. She hasn't gotten back to me, so I moved on, but really      Is she interested or is it over? I ask because I felt something with this girl I haven't with anyone else in a long time, a connection that it could go into a relationship.

20070327115842AAoxmei	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What was this girl thinking?	I was at a party over the weekend and a girl there got a little drunk (not falling down, getting sick drunk) but she was feeling pretty good. She decided that she was going to make some $ and started giving BJ’s for $5, which I thought was a very reasonable price. I heard that by the end of the night she had about $42, which means she either got a tip or someone got a discount. Her friends were there and didn’t stop her in fact a few watched. How do you decide that that is a good idea and how do you feel the next day (besides sore)? Has any girl on here ever done that before? How do you look at yourself after something like that?

20070507152648AAt8ZA6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	VERY VERY VERY UPSET!!! help!!!?	I honestly want to kill myself! I really do i've reached the point where i can't take it anymore!!!! I really really REALLY CAN'T!! Please read it's LONG         This is my Story of how all hell broke loose in my life.      I started off school like every other youngster. Eager and happy to go to Kindergarten! Kindergarten – third grade were some of the best years for me. I wish I could go back to them every single day! Third grade I recall getting into a small “tiff” with a young lady who I was good friends with. Her name was Annie. I remember I shoved her down the slide and she cried. That was the only fight I ever remember getting into.   By the time 4th grade came around things really changed for me. I remember I was put in Mrs. M’s class. We went to a different school in 4th grade and where I live there are 8 different elementary schools and then a school for 4-5th graders. I remember all the kids would not include me to sit with them at lunch or work with them on projects because I did not go to the same elementary school as them. I would come home crying.   My mother got me switched out of that class and into this male teacher’s class. I still remember his name Mr. Smitty! He was the best teacher I ever had but the class was worse then the first class I was in. I wanted to make friends and I got invited to this girl Jenna’s birthday party. I went and got scared because they were popping balloons. I started crying. The next day at school the girl claimed I ruined her birthday party. After that I got picked on every single day! When I went on field trips my mother would have to come along because nobody would allow me to be in there groups on the field trips.   I would come home crying every single day. I remember one girl made up a rumor saying I had a knife in school and this was bout two days after columbine. I got suspended but they found no weapons no NOTHING!! I remember at the end of the year the kids had a party and all threw water balloons at me. I had begged my parent’s to move but they refused.   5th grade was NO better! It was just as bad. I remember the one friend I had told me he had to pretend to not be friends with me so everyone would not make fun of me. I remember my teacher telling the class “I know you don’t like her neither do I but deal with her.” I was crying when I heard that! She would seclude me and one other student and not allow us to sit in groups. I hated it.   Sixth grade (junior high) came around and I did fight with people somewhat. I guess because I had a lot of anger built up in me. I made a few friends that year and it was not “too bad.” I don’t remember having many problems that year aside from my father passing away.   In 7th grade things got bad yet again. Boys would make fun of me for my flat chest. They did not like me at all. I remember one boy I really liked stood up in front of the entire class and told them he would never date me and how he thought I was so ugly. It hurt really badly   In 8th grade I lost all my friends I did have in Junior High. I remember this girl named Lauren. She was the biggest B*tch you could ever meet! She would tell my best friend at the time Kelly when I was allowed to hang out with her. She made numerous people go against her and I remember at one point I did get violent with her and beat her up pretty badly. I chased her down the hallway jumped on her and hit her. I got detention for that. I never apologized because she made my 8th grade a living hell. By the end of 8th grade though, I did have some friends.   I entered high school with a brand new slate! I thought things would be great! My freshman year was not that bad at all to be honest. I had a boyfriend and friends and I was happy. I really enjoyed high school and hoped it would stay the way it was.   During my sophomore year I became very depressed and attempted suicide 17 times! I remember NOBODY would talk to me in any of my classes and I was taking a chemistry class in which my chemistry teachers who were amazing actually had a meeting with guidance and my mother and insisted I be transferred to another period that they offered there chemistry class because they felt I was not treated right at all and they could not understand why. They even TOLD my guidance consoler that I did nothing wrong at all and they were shocked by other students behavior towards me. I remember that was the year in my math class that I had had a bottle thrown at my head as well. I was miserable.   During my junior year I met my boyfriend. He goes to a different school then me and has been the strength that has kept me together. Junior year I loved. I made friends with upperclassman and underclassman. I had the time of my life and I would give anything to go back to it but I can’t!   My senior year has been an all out HELL! I broke up with my boyfriend to date another guy because my friend convinced me he would be great for me. I asked him to prom and he said “yes” I bought the tickets to find out that he was joking and that he had no real intention of going with me and he had no interest in me what so ever. My friends also back stabbed me with prom. They told me that they were buying tickets one day and went and bought them a different day behind my back so that I would not be included in the limo and such. I had no table to sit at for prom and when I signed up with my best friend he screamed at me and told me that I was ruining his prom. It’s gotten so bad to the point where people are vandalizing my car now! I went to the school and complained and nothing would be done about it!      My goal was to not graduate from this high school to not graduate with these students! I don’t want this anymore!! I have been through 8 years of this hell and for 8 years I have been begging my parent’s to move! I know a month left a month left but I am very nervous I’m going to snap and either end up doing something dumb to myself or to others. You can only push a person so far. I’m really considering dropping out all together! PLEASE HELP PLEASE!!!

20070622174918AA2mBdA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Para compartir con ustedes espero les guste?	Hola me llamo Juan, tengo a?o y medio de edad,   aunque aun no entiendo qué significa.   Lo que si me preocupa,   es cuando se me cae mi mamila o mi sonaja;   cuando entre las sábanas se me pierde mi osito de peluche.   Es tal mi desesperación, que lloro   y grito muy fuerte para que mis papás se fijen   y resuelvan mi problema. Que angustia.   Esos si son problemas...      Hola soy Juan, tengo 7 a?os, me gusta jugar fútbol.   El mes pasado me saqué un 10 en matemáticas   y adivinen qué me compraron - un balón profesional;   era yo el ni?o más feliz del mundo.   Todo era felicidad hasta hoy,   porque mi balón se ponchó   y mi mami me dijo que no volvería a comprarme otro   porque no sé cuidarlos.   Qué angustia. Esos si son problemas...      ?Qué tal! tengo 14 a?os y me llamo Juan Salvador.   ?Alguna vez se han puesto a pensar:   ?Quién eres tu?, ?Porqué nací aquí?   ?Qué será mi futuro? ?Porqué soy yo y no tú?.   En realidad me doy cuenta de que son tantas cosas en qué pensar,   la vida se va haciendo más difícil   y de que francamente es imposible descifrar el enigma de la vida.   Qué angustia. Esos si son problemas ...      ?Qué onda!, ?Cómo estás?,   me llamo Salvador voy a cumplir la grandiosa cantidad de 18 a?os.   Troné 4 materias y creo que estoy perdido,   soy un fracaso, no sirvo para nada.   No quiero pensar en esa mirada de mi jefe al ver mis calificaciones,   sus ojos parecerán los de un león furioso...   Y eso no es todo;   creo que lo que me tiene peor es esa nena que conocí hace tiempo,   creo que estoy enamorado de ella, pero es un poco fresa.   No sé qué hacer, no sé qué decir, no se cómo actuar.   Esta vida no vale nada; como me gustaría ser ni?o otra vez,   en esa edad uno no tiene problemas.   Qué angustia. Esos si son problemas...      ?Qué tal!, Soy el Lic. Salvador.   En la empresa donde trabajo no gano lo suficiente.   He estudiado toda una vida y ?esto es lo que recibo?   ?Mi mejor esfuerzo, no vale nada!,   se anteponen los intereses personales,   además hay que ser deshonesto.   Lo que aprendí en la Universidad no se parece en nada a la vida real;   Ya no soy tan feliz como cuando era adolescente;   entonces no había preocupaciones;   no tenía tantas responsabilidades.   ?Qué problemas tenía yo? Tenía casa, comida, ropa, todo por hacer;   mi única obligación era la escuela.   Les diré una cosa:   prepárense para el futuro porque está lleno de problemas complicados.   Qué angustia. Esos si son problemas...      ?Gusto en conocerlos! soy el Dr. en Derecho,   Juan Salvador; soy padre de familia, no es fácil serlo.   Mis hijos, mal que bien, ahí la llevan;   pero a la que ya no soporto es a mi esposa;   no es la misma que conocí hace 18 a?os.   ?Bendita edad! construyendo castillos en el aire,   sue?as con ser millonario famoso, veía el mundo a mis pies.   Ahora todo es diferente;   la vida es más dura de lo que parece en realidad;   estoy sintiendo una gran angustia   ante la impotencia de no poder hacer mucho..   Definitivamente, Estos si son problemas...      ?Ya soy abuelo!, Mi nieto se llama Juan Salvador, como yo.   ?Gracias a Dios nació con salud!   Qué suerte la de poder gozar de salud.   Si yo la tuviera, sería el hombre más feliz del mundo,   haría tantas cosas que no puedo hacer...,   caminaría por el parque de la mano   con esa bendita mujer que tengo hace más de 50 a?os,   jugaría con mi nieto a la pelota,   viajaría de vez en cuando con el dinero que logré juntar   y que ahora se me va en puras medicinas.   Qué lastima que la vida sea tan angustiosa   y esté lleno de problemas.      ?Qué pasa?? no sé dónde estoy.   Aquí sólo veo una luz hacia donde dirijo la mirada.   Hace un tiempo deje de vivir, pero sigo existiendo...   Tarde me di cuenta de que la vida es más sencilla de lo que parece,   de que en realidad estuve muerto en vida, quejándome de todo,   sintiendo que la vida era para sufrir, no entiendo   ?porqué me preocupaba por una sonaja, o por un balón ponchado?,   ?qué me importaba que debiera 4 materias o todas las materias?,   ?porqué le tenía miedo a esa mujer que llegó a ser mi esposa?   y que sólo de viejo supe valorar;   ?a quién diablos le importa   si la empresa por la que desatiendes a tu familia   y le dejas tu vida no te valora?,   ?porqué me preocupaba de mi salud?   cuando sólo tenía un peque?o catarro...      ?Lo más importante era que estaba vivo!   Tenía sue?os y esperanzas...   Yo mismo me impuse el peor castigo: No fui feliz.   En aprender a vivir se me fué toda la vida.   Tarde me di cuenta de que en realidad   no existen los problemas complicados;   tarde me di cuenta de que el secreto de la vida   es vivir intensamente cada momento,   tarde me di cuenta de que el secreto de la vida   es aprovechar este regalo y compartirlo contigo...

Basically until now I did not have the money to support a wife but now I am in a place in my career where I can afford to take care of the right woman. Oh, I'm not so proud of being an almost middle-aged virgin and that is why I choose the scull face.
20070804192950AA5Kc5N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she thinking about dumping me?	My girlfriend and I have been a very loving, intimate couple, until just a few weeks ago. She doesn't seem as happy with me as she used to be. She doesn't laugh at the things I do or say that used to make her laugh, she only says that she loves me when I say it first, and even then it's a hasty "love you too." She been almost cold to me lately. I don't know if somethings wrong, cause when I ask her she says everythings fine. Is she thinking about dumping me? I don't know where I went wrong, I love her death! But, then, I'm no women expert. Any suggestions about what might be up with her?

During the 18 months my ex Ty and I dated, I treated him horribly,like completely sh!t some days worse while he treated me like a princess from day one.He's the type of guy most girls only dream of dating and had girls throwing themselves at him all day long remained completely faithful while I cheated on him with his best friend for the last 6 months of our relationship which ended when I got caught.      I'm currently in a new relationship with another really great guy.A few months I was in a really bad car accident and urgently needed a kidney and as soon as my ex found out he got tested for compatibility before he even spoke to me and signed all the paperwork seconds after he was told he was a match.      I feel absolutely horrible about how I treated him even though it's been 9 months since our break-up and have no idea how to thank him.What would you do?

20090131083843AAVup1W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did he ask my friend out a week later?	i am more than slightly confused about this. let's call him Jay. So, i'm in love with Jay. we were best friends for a year, but i guess that was kinda fueled by his insane psycho crush he had on me. It made our friendship just a tad more special, added a certain spark.      When i first came to realise that i was falling in love with him, i was so thrilled because i knew he had feelings for me. so i told him so, and he admitted them - and kissed me. He was very passionate, and every time he saw me his eyes would melt. It was perfect for a while.       But he never asked me out. It got awkward,(both of our faults) and we kinda put a stop to it. Then it started up again, but something REALLY bad happened, that broke us. It also put a hold on our friendship.       A week later he asked my friend out. They went out for a month until she dumped him because they weren't going anywhere. That was a month ago, and he's just told her he's not over her.         So what the hell happened!? I know him well enough to know when he's got a crush on someone, and i know that he definatly likes her, and doesn't like me. But i also know the depth of his old crush...      so yeah, what happened?      can you see any way i can get him back?

20090131084226AAkFa3z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advance on asking girl to prom?	so I no asking someone to prom is a big think and all and obviously you don't know if they will say yes or no so its nerveracking but i am going to anyways.  so my question is that our prom is at the end of may and tickets go on sale end of feb/ early march.  Now first thing is that our semi is like second week in feb and i probably wont go, but if i ask someone to prom like just before tickets go on sale so mayb like end of feb would that be fine? or is it too early? ( 3months about) if too early then wen should i ask? (and obviously im asking face to face and dont want someone else to ask her first)  second is since im not going to semi most likely im kinda nervous that if she gets asked then she will go to prom with that individual if they go to semi but on the other side semi is just kinda for grade 11 and 12 so not really like prom....so would that be a bad thing if she gets asked to semiby some other guy? thnks

20090131085407AAA95kv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make the first move?	I once knew of this girl that I liked. However, I can get to be no more than friends with her and she was also attached. Subsequently, we graduated and went our ways.      Recently I saw her profile in Friendstar. She is now leading a very successful life and is a director of some organisation. I also noticed she no longer seemed to be with her bf but her own family. She is living with her parents. My feeling is that she had broken off from her bf.      I am thinking of going after her again. It will be a long shot, but I hope to give it a try.      Do you know how can I approached her again? Email her? Visit her home? What should I do for the first time?      Any sincere suggestions will be very welcome. Thank you.

The statistics on HIV and AIDS in America clearly show that ethnic minorities account for a disproportionate number of cases in most states. African Americans are particularly severely affected by the virus, and relatively high rates of HIV can be found in virtually every sector of the black community.       The latest Centers for Disease Control report on the US epidemic shows that in 2007, the vast majority of people diagnosed with AIDS were black men.

20090131102442AAyuuHy	Family & Relationships;Friends	If a friend is at stake...how much is too much?	My 16 year old friend, (for the sake of easiness and being anonymous we'll call her Sally), Sally, is a good friend of mine. She's a bright girl, very bubbly and beautiful, always in and out of crushes. She's not a skank by any means of the word. I mean, she just had her first kiss not to long ago. Okay, so this is what happened late last night.   ...To make a long story short Sally tells me that she and a 32 year old co worker (we'll call Bill) have had oral sex with each other. She told me she was worried about STDS, but also she knew what she had done was stupid, and she "ended it" with Bill the night before. This is where I obviously freak out. While trying to be supportive and non-judgemental, I try to explain to her that what had happened was illegal (well she knew that), and that this man was a predator. From first hand experience, I know the first thing predators do is "become your friend", which is what happened with Bill and Sally. I also told her that I loved her as a friend, that I'd do anything to protect her...anything...including giving up our friendship. I told her then that she needed to tell someone, be it parent or school counselor or someone immediately. She had tell, and soon, or I would tell her parents. I knew she would be pissed at me, furious, but I'd rather have a safe grounded Sally then a dead-raped-found-in-a-trash-can Sally.       She texted me the next morning saying that she would tell, and that I needed to get out of that part of her life, and that no matter what, we'd be friends, because friendship and love never die.      She then called me an hour later telling me that she was grounded, and that Bill wouldn't be hanging around anymore. That she was very pissed at me, but that she still loves me. She also said that if she saw Bill, she'd "handle it" (though I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean).      Okay, so my situation right now is...I don't know if I believe that she told her parents. I mean, I threatened telling her her parents herself, she could have very easily not told them. But at the same time, but calling her parents behind her back now, even if she did tell them, I'd lose her forever, which is what I risked in the first place.       So am I being overboard? Should I ask my own parents for advice? Should I just forget this whole thing? What should I do?      All I know is that a 32 year old pervert took away the innocence of a 16 year old girl, and I'm not sure if I'm the only one that knows it.
20090131102938AAwysYx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Unhealthy To Have No Close Friends Of The Opposite Sex?	Well im a sophomore in highschool, Im always busy with either wrestling or with family, my parents are divorced so i switch back n fourth alot during the week.    So basically i have no time for close friends outside of wrestling. Yeah i got tons of people that like me and say hi wit short conversation. I do flirt with girls normally but it never gets anywhere. I definitely dont have any girl-friends that i talk to regularly outside of school. So i think my social skills with girls suck and its been making me feel kinda empty and depressed.    Could that be the reason why i feel like this? (empty&depressed)

A guy asked my friend to ask me to go on a double date with my friend her boyfriend him and me, so I said yes. Anyway our schedules didn't work so he just came to a thing with us with about 7 other people, didn't really work because there was so many people and I was almost completely ignored by him. I had to give him a run home however and trapped in a small space with him talking wasn't that bad, he's super shy and I guess that's why he treated me different when around other people. Think I should ask for a second date just to get to know him more one on one? Or think because he ignored me he really just isn't that into me after all, or is he really just shy?

20090131103817AAKbwRK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are these good signs that she likes me?	its been a couple of months since i have been talking to this girl. i asked her out and everytime time i do, it seems to get closer and closer, the most recent was that she appologized a moment later because she felt it was rude and it made it sound like she didnt like me or something. she said she will tottally let me know when she is ready to hang out. ( I CANT TELL IF THATS A THROW OFF, LIKE I DONT WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS OR LEGIT..)      since then she now looks down the hall and if she sees me she stops and waits and we walk to class. we usually partner up for classwork type stuff.   she strums/brushes her desk and her hands usually somehow to manage to cross over and touch my hands which are gently resting on my own desk   she talks alot more, has more entusiasm, and gives strong eye contact.   and most recently i am starting to give her a hug, (she stated a while back she hates to be touched, but a few days ago when i held out my arms she followed through and gave me a hug goodbye)      not sure what do you think?

20090131110448AANlteL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Im confused! does he like me? does he like her? HELP!!?	Let me tell you about some people first:   Me- the confused one   Bill- i met him last year, then fell apart. he got my number over the summer and we text a lot. have been friends for a little while, not too long though. i think he might like me and i kinda like him   Thomas- Bills best friend, i text him a lot, then bill asks why im texting thomas, not him   Bridgette- One of my really good friends that thomas has asked out through bill (texting, bill said thomas wanted to go out with her)      now for the story:   i was texting thomas and bill on bridgettes phone, because mine was dead. after i left, she had their numbers. and now they text her all the time and not me. i guess i feel kinda jealous, but kinda mad too, because she knew that i kinda liked bill, and now she flirts with him, she sent him a picture of herself, and he repled with "you're cute" i was sitting right there. he has never directly said that to me. hes said things like, "o her? not as cute as you", but never come out and said "i think you're hot" he'll randomly stop texting me, and ill look over and hes started texting bridgette :( theres actually a few questions in here... do you think bill likes me? is he just shy or nervous around me? hes always saying, where were you at school, or you wanna go out, but its always texting and im not sure if its really him. he asks me who i like, a lot, but doesnt talk to me in person very much at all. im so confused. also, does thomas like bridgette?      sorry its so long and stupid, i just dont really know how to shorten it, and im feeling kinda sad... THANKS!

20090131110840AAEQs0U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think about the New Age independent Woman?	Yesterday I went to a coffee house when the MC said, “We need to stop making all these women believe they need to be independent and just step up and be a man." I know you are probably a feminist and thinking this man is an old fashion sexist but take a good look at what it means to be not only independent but an independent woman. At first being an independent woman sounded like we were being freed, it sounded like power and fun but now I realize with more freedom comes more responsibility. I can picture myself getting my own place, having my own car and being there all alone. I'd have to change my own flat tires, fix my own broken furniture as well as cook and clean. And then there are so many other expectations of a woman like working out all the time so that you can be attractive and don’t forget the all hair appointments, getting your nails done and shopping. Ooo and Of course work comes first and you have to be smart and aggressive at your job and then when you come home and you have this “sex in the city life” on the side. All this stuff is kind of unrealistic for your average woman and it’s a lot of pressure to be a trophy girl. I think it takes a single person to really realize the value of a relationship (preferably marriage) and the value of having someone else to rely on from time to time. I have come to the realization that I do need a man or I will eventually. I don't need a man just for handy work but also emotional support. I need someone to grab me by the waist and tell me that I'm absolutely beautiful inside and out and he hasn't noticed me gaining any weight, even if it is a lie :) We need to stop thinking that we are near invincible and know that it's okay to ask for help or rely on someone else from time to time. I don't know if I believe in true love but I do believe in a partnership.

20090131104000AAUFuN1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I am in my late 30's, and have a 18-month old baby.  His dad and I live together and have been now for almost ?	a year.  To make a long story short, he has other children (that do not live with him) and I have an older son who is 15, needless to say we have a blended family.   There has been tension and a few weeks ago we got into an argument that resulted in him pushing me , and this wasnt the first time he has been this way,, back in September he slapped me across the face when we got into an argument.  I know...everyone would say leave him which believe me I have considered...the issue is that he is a great father to our baby and they have  a close bond.   I feel terrible taking that away, yet I know I have to think of myself.   He has not done anything since this last incident,, ..I just dont know what to do.

20090131110529AATRunj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if he's a player?	I've been cheated on before even though I'm only a sophomore in hs. I refused to let myself go through that again and promised myself I'd be careful so I wouldn't get hurt. But it has happened again. I've been talking to this junior guy since december. He told me he liked me a lot and we talked every day. He always texted me when he said he would, he came to watch me at all my home high school swim meets, and constantly called me beautiful and amazing. He said I was different then the other girls and recently said he was crazy about me. Sure he had a reputation as a player, but I gave him a chance because he promised me he had changed and even our mutual friend assured me he changed. But last night at a school-sponsored event< he ignored me for the first two hours. He saw I was there, looked at me, and walked away. He made a point of talking to every other girl except me. So when he came to give me a hug later in the evening I told him I didn't want to talk to him and walked away. He then texted me and asked what he did wrong. I told him he made a point of ignoring me. He said he didn't mean to and didn't want to be clingy. I said there's a difference between being clingy and not even bothering to say hello. I said I felt like an idiot for wanting to hang out with him and he said he tried. Then I said you can tell yourself you did but you didn't because I wouldn't feel this way if you had. I never got a reply text. Maybe he fell asleep (it was late) but today I have not heard from him. All my friends say he played me and planned this. I'm trying to protect myself from getting hurt again, but this hurts. I'm conflicted over if he really is a player or if he just made a mistake last night (but I think ignoring someone you "like" is unacceptable). Words and actions should correspond. But last night they didn't. I called him a jerk. I figured if he really does like me then he'll try to fix this and if he's a player then he won't. What if he doesn't? Or what if he thinks I hate him and won't try while he still secretly likes me. I don't know. I have no idea what to do and if what he has been doing means he's a player. Please offer some help. Tell me how I should react when I see him in school also. What if we never talk again? He always did say he couldn't wait to get to know me and that he was looking forward to spending the summer with me. I also told him I wasn't going to have sex with him and he said he doesn't care and he just liked me for me.

20090131103427AAEb8Vw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Odd girl help needed!?	last fall I went on a hike with a beautiful girl, after the hike we went to get ice cream, after that i took her back to her car where she told me she had a good time and then gave me a hug. after that i discovered we had a class together, we've talked in class and i would like to say that our friendship has been strengthened. ever since that first date i've always had this constant attraction to her. now we are going to a valentines dance this coming weekend and i was actually going to tell her how i felt, i'm not expecting her to feel the same way but i just need to let her know. and finally last night i woke up in a cold sweat after having a dream that her friends didn't want me talking to her and that she really hated me. i'm just curious what this dream could mean about how i feel about her. i strongly care about her but i'm not sure if it's love. the only thing i'm certain of is that i could spend the rest of my life with her and be happy. thanks.

Out of the 10 or so friends i have, every single one of them has a girlfriend. It makes it really hard for me to find one myself... I am 20 years old. My friends barely seem to go out much any more since they all got girlfriends themselves so it makes it hard for me because i don't really have anyone to go out with to meet girls. My job doesn't help either i am a machinist who works in a shop with all men. I feel like i made the mistake of not finding a girlfriend in high school because almost every one of their girlfriends were the ones they graduated highschool with. Not to be cocky or anything but i think i am a pretty good looking person, i go to the gym i play sports and i am not shy around women. What do i need to do to find that special someone? I hate always having my friends calling me saying " hey man come over there is me my gf him his gf and him and his gf were going to have a few drinks"  So what should i start doing? Try to find some new friends that are single and go out with them or just go out alone and try? Thanks for the help.

20090131110203AASCcnY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I dump new boyfriend?	I've been going out with my boyfriend for a week now. I thought that I liked him when he asked me out  but now I'm not sure whether to dump him or not.He asked me out and I knew that my friend used to like him, so when I was sure that she didn't like him anymore I said yes. The only problem was i didn't feel comfortable with going out with a boy from my school, i didn't tell my friends, and I didn't tell my parents. Then I got text from his friend asking when I was going to kiss my bf and if I was going to 'shag' him. I was shocked as I didn't want to believe that he just wanted me for my body and sex. So I mostly ignored him at school as I wasn't very comfortable around him especially with his friends always watching. To make things worst, everyone at school seemed to find out that he was my boyfriend and then I overheard some of his friends saying to him 'If u do this girl then that will be good' I was horrified as had I heard of him and his friend's reputation for partying and sleeping with girls but he seemed like a nice person despite this. I'm not the kind of girl to just sleep with a guy straight away and he said that he likes me but I can't help but think that he wants to go out with me for more than because 'He likes me'.      So should I dump him or not because I've only been out with him for a week and he is my 1st bf so i don't know if I'm making a big deal over nothing.

The other day we were in the intimacy when he starting giving oral sex. He out of the sudden stuck a finger into my private part and then stuck it in my mouth for me to suck it. Well I did, then he asked me if I would do a threesome with him and another girl. Well I din't want to kill the mood so I said yes. I said "who woluld the other person be" and he said " I don't know we need to find a person" Well then he said " would you do it with my girl?" and I said yes. Then he became all excited and saying " that way I could do you all the time and came immidiately.       Now my question is: Did he say that ( what he said and the offer) because it would excite me or what? I don't want to bring the subject but this only happen yesterday (01/30).One of his fantasies is to do it with two girls.       A man that give this type of offer "threesome" its a clue that he does not value me. Am I correct?
20090131111145AAZztaJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl advice needed. I'm always flirting and talking to this girl, but she's kind of reserved. Should I just?	Should I just wait until we're alone, and say something like, "I really want to kiss you right now." Or something like that. I know that sounds creepy, but she's never kissed anyone before, and she's really reserved. She's 17, and so am I. I almost feel like if I just "went for it" out of the blue she might sort of shut down (because she's really reserved). Anyway, advice?
