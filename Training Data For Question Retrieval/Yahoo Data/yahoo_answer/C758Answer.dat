5583cf5bb232e8b5f0a13f703c7621a7aa	Junk food is a slang word for foods with limited nutritional value. Every person has their own list of foods that they call junk foods. I would include foods that are high in salt, sugar, fat or calories and low nutrient content.<br>  <br>  Salted snack foods, candy, gum, most sweet desserts, fried fast food and carbonated beverages are some of the major junk foods. Generally, they offer little in terms of protein, vitamins or minerals and lots of calories from sugar or fat. The term "empty calories" reflects the lack of nutrients.<br>  <br>  Rather than taking a radical approach and banning all but the simplest foods, judge each food based on the list of ingredients and Nutrition Facts label found on packages. When reading the list of ingredients, look for sugar, fat or salt as one of the first three ingredients. If any of these are listed that high in the ingredients, you can probably consider that food to be too high in sugar, fat or salt.<br>  <br>  A look at the nutritional information on the label will list the number of calories per serving, grams of fat, sodium, cholesterol, fiber and sugar content. This nutritional information will make you more knowledgeable in selecting foods to reduce your nutritional health risk.<br>  <br>  Calorie content of 300 calories per serving or less is considered to be all right, except whole meals unless you are following a weight loss diet. Be cautious though as to how large a serving size is. If 4 ounces of yogurt is a serving size and you eat an eight-ounce container, you have doubled the calorie content. Sometimes, the package serving size is not how little you serve yourself!<br>  <br>  Now look at the number of grams of fat. For every five grams of fat in a serving of a food, you are eating the equivalent of one teaspoon of fat. So, if one serving of a food has 23 grams of fat in it, that serving has the equivalent of four and one-half teaspoons of fat. You should limit the fat content in foods you eat daily to 30% of your total calories. Don't try to lower your fat content to below 25%, since fat does play a vital role in carrying fat soluble vitamins and keeping you satisfied between meals.<br>  <br>  Sodium content per serving should be 2300 milligrams or less per day. Some foods, like ham and other cured meats do have very high sodium content per serving. Limit these foods rather than eliminate them.<br>  <br>  Cholesterol content should be 300 milligrams or less per day. It is easy to remember that 300 is the same as the number of calories per serving.<br>  <br>  Fiber content will be listed in grams of dietary fiber. This amount will vary from product to product, but don't necessarily shop for only the highest numbers you can find. Any amount of dietary fiber above two grams per serving is good. Foods with five grams of fiber or more are considered high fiber foods.<br>  <br>  Sugar content is usually listed on cold cereal packages. A rule of thumb to follow is four grams of sugar equals one teaspoon of sugar. Limit sugars amounts in cereals to four grams, but if the cereal has fruit in it, relax the sugar content to eight grams per serving. Fruits usually contain about 60% fructose and 40% sucrose. If you were to eliminate all sugar, you would be eliminating fruits, which are a valuable source of nutrients and soluble fiber.<br>  <br>  If you want to cut down on junk food, cut down your intake of salt, sugar, fat and refined foods. Choose your calories by the nutrient company they keep.<br>  <br>  gs|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	Good to taste but bad for health !!!!!|`|5c0ed2b911dccfd03f7638f8ea82f817aa	Junk food kills appetite, make most of the organs in the body work over time and make thees sick ( which you will not even notice ), expensive for treatment you may need to take..|`|5d1f081bd15e22e46f1adedf8638b5d7aa	demerits:<br>  1.damage to liver(excess secretion of bile acid)<br>  2.damage to stomach(undigestable)<br>  3.damage to whole body(loss of nutrients but increase of fat.)|`|7022cf09849a1a503d7f6a655008b8d5aa	Junk foods increase your calorie intake and too much of it can cause Obesity and Increased risk of Heart problems as well as Diabetes, High BP.Also many a times I have felt that some of the junk food is not very easily digestible and heavy on stomach.|`|JgbjGTpnaa	there r so many!!so better avoid eating them!!keep healthy!|`|7b53f49a178d0e339ad5bf4af3f42e0eaa	Demerits:<br>  1.Obesity-increase in weight.<br>  2.Increase in cholesterol levels - heart attack - death/paralysis.<br>  3.Indigestion-Stomach disorders|`|pmY2b19Gaa	The junk foods will make you obese.

It's the flavor that's important.    ADD: I asked  my wife and she said try a potato stick or an asparagus spear or a a celery stick or some sort of root veggie that can be shaped into a stick/bone. Might affect the flavor though.

The majority are Shia muslim, their food laws are more strict than Sunnis, a little closer to the rules Jews follow, no pork, no shellfish, no fish without fins and scales (ie no shark) no rabbit.

A similar restriction applies to alcoholic drinks.|`|udQvd953aa	I'm Iranian, and I eat and drink whatever I want (and yes, this includes pork!)

The dough gets fluffy on the inside and golden on the outside so its like a piece of pizza with the crust all over!|`|b691bb1ad02611fd2a2713211ea8bc98aa	i tink its some kind of pasta dish|`|OME1I8DRaa	Its wrapped up pizza u dip in sauce :-) its great|`|Sl3yYtPSaa	Stromboli, is essentially a thin, stuffed pizza. The Stromboli contains various fillings that are commonly used as toppings on pizza. The dough is the same as pizza dough. While it's similar to a calzone, a stromboli is usually only filled with mozzarella cheese, as opposed to a calzone which contains riccotta and other cheeses. Calzones also have a sauce (usually marinara) which strombolis generally lack.
VWwdWI8uaa	When you are grilling, turn on the grill for a few minutes (with the cover down) and let it heat up.  This will allow you to scrub off any remaining food from a previous grilling and allows the BBQ to get hot enough to sear anything you want to grill.  Then, once you have your food on the grill, turn the heat down.<br>  <br>  Another tip is to move the meat over to one side after it has been seared.  Make sure the burner under the meat is turned off, and the burner on the other side stays on med or high. Then close the lid and finish cooking.  By searing it first, you lock in the juices and get the good BBQ flavor, but removing it from direct heat helps keep meat from overcooking and getting too dry.<br>  <br>  Lastly, make sure you put your grill over an area you don't mind getting greasy and dirty, as food grease and marinade will spill down and drip out of the bottom.  There is usually a drip pan to catch some of this, but not always.|`|AA11015643	There are many tips for the first time user...such as using gas briquettes (Looks like lava rocks) and letting it run for a good 20-30 minutes that'll break your grill in a little bit.  Then there is the cooking...its always best to preheat your grill and get an external thermometer to keep your temps. just right.  My theme for this year is indirect grilling...that is leaving one side of the grill on then putting your steaks or chicken or whatever  you may be grilling on the side that is not on and covering it and leaving it alone to cook (this is where the thermometer is useful) maintaining a temp of about 200-270 degrees F.  But the key is to leave it covered until cooked, you'll be tempted to check your food but at those temps three Ribeyes would cook to a Meduim or so in just about an hour give or take a few minutes.  Enjoy your Grill!

Una vez limpios los colocamos en una perola, con el vino blanco, el laurel y un poco de sal. Calentamos hasta que se habran (unos 10 minutos). Los sacamos, los escurrimos, quitamos las partes de las conchas que no contienen carne y los colocamos en una cazuela de barro. <br>  <br>  En una perola a parte ponemos aceite a calentar. Cuando esté humeante echamos los ajos laminados y las cayenas partidas, esperamos a que estén dorados (sin llegar a tostarse) y a?adimos la cebolla y el pimiento verde cortados muy finos, bajamos el fuego y pochamos el conjunto hasta que esté tierno. A continuación a?adimos los tomates pelados, despepitados y rallados. <br>  <br>  A?adimos sal y media cucharada de azúcar y seguimos cocinando hasta que el tomate haya soltado todo su agua y se haya oscurecido. En ese momento vertemos la salsa sobre los mejillones y dejamos cocer 5 minutos más. Se sirve muy caliente y en compa?ía de un buen vino de aguja. Buen provecho ;) <br>  <br>  Nota: si vemos que la salsa queda muy espesa, podemos aclararla con un poco de caldo de cocción de los mejillones|`|ebdb61d2d2996a2bc28501e7fd1125bbaa	No la probaria, porque soy vegetariana.. al parecer te equivocaste de seccion.

t4jpYJVkaa	Nori sheets (seaweed sheets) can be found in most Asian sections of your local store, or try an Asian market if not. - Be sure to pick up some rice and wasabi while you're at it! You can really fill rolls with whatever you like - just make sure to have everything super fresh...think avocado's, cucumbers, steamed asparagus, green onions, crab or imitation crab meat...those all work great together or just a combo of one or two.<br>  Here are some great links to look at that will help with how to make the rice (the rice is very important) and creating your rolls ...<br>  <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_make_sushi" rel="nofollow">http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_make_sushi</a><br>  <a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/Appetizers/CaliforniaRoll.htm" rel="nofollow">http://whatscookingamerica.net/Appetizer...</a><br>  Those will get you going! Have fun!|`|d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	most asian grocery stores will have nori sheets, even if they are not a purely Japanese store.<br>  <br>  The MOST important thing is the rice. Get short grain rice....check if there is a special one for sushi. This is very important as you need it to stick together.<br>  <br>  First wash the rice. Put your rice in the saucepan and put some water in and sort of knead it with your hand. The water will become cloudy. Tip out that water and get freah water and repeat. You are supposed to keep doing that until the water runs clear (I am lazy and only wash it a couple of times...and mine turns out okay). You can use that water on the plants if you like.....it`s really good for them.<br>  <br>  Then you steam NOT boil the rice. Put a small amount of water in the saucepan (about a finger or so above the level of the rice) Bring it to the boil and IMMEDIATELY  put the lid on and turn it down as low as it will go. Cook for 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  Once the rice is cooked turn the heat off and fluff the rice with a wooden spoon or similar. Leave for 20 minutes or so (if you have time...I never do!).<br>  <br>  Finally add vinegar. The best winegar is rice wine vinegar (available next to the nori sheets in the asian grocery )....although you could you use another white vinegar.<br>  Add a little at a time until it gets a slight vinegary flavour ( but doesn`t become too wet).<br>  <br>  You can roll the sushi yourself (get yourself a little bamboo mat to help you) or you could try  te-maki sushi (just put a number of fillings in the centre of the table with sushi rice and nori sheets and everyone makes their own....hint- roll them in a cone shape like a cone of peanuts.|`|y4ZFaURXaa	lions market...duh! and as for amking it youll need one of thoughs bamboo things and alota rice   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  try makin onigiri for people who dont like fish|`|7JpPe3uCaa	japanese grocery stores have nori (seaweed).  and to make it easier, they have bottled sushi vinegar mix that is pretty decent.  (even my mom uses them, and she is a first generation!)  just make sure that you toss the rice after it has been steamed before adding the vinegar mix - and don't add too much.

cDTZ9RgSaa	In order to "blacken" something you need to start with a good spice blend called a rub, or Cajun Seasoning. Most people that use my products tell me that they loaded their chicken or fish with my blacken, then put it in a scorching hot fry pan. The outside gets burnt, and the inside is raw. You'll find that chef's who blacken this way, get the pan hot, set the chicken in it, flip it fairly quick so that it blackens without burning to a crisp, then place the pan in an oven to finish it off.<br>  <br>  I usually suggest that people cook over a lower heat. This way the spices will still turn black, and the insides will be done. <br>  <br>  If you'd like some other ideas on blacken, I've got a bunch of recipes at <a href="http://www.capnrons.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.capnrons.com/index.html</a>|`|CnBMe52naa	Blackened Chicken <br>  <br>  1/2 teaspoon paprika <br>  1/8 teaspoon salt <br>  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper <br>  1/4 teaspoon ground cumin <br>  1/4 teaspoon dried thyme <br>  1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper <br>  1/8 teaspoon onion powder <br>  2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves <br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat for 5 minutes until it is smoking hot. <br>  Mix together the paprika, salt, cayenne, cumin, thyme, white pepper, and onion powder. Oil the chicken breasts with cooking spray on both sides, then coat the chicken breasts evenly with the spice mixture. <br>  Place the chicken in the hot pan, and cook for 1 minute. Turn, and cook 1 minute on other side. Place the breasts on the prepared baking sheet. <br>  Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. <br>  |`|f6dxZXPGaa	BLACKENED CHICKEN SALAD<br>  <br>  6-7 oz. chicken breast (boneless and skinless)<br>  1 head Boston lettuce<br>  1 head spinach<br>  1 roasted pepper (strips)<br>  4 oz.

Take all the wire racks out of your oven now. Check the S hooks to see if they work. Find a pan that will fit the bottom of your oven.

Test for doneness by slicing a piece. No Red, a little pink ok. While cooking add a little water to pan juices if they threaten to dry up on you. Not too much.

JOpX2Znmaa	I'm afraid that all of these good folks are right about your protein intake.  Let's take a look.  You say you're going to have some nuts with dinner; for the sake of argument, let's say you're having almonds, which are a very healthful nut.    1 serving of almonds - 1/4 cup - has about 7.5 grams of protein.  You can find this information here:  http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname...    However, while people's needs obviously vary a lot from person to person, most adults need at least 40 grams of protein a day; usually more, and depending on size and activity level.  Here's one website I found that seems pretty legit that will give you an idea of how many grams of protein you need a day.  I weigh 105 pounds and get moderate exercise; this website told me I need about 37 grams of protein per day.  http://nutrition.arizona.edu/new/files/0...    However, if you were going to get your protein from almonds alone, you would need about 5 servings for just 37 grams of protein - and that would amount to 1000 calories and 90 grams of fat, which is way more fat than you want to eat in one day!    My point is, in essence, that to eat healthfully, you need protein from sources other than nuts and seeds.  Would you consider adding beans to your diet?  I know they're not quite raw, but they're an excellent source of protein, low in fat, and they really fill you up.  You can still get the benefits of a mostly raw diet if you incorporate beans and maybe even some grains like rice into your diet.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Calorically, yes, that's a light but adequate day.    Nutritionally, not good. You haven't had any carbs except what's in the banana and the apple, and no protein at all. Protein doesn't have to be animal. Your body needs it, and if you don't give it any, it quite literally 'eats' your muscle mass to get what it needs to function.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	You really need some protein in there - how about some nuts?|`|UUagVWgraa	Yes, but I would as everyone said before, add protein. Try eating more almonds, any other nuts and seeds, and beans.   Edit: Yeppers.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	You need some veggies in there and some nuts.  You can make a salad with lettuce, bell peppers tomatoes, celery, carrots, other veggies, and find a recipe for a raw dressing.  Throw a few nuts on for protein.    Check out www.fromsadtoraw.com for recipe ideas.    I also am not sure if you're getting enough calories.|`|9c0JAYP9aa	If your goal is hunger and malnutrition, you are doing great!
NFZH7zd6aa	yes. my favorite meal is so simple: i put as many green beans as i like in the crock pot (normally equivalent to 3 cans), cut up a head of cabbage and put it in with the beans, cut up a few red potatoes and add to cooker, then put bacon on top of everything, salt and pepper, and about 3 tablespoons of butter. oh and i almost forgot, add water until its about 1/4 full in the crock pot. on high i cook it for about 4-6 hours and on low 8 or so hours.|`|fysEkCIUaa	Yes you can slow cook green beans with a bit of water to cover them, season as you wish.<br>  <br>  I like to cook fresh green beans by, washing them and cutting them first.<br>  Melt a bit of butter in a hot skillet and saute them till done to your likenss.  Season with sea salt and fresh black pepper,  |`|AA10820540	yeah, but why??? They won't be crisp and yummy, they will be mushy and the point of getting fresh ones is lost. The best way to do it is to do them in a pan on slow with a little water, butter, salt and pepper. I am also a sucker for crispy green beans with soy sauce. Just barely steemed. Not mushy.|`|bByy9iqeaa	yes , you can. along with enough water to cover the green beans ,add onion (diced) ,bacon,and small red potatoes. it's delicious |`|0RuNbOGlaa	  Yep, you can also cook a road kill possum in a slow cooker, but why ruin good fresh green beans by making them soggy and mushy?<br>    Good crisp fresh green beans are best cooked just until a little tender, with a little snap left in them for maximum flavor.  In fact, any fresh vegetable is best just cooked until a little tender.<br>    We prefer most veggies steamed a little, but that's just our preference, and may not suit all tastes.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Yes, I have many times.  I just clean then as I would to cook on the stovetop.  I add a ham hock or two, salt, pepper & garlic to taste, then cover with a 50/50 mixture of chicken broth & water (I have used all water as well).  Sometimes & add some halved red potatoes.  
e2c41707eaac6501e5cbfc25665d75b6aa	read the ingredients. The chemicals in diet soda are not fit for human consumption. People who drink diet soda are too lazy to give up soda, so they try a calorie free alternative. The body has NO need for diet soda, there is NO nutritional value in it, so there is no real reason to drink it. <br>  <br>  Drinking carbonated soft drinks regularly can contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel surfaces. <br>  <br>  Soft drinks, which contain sticky sugars that break down into acids, adhere easily to tooth surfaces. <br>  <br>  These acids can soften tooth substance and promote formation of plaque, which erodes the enamel. <br>  <br>  Enamel breakdown leads to cavities. <br>  <br>  If erosion spreads beneath the enamel into the dentin, pain and sensitivity may result <br>  <br>  Which may result in root canal surgery. <br>  <br>  Because saliva helps neutralize acids and wash your teeth clean, the worst time to drink soda pop, ironically, is when you are very thirsty or dehydrated due to low levels of saliva. <br>  <br>  The larger the volume of intake, the more impact pop has on your teeth <br>  <br>  "Diet sodas are part of the problem. Women especially like to drink them throughout the day and between meals because they have no calories, yet the higher frequency and volume is putting their teeth at risk." <br>  |`|ylJoUuMDaa	Not bad but not good either.  Drinking soda in moderation is alright.|`|0b508e8a46ceb076d498c94707fa4b1aaa	Yes. Diet soda has been known to cause seizures. Look at the ingredients.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Soda - diet or otherwise - is bad for everyone, not just children.  The thing to remember with diet sodas is the chemicals used to make articificial sugar are just not good for children at all.  <br>  <br>  We did an "experiment" at my child's preschool.  Using both regular & diet cola, we put some in a sealed jar with a nail.  Both types ate right through the nail.  Can you imagine what it's doing to your stomach?|`|AAgX0SDcaa	the chemicals in diet sodas can clog your liver, don't think any of them are good, caffeine is not so good for kids either. Kids should drink more water and keep a healthy appetite for fruits and other foods that have something nourishing in them.|`|8570ccb497e3dbcebec056c26ed6ddddaa	Yes soda is always bad for health |`|m9QsDnwSaa	my opinion is  in moderation, and I wouldn't do diet soda.|`|uT1JCBm2aa	Yes! Diet soda is more harmful than regular soda and they both will mess your teeth up no matter what age!|`|l1Z4Bd48aa	No, it's better that just regular soda|`|AA11199670	soda is bad, diet or otherwise, old or young.|`|r6Va51b6aa	From my ***?<br>  No.

You just have to add the color.  <br>  <br>  For the shapes - those cakes are separately sculpted with a knife to give each layer a tilted appearance.  You should insert dowels into each layer to help with the weight as all.  <br>  <br>  Basically, each layer is shaped, then covered in what is called a crumb coat - buttercream frosting smoothed out so no crumbs show thru the finished cake.  The cakes are chilled until set.  Next, cover in rolled fondant and decorate each layer.  Then you stack them.  |`|16i8jJ2daa	I've never worked with it before but it is fondant.

The thing about doing that is that you don't really know what they're made of. I'll betcha they are full of trans fats and other crap, things that you aren't taking into consideration when you are making food at home. Why don't you just pick up a bag of those frozen (Tyson or other) chicken nugget things? Or better yet, when you DO feel like cooking, fry up some boneless chicken breast pieces and freeze them to use later on in the week. I guess if you don't care about those things they would be perfect for last minute meals.|`|hECIHlkLaa	yeah you can. I've done it, they taste just fine.

It seems like a big waste to me. It wouldn't take 5 minutes either of those ways too, more like 30 seconds-2 minutes depending on which method you used. You can put anything in any quesadilla. It's spelled with an a, not a second e. I don't even have to use butter or anything even in the skillet. I don't know what other people do wrong, but it's really not hard or messy.
KtdlJbrOaa	No brown sugar in mine - just salt, pepper, garlic, and a bay leaf.  Sometimes I add some red pepper flake.  Some people like it served over fried potatoes, but that is too heavy for me.

Over, low heat, & in the same pan you cooked the hamburger in, stir in 2 tablespoons of flour & mix over low heat to make a roux.  Add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Cook for a couple of minutes to take the flour taste out.  Remove from heat & whisk in 2 cups of milk.  Once combined, cook over medium heat until thickened.

AA12088121	You can ruin it..LOL..not everything is foreman grill compatible,with my vast experience in this area i suggest if u do it this way youl have flat dry shrimp..but enjoy!!!!|`|7f3cef37ab2b47a02c9872d69c0c1b8aaa	Try marinating it with the shell on using a bottled teriyake sauce. Thread on wooden skewers that have been soaked in water for 30 mins. (so they don't burn) then grill for only a few minutes. Shrimp cook very quickly when grilled, especially when receiving heat from both sides at once. Leaving the shell on will help to keep the shrimp from drying out.|`|cf924ead84144eee7197b7aaba83beacaa	Yep, just skewer it with some veggies like onions, mushrooms, squash.  Marinate then cook on the Foreman grill.  We have a small grill, do 2 at at time, put the other 2 on while we're eating and cook it right at the table.  So good and soooooooo easy.<br>  Whatever marinade you want to use, Italian dressing or herb and garlic olive oil always work well.  Using the veggies helps keep it moist and keeps it from "frying" while the other stuff is cooking.<br>  Quite tasty.

Place in a 375 oven and cook about  10-12 minutes per pound.  Let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.<br>  <br>  If it's a pork roast, more round in shape, just salt and pepper & put it in a roasting pan, surround with veggies of your choice, add about 1/4 cup water and roast on 350 for about 15 mins. a pound, probably close to an hour for the veggies at least.<br>  <br>  The previous recipe looks like a good one!<br>  <br>  Enjoy.

n8ry3Tnbaa	CHIPS! Favourite meal!|`|e2c41707eaac6501e5cbfc25665d75b6aa	Macaroni is one of the most popular side dishes in America, for both every day meals and special occasions. There are several different ways to prepare macaroni and cheese, most of which use yellow cheddar or American cheese. <br>  <br>  The first thing you'll notice about this unique macaroni and cheese recipe is that it looks and tastes completely different from traditional casseroles. For starters, it's white instead of yellow. That's because this recipe uses a combination of Swiss cheese and parmesan cheese. It's a unique twist on an old favorite that you and your family are sure to love. <br>  <br>  Macaroni with Swiss and Parmesan Cheese Recipe<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  12 ounces of elbow macaroni<br>  1/2 cup butter<br>  1/2 cup half and half<br>  1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese<br>  1/3 cup shredded Swiss cheese<br>  1/2 teaspoon salt<br>  1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>  Paprika to taste<br>  Directions:<br>  <br>  Prepare the elbow macaroni according to package directions, being careful not to overcook the pasta. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the half and half and heat, but do not allow the mixture to boil. <br>  <br>  Pour the sauce into a 10 X 13 casserole dish. Add the cooked macaroni, Swiss cheese, parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Mix gently until everything is well combined. Sprinkle paprika on the top of the casserole. Bake for 30 minutes, or until heated through. <br>  <br>  Recipe Variation: If desired, sprinkle additional Swiss and parmesan cheese on the top of the casserole before baking. <br>  <br>  Serving Suggestion: This recipe is a perfect accompaniment for ham, fried chicken, meatloaf, and any other recipe that tastes great with a traditional macaroni and cheese recipe. <br>  <br>  Take this tasty dish to the next potluck dinner or family get together you attend, and your contribution will be the talk of the event. The guests might look at the concoction a little bit suspiciously at the beginning of the meal, but they'll be asking you for your secret recipe before dessert is served!<br>  |`|wff1Nc60aa	fruit, with a nice french bread.|`|AA11015885	more assorted cheeses, a variety of fresh fruit, pate, assorted crackers, crusty french bread and a good bottle of wine with some good friends at sunset.|`|7zG9ZScCaa	carrots. its damn good!

KtdlJbrOaa	They have used rolled fondant to decorate that cake.  They probably started out by sculpting the cake to the desired shape, then doing a butter cream crumb coating.  Once the crumb coat is set, they covered with fondant.  There are recipes online to make it, or you can get it ready made at the store (try a cake decorating specialty store, but I have even bought fondant at wal-mart).  There are directions on the container for how to use the fondant.  It comes in white, but you can use food coloring, or special cake decorating colors.  |`|KGRikkJeaa	the "icing" is called Fondant.

KtdlJbrOaa	It's hard to say because you don't know how much each chop really absorbed.  Or was there any carmelization that turned the marinade to a sugar product during the cooking process.

KtdlJbrOaa	Blueberry Cheesecake<br>  <br>  <br>  Butter, for greasing pan <br>  <br>  For the Crust: <br>  2 1/2 cups shortbread cookie crumbs <br>  1 tbsp. granulated sugar <br>  2 1/2 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted <br>  <br>  For the Filling: <br>  5 ( 8oz.) packages (40 oz. total) cream cheese, at room temperature <br>  2 cups granulated sugar <br>  5 large eggs <br>  1/4 tsp. almond extract <br>  1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract <br>  3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries, (if frozen, drain) <br>  Confectioners' sugar, for dusting top of cheesecake <br>  <br>  You will need: <br>  An 11-inch springform pan. (it is best to wrap aluminum foil around the outside. This helps prevent the edges of the cake from cooking too quickly. Because the foil’s shiny surface reflects the heat, the cheesecake will cook more evenly.)<br>  <br>  Position a rack in the center of oven and preheat to 325°F (160°C). Lightly butter an 11-inch springform pan. Cover the outside of pan with aluminum foil, shiny side out. <br>  <br>  For the Crust: <br>  In a medium size bowl, stir together the cookie crumbs, the 1 tbsp. sugar and the butter until well blended. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and 1/2-inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Refrigerate until ready to use. <br>  <br>  For the Filling: <br>  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat all of the cream cheese on high speed until smooth and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, gradually add the 2 cups sugar and continue beating, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl, until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl, until the mixture is smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the almond and vanilla extracts; mix well. <br>  <br>  Pour the filling into the prepared pan, spreading the mixture evenly to the edges. Scatter 1 cup of the blueberries over the top and bake until the filling is just set (it will still be a little loose in the center), about 1 hour and 20 minutes. <br>  <br>  Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool the cheesecake to room temperature, at least 1 hour. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours, before serving. <br>  <br>  To serve, unmold the cheesecake and set it on a cake stand or cake plate. Garnish with the remaining 2 cups blueberries and dust with confectioners' sugar. <br>  <br>  Tip: <br>  Cheesecake is best chilled overnight. It becomes firmer the longer it is left to chill in the refrigerator. <br>   <br>  |`|AA12198711	No-Bake Blueberry Cheesecake with Graham Cracker Crust<br>  <br>  Bon Appétit<br>  <br>  Crust:<br>  <br>      * 9 whole graham crackers<br>      * 1/2 cup old-fashioned oats<br>      * 3 tablespoons (packed) golden brown sugar<br>      * 1/8 teaspoon salt<br>      * 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br>      * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>  <br>  Filling:<br>  <br>      * 1/4 cup water<br>      * 1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin (measured from 2 envelopes)<br>      * 12 ounces Philadelphia-brand cream cheese, room temperature<br>      * 1 cup heavy whipping cream<br>      * 1 cup sugar<br>      * 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br>      * 3 cups fresh blueberries<br>  <br>  Topping:<br>  <br>      * 1 cup chilled heavy whipping cream<br>      * 1 tablespoon sugar<br>      * 4 1/2-pint baskets blueberries<br>      * 2/3 cup blueberry jam<br>  <br>  For crust:<br>  Preheat oven to 350°F.

Press the mixture onto the bottom, and half way up the side of a 10 inch springform pan.<br>  <br>   Make the filling: In a metal bowl over a pan of barely simmering water, melt the white chocolate, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs and the egg yolks, one at a time. Beat in the flour and the vanilla and blend in the melted white chocolate slowly, beating until the filling is well combined. Pour filling into crust.<br>  <br>   Bake in the middle of preheated oven for 1 hour. Then turn off the heat, and crack the oven door an inch, letting the cheesecake cool in the oven to room temperature. Cover loosely and refrigerate overnight before removing from pan.<br>  <br>  Make the topping: In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup sugar and cornstarch. Stir in water and blueberries.

When a raw turkey is stuffed, the bacteria from the turkey may be transferred to the stuffing. Because the stuffing is located inside the turkey, extra cooking time is required for the stuffing to reach the appropriate temperature which is 165° F to kill harmful bacteria.

People jealously hoarded whatever food they could find, hiding it even from their friends and neighbors. One day a peddlar drove his wagon into a village, sold a few of his wares, and began asking questions as if he planned to stay for the night. <br>  "There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "Better keep moving on." <br>  <br>  "Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of making some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron cauldron from his wagon, filled it with water, and built a fire under it. Then, with great ceremony, he drew and ordinary looking stone from a velvet bag and dropped it into the water. <br>  <br>  By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come to the square or watched from their windows. As the peddler sniffed the "broth" and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their skepticism. <br>  <br>  "Ahhh," the peddler said to himself rather loudly. "I do like a tasty stone soup. Of course, stone soup with cabbage, that's hard to beat." <br>  <br>  A villager approached hesitantly, looked around, and pulled a small cabbage from under his coat. When he discreetly added it to the pot, the peddler beamed. "Excellent," he cried, "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a little morsel of salt pork, and it was fit for a king." <br>  <br>  Then it was the village butcher who approached. He had a little piece of salt pork under his apron. And so it went, some potatoes, some onions. Carrots, mushrooms, and so under. Until there finally was, indeed, a delicious meal for all. The villagers offered the peddler a great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell and traveled on the next day. And from that time on, long after the famine had ended, the villagers reminisced about the finest soup they'd ever had. <br>  |`|gpBxdpa7aa	Find some stones in your garden put them into a pan of hot water add a vegetable oxo cube leave to simmer for a while and voila! <br>  Stone Soup!<br>  x|`|3BSEJuQ7aa	3 large handfuls of ballast - add 2 pints of boiling water simmer gently for 20 minuites and serve|`|ZyJZ2qPnaa	soup + stone<br>  simmer for 10 minutes.|`|esRI2Dooaa	Put some stones in a blender.

Dip each slice of squash in batter and fry in frying pan until brown turning and brown both sides. Serve hot. <br>  <br>  You can check out other recipes for fried squash on the link below<br>  |`|UtoFQHyhaa	I mix together corn meal, flour, salt, and just a little pepper. Fry them in oil until they are brown and crispy. They are one of my favorite things to eat. I dry them on paper towels to remove some of the oil. If you want, you can add a little lemon pepper to the batter. If not, you can omit the pepper or lemon pepper and sprinkle a little sugar on them while they are still hot. It will melt and give them a nice flavor.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	I have fried zucchini and butternut squash.  I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, a little nutmeg, and parmesan cheese.  Both came out great.  Remember to either cut the butternut in small pieces, or cook to soften for a few minutes in the microwave to ensure even cooking.  |`|DkAY3oNbaa	All of the recipes you have received are good.  But the easiiest thing I have come up with is to salt and pepper it and then roll it in egg and then packaged corn bread mix.  Pick your favorite one.  Some people like the Jiffy mix because it is sweet. <br>  <br>  Anyway, using the corn bread mix eliminates the need to use cornmeal and flour in the coating.  It is very crispy because there is a little rising agent in the mix.|`|hT8vbWiDaa	I batter small pieces of squash when I fry it. I've never fried it outright (w/o a batter). |`|KWhKwgsSaa	I have tried fried summer squash.  It is very good.  I season the sliced squash with salt and pepper, dip in milk, roll in cornmeal and flour mixed, then fry in hot oil until golden and crispy on both sides.  Then, I sprinkle with kosher salt.
iRKOJhYeaa	Haloween was never really celebrated here in the UK like it was in America, but in recent years, the kids have picked up on it and started trick or treating. I would be most delighted to answer the door to a few kids in a imaginative, creative costume and give them a handful of sweets or chocolates. But, no. A lot of them dont bother dressing up, and they dont want sweets, they want money. And to me, that is begging from door to door.

Add 4 quarts of water and in water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer the chicken until it is tender and the thigh juices run clear, about 40 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and, when it is cool enough to handle, remove the skin and separate the meat from the bones. Return the chicken meat to the pot. Keep warm over low heat. <br>  <br>  To prepare the dumplings: Mix the flour with the salt and mound together in a mixing bowl. Beginning at the center of the mound, drizzle a small amount of ice water over the flour. Using your fingers, and moving from the center to the sides of the bowl, gradually incorporate about 3/4 cup of ice water. Knead the dough and form it into ball. <br>  <br>  Dust a good amount of flour onto a clean work surface. Roll out the dough (it will be firm), working from center to 1/8-inch thick. Let the dough relax for several minutes. <br>  <br>  Add the cream of celery soup to the pot with the chicken and simmer gently over medium-low heat. <br>  <br>  Cut the dough into 1-inch pieces. Pull a piece in half and drop the halves into the simmering soup. Repeat. Do not stir the chicken once the dumplings have been added. Gently move the pot in a circular motion so the dumplings become submerged and cook evenly. Cook until the dumplings float and are no longer doughy, 3 to 4 minutes. <br>  <br>  To serve, ladle chicken, gravy, and dumplings into warm bowls. <br>  <br>  Cook's Note: If the chicken stew is too thin it can be thickened before the dumplings are added.

KtdlJbrOaa	These look complicated - but really they are not.  These are real French truffles too...<br>  <br>  20 ounces semisweet chocolate, cut into small pieces (or semisweet chocolate chips) <br>  2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened <br>  1 cup heavy cream <br>  <br>  MAKE THE FILLING: Place 8 ounces of the chocolate pieces and the butter in a large bowl. In a small saucepan over low heat, bring the cream to a simmer. Remove from heat and pour half the cream into the bowl.<br>  As the chocolate melts, slowly whisk the mixture together until smooth. Then gradually add the remaining cream until it's completely incorporated and the ganache is thick and shiny.<br>  FORM THE TRUFFLES: Pour the ganache into a 2-inch-deep baking pan, spread evenly, and place in the freezer for 30 minutes or until set (it should have the consistency of fudge). Using a melon baller or a small spoon, form rounds and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment or wax paper. Let the truffles harden in the freezer for about 15 minutes. After removing from the freezer, roll truffles between your hands into marble-size spheres, squeezing slightly (try to do this quickly, otherwise they'll become too soft). You can now dust the truffles with cocoa and serve them as is, but they'll hold their shape better if you coat them with chocolate first.<br>  MAKE THE COATING: Let the truffles rest in the freezer while you make the chocolate glaze. Place the remaining chocolate pieces in a large bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and stir occasionally, until the chocolate is completely melted. Remove from heat and let cool at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate starts to set at the edge of the bowl. Drop the truffles into the melted chocolate and retrieve them with a fork, allowing any excess chocolate to drip off. Garnish immediately or leave the truffles plain and proceed to step 5.<br>  GARNISH: For a nut garnish, roll the freshly coated truffles in a shallow dish of chopped nuts. For a sugar or cocoa garnish, set the freshly coated truffles on a plate and sift the garnish over them. Turn the truffles and sift again to cover completely.<br>  STORAGE: Place the truffles on the lined baking sheet and allow them to set in the refrigerator for 5 minutes. Truffles will keep for about 2 weeks, chilled or at room temperature, when stored in a tightly sealed container.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yield: Makes 35 to 45 truffles <br>  |`|AA11689643	I make the oreo ones because they're easiest.

KtdlJbrOaa	While real mashed potatoes will definitely taste much better, sometimes the time constraints of life just don't allow us to do that.  You can mix the 2 together - just make sure you have a higher ratio of real potatoes to instant.  You may want to jack up the flavor of the instant potatoes by substituting chicken broth for some of the liquid.  You can also use heavy cream in place of milk.  |`|vcgn6XZgaa	Do it all from scratch - it will taste much better!

The instant ones are terrible, and it would make the work of peeling and boiling the real ones a waste of time.  The refrigerated tubs of mashed potatoes are alot better than instant (they're real potatoes), but you'd need quite a few of those for that many people.  Just do the real potatoes, but do them the day ahead.  Make up the mashed potatoes and add softened cream cheese (or Rondele cheese with herbs), in addition to lots of butter and refrigerated.  Then dot with more butter and reheat the next day......|`|6QJe4Mlyaa	Use all "real" potatoes.  I have never found an instant that is as good as the real thing.

IbOL868caa	Make 2 or three rectangle sheet cakes...like 9X12 or something of that measurement and once cooled all the way, stack them on top of each other and have the size and shape of the beer mug already drawn out on a sheet of paper and lay over it and kinda cut the shape of it first, like tracing. Then you can carve the cake to be rounded, might take some time but I watch 'Ace of Cakes' all the time and they have little knives and that's how they make them.<br>  I would make the mug first then if you have decent sized left over cake pieces from you tracing and carving then mold those into a handle if you can, or you can make a fake one (like in the pic it looks like) with icing later. I would make the indention's of the mug with the icing, cover it with the dark yellow first then go back over with extra icing and get a big spoon and start at the top and bring it down over the icing to make those indention's...then make you handle with a fat icing topper, and get whip cream and put in a icing back or the can would work and make the foam on top.

GL and have fun!|`|f78e049a0a721f2547dc02fbb6ae7403aa	You could probably use a Betty Crocker cake mix, bake it as a sheet cake, then shape it by cutting the corners and making it into an oval.  I'd say just get a white frosting from the grocery store, color it with food coloring - a little yellow with a dash of red for that orange-ish color, then keep it white for the froth.  If you don't have something to frost it, you could put the icing into a sandwich bag and cut the tip out.  The bigger you cut, the more comes out.  That might be a good way to make the handle.  If you cut the edge of the bag really small, you can write words with it.  Looks cool!|`|CnHYgd7baa	You will need lots of buttercream or any other thick frosting that will long it's shape on the cake. you'll also need a few ziploc bags that will serve as piping bags. in addition you'll need a big round piping tip to make the yellow lines on the cake. you should pipe the handle on parchment paper and let it set or harden up and then put it in place on the cake plate. hope this helps you.

You can even make one in a big (empty) coffee can and have a beer mug that would stand up!   Otherwise, you could do a large loaf pan, or 9x13" pan (cut it in half and layer, when it's cooled).  If you chill the cake, you can easily "carve" it with a small, serrated knife.  If you really layer on the frosting, you can do the indentations with your finger or the back of a small spoon.....|`|KtdlJbrOaa	I would suggest using a sheet cake & then cutting into pieces to make the half mug shape. Just stick them together with frosting.  You could then carve out the indentations in the cake - or just do it with the frosting.

When the cheese in the center is melted, and the cheese around the edges is a little brown it should be done.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Usually the pizza will tell you what temp. to cook it at.  So put the oven on bake up to that temperature.  Put it on a flat pan so the crust doesn't burn or if there's like a cardboard "tray" use that.  It's made to be heatproof.  Cook it for the time indicated but if there's no instructions cook it on 425 degrees for about 15 minutes.  <br>  Keep an eye on it and pop any bubbles forming in the crust.<br>  Take it out when it's hot and the crust is slightly brown and the cheese melts.<br>  If you want to use a microwave, if it's a microwaveable pizza, put on a pan (nonmetal) that will fit in the microwave and set it on high.  Just keep an eye on it since cooking times vary with different microwaves.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Sometimes there's a button that says PIZZA on it on some microwaves too.|`|8oAlBL91aa	The box has heating directions.

fysEkCIUaa	Usually if a recipe calls for unsalted butter it will state unsalted.  I would guess this recipe is for salted butter.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I don't think it matters for cooking, as long as it's not whipped butter (or in a tub).  It DOES matter for baking though - you only use UNsalted for baking (the salt may burn the cake/cookies and there's usually salt in self-rising flour, so it would be too salty)|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	When reading a recipe for butter the recipe will state if you need to use salted butter or unsalted. BUT in this case you can use either one. If you have unsalted butter you can use it and adjust the salt later in te recipe to taste.<br>  But when baking, for instance I use a recipe for cookies that specifically calls for "unsalted" butter and this is due to the fact that the taste is totally different with salt.<br>  Good luck and good question!|`|CnBMe52naa	Whichever kind you have on hand would be fine for this recipe. It really only make a difference when you are baking as the salt could cause issues with leavening. In cooking a savory dish, it really doesn't matter.|`|45N6tmWraa	In this case, it won't make a difference.  You will have plenty of salt because of the Parmesan, and a little more or less in the butter won't matter.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Unsalted.  Chances are you are adding salt at another point in the recipe, and parmesan cheese is salty as well - you don't need the extra sodium in your finished dish.|`|CnutrvBraa	Either would be fine. Pasta will need some salt anyway. If I had unsalted in my fridge, I would use it and just add some salt to the dish, but I would pick salted if I had to choose.|`|8Bm3yiFraa	Alfredo is made with Parmesan which is naturally salty.... you may want to stick with unsalted, but it really is a taste preference.  If  salted is what you have on hand, I wouldn't add any more salt to the alfredo,  no matter how tempted you might be.  I typically cook my pasta with a good amount of salt, so I think I'd be extra careful not to over-salt the pasta water.  |`|e4xbicjvaa	When it is not specified use salted butter.  That is the most common kind available.  If it made a difference in the recipe then it would have said unsalted.  I suspect if you wanted to lower the salt in the dish you could use unsalted and have it come out just as well.|`|HjFZUaQQaa	It is probably unsalted...I don't think it really matters if you really needed salted butter it would say. If you give the recipe I could tell you weather or not it is...it depends on the other ingredients. |`|74q3AtJXaa	Actually, it doesn't matter when you're cooking--use any kind of butter you want to!  :-)  Only in baking, does the difference matter.|`|yDcOUP3saa	dont matter i use regular butter for everything i cook/bake and it comes out just fine..|`|voJ8XzuEaa	Use whatever you have in the fridge.

8bh0IGwJaa	If I were you, this is what I would do:<br>  <br>  Fork poke the steak about 25 times then marinate in Worchester, some cayenne, salt&pepper.  Let marinate for about 2 hours.<br>  <br>  Dice the potatoes, slice the onions, and cut up the asparagus, and cut the tomatoes into large wedges.  Toss all of them in some canola or vegetable oil, a little cayenne, salt, pepper, and dried herbs (oregano, basil, parsley, etc.).<br>  Lay them out on a roasting pan and roast in a hot oven (400) for about 30 mins.  In the last 10 mins, you could put some shredded pepper jack over all of the potatoes/veggies, but not nescessary.<br>  <br>  Put the steak in a pan and BROIL on HIGH for 4 minutes per side, then let REST for at least 10 mins before slicing.<br>  <br>  You could get some tortillas if you'd like and have a spin on fajitas.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Make Beef Stroganoff with mashed potatoes on the side-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/BEEF-STROGANOFF-WITH-TOMATOES-107484" rel="nofollow">http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/v...</a>|`|Hzospze7aa	I'd use a dry rub and either put it on the grill or pan-sear it. No recipe necessary. For the dry rub, you need not make anything complicated; just crush the garlic, use salt and pepper (the cayenne would be fine but skip the chili powder) rub it into the meat.<br>  <br>  To cook in a pan, let the meat come to room temperature under plastic wrap (otherwise the outside will get overdone while the inside is still raw) and heat up a pan with just a little oil. Sear on one side, let cook shortly, turn over and do the other side. There's no exact time; you'll have to feel it out based on how you like it done. By now you will have a nice lovely buildup of tastiness stuck on the bottom of the pan. When the meat gets done, pour a little liquid into the very hot pan. (This is known as "deglazing.") Use a whisk to loosen up the stuck on bits. You can add a little butter to make the flavor richer. Now you have a nice pan sauce.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	marinate the steak in a gallon-size zip-loc baggie using a mixture of the garlic, Worcestershire sauce, a bit of sugar, salt, & pepper to taste.  I would broil - about 3 minutes per side, then check to see if it's done enough.  <br>  <br>  You can do baked potatoes (microwave to do quickly), and steamed asparagus or spinach on the side.  |`|pTBhq0rHaa	Use a little bit of butter in your pan - season your meat with salt pepper and garlic and worchester for 10-12 minutes on med heat.

Good luck!|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	a nice Tuna steak is supposed to be served rare, you can cook it longer, but it will dry out|`|pXdkEMPhaa	A good tuna will always be served rare/medium rare. In fact, one of the best ways to cook really good tuna is to poach in hot oil for a brief flash then braze in a pan for looks and texture. The result should be a white outside with a red/purple steak-like inside. <br>  <br>  If you're that concerned about it being too undercooked for your boyfriend, you could always wrap the tuna in aluminum foil and bake. The juices will stay inside the packet and effectively boil the hell out of the fish. Can't guarantee it will be all that good though.

KtdlJbrOaa	To freeze raw:  <br>  <br>  Choose very fresh mushrooms; wipe with a clean cloth to remove dirt. Place each a little apart on a baking tray and open-freeze as quickly as possible. When mushrooms are frozen, pack into containers, fit on a lid and replace in freezer. Use within 3 months. Use straight from the freezer for pies, casseroles or stews or thaw for about 1 hour and use as required.<br>  <br>  To freeze par boiled:<br>  <br>  Wash raw mushrooms. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to 1 quart rapidly boiling water. To keep mushrooms white, add 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice to water. Add mushrooms. Let water come to a boil again. Boil mushrooms 3 minutes. Rinse with cold water. Drain thoroughly. Seal in plastic bags. Freeze. Will keep about one year.<br>  <br>  To freeze sauteed:<br>  <br>  Saute 1 lb. of mushrooms in butter with salt and pepper, using high heat for 1 or 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

KtdlJbrOaa	If there are no ice crystals, you need to cook the fish.|`|VHk7ihSdaa	Do not freeze it again. |`|VIUGLqTkaa	It can...but to do so would be very dangerous. This is because the thawing fish is full of ice crystals which, once defrosted, will absorb oxygen and start to decay again (as everything does once it's dead, although we slow the process by freezing, refrigerating, canning, preserving in sugar, vinegar, salt, etc). This allows bacteria to grow = not good!<br>  iF IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT!|`|AA11368073	It depends on the degree of "defrostedness". If it defrosted just a little with remaining ice crystal you can probably refreeze with just a little loss of quality. However, if it defrosted completely you should have fish dinner tonight.

Place in the refrigerator and marinate a few hours or overnight. <br>  The next day, preheat the oven to 300o F. <br>  Combine the flour, 1 Tbsp. salt, and 1 Tbsp. pepper. Lift the beef out of the marinade with a slotted spoon and discard the bay leaves and garlic, saving the marinade. In batches, dredge the cubes of beef in the flour mixture and then shake off the excess. Heat 2 Tbsp.s of olive oil in a large pot and brown half the beef over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes, turning to brown evenly. Place the beef in a large oven-proof Dutch oven and continue to brown the remaining beef, adding oil as necessary. (If the beef is very lean, you'll need more oil.) Place all the beef in the Dutch oven. <br>  Heat another 2 Tbsp.s of oil to the large pot and add the onions, carrots, mushrooms, and potatoes. Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes. Place all the vegetables in the Dutch oven over the beef. Add 2 1/2 cups of the reserved marinade to the empty pot and cook over high heat to deglaze the bottom of the pan, scraping up all the brown bits with a wooden spoon. Add the chicken stock, rosemary, sun-dried tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, 1 Tbsp. salt, and 2 teaspoons pepper.

Add the meat to the oil, adding a little extra flour.<br>  Meanwhile add all veggies and bay leaf to a soup or crock pot.

I put chunks of beef or venison, chopped carrots,chopped potatoes, canned tomatoes, celery chopped, chopped onions, chopped garlic and anything else you want.

Then I let it cook another hour or so and it taste awesome.

When you open it to use date it & use with-in 7 days or so.|`|F3NNKwP9aa	yes you can freeze it but like any other food: don't keep it frozen too long or it will lose all nutritional value.

Just make sure you defrost it in the refrigerator & not on the counter.  |`|1xaKovK2aa	Make sure you shake the milk before use after it is thawed.

We froze our milk throughout my childhood (Costco, Sam's club) and now I cannot pour any milk, even if it has never been frozen, without shaking it.  It will become an easy habit.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	We always do that.  No problems, it tastes the same.<br>  <br>  We do it with whole milk, the fat doesn't separate because it's homogenized.|`|A8t8bcJKaa	This is what I did last week.

It's a solid beer, way better than your common lager.  <br>  <br>  My personal favorites are their darker beers, though.  The Cream Stout is very good, and you don't see too many in that style.  The Black Lager (a Schwarzbier), is in the top 10 worldwide for that style.  It's a really solid beer -- looks much darker than it tastes.<br>  <br>  The Octoberfest that's out is great.  You can find better Oktoberfests if you look around a little bit, but this is a really good one you can probably find on tap.<br>  <br>  I'm not particularly a fan of the Honey Porter.  I'm not sure why, just didn't care for it.  The Summer Ale is average; you'll have to wait till next year or your might find some leftover -- its better on a hot day, though.  |`|DT2mU1jOaa	I think the Sam Adams  Boston Lager from Boston Brewing is a very nice lager beer.

CnutrvBraa	They want you to put foil in the bottom of your pan first- make the sheet of foil long enough so you can use it for "handles" on both sides so you can lift the bars out of the pan. The spray is so the parchment doesn't stick.

I'm from the North and we put noodles in our chili, but if you are from the south it is unheard of.

I then add some chili powder, cumin, cilantro, and more salt & pepper if needed.  <br>  <br>  As for the hot dogs - I'm not sure of any turkey or chicken dog that tastes as delicios as a kosher dog.|`|DKdQ7swZaa	ask your butcher to get you the mild and the spicy turkey sausages there is like 5 in a flat (usually in the meat dept near all sausages), I eat them like a brat and use them (mixed) in all my white and red Italian sauces as well. mix your own seasoning I use steak rub, garlic powder, italian seasoning and pepper even cup to cup and re jar it and mark on the jars "MIX".

AA11015885	Actually your meatloaf will come out better if you do not use a loaf pan.  Just shape your meat into a "loaf" shape and bake it on a baking or roasting pan. You could also use a parchment paper lined baking sheet.  It will not "spread out", it will maintain it's shape, and be less greasy. Bake at the normal temperature. I never use a loaf pan for meatloaf.  Don't try and pack your meatloaf into a  baking pan.<br>  Here is my favorite meatloaf recipe from "Good Eats".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/good-eats-meat-loaf-recipe/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton...</a>|`|mhXboni1aa	I also saw Rachel Ray use a muffin/cupcake pan and made individual meatloaves. |`|d9afb5f10eed7750b0b4604b351f8e22aa	Nope!

KtdlJbrOaa	For me, cooking is all about experimentation, so I would try it.  Perhaps use a bit more yogurt since it's not as wet as milk & you may need more sugar to combat the tartness of the yogurt.  It would be interesting to see how they turn out.  |`|HkMhWvtgaa	First, check and see if you have any canned or powdered milk.  Powdered milk can be reconstituted according to the directions on the box.  Canned milk may be either sweetened or unsweetened.  If you have a choice, use the unsweetened.  Mix equal amounts canned milk and water.  If you must use sweetened, again mix equal portions of water and canned milk, but reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe by about one fourth.  If you have cream, you may also dilute it with an equal amount of water.  If you have half-and-half, use it in place of milk without adding water.  If you have no real dairy products, you may resort to non-dairy coffee creamer (unflavored), but I won't vouch for the results.<br>  <br>  If you do not have any of these, then try it with plain water instead of milk.  It may not rise quite as you are expecting.|`|BlMOrfz4aa	No you can't use yogurt in place of milk..<br>  You can use evaporated milk<br>  Coconut milk<br>  Powder Milk<br>  Soy milk<br>  <br>  If your out of milk see if a neighbor will lend you some.<br>  |`|xbeyejxfaa	YES YOU CAN BUT SOMETIMES IT WILL TASTE LIKE YOGURT YOU CAN SEND ME SOMETHING ON THIS EMAIL ADDRESSE ZUNDRIAWILKINS@YAHOO.COM|`|4A52dOlgaa	milk and yogurt ate 2 diffrent things.<br>  it iis not choose betweeen red or green.<br>  No milk CANNOT be replaced with yogurt,,<br>  |`|byScRN6baa	no|`|Es2uLUO1aa	ha.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).<br>  2. Dip the skinless chicken pieces in the melted butter/margarine. Coat with the crushed salted cracker crumbs.

A little garlic powder mixed with the cracker crumbs, maybe a little lemon pepper.<br>  <br>  Also, think of this. Yeah, it talks about using a whole chicken, but is this necessary? No, not really. Just a matter of changing things up a little. With the bone in the chicken, the cooking time is increased. Use boneless chicken breasts, and the time cuts, almost in half.

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees for the first 10 minutes, and then down to 325 for the remaining period.  You can put it in an oven roaster bag or cover with foil but it is unnecessary.  Tenderloin is done when the juices run clear when pricked with a fork.<br>  <br>  Remove the roast from the pan and let rest for a minimum of 7 minutes for the juices to settle into the meat.  Slice against the grain on a diagonal to maximize the tenderness.<br>  <br>  We do tenderloin 2x a month this way.  Yummy.  If you ever want to try something AWESOME - grind 4 cloves of garlic, 2 T rosemary, 1 t or large dash of sea salt, and a drizzle (couple of tablespoons) of olive oil in a food processor.  Once it gets to a paste-like consistency, rub on the pork loin and roast dry in the oven.  It's really, really good and so very simple.|`|rkRIYxi2aa	I cook pork tenderloin most weeks.  I keep it as simple as possible, trim the tenderloin, put it in an ovenproof dish with olive oil, fresh rosemary, salt and pepper, cover it with foil and put it in a 300 degree oven for about an hour.  I then check it with an instant read thermometer and if it's up to about 160 internally, it's done.|`|byScRN6baa	uncovered 350 for 1 hour (i like to make sure its cooked well so mayeb 1 1/2 hours)

We don't buy the store brand bread from walmart because H-E-B has a bake shop that makes honey wheat, if I were to buy bread from walmart I would probably go with Nature's Own because I think it's the least expensive high quality bread. I am buying plenty of store brands, but always still look! I often find other brands on sale for less than even the store brand. The only things I would not skimp on would be meats/seafood and things like mayo that have very distinct flavors where it would be obvious that you were using something low quality. I also do not buy regular cheap milk. The cows are often over milked by large manufacturers, leading to puss and even trace amounts of blood in the milk. I either buy organic or soy.  After reading and seeing so many things about the milk, I don't think I can ever drink regular milk again. It's worth the price to not be drinking puss!|`|KtdlJbrOaa	I buy the store brands at Wal-Mart, Meijer, SuperTarget - pretty much wherever I happen to be shopping.  The store brands are sometimes made/canned at the same plant as the brand name of an item, they just don't get the fancy packaging.  It's a great way to save $ - especially when it comes to cereal, cleaning products, and canned goods. I routinely save 40% by purchasing the store brands.  Good luck!|`|ExR0Y6oyaa	I cook for my family nightly and have price-shopped at all of them,store brand and name brand- Go to a few places and walk thru yourself- I don't see how anyone can beat Wal-Mart, except for the occasional special deal-Most all Wal-Mart brands are great- God Bless You!|`|SuvXbPvgaa	What a great idea!  You should notice a difference for sure!<br>  <br>  Try to choose only a few grocery items that are not store brand, as you probably won't want to scrimp on things like toilet paper.  But go store brand with everything else.|`|FbcFcf4oaa	I also shop at walmart, I find very good deals at stop n shop too.|`|mL5C5LYOaa	I have never been able to taste a difference in store brand to top dollar brand items from the grocery... especially in cereal.  Honey Nut O's taste the same as Honey Nut Cheerios and save you about a dollar. <br>  Wal-Mart has, by far, the best prices for every day buying.<br>  BUT,<br>  example...<br>  an item people have been mentioning is bread.  Of course Wal-Mart has cheap bread but I always always always check Meijer grocery ads in our newspaper... Often they had Buy 1, Get 2 Free (YES, buy ONE, get TWO.) on items such as bread... Even if they don't have buy one get two, they almost always have buy one get one on items like hot dogs or chicken breasts.<br>  An earlier answerer said be a coupon clipper... This could help but the best solution is to always check the ads!<br>  Wal-Mart has the best prices for everyday, Meijers has the best sales. I would also stay away from small city grocers. I know they are trying to make a living and they are perfect places if you need milk for some cookies to bake but they often hike up prices because they have a monopoly in the city.<br>  Just look around. =]

This is LUSCIOUS---from a recipe board:<br>  <br>  "This is the "Original" weddin' cake recipe from the day Tourmaline Fox was married to Jimmy Cales. Now, I am going to post the recipe first, and the story after that. One thing I just havta tell ya'll is that back in them days, the three deckered weddin' cake was just something that was seen in New York, or some other big city. In the rural south, weddin' days were just a big sharing of good food, and the weddin' cake was usually just a darned good cake baked by one of the local yokels who had a good talent with that old wood stove, it was just a cake, nothing fancy, but always, GOOD AS GOLD!<br>  <br>  Now, Tourmalines Wedding Day Cake recipe is posted below:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CAKE:<br>  1 Cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened<br>  1 1/2 Cups sugar<br>  4 Eggs separated<br>  1/3 Cup grated white chocolate<br>  1/2 Cup Water<br>  2 1/2 Cup all-purpose flour<br>  1 teaspoon baking soda<br>  1 Cup Buttermilk<br>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>  <br>  ICING:<br>  1/2 Cup plus 2 Tablespoons Butter<br>  3/4 Cup Evaporated Milk<br>  4 Tablespoons (1/2 stick) unslated butter<br>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>  2 cups grated white chocolate<br>  <br>  Prehead the oven to 350* degrees. Grease and lightly flour three 9-inch <br>  round cake pans.<br>  To make the cake, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat <br>  in the egg yolks, one at a time. Set aside.<br>  Combine the white chocolate and water in a small saucepan over low heat.<br>  Carefully melt (be sure not to let it scorch) and beat into the butter<br>  mixture, alternating with the butter-milk. Stir in vanilla. Beat egg<br>  whites until stiff, then fold into the batter.<br>  Divide batter equally among the 3 pans and bake for 20 minutes, or until<br>  a cake test comes out clean and layers are turning golden. Let rest a few<br>  minutes before loosening edges and inverting onto cooling racks. When <br>  cool, brush off crumbs.<br>  <br>  To make icing, combine sugar, evaporated milk, and butter in a saucepan <br>  over low heat. When the butter is melted, lighly boil for 1 minute. Stir<br>  in vanilla. Off the heat, beat in the white chocolate until it is <br>  completley melted. Let cool to a spreadable consistency. <br>  <br>  Now, just frost that cake up proper like anyone would, and make it little<br>  thick in the center layers. Let is sit for a bit, and that frosting will<br>  set up proper, and ummmmmmm, GOOD STUFF!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, going back to that day in '57 is a bit of a struggle for me, my goodness, it's been a spell now hasn't it? I can still see in my minds eye the farm and all those animals, and I can still see Pop Church up on the porch on that mornin of the weddin. He was kinda taken by Patsy Cline and her music, and with this thing called "Radio", he was as addicted to it as we are to the internet! My I can hear the tunes from that radio right now, "Walking After Midnight", "San Antonio Rose", the voice of Patsy just echoing over the hills. <br>  In the background of all of Pops world was Granny Church just in a flurry of gettin things together for her last daugher (and oldest daughter), who was finally getting married! Tourmaline had probably traveled farther than any of the family, but she was a "Free Spirit" as Granny always called her, but, at long last, she'd found a fella', and he was local, and that was all that mattered!<br>  The day was just another wonderful day in the mountains, and I know all of us younguns were sent out on orders from "Granny Church" to pick every single ladyslipper blossom we could find in the woods, along with as many fern leaves that we could find to weave into Tourmalines bouqet. We did what was asked and the bouqet was assembled, and it all was so beautiful!<br>  The mountains were just all around us, and Granny had this pump organ where you had to pump your feet on these things to get the thing to play, and she was quite good at doing it (she played for the church), and she kept pumping those pedals and she played "Here Comes The Bride", and she never missed a single note! The preacher, Reverend Lewis, did the ceremony up proper and then, Tourmaline and her new husband did this really big "KISS", and my goodness, it almost turned into lust on the alter I thought! I think the "KISS" was rather more than Granny could take and when she started pumpin that old organ she realized that it had gotten warm in the day. She played on, but my goodness she started to perspire, but she kept a playing. Then, we had a rather unwelcomed visitor.... A black snake! That organ had been stored in the shed for a few months and apparently, this ole snake had made it his home! The rattlings of the wedding and Grannys playin' made this a nervous creature. That creature shot out of the side of that old organ and just slithered up the side of that instrument, and Granny Church nearly had a heart attack! I dont think I ever saw a human being move so fast in my life, and she was just a yellin "Snake Snake Snake"! I just remember that Harummmmmm of the organ shutting down! Total silence!<br>  By the time we realized what was happenin' tha|`|0rAgtGNgaa	in the first bells best cook book there is a 123 cake that is really good (I use it everytime I make a cake) and if you mix a box of vanilla pudding and add one cup to the cake batter it will make the cake more moist.

Bring a saucepan filled with 1 inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl on the pan without touching the water. Stir occasionally until melted.

YUM.  I have seen bacon ice cream on the food network before, & I believe it did have some maple in it.  I would think that as long as you use a smoky bacon and use some maple or caramel for flavoring, the result would be delicious.  I'm on the hunt for some recipes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's one:<br>  <br>  To make bacon candy, all you need to do is:<br>  <br>  Heat your oven to 350 degrees <br>  Coat your bacon (use the basic supermarket kind) in a half-cup of brown sugar. <br>  Bake it in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the bacon is cooked through and crispy.<br>  <br>  Once the bacon is crispy, take it out of the oven and let it cool so it hardens nicely. You want to be able to experience that candied crunch.<br>  <br>  Once you've tried bacon candy, then it's time to expand your bacon repertoire. You can try the excellent Mo's Bacon Bar from Vosges Chocolatiers. Whole Foods tends to stock Vosges chocolate as do other specialty food retailers, but you can also order it online if you can't find it locally. You'll be surprised how good bacon and chocolate taste together. In addition to the full size chocolate bars, Vosges also makes these sweet flying chocolate pigs filled with Applewood bacon. Yum!<br>  <br>  And of course, bacon tastes great with virtually anything flavored with maple syrup. After all, it tastes great with pancakes, doesn't it? So you can crumble up some bacon to add to maple scones, muffins or cakes and it will taste delicious too.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Bacon Cinnamon Rolls<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 tube ready-to-cook cinnamon rolls<br>  1 uncooked slice of bacon per roll<br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  1.

b13f990ababf901d37e57f22cbb3582faa	I've found that several of Martha Stewart's macaroni and cheese recipes turn out great.  The base cheese is always cheddar, but you can throw in other cheese as well, including parmesan.  One of her recipes calls for cheddar and romano, which is very similar to parmesan, so just substitute.  You can throw in meats ((ham, chicken) or vegetables to a recipe to add something extra.  Here is the link to Martha's site where she has all her mac & cheese recipes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/portal/site/mslo/menuitem.e28a2ad6d3341f8836eb9e2bd373a0a0?vgnextoid=42cacf380e1dd010VgnVCM1000005b09a00aRCRD&rsc=search_home&autonomy_kw=macaroni+and+cheese&x=42&y=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.marthastewart.com/portal/site...</a><br>  |`|KtdlJbrOaa	Absolutely.  Boil the macaroni & drain.  In a sauce pan, melt 3 tablespoons butter over low heat.  Add 3 tablespoons flour and whisk together.  At this point add salt, pepper, garlic powder - any desired seasonings to taste.  I also add a teaspoon of prepared mustard.  Whisk to combine.  Remove from heat & whisk in 2 cups milk.  Return to heat & bring to a boil.  When the mixture starts to thicken, add 2 cups (more if you want) shredded cheddar cheese.  Add macaroni to mixture & stir to combine. You could easily serve at this point, but you could also put in a greased 9x13 pan, sprinkle with a mixture of parmesan cheese & breadcrumbs (or crumbled ritz crackers) and bake at 350 degrees until cheese is bubbly.|`|pnrhpAfbaa	I would think that it would work I have a friend that does it and it tastes really good|`|kJjBAJu4aa	You can make it with either of them.

Bake in oven for 40 minutes or until bubbly and golden on top.<br>  |`|Xw5A7ObVaa	Yep those two cheeses (or even just cheddar) would be fine! <br>  <br>  You need to boil the macaroni until it's tender, and make a cheese sauce by firstly making a roux - cooking flour and butter together for a little while.<br>  <br>  Then you add milk a little at a time (add as much milk as you think you will need to cover the macaroni at the end) and stir like crazy until the lumps of flour work their way out of the sauce (the heat should be medium/high)  <br>  <br>  Then add grated cheese to the sauce and keep stirring until it's all melted.  Add pepper to your taste (you probably won't need to add salt because cheese is salty enough already).  You could add mustard instead of pepper for a different flavour.<br>  <br>   Put your macaroni in an oven-proof dish, and pour the sauce on top.  Put the whole thing under the grill or in the oven on a high heat for abou 5 minutes or until its brown on top.|`|AA12202766	The short answer is that you can, unfortunately you cannot only use cheddar and parmesan cheese, you must at least use some processed cheese so that the sauce will melt evenly.<br>  <br>  Unlike what the poster above suggests, you cannot simply remove the velveeta and use any other cheese; you should either mix in some velveeta or American cheese to make sure the cheese creates a sauce, and not just a hard chunk of cheese in the middle of your pasta.  I usually use 1/4 cup processed, 3/4 cheddar (or other all natural cheese); this creates a great melt and you taste the cheddar, not the American!<br>  <br>  I usually eyeball my homemade mac & cheese by now, but you make the pasta and mix in butter or margarine and milk just like you would the stuff out of the box.  Then, mix in your cheddar/parmesan/american cheese.  Another great thing I like to do with it, is bake it; just heat up the oven to 350 degrees, sprinkle some breadcrumbs and natural cheese on top, and bake it for about 10 minutes.  It gives it a great crisp on the top layer above all the gooey mac & cheese :)|`|Kp0NXNyjaa	I make homemade mac and cheese all the time.

Once milk is slightly warmed, turn heat to medium-low and add flour and milk mixture, stirring constantly until thick. Reduce heat slightly and add butter, cheeses, and pepper. Cook until smooth, about 5 minutes. Drain macaroni, then combine with cheese mixture, stirring thoroughly. Pour into a 13" x 9" baking dish. Sprinkle breadcrumbs lightly and evenly on top and bake 30 to 35 minutes. Serve immediately.

4dntstR9aa	Yes, I sometimes get stuck in food ruts!  Whats crazy is I am a foodie and watch Food Network constantly! LOL I am a huge Rachael Ray fan!  I love to learn new meals and try them - but weeknights are when I don't want to spend 2 hours making dinner.  As much as I love cooking I love sitting down and relaxing after a long day of work!<br>  <br>  I have a huge 3 ring binder that I started several years ago - (its almost ready for the 2nd edition!) that I have dividers in, sorted by different recipes...(Beef, Chicken, Pork, Mexican, Asian, Pasta, Soups/stews/stoups, Casseroles, etc) and when I find recipes online, I print them out and using a 3 hole punch, I put them in my book.  It is now so big it hardly closes!  I love to flip through and find recipes in there that I have yet to try.  I always find myself going back to Rachael Rays recipes, because she really focuses on the fast and easy recipes, while still trying to be healthy and delicious!  (Thinking I sound like an informercial!)<br>  Some websites I always go back to are<br>  www.recipegoldmine.com<br>  <br>  www.allrecipes.com<br>  <br>  www.foodnetwork.com (you knew that one would be here huh?) lol<br>  <br>  www.cooks.com<br>  <br>  www.epicurious.com<br>  <br>  www.meals.com<br>  <br>  www.rachaelray.com<br>  <br>  I think its allrecipes.com that has an ingredient search on it too.  Say you have canned mushrooms, a roast, white rice, onion and not sure what to make, but sure you have a meal in there somewhere, you can enter in all the ingredients you have on hand and it will pull up the recipes you could make with what you have on hand.  Sometimes it does assume you have certain pantry ingredients on hand at most times though.  I try to keep the essentials stocked up just for nights like this!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|IXqCB5oqaa	This happens to me all the time, We have a large family of 6 and I find myself making the same stuff all the time, you can start by changing up what you make in a simple way such as with a whole chicken in the freezer, thaw it, rinse, stuff a cut up lemon, some garlic cloves and fresh rosemary inside the chicken, rub with lemon toss some salt and pepper and stick it in the oven, this not only makes for a great dinner but your house will smell wonderful too. I find a lot of simple and easy recipes at recipes.com. Chicken with some sauce and cheese over thin spaghetti, toss in some garlic bread and there's a nice easy meal. For super quick meals I might even buy something frozen that can be quickly heated and toss it with something like rice or potatoes.

Add prepared hens and soak for 2 hours. Rinse thoroughly; pat dry. <br>  Adjust oven rack to upper middle position, and heat oven to 450 degrees. <br>  Heat oil in a large skillet. Saute onions until softened, about 7 minutes. Stir in apricots, then spread mixture onto a large (about 18-by-12-inch) lipped cookie sheet. Lay hens over the mixture. Mix jam and vinegar, and brush all but a few tablespoons over hens. <br>  Bake hens, brushing 2 or 3 times with remaining jam mixture and accumulated pan juices, until hens are golden brown and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. Turn heat from bake to broil, then cook until hens are spotty brown, watching carefully so they don't burn, 4 to 5 minutes. <br>  Transfer hens to a large platter with tongs, then cut in half at the breastbone to create individual servings. <br>  Return apricot dressing to the oven and broil to evaporate some of the excess liquid, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in pistachios and parsley. Spoon in a mound next to hens. <br>  <br>  <br>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...<br>  <br>  <br>  Famous Pork Chops --<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS <br>  1 cup crushed butter crackers <br>  garlic salt to taste <br>  ground black pepper to taste <br>  3 eggs, beaten <br>  4 pork chops <br>  1/2 cup butter <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). <br>  In a shallow bowl combine crushed crackers, garlic salt and pepper; mix well.

Cover each breast with some store bought alfredo sauce and then bake at 375 for about 45 minutes!

The first one is from "Peggy's Antiquated 1930's recipe page" (see link below).<br>  <br>  Butterscotch Pie<br>  <br>  1 pre baked pie crust<br>  1 cup dark brown sugar<br>  3 tablespoons butter (or, if you prefer, 'Nucoa oleo-margarine')<br>  1 1/2 cups milk<br>  1/2 tsp vanilla extract<br>  2 eggs, separated<br>  3 tbsp all purpose flour<br>  2 tbsp powdered sugar<br>  <br>  Heat a heavy fry pan over medium heat.

Add to the mixture in the fry pan and stir over medium heat until thickened and creamy. Pour into cooled pie crust. Beat remaining egg whites with powdered sugar until stiff and spoon decoratively over pie. Bake in preheated 325 degree oven until meringue is browned, Serve cold.<br>  --------------------<br>  This next one, "Mystery cake" is from the 1930's chapter of a  book called "Recipes from the Twentieth Century." It says:<br>  <br>  "Cake had not waned in popularity since the Twenties; if anything, it was more popular. And that popularity now had (pseudo)-scientific backing. A 1931 booklet from K. C. Baking Powder notes “cakes are no longer considered too rich for daily consumption; in fact, cake is now known to be an exceedingly well balanced food product.”<br>  <br>  One of the newest and most popular cakes was mystery or surprise cake—not surprising, because everyone in the Thirties seemed to love “clever” cooking.This cake was a 1925 culinary contribution from Campbell’s Soup and tasted surprisingly good. “But,” said Joy of Cooking (1964), “why shouldn’t it? The deep secret is tomato, which after all is a fruit.” Mystery cake was most often frosted with another brand name product—frosting made from Philadelphia brand cream cheese.<br>  Mystery Cake, Campbell’s Soup<br>  <br>  Cooking with condensed soups (usually Campbell’s but Heinz and Hormel also were popular) had really taken hold in the 1920s, but this recipe was one of the first departures from the sauce/aspic oeuvre.<br>  <br>  2 cups sifted cake flour<br>  1 tablespoon baking powder<br>  ? teaspoon baking soda<br>  ? teaspoon ground cloves<br>  ? teaspoon ground cinnamon or mace<br>  ? teaspoon ground nutmeg<br>  1 cup seedless raisins, coarsely chopped<br>  ? cup vegetable shortening<br>  1 cup sugar<br>  2 large eggs, well beaten<br>  1 (15-ounce) can condensed tomato soup<br>  Philly-Vanilly Frosting (below)<br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 375°F. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and spices together in a medium-size bowl. Toss the raisins to coat with ? cup of the flour mixture. Cream the shortening in a large bowl. Add the sugar gradually to the shortening, creaming until light. Beat in the eggs until thoroughly mixed. Add the flour mixture alternately with the soup to the egg mixture. Stir until smooth. Fold in the raisins. Pour into two greased and floured 8-inch layer pans. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes.

Work in the sugar, then beat in the melted butter and vanilla. Continue beating until very light."|`|zawmsUO1aa	After Ritz crackers were created in the early 1930's a recipe for Mock Apple Pie began appearing on the box.  Apples were once again expensive and homemakers in those years were able to use crackers in order to give their children a taste of apple pie. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mock Apple Pie a la Ritz <br>  Pastry for two-crust 9-inch pie <br>  30 to 36 Ritz crackers, coarsely broken up (about 1 3/4 cups) <br>  2 teaspoons cream of tartar <br>  2 cups water <br>  2 cups sugar <br>  Grated rind of one lemon <br>  2 tablespoons of lemon juice <br>  2 tablespoons butter or margarine <br>  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>  <br>  1.  Place sugar, cream of tartar and water in saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer for 15 minutes.  Add grated lemon rind and lemon juice.  Allow to cool. <br>  <br>  2.   Preheat oven to 425 degrees. <br>  <br>  3.    Roll out half the pastry and line a 9 inch pie plate. Place coarsely-broken cracker crumbs in pie crust.   Pour cooled syrup over crackers.  Dot with butter or margarine and sprinkle with cinnamon. <br>  <br>  4.   Roll out remaining pastry; place over pie.  Trim, seal and flute edges.  Slit top to allow steam to escape.  Bake at 425 F for 30-35 minutes or until crust is crisp and golden.  Cool completely before serving. <br>  <br>  |`|tfkpNh89aa	Here are a few recipes from the Joy of Cooking 1931 (First Edition)<br>  <br>  Sweet Potato Puffs <br>  <br>  Baked in mounds or in ramekins. This is a good way of utilizing left over sweet potatoes. Serve them to people who like pumpkin, for they are not unlike pumpkin pie filling. <br>  <br>  4 medium sized sweet potatoes (about 2 cups)<br>  1 large ripe banana<br>  1-1/2 teaspoons salt<br>  1 1/2 tablespoons butter<br>  1/8 teaspoon nutmeg<br>  1/3 teaspoon paprika<br>  1 egg yolk<br>  Hot milk or cream<br>  1 egg white beaten <br>  <br>  Boil the potatoes in their jackets. Peel and rice them. Rice the banana and combine all the ingredients except the egg white. Beat them, using sufficient hot milk or cream to make the batter fluffy. Fold in the egg white. Place the mixture by the tablespoonful will apart in a greased pan. Bake the puffs in a hot oven 500 for 12 minutes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Queen Mary's Sponge Cake <br>  <br>  When King George was sick, his wife, who is reputed to have that inborn thing, "a light hand with patry," brought him a volume of Marie Corelli's and bake a sponge cake for him. Who says that the lives of Queens are complicated? <br>  This cake contains neither baking powder, nor cream of tartar, but depends for its lightness upon the air that is first beaten and then folded into it. This recipe makes a large, delicate, fine grained cake, which, if somewhat uninteresting, makes up for that by being highly digestible. <br>  <br>  6 eggs<br>  1 cup sugar<br>  1 cup cake flour<br>  Rind of 1 lemon<br>  Juice of 1/2 lemon<br>  1/4 teaspoon salt <br>  <br>  1 teaspoonful of vanilla and 1 teaspoonful of water may be substituted for the lemon juice. Separate the eggs and beat the yolks until they are light. Grate the lemon rind over the sugar, and add the sugar slowly to the egg yolks, stirring them briskly with a wire whisk. Add the lemon juice and when these ingredients are creamed, begin to fold in the egg whites, which have been whipped with the salt to a stiff froth. When the egg whites are partly folded in, begin adding the flour--one tablespoon at a time. Cut and fold lightly until the flour is blended, then pour the bater into an ungreased angel food pan and pake it in a slow oven 325 for one hour. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mint Sherbert <br>  <br>  2 cups sugar<br>  2 cups water<br>  2 lemons, grated and juiced<br>  2 oranges, grated and juiced<br>  12 sprigs of fresh mint, chopped<br>  1 egg white<br>  Green coloring <br>  <br>  Boil the sugar and the water for five minuts. Pour the syrup over the mint leaves and permit them to steep for 1 hour. Strain the syrup, add the fruit juice and rind and the green coloring and freeze the mixture. When it is partially frozen, add the stiffly beaten egg white and freeze it until it is firm. Garnish the ice with mint leaves. <br>  <br>  <br>  Cheese Souffle  <br>  <br>  1 cup thick cream sauce<br>  1/2 cup grated cheese<br>  3 eggs, separated<br>  Salt, paprika<br>  A few grains of cayenne <br>  <br>  Make a thick cream sauce of 3 tablespoons of butter, 3 tablespoons of flour and 1 cup of liquid (milk, stock, vegetable water, or cream). <br>  <br>  Add the solids, cheese, etc. while the cream sauce is boiling. Reduce the heat to a low flame and add the beaten egg yolks. Cook the sauce, for one or two minutes, stirring it constantly, until the yolks thicken slightly, but do not permit it to boil. Season the sauce and remove it from the fire. <br>  <br>  When it is cool, fold in the stiffly beaten whites of eggs and place the mixture in an ungreased baking dish. It will rise higher when the dish is not greased, as it will cling to the dry sides. <br>  <br>  The souffle may be baked with an increasing heat, beginning with a slow oven and increasing the heat slightly every ten minutes until the oven is moderately hot (325 to 350) [what is the symbol for degree] or by placing the baking dish in a slow oven (325) and baking it until the souffle is firm--from 24 to 45 minutes--dependent upon the size of the souffle. <br>  <br>  Do not place the dish in hot water unless the recipe calls for it. The water will keep the souffle soft and in some cases it is preferable to have it crisp and crusty. <br>  However, when making a souffle in a ring mold, or in any other dish, with the intention of inverting the contents when done, grease the mold well, fill it and set it in a pan of hot water. this will facilitate removing the souffle from the mold and will giv it a uniform consistency. <br>  <br>  Souffles may be prepared in advance, with the exception of the beating of the egg whites, which must be done immediately before the souffle is put into the oven. <br>  Onions and garlic add greately to the flavor of the souffle. If you like them, place finely chopped onions in the butter and saute them for a minute before making the cream sauce, or place bit of garlic in the butter, saute it for a minute and remove it before making the cream sauce. <br>  <br>  Condensed milk makes a good souffle. When using it take half milk or stock and half condensed milk and decrease the flour from 3 tablespoons to 2 tablespoons to one cup of liquid. <br>  <br>  Carrots, onions and celery may be used raw if they are finely minced, or put through a food processor.<br>  
KtdlJbrOaa	Irish Potato Candy is a Philadelphia delicacy though it is neither Irish nor a potato.<br>  <br>  It is an extremely sweet treat, generally made up of some blend of coconut, confectioner's sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and milk or cream. These treats are about the size of a large marble and are quite popular around St. Patrick's Day. Oh Ryan's makes the largest distribution of Irish Potatoes, delivering them to major chains and smaller candy stores throughout the nation, though most of the deliveries are focused in the Philadelphia area.<br>  <br>  Many people believe that the Irish Potato was created as a commemoration of the Irish Potato Famine.<br>  <br>

Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and wrap tightly in foil, then roast in oven until garlic is soft when pierced with tip of a knife, about 45 minutes. <br>  While garlic roasts, heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Add bay leaves and cook, stirring, until leaves begin to brown, about 10 seconds. Reduce heat to moderate, then add onion, carrot, celery, and chorizo and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, cloves, red-pepper flakes, and black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil, then add broth and reserved clam juice. Simmer, uncovered, until reduced to about 2 cups, about 15 minutes. <br>  While tomato sauce simmers, squeeze pulp from garlic cloves and force through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl using a rubber spatula, discarding solids. Whisk purée into tomato sauce. Discard bay leaves and cloves, then keep sauce warm while grilling chops. <br>  Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate. <br>  Pat pork chops dry and sprinkle on both sides with salt. Grill pork chops on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until thermometer inserted 2 inches into center of a chop (do not touch bone) registers 145°F, 12 to 14 minutes total. Transfer chops to a plate and keep warm, loosely covered with foil. <br>  Add clams to sauce and cook just until clams plump and edges begin to curl, 30 to 45 seconds.

VjF1F0vBaa	Make meatballs using either minced beef or pork or a mixture of the two.  I would add very finely chopped onion, crushed garlic and black pepper to the meatball mixture and maybe an egg to bind.  Roll into balls and fry lightly to brown.  To make the sauce fry a chopped onion and  some garlic together in a little olive oil and add a tin of chopped tomatos and a carton of passata.  Add black pepper, torn basil leaves and any vegetables that you like such as peppers or mushrooms. Also add a dash or Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar at this stage.  Cook together for 5 to 10 minutes and then pour over the meatballs arranged in an oven proof dish.  Bake in the oven for another 30 minutes.  Alternatively you could add the meatballs to the pan with the sauce and cook that way.  It may be a little quicker.  Serve with parmasan cheese and pasta.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Quick Sausage Meatballs with a Tomato and Basil Sauce<br>  <br>  For the meatballs:<br>  Olive oil <br>  8 good-quality pork sausages <br>  Sea salt <br>  A few sprigs fresh marjoram, thyme or rosemary, leaves picked <br>  1 block Parmesan, to serve <br>  <br>  For the tomato sauce: <br>  Olive oil <br>  2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely sliced <br>  1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves picked, stalks finely chopped <br>  2 (14-ounce) cans good-quality plum tomatoes <br>  Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper <br>  Good quality balsamic vinegar <br>  <br>  Heat a large saucepan and add a few glugs of olive oil. Snip the sausages apart, then squeeze and pinch the meat out of the skins so that you get little meatball shapes - don't make them too big or they will take too long to cook. Try to get at least 3 balls out of each sausage. Don't worry about rolling them into perfect balls and making them look all fancy - rough and rustic is good! Put them into your pan. Keep frying and turning the meatballs until they're golden brown and cooked through. <br>  <br>  To make your tomato sauce, heat a separate pan and pour in some olive oil. Add the garlic and the chopped basil stalks and move them around the pan for a couple of minutes. Put some small basil leaves aside for later, and sprinkle the rest into the pan. Add the tomatoes and season carefully with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a simmer, break up your tomatoes a bit more with a spoon and add a swig of balsamic vinegar - it's for adding sweetness to the sauce. <br>  <br>  Add the herbs to the pan of sausage meatballs, tossing everything in all the lovely flavors. Cook for around 30 seconds. Divide the  meatballs between 4 bowls. Spoon over the tomato sauce. Sprinkle over the reserved basil leaves and a little Parmesan for grating or shaving over the top. <br>  <br>  |`|0c3ab6f17dfe75c72fe428de8b11aae3aa	impossible to make it quick.

It's simple enough to wing it. I'd suggest, though, to make the sauce separately from the meatballs, to help get the flavors right.<br>  <br>  Brown the meatballs, store bought ones work fine, then once they're done, remove them from the pan. Poor off the extra fat, if any, being careful not to lose all the brown bits. Personally, I'd rather have a little fat than lose the flavors. Deglaze the pan with a little port or red wine (use about 1/4 cup), which means you pour in a liquid (you can use water for this step too) and use a whisk to scrape all the brown bits upr from the bottom of the pan. Be careful not to let it flame up (especially if you have a gas stove). Keep the heat on about medium to help avoid this. <br>  <br>  Add your sauce and to it, add basil to taste. Personally, I like a lot of basil and I use about 2 tablespoons, sometimes more. Black pepper is also good, and will go well with the meat. If you like garlic, toss some of that in as well. Remember: add small amounts because you can always add more. Once it's in, you can't get it out. A little salt, maybe a little onion powder, just whatever you like. And a bit of olive oil not only adds flavor, it helps with consistency and texture.<br>  <br>  Using a whisk rather than a spoon always helps, I find.<br>  <br>  I'll also add a bit of sugar too to help bring out the sweetness of the tomatoes. I use about 1-2 teaspoons, and sometimes more, all depending on how much sauce I have.<br>  <br>  Once the sauce comes to a slow boil, let it cook for a bit. Tomato sauces work best when they've "browned" a bit. (They don't really brown, but the color will darken and you'll see sort of condensed, pasty looking bits on the wall of the pan.) But they do NOT do well when they've been scorched, so keep your heat no higher than medium. Stir frequently, scraping the sides to pick up the flavors.<br>  <br>  Once you get it to a consistent simmering boil, let it cook probably 10 minutes or so, and check for taste. Add more basil as needed. The flavors will deepen the longer it cooks but if you want a fresh, snappier basil flavor, add it right at the end.<br>  <br>  Add the meatballs back in when you have the taste right. You don't need to re-boil it, just warm up the meatballs. Be sure you pour in any juice the meatballs might have leaked out.<br>  <br>  Yum!|`|vikDAKPxaa	uhhh. just cook your sauce on medium to low heat and when it starts to bubble lower it. add the meatballs and let them cook and kinds marinate in there. shouldnt take more than 20 minutes as long as you use your time wisely|`|jUmT8JnFaa	good sauce can not be made quickly.   but this will work for quick.<br>  Buy frozen meatball and add to a jar of tomato basil sauce.  presto, you're done.|`|fu5v3Jnlaa	buy meatballs from ikea put them in the oven and add  basil tomato sauce from jar and cream <br>  ready|`|Tw1HfCv6aa	I made that a few weeks ago, can't remember how though.

The best way to check it is by sticking a fork in the thickest part and it should still be "pink" inside. Now if you don't want the  fork marks to show on the final product consider my favorite recipe; salmon fillets covered with salsa (get the chucky kind, put the salmon on foil and cover with salsa, bake at 400 degrees until "done"), very easy and tasty. the key is that you have fillets that are the same thickness, so they get "done" at the same time; but if you have a whole fillet with different thicknesses, cut it in serving sizes and the start cooking the thicker pieces first, then later adding the thinner ones. If you have salmon steaks they should be the same thickness so the cook time for all pieces should be the same.<br>  You can wrap the salmon in foil and add butter, herbs and spices (salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, maybe some mustard powder)and a hit of lemon juice, very good.|`|kJjBAJu4aa	Here's a great link for "How to Bake Salmon" with some great tips:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_Bake_Salmon" rel="nofollow">http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_Bake_Salmon</a><br>  <br>  Here's a recipe that I like:<br>  <br>  Baked Salmon<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  2 cloves garlic, minced <br>  6 tablespoons light olive oil <br>  1 teaspoon dried basil <br>  1 teaspoon salt <br>  1 teaspoon ground black pepper <br>  1 tablespoon lemon juice <br>  1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped <br>  2 (6 ounce) fillets salmon <br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). <br>  <br>  In a medium glass bowl, prepare marinade by mixing garlic, light olive oil, basil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and parsley.

Preparación: Mientras bates la mantequilla con el azúcar, pones a desleir el chocolate en un poquitico de agua, a fuego mínimo. Luego bates las yemas de los huevos (tienes que quitarle le película que rodea a la yema, sino sabe a mucho huevo jejeje) y las claras las bates a punto de nieve. Luego mezclas todos lo ingredientes en un bol. Tomas un recipiente pones una capa de galletas y otra de la mezcla, así sucesivamente hasta terminar con una capa de la mezcla, la llevas a la nevera y a los tres días está para chuparse los dedos.<br>  <br>   Ten un lindo Domingo.

Engrasamos 4 moldes individuales y los enharinamos con cacao. Derretimos mantequilla y chocolate en un calentador, pero no lo llevamos a su punto de ebullición, y lo reservamos a un lado. <br>  <br>  Batimos los huevos, las yemas y el azúcar hasta que estén cremosos y espesos. A?adimos el chocolate, cuando ya esté tibio, batiendo constantemente. A?adimos la harina, y lo batimos todo sólo hasta que esté incorporado. <br>  <br>  Vertemos la mezcla en los 4 moldes y los introducimos en el horno, los dejamos hacer de 10 a 12 minutos. Volteamos los moldes, cada uno en un plato, y los dejamos 10 segundos, hasta que se desprendan del molde. los podemos servir con helado, nata montada, frutas, salsa de chocolate, lo que más te apetezca. <br>   <br>  Espero te guste.

Ah, me olvidaba, lleva pimienta negra (la original lleva repollo, no sé exactamente, yo hago una sopa de verduras + la remolacha).  Te puede quedar la cocina salpicada como si hubieran pasado los muchachos de Al Capone, pero el resultado es color de remolacha con gusto a sopa.<br>  Los rusos le ponen una cucharada de crema agria, queda muy bonito el color remolacha con el blanco en el medio (yo le pongo mendicrim).<br>  Bon appetit|`|cjRDvOuvaa	Bueno ya no sireve, ya no las podes comer, pedile a alguein consejos para que te salgan bien las remolachas...No hay otra cosa que hacer!|`|dLzW5yB5aa	hechales colorante morado|`|0SNaxSW3aa	cortalos en rodajas, mescla un poco de aceite, sal y vinagre, agregale semillas de kümel y aderesa la remolachas con ella.<br>  Y a disfrutar que es sabrosa.|`|18ac8e0f3f65cbf191277fab0aee86b5aa	querido cyberamigo, te paso eso por que las remolachas no se llerven sino que se ponen en esas ollas que vienen con on colador encima entonces pones agua a la olla hasta la mitad y cuando el agua este hirviendo pones el colador pero muy importante que no tope el agua y luego lavas bien la remolacha la partes en cuatro pedazos y las pones encima del colador eso en mi país se llama cocinar al vapor y veras que no se le va el color a la remolacha y te quedan deliciosas aparte que conserva todos los nutrientes que si la llerves . espero que te haya servido el consejo, que Dios te bendiga|`|3IjZfDOpaa	Nada, solo cómelas, a veces pasa, el resto, del agua colorada, puedes usarlo para te?ir alguna prenda de vestir. jajajaja. suerte!!!!!!|`|898b56d4ded6b7f058a3dd39366c7cc5aa	Si te gustan los alimentos de color rojo, te propongo comer alimentos más sabrosos y  SENSUALES que unas tristes remolachas:<br>  <br>  FRUTILLAS<br>  <br>  TOMATES.<br>  <br>  MORRONES<br>  <br>  CHURRASCO<br>  <br>  No sé si los tomates y los morrones te resultarán sensuales, pero bueno...

Un aceite es un producto de origen vegetal, insaturado, más fácil de digerir por tu organismo. Los lípidos necesrios para tu organismo los adquieres consumiendo oleaginosas como las nueces, los cacahuates, las almendras, las pepitas. También consumiendo aceite, el más recomendable es el aceite de olivo.

Place the pork tenderloin in a plastic, sealable bag. Pour marinade over the tenderloin and seal bag. Marinate overnight in the refrigerator. <br>  Preheat an outdoor grill or preheat oven to 350 degrees F. <br>  <br>  Remove pork tenderloin from marinade and pat dry. Brush olive oil onto grill and over meat for extra flavor. Reserve marinade. Grill tenderloin until cooked through, about 30 minutes to 40 minutes over medium heat. Or roast in oven for 35 to 45 minutes. Allow meat to rest about 10 minutes before cutting into 2-inch serving pieces. <br>  <br>  While meat is grilling, bring reserved marinade to a boil in a small saucepan, then lower the heat and gently simmer until it is reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Stir occasionally. Drizzle a small amount of marinade over each piece of meat.|`|2be2aec81030aba0e4e2455db78d8f66aa	Put a thin coat of mustard on it.

Place the roast in a large zipper bag and pour in the marinade.  Seal the bag and marinate overnight.<br>  <br>  Roast the meat according to traditional timing and temperature, using the marinade to baste it occasionally.  Stop basting at least 1/2 hour before you are finished roasting, so the heat can kill off any bacteria that might have resided in the meat and marinade during the overnight process.<br>  <br>  This will produce a tender, flavorful  pork roast with a vaguely Italian flavor.|`|xyjg3FkPaa	Here in the south I do it like this...................put pork roast in a bag and cover with one 20 oz bottle of coca cola.

Add 1 beaten egg and 5 or six finely crushed saltines, 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning and a tsp of minced fresh parsley.  Stir all together with a fork, breaking up the chunky bits of mackerel.  If the mixture seems wet, add a few more crushed saltines.  Take 1/2 cup of this mixture into your hands and shape it into a rounded patty about 3/4" thick.  Do this until all of the mixture is made into patties.<br>  <br>  Perpare a hot frying pan with about 3 Tbs vegetable oil.  When the oil is hot, drop in the patties.

5681fd552adeb066b8b4b98a610b3744aa	Congelación, conservación y descongelación <br>  <br>  Carnes <br>  <br>  Debes de ser muy exigente respecto a la calidad, estado y frescor de las carnes que destinas a la congelación. Las porciones individuales tales como filetes, chuletillas o escalopes serán separadas entre sí mediante una hoja de aluminio o una película de celulosa para que puedan ser utilizados fácilmente y sin esperar a que estén descongelados. La congelación se realizará en plazos cortos. <br>  Las carnes de buey, cordero y ternera pueden ser conservadas durante 8 a 12 meses; la duración de conservación del cerdo es más corta, debido a su contenido en materia grasa. Los despojos sólo tienen una duración máxima de 4 meses. La descongelación es una operación muy importante y se pueden emplear varias formas: en el refrigerador, con agua fría, con la cocción o calentamiento de los platos<br>  <br>  Pescados y mariscos <br>  El pescado se presta a una buena congelación, pero hay que tener en cuenta que es un producto delicado. Y debe congelarse antes de pasar tres horas después de su captura; por eso no debe congelarse lo que se compra en el mercado. <br>  Su conservación en el congelador no debe sobrepasar más de 6 meses, según la clase de pescado que sea, bien azul o blanco. <br>  <br>  Su descongelación se debe hacer en su embalaje, antes de ser cocinados. Y su duración es de dos o tres horas según el grosor del paquete. También se puede colocar bajo el grifo del agua sin desenvolverlo. Por norma general los pescados que se vayan a consumir hervidos no hace falta descongelarlos.<br>  <br>  <br>  Legumbres y fruta <br>  Para su buena congelación hay que tener en cuenta la maduración y frescura de los productos que se van a utilizar. Es fundamental utilizar sólo los productos cogidos frescos, pues los vegetales pierden cualidades de sabor y valor nutritivo. <br>  Las legumbres deben ser lavadas y limpiadas de la misma manera que si se fueran a consumir inmediatamente. Acto seguido deben escaldarse y en algunos casos hasta secarlas. <br>  <br>  El escaldado consiste en introducir las verduras en agua hirviendo durante unos minutos y a continuación pasarlas por agua fría, escurrirlas y esperar a que estén completamente frías para su congelación. <br>  <br>  La preparación de la fruta es mucho más delicada pues necesita una serie de preparativos antes de su congelación que debe hacerse en las horas siguientes a su recolección. Para su protección se deben envolver en azúcar en polvo o en un jarabe, a?adiendo zumo de limón para que no pierda acidez. Según la fruta que se vaya a utilizar se podrá lavar, mientras que en otros casos se deberá pelar. <br>  <br>  Las manzanas como las peras tendrán de ser peladas y cortadas en trozos y seguidamente sumergirlas en un jarabe de azúcar caliente durante unos tres minutos, después se procederá a colocar la fruta en los recipientes adecuados, que por norma general serán recipientes rígidos; y sin demora se procederá a su congelación. <br>  <br>  Se podrán tener en el congelador una duración máxima de entre 6 y 12 meses, según la clase que sea, tanto en verduras como en frutas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Congelación de platos preparados <br>  Puedes congelar todo tipo de platos cocinados, según tus preferencias. Los asados los puedes tener durante dos o tres meses y luego puedes consumirlos fríos después de descongelarlos. Las carnes o pescados con salsas los podrás congelar siempre que la salsa la líes después de su descongelación; no habiendo ningún problema con los hervidos. Las verduras y potajes los puedes congelar aunque estén completamente cocidos, para que después con tan sólo descongelar y calentar está listo. <br>  Estos consejos te serán prácticos a la hora de congelar platos hechos: <br>  <br>  Disminuye la sal y la cantidad de grasa <br>  Reduce el tiempo de cocción <br>  Para ligar las salsas utiliza maicena <br>  Utiliza recipientes que puedas usar en el horno <br>  Recuerda siempre que una vez cocinados los platos y enfriados debes proceder a su inmediata congelación|`|XbMGGqvpaa	Tengo el conocimiento de que las carnes de todo tipo pueden estar congeladas durante mucho tiempo hasta a?os, aquí el problema no es que ya no sirva, porque mientras lo estan, el proceso de descomposición se detiene, pero la carne pierde su textura roja como la fresca, la carne se quema y se hace cafe pero esto no dismunuye sus propiedades, lo que las hace poco atractivas para nuestro consumo, lo interesante es que hay que saber como congelar la carne, la tienes que racionar, lo que vas a utilizar ponerlo en bolsas separadas de preferencia extraer el aire sobrante o al vacio,  para que cuando la descongeles la utlices, ya que si descongelas YA NO LA PUEDES VOLVER A CONGELAR solo se tiene que mantener refrigerada y por no más de dos días.|`|e13abe60b584fc9ab15ec40195386fcfaa	pescado 2 a 4 meses<br>  puerco  4 a 6 <br>  pollo  10 a 12<br>  carne 8 a 10 <br>  mariscos 1 a 2|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Pueden durar a?os, pero buenas para consumir, de preferencia que no pasen de tres meses.<br>  Saludos!|`|5Pbc4zHjaa	Pescados y mariscos de 2 a 3 meses<br>  Carnes frescas (pollo, cerdo, res) 3 meses<br>  Carnes procesadas (carne molida) 2 meses

P. americana puede alcanzar 20 m de altura. Su fruto, comestible, se llama "aguacate" como la planta o también "palta", "cura" o "abacate". Se divide en tres variedades: raza mexicana, raza guatemalteca y raza antillana.<br>  <br>  Las paltas originadas en las zonas altas del centro y este de México generan la Raza Mexicana, Las paltas originadas en las zonas altas de Guatemala generan la Raza Guatemalteca, y la Raza Antillana proviene de las primeras plantas encontradas en Las Antillas. Con respecto al origen de la Raza Antillana, existen discrepancias puesto que cabe la posibilidad de que los primeros paltos existentes en Las Antillas hayan sido introducidas desde México por los espa?oles o los ingleses durante la colonización.<br>  <br>  Estas tres razas de palta, desde la antigüedad se fueron mezclando naturalmente entre ellas por medio de su propio sistema de reproducción. El resultado de estas fusiones; producidas por medio de "polinización cruzada"; dieron origen a incontables variedades Híbridas naturales indefinidas. Recién a partir de principios del siglo pasado (1900) se comenzaron a seleccionar paltos de excelentes atributos para ganar mercados consumidores, dando origen a los distintos cultivares que durante décadas lideraron los mercados mundiales. Todas estas nuevas variedades funcionaron bien hasta que en el a?o 1935 se patentó en Estados Unidos una nueva variedad llamada “Hass”, de progenitores desconocidos (pero con más porcentaje de guatemalteca), originado en La Habra, un lugar de California, donde el Sr. Rudolph Gay Hass la detectó entre los árboles de su huerto.|`|tcOY9lUGaa	SI ES SANO PERO CON EXESO TE SACA ESPINILLAS O GRANOS SUERTE
ahoRHHnuaa	NO!! el almíbar se separa...<br>  es como cuando pones jugo en el freezer... se separa el color y el azúcar y te queda como un hielo el resto... <br>  te conviene ponerlo en la heladera y te duran varios días mas... 1 semana por lo menos.|`|85763e04d55025e07368cd2a218b3c28aa	No se pueden guardar se malogra el almibar.|`|dF2s3sr0aa	No puedes.Pero sí guardarlos en frasco<br>  de vidrio ,con su jugo,bien cerrado.<br>  Podrás tenerlos en la heladera unos días.|`|zJ9lxwoGaa	No.<br>  Salvo que después quieras usarlos para una torta, no podrás desfreezarlos y comerlos solitos: son un asco.<br>  Besos|`|YmG2YmlEaa	Una vez que abras cualquier alimento enlatado, lo debes guardar en el refirgerador, pues se pierde el cierre hermético que permite el paso de bacterias de descomposición. Los duraznos no sufren ningún cambio y los debes consumir en máximo una semana.<br>  Si los quieres congelar, lo más probable es que se va a da?ar la textura de los duraznos porque tiene gran cantidad de agua. Te pueden quedar sin firmeza y probablemente se oscurezcan.<br>  Te recomiendo que les a?adas algo de yogurth o crema ligera para batir, mezcles y congeles. Este postre se come semi-congelado, es decir, nunca se descongela totalmente y así no te darás cuenta de que los duraznos se han da?ado.|`|d9qclc4Xaa	Claro que si, siempre la comida y todo aquel alimento enlatado  que sea sobrante guardalo en el freezer en embase de plastico, el plastico hace que estos alimentos se conserven mejor y por mas tiempo.|`|9f00d18de1423c5666fce02714201175aa	?en el congelador? no.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Si, pero es mejor guardarlos en el refrigerador, en un frasco de vidrio, herméticamente cerrado para que duren mas. El almibar por si mismo los protege de la degradación. Pero si los metes al refrigerador y en un frasco limpio y herméticamente cerrado van a durar mas.<br>  Saludos!
SDHvDNGJaa	Puedes tomarla con manzana. Tomas dos cucharadas grandes copeteadas de avena, un cuarto de manzana jugosa en trozos, lo licúas con un vaso con agua y si quieres puedes endulzar al gusto con miel o si lo prefieres con splenda, o bien sin a?adir azúcar.<br>  Y listo, la puedes tomar antes del desayuno y no sabe mal.<br>  Saludos!!!|`|FiXkFZSmaa	Puedes mezclarla con linaza, para mejores resultados, prepara un baso de agua, le pones un poco de azúcar y le agregas la mezcla de avena con linaza,  el sabor que resulta es como de una deliciosa horchata.|`|CWpm2qqmaa	revuelvela con granola y ponle la fruta que quieras te preparas un rico licuado, si lo refrigeras mejor|`|EJ6cAfdDaa	Hola...
