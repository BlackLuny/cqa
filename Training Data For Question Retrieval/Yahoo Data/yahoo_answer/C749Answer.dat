PjW3Yo2saa	works just fine.. done it many time..<br>  but you need to take out the top and all of the white <br>  parts from the berry<br>  more or less cut a cone shape out of the top of the berry<br>  just place it on top or push it some of the way in<br>  ive use pineapple, organges, tangerines, apples,, and grapes<br>  never had any problems,,|`|0KatzHYhaa	Can you put a whole strawberry on top as a garnish? Put the chopped or sliced strawberries to the batter instead then once it's baked, put some frosting on top then top it with fanned strawberry? <br>  <br>  I think a whole strawberry would make the cupcake soggy and mushy.|`|GiBUKFJYaa	i wouldnt suggest baking a whole strawberry into the cupcake because it would cause the berry to steam and thats not very good  tasting instead why dont you use a strawberry mix or cut it up into smaller pieces and mix it in and you can finish it off with a strawberry icing and a fresh whole strawberry fanned out on top!|`|9LFjvDzzaa	A baked strawberry would be fairly nasty. When you make the cupcake, very carefully cut the top of the cupcake off; hollow out the inside a little with your finger or a spoon and put the strawberry in. If I were you, I'd also drizzle some strawberry syrup in it.|`|L8RVJ4soaa	Hi,I would say the easiest way would be to kinda push them in after cooking had started so they wouldn't sink.But depending on your' recipe your' batter may be adequate.The solution could lie with smaller pieces of berrie so the may not sink.<br>  Or consider adding pieces to thee entire mix like chocolate chips.<br>  Hope that helps.

They are patting you down to find hard objects hidden!  The only way to do it is to strap a ziplock bag to your crotch.|`|YUjVFkocaa	I know that drinking has long been established as being "tite" and cool people do it, blah blah blah...<br>  <br>  But I simply don't see why that's the case! Drinking has been shown to mess you up in every aspect of life.<br>  <br>  Intellectually, it makes you dumber- in the short run, AND in the long run.<br>  <br>  Financially, it kills your money, drains you of stuff, and being drunk can lead to you being robbed or raped.<br>  <br>  Morally, the Bible states that drunkards "will not enter into the kingdom of heaven". So not only does drinking lower moral standards and screw up your earthly life, but it screws up your afterlife as well!<br>  <br>  Physically, drinking severely damages your liver and kidneys, and it causes apparent but less significant damage to the brain, to blood vessels, and to skin cells. This is why alcoholics often have slightly bigger veins, and dry, wrinkly skin, and age much quicker.<br>  <br>  Emotionally, drinking causes you to forget what happened last night, which can lead to psychological/emotional breakdowns. It also can cause you to have a "lapse in judgment", which usually results in sex or crime, and this is usually followed by shame, guilt, remorse, hopelessness, fear, anger, and regret.<br>  <br>  ====================<br>  <br>  Good riddance to you. I've been drinking 3 times in my life- and I can remember them all. One was at a sophomore party, one was a beach party, and one was with my ex, about a month and a half ago.<br>  <br>  I'm a Junior now, and let me tell you this: I may not be mature in some ways, but certainly I am mature enough to not stick my head in a sand like an ignorant duck, when they teach us the long-term many-pronged dangers of alcohol and drinking. I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed... but at least I've learned not to intentionally kill myself.<br>  <br>  If you want to drink, then go ahead. If you want to pay money to damage, embarrass, exploit, use, and ridicule yourself.... be my GUEST!<br>  <br>  But I'm telling you..... you'll regret it. Everybody always does, in the end. Either you'll piss all your money away, get raped sometime from passing out from whiskey, or end up getting bad grades and a bad job, because the alcohol affected your brain and killed brain cells.<br>  <br>  Or you'll end up like my brother.<br>  <br>  ===================<br>  <br>  My older brother died in a car accident, coming home from a party. His car flipped on a curb, and he was thrown from the car, and killed. There wasn't another car in sight. The cause? Alcohol. And his girlfriend luckily was alive (although hurt, and drunk as well) because she wore her seatbelt. But let it be known.... alcohol KILLS.<br>  =================<br>  <br>  Guns don't kill. DRUGS kill.<br>  =================================<br>  Source(s):<br>  n my opinion, drinking alone proves the devil's existence.<br>  <br>  Why, you ask?<br>  <br>  Because only in a society where sin is promoted, SOLELY on the basis of sin...<br>  <br>  Would losing money, slurring speech, getting raped, getting robbed, having a bad job, losing friends, aging faster, dying young, getting bad breath and rotten teeth, and getting physically weaker and slower, BE CONSIDERED "COOL"!<br>  <br>  You can still go to parties without drinking! Good god! I know sooo many girls my age who love to go to parties and drink... I stopped going to most of them cuz of this! it just pisses me off, that they feel the NEED to drink.<br>  <br>  If they're horny, GREAT! LET them go to parties, hang out, laugh, talk, make out with random guys, and have sex. But why the hell do they need the alcohol to do that? Do they simply want an EXCUSE to act immorally?? I SAY, if you plan on doing sh*t like that, just throw your conscience out the window!<br>  <br>  Cuz a lack of a conscience for a night, is better than a lack of life or a lack of money, because you pissed away your life or money with alcohol!<br>  <br>  Alcohol doesn't do a single positive thing for you. The drunk feeling is equaled out by a hangover of equal value, as well as headaches that night, and a burning in the chest.... so why do ppl like them?<br>  <br>  The fact that it makes you more open to talking is good- but in my opinion, people who have to drink to become outgoing and popular are f*gs, clowns! Why the hell do you need a drug to make you cool? Shyyyyttt I was born that way. I can talk to who i want, when i want, how i want, and get a girl if i want... as long as i put my mind to it, and focus on what to say.<br>  <br>  People who drink alcohol to be cool are the same as people who take steroids or HGH to get better at sports. They are cheaters and frauds, and in the end, they are hurting themselves instead of helping themselves.<br>  <br>  The short-term gains by ppl thinking they're cooler for doing it, is more than canceled out by the long-term harms.|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\|`|fk8wXA3Saa	my buddie and i snuck 3liters of vodka into a Ozzfest concert by buying colostomy bags and filling the with vodka and lemonade when they went to pat me down i told them it was a colostomy bag and explained its medical use they didnt want to even see the contents but i showed them the bag and asked where the nearest restroom was .<br>  They were grossed out and waved me by !|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Not gonna happen bud.|`|KOctm8uKaa	Drink it....|`|D2VJP1ADaa	I got a 5th of Captain Morgan into a college football game last year thanks to a diversion by a friend.

If they washed away all the yeast there would be no alcohol.  But even if there was a little yeast.. they could multiply still.  I think it would take longer to ferment.  Kinda like yeast in bread, the more you add the sooner it will rise.  The reason for them doing it I could only guess.  What really defines alcohol content would be the amount of sugar present in the grape..or added.

They were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease." <br>  <br>  Particular attention was paid to the various factors that result in the formation of blood clots, Dr Willoughby said, including stickiness of the blood and the proper functioning of the patient's blood vessels. <br>  <br>  "If you get an increase in stickiness and a decreased ability of the blood vessels to stop its stickiness, that adds up to a bad situation," he said. <br>  <br>  "If you add in other risk factors for cardiovascular disease - stress or high blood pressure - this could be potentially deadly." <br>  <br>  He said these and other factors, such as the effects of Red Bull when mixed with alcohol, would be the subject of further studies. <br>  <br>  While Red Bull is already banned in countries such as Norway and Denmark, Dr Willoughby said there would have to be further research before it could be banned in Australia. <br>  <br>  "The can currently comes with a warning of its own," he said. "But if you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease, I'd think twice about drinking it."|`|Q8fcepcZaa	relentless|`|7xfnu8ozaa	I stopped drinking them.

It wasn't even designed to be a food substance. It may have less calories but it is really not good for you.<br>  <br>  Margarine and similar hydrogenated or processed polyunsaturated oils are potentially more detrimental to your health than any saturated fat.7 For more information on why you should avoid all processed oils read Why the Processing of Consumable Oils Has Devastated America's Health.<br>  <br>  <br>  Include Real Butter as part of Your Body Ecology Lifestyle<br>  <br>  As many of you already know, I am a strong proponent of including a variety of healthy oils and fats into your diet. Together they work as a team to supply your body with essential fatty acids for longevity, hormone balance, heart health, sharp vision, glowing moist skin and energy. The wonderful variety of oils and fats certainly includes organic, preferably raw butter. Cultured raw butter is even better. <br>  <br>  And why would I be so insistent that you eat butter? Take a look at the long list of the benefits you receive when you include it in your diet:8<br>  <br>  Butter is rich in the most easily absorbable form of Vitamin A necessary for thyroid and adrenal health. <br>  <br>  Contains lauric acid, important in treating fungal infections and candida.<br>  <br>  Contains lecithin, essential for cholesterol metabolism.<br>  <br>  Contains anti-oxidants that protect against free radical damage.<br>  <br>  Has anti-oxidants that protect against weakening arteries.<br>  <br>  Is a great source of Vitamins E and K.<br>  <br>  Is a very rich source of the vital mineral selenium.<br>  <br>  Saturated fats in butter have strong anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties.<br>  <br>  Butter contains conjugated linoleic acid, which is a potent anti-cancer agent, muscle builder, and immunity booster<br>  <br>  Vitamin D found in butter is essential to absorption of calcium.<br>  <br>  Protects against tooth decay.<br>  <br>  Is your only source of an anti-stiffness factor, which protects against calcification of the joints.<br>  <br>  Anti-stiffness factor in butter also prevents hardening of the arteries, cataracts, and calcification of the pineal gland.<br>  <br>  Is a source of Activator X, which helps your body absorb minerals.<br>  <br>  Is a source of iodine in highly absorbable form.<br>  <br>  May promote fertility in women.9 <br>  Is a source of quick energy, and is not stored in our bodies adipose tissue.<br>  <br>  Cholesterol found in butterfat is essential to children's brain and nervous system development. <br>  <br>  Contains Arachidonic Acid (AA) which plays a role in brain function and is a vital component of cell membranes.<br>  <br>  Protects against gastrointestinal infections in the very young or the elderly. <br>  <br>  Raw, Organic Butter is the Best<br>  <br>  Believe me this is only a partial list. If a woman is pregnant, hopes to become pregnant or is nursing her baby, I think it should even become a law for her to eat butter for her baby's developing brain, bones and teeth. <br>  <br>  The best butter you can eat is raw, organic butter because pasteurization destroys nutrients. Unfortunately, the sale of raw butter is prohibited in most of our 50 states.<br>  <br>   <br>  Are you finding it difficult to get organic, raw butter? Don't worry! Making your own delicious cultured butter with Body Ecology Culture Starter is an easy way to get on the right track towards health<br>   <br>  You can, however, make your own healthy butter, and it is easier than you think. Look into our Body Ecology Culture Starter, which you simply add to organic cream. After letting this mixture sit at room temperature for 24 hours, chill it, beat it with a whisk, and voila! You'll have healthy, probiotic butter that is delicious!<br>  <br>  Cultured butter is full of health sustaining good bacteria like lactobacillus planterum, and lactococcus lactis. These microflora are essential for a healthy inner ecosystem. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sources of Healthy Butter<br>  <br>  If you don't want to culture your own butter, I recommend butter from grass-fed animals only. A good source is U.S. Wellness Meats.<br>  <br>  I also recommend Activator X and Vitamin rich butter oil, made by Green Pastures.<br>  <br>  <br>  Heart Healthy-the Body Ecology Way<br>  <br>  Completely eliminating butter and other healthy animal source fats is NOT the Body Ecology way. It is not how our ancestors thrived, and not what nature intended. <br>  <br>  How much should you eat each day? Like sea salt, your own body will tell you how much to eat.

VKQzj4Pmaa	Fructose is a simple sugar found naturally in honey and in many ripe fruits. If the ingredients did not say the phrase "high fructose corn syrup," then no, it does not contain that ingredient. It only contains corn syrup (processed suagr) and fructose (natural sugar). HFCS is not made by combining the two together.<br>  <br>  "There is no such thing as a natural corn syrup pressed directly from corn kernels. Instead, the pulpy middle layer called cornstarch is first separated from the outer husk and the inner germ layers. The cornstarch is then stored in giant vats, where natural enzymes are added to break it down into glucose. It is these sugars which are heated and turned into what we call corn syrup.<br>  <br>  Corn syrup is almost exactly as sweet as the granulated sugar (sucrose) it often replaces in recipes. Corn syrup can be naturally light in color which is often used in candymaking or darker which is usually used for general baking purposes. <br>  <br>  The advantage of corn syrup over sugar is its resistance to crystallization. A candy lollipop made with corn syrup will retain its smooth texture, while a similar treat made from pure sugar may turn into a hardened rock candy. Corn syrup also prohibits crystal formation when sugar is added to a cake or fudge mixture.<br>  <br>  High fructose corn syrup is subjected to additional processes as compared to regular corn syrup. First, three types of enzymes (alpha-amylase, glucoamylase, and glucose-isomerase) are successively added to change the starch to glucose and then fructose. Pure glucose is then added to the mixture to create some ratio of fructose to glucose which comprises the final product — high fructose corn syrup. Since the United States Department of Agriculture subsidizes corn production but taxes imported sugar, high fructose corn syrup has become the default sweetener in many consumer food products.<br>  <br>  High fructose corn syrup manufacturers insist that their product is just as healthy as the sucrose sugar it replaces in soft drinks, plus the savings in taxes keeps domestic food prices low. Opponents of high fructose corn syrup point to studies indicating serious health problems in laboratory rats fed a constant diet of high fructose corn syrup. Other sugars like sucrose can be processed by every cell in the human body, but fructose must be broken down in the liver. Over a lifetime, the liver may become overworked by a diet heavy in fructose."|`|cQk8usneaa	High Fructose Corn Syrup is bad. However, corn syrup, and fructose are fine! Fructose just means sugar. Some salad dressings also contain it. Also get rid of anything with transfats, and PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED OILS they are both way worse that High Fructose Corn Syrup! Please vote me best! I was in the same situation and we had to check EVERYTHING! stores like traderjoes and whole foods don't carry anything with HFCS Or Hydrogenated oils. Also you're jelly probably has HFCS

The drier the wine the less sugar is contains. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Dry Champagne: ~2.5 to 4.5 grams<br>  Dry White (e.g. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay): ~3 grams<br>  ”Off Dry” (e.g. Reisling, Chenin Blanc): ~5 to 6 grams<br>  Muscat:~8 grams<br>  Dry Red (e.g. Syrah, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sav.): ~3.5 to 4 grams<br>  Zinfindel: 4.2 grams<br>  Dessert Wines: 12 to 14 grams<br>  Sweet Late Harvest Wine: 20 grams "

Heat the oil in a skillet and lightly brown eggplant slices over moderate heat for 3 minutes. Remove and put into a serving bowl. Cool. Put the tomato sauce, pepper, chile, cinnamon, mint and 1/2 tsp. salt, if wanted, in a pan. Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes, which is long enough to integrate the flavors. Pour this over the eggplant; refrigerate until ready to use. The salad can remain in the refrigerator for several days.

9ko5WUFkaa	If you can get the cork back in, that's the best.  Usually you can't, so get one of the air-tight bottle stoppers they sell specifically for champagne.  They only cost a few dollars and any homewares store will have them.  Keep it in the fridge.<br>  <br>  If you haven't got a bottle stopper on hand and need to keep a bottle, wrap some plastic wrap around the bottle top tightly and put a rubber band on it to seal the bottle.  You want to try and keep the air out of it.  This is not a great option but it will help.  Some of the old tricks like putting a silver spoon in the neck of the bottle simply don't work and actually make it go flat faster - the Mythbusters tested this and they found you are better just putting the open bottle in the fridge with nothing over the silver spoon.  And always put it in the fridge!!!<br>  <br>  Though who ever needs to store open champagne?  I'd just drink it....|`|Q7IthmTFaa	I've never had any around long enough to have to store it.|`|NnPJI27jaa	You can buy a devise that re corks it and it will keep several days in the frig.

MIZi6GLeaa	Lone Star uses "corn extract." It is a fermentable sugar used in brewing. There are a couple adjuncts in beer brewing: rice, used in Budweiser, and; corn, used in Lone Star. They lighten a beer's body and flavor, and bring absolutely NOTHING to good brewing.<br>  <br>  Read the bottle, it should have; malted barley, hops, yeast, water. That's it!!<br>  <br>  ok...ok...a well made wheat beer is nice in the summer, and oatmeal is tasty in a good stout.... but corn in beer??? NEVER!!<br>  <br>  And as to high fructose corn syrup, I don't know if any brewer uses it. I doubt any beer made from it would be drinkable.

The problem is with the sodium. And the sodium will make you retain water.<br>  <br>  Jerkey is an excellent source of protien wich helps keep you full longer, so you don't need to eat as much.<br>  <br>  To make good jerkey you need tostart with leaner beef (or meat of choice) Longhorn cows for instant make better jerkey as they are alreadya pretty lean cow. Wild game as well makes good jerkey as they as leaner.|`|o1hW0liBaa	First off, nothing eaten in moderation will make you fat.  To answer your question, you really need to look at the nutrition label. If you get turkey jerky it will generally have less calories, but some beef jerky can be relatively low cal as well. Its also a good source of portable protein.  Obviously though the downside is that they contain a lot of salt and presertatives.|`|DSg4fgnEaa	Yes, they are bad for you.  Will they make you fat, yes.  But only because of all the chemicals they put into it.  MSG is a very good preservative but one of the most popularly known to be very bad.  But there is more then just that in commercial beef jerky.  If you made your own beef jerky at home you'd be fine.  It would actually be a healthy snack.  Kevin Trudeau's book told me what to look for in food labels.  His book is crazy but I learned a lot from it.|`|8H170msDaa	They won't necessarily make you fat. It's all about portion size. Nothing makes you fat unless you eat a whole bunch of it and if it has a large fat content. It is definitely ok to eat jerky etc. but in small doses. Have 1 or 2 pieces once in a while and you'll be fine.|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	check the nutritional content. Most are greasy and fattening.

WhVSb2fbaa	1. Beer Pong - A test of drunken skill and aim. Perhaps the greatest drinking game ever invented???<br>  <br>        How to Play Beer Pong:<br>  <br>            Keg Cups (usually 6 or 10) are partially filled with beer and set up in a diamond shape on each ends of the beer pong table. When a ping pong ball lands in an opposing players cup, that cup must be drank by the opposing player. The winner is the player with the most cups left. <br>  <br>        beer pong<br>        Beer Pong Cup Formation<br>  <br>     2. Flip Cup - A great drinking game for groups who are energetic and like doing something active. This game can get loud, as with most drinking games. But, the competitiveness this game brings is fun!<br>  <br>        Game Summary:<br>        Flip Cup<br>        Flip Cup<br>  <br>            Its a team based drinking relay race. Two teams line up opposite of each other at a table. First person chugs their beer out of their keg cup. The next person can't go until the person before them has drank all their beer and set their cup on the edge of the table and successfully "flipped it" until it has landed upright. <br>  <br>     3. Quarters - Test your ability and accuracy by bouncing quarters off a table and into another's drink. A great ice breaker...just go up to someone and say "drink" and slam a quarter on the table and sink it in their drink. Ok, not really, but a fun game to play at home or at the bar.<br>  <br>        Kings<br>        Typical Kings Rules<br>     4. Kings Cup - Another great drinking game for big groups. This card game is not only fun and entertaining...it'll get you drunk!<br>  <br>        Game Play:<br>  <br>            Place a beer on the table and cards face down in a circle around it. Who ever draws the 4th King has to chug the beer in the middle. Each card turned over before the 4th King has it's own rule, giving many variations to the game. <br>  <br>     5. Presidents & Assholes (card game) - Which one are you? There are many different house variations of this game. The idea is to be the first to get rid of all your cards to become President. The person who finishes last in the round, is the Asshole.<br>  <br>     6. Bullshit (card game) - Call out your friends if they are BS'ing you. The point of this game is try to lie and try and get away with it. But, if your opponents call "Bullshit" and catch you lying, you have to drink.<br>  <br>     7. 3-man (Dice game) - A pretty simple dice game that will always get the "3-man" drunk. Time to bust out your dice rolling (craps) skills because every time you roll a "3" the 3-man drinks.<br>  <br>     8. High or Low (card game)- Another one of those pointless drinking games where the idea is to get drunk. Grab a deck of cards and start turning over the cards one by one. You guess whether the next card will be higher or lower, and if you guess wrong you drink.<br>  <br>     9. Shotgun - A race to see who can drink the fastest. Something that is argued over between guys at every party you go to.<br>  <br>    10. **** the Dealer (card game)- The point of this game is to get the "dealer"...well, you know. Its a card guessing game that involves a lot of drinking.

I assume the soccer ball shape pan is in 2 pieces in order to put the batter in and get the cake out. And I also assume that your recipe tells you how much batter to place in each half. That being said bake<br>  your cake following directions in the recipe.<br>   I would test for done ness by gently pressing <br>  down with my finger in the center of cake after it has baked to a nice golden brown if done it will spring back from the touch if not done it will leave a dent from your finger { bake a little longer} until it does spring back. When done<br>  remove from oven place cake up side down on a cookie sheet and let cool completely. In the past I have allowed angle food cakes to cool over night, they become a little firmer and are <br>   easier to remove from the pan. To remove from pan [with your fingers press cake down and at the same time pull the cake gently away from side of pan working around the top of pan when cake is free from pan all the way around a 1/2 in. <br>  or so turn it over and give it a good whack on a cutting board give the pan a 1/4 turn and whack again keeping the cake at about a 45 degree<br>  angel from the cutting board or counter top,<br>  just keep whacking until cake releases from pan.<br>   With your hands remove the crumbs by gently rubbing them off cake.

If it is greased the cake will fall to the bottom of the pan and wont be light and airy. You could try greasing just the bottom or using parchment on just the bottom. You have to cool it in the pan too, usually upside down so I'm not sure how it will work. I have seen them made in a tube pan though, so.....It might just have to be trial and hopefully no error!

I've never seen an angel food cake come out of the pan "clean," they always leave a crumb layer behind.

DT2mU1jOaa	This may be a bit sloppy C&P.<br>  It's widely assumed that wine and cheese are compatible friends. They're paired together so routinely that phrases like "the white wine and Brie crowd" can be used to define a social set. But all is not well in this friendship. At least one wine writer has recognized this, according to brew master and gourmand Garrett Oliver of Brooklyn Brewing: Willy Gluckstern, a somewhat cranky New York wine critic, called wine and cheese a "train wreck in the mouth." <br>  Not many folks realize that beer and cheese have far more in common than wine and cheese. Both are simple and nutritious, each born of Graminae and carefully nurtured in an ancient fermentation process. Of course, the beer aficionado must be forgiving of the fact that cheese residue remaining on the lips will crash the finest head formations of any beer. If you can put up with that inconvenience, you'll find that most beer styles are quite compatible with most cheese types. <br>  The same cannot be said of wine and cheese. Naturally, some wines do go well with some cheeses, but the pairing is much trickier. <br>  The wedding of Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces is fraught with perils of another nature. The marriage of milk and grain is a melding of fat and carbohydrates--calories compounded by more calories. This is not a diet for the weak hearted nor for weight-loss champions. Deal with it. Remember, losing weight is fun only if you have some to lose.<br>  <br>  It is fascinating to consider that both beer and cheese are the result of ferments. That of beer produces alcohol, while that of cheese produces acid. Not to worry; both processes have matured over the centuries. Early beer was dark, overbearing and sometimes wild, whereas cheese evolved from a sour, semi-solid mess. Your beer, in those times, was limited to what your local brewer could produce, and the same was true of cheese. You took what you could get or could make yourself. <br>  Over the centuries, beer has become the sophisticated and wide-ranging delight that we know and love. In recent years, large companies may have reduced the brewing process to the lowest levels conceivable in their attempts to satisfy the most people possible. Despite that, modern beer is undergoing a revolution in which the old styles are being brought back and new styles are evolving. Beer is alive and moving right along. <br>  Cheese, too, has undergone a similar revolution. Cheeze Whiz and Velveeta are no longer the epitome of mass-marketed cheese, any more than "lite" beer is that of the beer industry. Small American cheese makers are undertaking the manufacture of ever more obscure cheese types from across the world, just as craft brewers have revived ancient artisanal brewing processes.<br>  Moreover, like beer, cheese comes in many forms. Cheese ranges in density from very soft and gooey to relatively hard, and can be made from the milk of dairy cows, sheep and goats. Although rare, cheeses have also been produced from a wide-ranging bestiary, including such oddities as yaks, reindeer, camels, water buffalo, and even zebras. These are creatures on which one can barely imagine locating udders, let alone milking them. Indeed, there is a story of cheese made from the milk of manatees, although it strains the imagination to envision a method of milk extraction from that water-bound species. <br>  What these milk-producers have in common is that they are all vegetarians--grass and grain eaters. Grass is indeed the common element for the relationship between beer and cheese. <br>  <br>  -Poster from Fred Eckherdt, on AAB mag-<br>  What Beer? Which Cheese? <br>  Yes, beer does indeed go with cheese; but beer and cheese combinations only appear to be simple. The reality is that, at times, this wedding can be perilous and difficult to manage. <br>  <br>  Most cheese authorities agree that there are some eight different categories or styles in the world of cheese. Let us examine each to see what beer types will complement them. <br>  <br>  1. Fresh, very soft cheeses are uncooked and unripe or barely ripened; coagulated with rennet or by lactic fermentation, or even by using lemon juice; and packed simply into tubs, crocks, or molded by hand. Some are very soft, even spoonable. Very soft cheeses include pot cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese and ricotta Beer: These cheeses have low taste profiles and go well with more mellow beers such as American wheat beer, American lagers, amber lagers, and Munich lagers. <br>  2. Soft, spreadable cheeses, such as Camembert or Brie, have bloomy rinds. Beer: These go well with Euro-lagers, pilsners, pale ales, porters and American fruit ales. <br>  3. Semi-soft cheeses include many monastic cheeses and washed rind cheeses that are cured with brine, beer, wine or spices. Trappist cheeses and muenster are good examples, as are Gouda, havarti, Tilsit, Liederkrantz, Port-Salut and American, Colby, Monterey jack and similar cheeses. Beer: These all go with more energetic beer at the lower end of the hop rate, such as English brown ales, amber ales, golden ales, bitters, and Belgian pale ales, plus Vienna lagers, mellow bocks, or Oktoberfest brews, not to mention rye ales and Bavarian whites.<br>  <br>  4. Semi-hard, sliceable cheese. Cheddar (there are many varieties, including white aged cheddar), Swiss, Cheshire, Tilsit, and other sliceable cheeses, such as Edam, Gruyere, emmentaler, Jarlsberg, and aged Gouda. Beer: Good sandwich cheeses go well with pilsners, extra special bitters and pale ales, plus IPAs, double bocks, strong ales and almost any Belgian ale, particularly wits and fruit ales. <br>  5. Hard cheese. These are very firm, grainy, cooked and pressed grating cheeses, such as parmigiano. But they are also nice nibbley cheeses and need something heavy in a beverage. Beer: Strong ale or doppelbock, stout or porter. <br>  6. Blue vein, marbled cheese, strong flavored and crumbly, including Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and other blues, especially those from Wisconsin, but particularly including Maytag Blue from Iowa. Beer: Try stronger porters, stouts, and heavier dark beers, such as old ales, barley wines, and Imperial stouts. The latter matches Stilton especially well. <br>  7. Goat cheeses--chevre--are usually a bit more flavorful than regular cheeses of similar types. Roquefort, romano and feta are good examples. We should note here that goat cheeses are at the cutting edge of popularity these days. Beer: Think IPAs, ESBs, American brown ales, stouts and porters. <br>  8. Pasta filata are the stretched curd cheeses of Italy, such as mozzarella and provolone. Beer: They go well with Belgian wits, Bavarian whites, and heavier Bavarian wheat beers (doppelweizen).|`|ewUQuX4Kaa	Unless "noncompliance" is actaully Fred Eckherdt, world-reknown drinks expert, than his posting is the worst form of plaigiarism ever...<br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutbeer.com/food/232-cheeseandbeer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutbeer.com/food/232-che...</a><br>  Although every point made is 110% true.<br>  <br>  Wine and cheese?

An animal that was similar to a chicken must have laid an egg and in that egg, a mutation must have taken place, therefore creating the chicken. The chicken's just a descendant from another bird that used to exist a long time ago. Scientists say it descended from both the red junglefowl and the gray junglefowl birds.<br>  <br>  And then comes religion. According to most religions, including Christianity, most animals were created by God. So according to that, the Chicken came first.|`|7nRJb2qCaa	It all depends on how you think we got here. If you believe in God, He obviously made the chicken first, He wouldn't just plant a random egg and expect it to hatch it like that. If you believe in evolution, It could've been the egg. Like, two animals that resemble the modern-day chicken could've had an egg and it finally turned out looking like a chicken and not the parent species (which probably wasn't an exact chicken).|`|MjJSWaUsaa	the chicken, there would be nothing to keep the egg warm and alive if it wasnt first. I spent many hours contemplating this and I used to have more evidence but I cant remember at the moment sorry.<br>  <br>  oh and more evidence<br>  <br>  "The embryo must have food while it is growing. It gets its nourishment from the yolk of the egg. That is why the egg cell is always attached to the side of the yolk. A day or two before the chick hatches it pulls what is left of the yolk into it’s abdomen through its umbilical cord. To use as a food source after it hatches."<br>  <br>  so the egg/chick need nutrients from the yolk, throught the umbilical cord, before it hatches.. CHICKEN CAME FIRST!|`|mRWAn2vHaa	my answer would be the chicken because you have to have a chicken to even get the egg in the first place.|`|D2vVMbdlaa	The chicken goes first, because if the egg goes first it would not hatch because there is no warmth that is coming from the chicken.|`|UW97kf4Baa	The chicken comes first.

You can choose to fry your corn tortillas to make "fried tacos" (I prefer them this way for beef, chicken and turkey tacos only) or you can go the low fat route and just warm the tortillas to make "soft tacos."

z4Xpzm3xaa	Caffeine, also known as guaranine, mateine or theine depending on the source plant, is considered a psychoactive drug. However, it has not been designated a controlled substance, so its use in teas, coffees and sodas is not illegal.

J2Y5zx4Saa	The overall moisture of the dough and bake time is what impacts the chewiness of the cookie.

I always under bake my cookies. I take them out of the oven, and leave them on the pan for awhile. They will continue to cook a little because they are sitting on the hot pan. If the cookies are premade from the store, you definitely need to under bake. Those kinds of cookies will continue to bake after taken out of oven.|`|D3rw1C8faa	The only proven thing that makes cookes "CHEWY" is brown sugar.  If your recipe calls for white sugar and you like a chewy cookie and don't have any brown sugar, you can use white sugar but add some molasses or sorghum to the sugar.  You can try baking the cookies a minute or two less than what the recipe calls for and you can also use a few more tablespoons of butter if you like.  The butter just really adds calories, fat and greasiness to the cookies.   Just remember, fat is what makes food taste better.|`|MsgqchCPaa	more butter will make it greasier<br>  less butter might mess up your cookies<br>  try more baking powder or baking soda<br>  not that much though<br>  but if you also want to try more butter, go for it<br>  :D|`|uNsiGqQPaa	The way to make cookies chewier is to have less time in the oven. not to sure if the butter content makes a difference.

When your peppers and onions are cooked, add in desired amount of pineapple and chili sauce. Cook until it is completely heated through. Add the shrimp and coconut and keep on heat until the shrimp is cooked. Serve with white rice.<br>  <br>  (for every two pounds of shrimp, i usually use 2 bunches of scallions, one red and one orange bell pepper, one cup of crushed pineapple with some of the juices, one cup of the sweet and spicy sauce and about one cup of coconut, but its all about your personal taste)<br>  <br>  Chicken Fajita <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS <br>  1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 2-inch strips <br>  1 tablespoon vegetable oil <br>  2 teaspoons chili powder <br>  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin <br>  1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br>  1 small onion, sliced<br>  1 small green bell pepper, chopped<br>  1 cup salsa<br>  1 (8-oz) package shredded Monterrey Jack Cheese<br>  Tortillas<br>  Topping Ideas: Chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, sour cream<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  In a skillet, saute chicken in oil over medium-high heat for 5 minutes or until tender. Stir in chili powder, salt, cumin and garlic powder. Remove from skillet and set aside.<br>  Add onion and bell pepper to skillet ( I also like to add the spices in the skillet again for more flavor: 2 teaspoons chili powder, <br>  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder) and saute for about 5 minutes or until tender)<br>  <br>  You can either serve this dish on tortillas like a regualr fajita, or it also goes well just as like a salad with black beans, rice, lettuce, etc. But the way that i usually make it is you just get a store bought pizza dough, roll it out to the size you need put it in a 425F oven for 10-15 minutes (until it starts to become golden brown) then put all the ingredients ontop of it (except for like sour cream lettuce and things like that) then pop it back in the 425F oven for about another 10-15 minutes (until the cheese is really nice and melted).<br>  <br>  <br>  cajun chicken burgers<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 pound fresh ground chicken<br>  1 small onion, finely chopped<br>  1/4 cup chopped bell pepper (orange are my favorite)<br>  3 scallions, minced<br>  1 clove garlic, minced<br>  1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br>  1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce<br>  1 dash ground pepper<br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  <br>  Combine all ingredients in medium bowl. Form into 4-inch patties. Broil or grill 4 to 6 minutes on each side or until cooked through (160F). Serve immediately<br>  <br>  <br>  Spicy Chicken burgers<br>  Ground chicken<br>  Cajun Seasoning<br>  chopped onion<br>  <br>  Combine all ingredients and cook over medium heat in a sprayed non-stick pan. (these taste really good served with roasted red pepper hummus).<br>  <br>  This is my favorite salad it can go with almost any meal.<br>  <br>  Start out by toasting some pecans (or walnuts), its really simple, take a non-stick skillet and put it over medium heat, add your pecans (or walnuts) and make sure they're kind of small, (not too small where they're like powder, but not too big where they wont get coated with sugar). When the nuts start to toast a little add about 1 1/2 cups of sugar per 2 1/2 cups nuts and just keep stirring the sugar and nuts until the sugar is crystallized around the nuts. Remove from skillet and allow to cool.<br>  <br>  Use whatever your favorite salad mix is. <br>  Slice up some red onion, cucumbers, and small tomatoes.<br>  Crumble up some feta cheese.<br>  Take out your cooled nuts.<br>  Grab some craisins.<br>  Thow all of these together in your favorite serving dish, and right before you serve your salad, toss with Rasberry-Pomegranite vinagarrette, or a balsamic vinagarrette. (My absolute favorite dressing is the Rasberry-Pomegranite vinagarrette)<br>  <br>  and you can also try<br>  allrecipes.com <br>  cookinglight.com <br>  epicurious.com<br>  CDKitchen.com

Then just mix it in well to give it an even coat.|`|U5N0iPfLaa	Don't be confused!  Low fat and low cal are totally different.  To go "low fat" use margarine and a low fat cream.  This will drastically change the flavor profile, but you can achieve lower fat contents and still have some flavor.  Some may also be confused about carbs and fat.  To reduce the carbs, use almond flour to make the pasta.  Some specialty food stores will carry such items.|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	any butter sauce will have a high fat content.

INPrlW6Maa	Makes 6 servings ( under $1 per serving )    ACTIVE TIME: 50 minutes    TOTAL TIME: 50 minutes    EASE OF PREPARATION: Moderate    6 small poblano peppers or Anaheim chiles  4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, cut into 6 long strips  1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican   1/4 cup all-purpose flour  1/4 teaspoon sea salt  2 large egg whites  1 tablespoon canola oil  3/4 cup Ancho Chile Salsa (recipe follows)     1. Char peppers (or chiles) on all sides directly over a gas flame until the skin blackens and blisters, or broil directly under a preheated broiler until the skin blisters and begins to pull away from the pepper. Wrap in paper towels until cool.  2. Use the paper towel to carefully rub off the blistered skin. Leave the stems on. Make a 2-inch slit lengthwise in each pepper and remove the seeds. Tuck a piece of cheese into each pepper and fold the pepper over to completely enclose the cheese.   3. Working over a shallow bowl or plate, rub the oregano between your palms to bring out the flavor. Add flour and salt and stir to combine. Put egg whites in another shallow bowl or plate and lightly beat until frothy. Dip each pepper into the flour mixture to coat on all sides, brush off any excess, then dip into the egg whites.  4. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully set each pepper into the hot pan and cook until the cheese is melted and the peppers are golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes total. (If you have larger peppers, you may need to cook them in two batches.) Serve warm with 2 tablespoons Ancho Chile Salsa each.

Using a sharp knife, make 4 deep lengthwise slits in each eggplant, make sure each slit runs almost up to but not through each end as we don’t want the eggplant separating into quadrants.<br>  3. Sprinkle salt inside each incision in each eggplant then place the eggplants in a saltwater bath for one hour to drain away their bitterness; then remove and wash eggplants and leave to drain for 5 minutes.<br>  4. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan and add the eggplants. Be sure to turn the eggplants a quarter turn or so every couple minutes to ensure even cooking and fry them until the skin becomes soft and they begin to wilt.<br>  5. Remove the eggplants from the oil and set side by side in a baking dish, always with one incision facing straight upwards.<br>  6. In the same oil the eggplants were fried in, add the chopped onion and sauté until golden then add the tomato pulp and bring to a boil then simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg and simmer for another 5 minutes then remove pan from heat and allow mixture to cool slightly.<br>  7. Preheat oven to 350° F. (180° C.).<br>  8. Using a teaspoon carefully spread open and fill the topside incision on each eggplant with generous portions of the onion mixture, but be careful not to split the eggplants through as they will be very soft. Once the eggplants have been filled, if there is any leftover onion mixture simply place it in the pan among or between the eggplants and pour any remaining oil from the frying pan over everything.<br>  9. Sprinkle some breadcrumbs overtop of each stuffed eggplant and then place pan in oven and bake for one hour.|`|kAfZaLwraa	Well, you could make a ton of salad dressing.

After every new layer, brush the phillo with the melted butter. With a sharp knife cut the pie in the pan to triangles or whatever shape and size you would like them to be when they are cooked. Cook in a preheated oven at medium-high until the pie grows in size and is golden and crispy on top. Let the spinach pie sit for 10 minutes and serve. <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  EGGPLANT AND ZUCCHINI CASSEROLE<br>  <br>  Ingredients for 4 individual casseroles: 3 zucchini, 2 eggplants, 1 tablespoon mixed dried herbs, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 tablespoon fresh basil, 3/4 pound fresh buffalo mozzarella, 6 oz. tomato sauce, salt and pepper to taste, 1 cup warm tomato sauce for serving. <br>  <br>  Recipe: Slice the eggplant and zucchini and toss them in a mixing bowl with the olive oil, dried herbs, garlic and season to taste. Grill the zucchini and eggplant until they have nice grill marks. Put 1 tablespoon of tomato sauce at the bottom of every casserole. Place a slice of buffalo mozzarella over the tomato sauce. Layer the some grilled zucchini and eggplant over the buffalo mozzarella and repeat until you run out of stuff. After each layer sprinkle with fresh basil.

In a bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, vegetable stock base, chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Bread the artichoke hearts by the method flour - egg - breadcrumbs and deep - fry them at 160 C. Drain the cooked artichoke parmesans over tissue pepper if necessary. Normally the artichoke parmesans do not absorb too much oil during cooking. Serve with the red pepper mayo on the side. For the red pepper mayo, put all the ingredients in a food processor and blend. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  VEGETARIAN STUFFED PEPPERS<br>  <br>  Ingredients for 4: 4 large bell peppers or 8 smaller ones, 1 cup rice, 1 sliced onion, 1 teaspoon summer savory, 1/2 cup grated carrots, 1/4 cup thinly sliced celery, 1 cup vegetable stock or water, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 2 bay leafs, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, 1/2 cup tomato sauce. <br>  <br>  Recipe: Heat the oil in a large skillet and saute the onions, carrot and celery. Add the summer savory, bay leaf and rice and saute until the rice is almost transparent. Add the stock and tomato sauce and stir until the rice absorbs all the liquid. Remove the bay leaf. Fill the peppers with the rice stuffing but leave some space, as the rice will grow when cooked. Arrange the stuffed peppers in a baking pan and pour 1/2 cup of water at the bottom of the pan. Bake until the rice is cooked. Serve on the side some grated Parmesan or other grating cheese such as Grana di Padano, Piave Vecchio, Pecorino Romano, Pecorino Crotonese|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Pesto.

Celery is especially good in soups or dishes with a long cooking time, such as those you might prepare in the slow cooker.  I've even tried celery soup a few times to use up excess.  It was very good, even a little spicy.    You can most certainly condition yourself to enjoy celery, simply by eating it frequently.

I can hide them in a sandwich or make salsa out of them and they're delicious, but plain just doesn't work for me.|`|d2846213b87d5246da81ceaa4bf3219baa	I also despise celery.  I don't think I could ever learn to enjoy it, because I used to be forced to eat it with nasty vegetable dip when I was little :S    I would advise peanut butter on them, or try cutting them up in tiny pieces and putting them in a salad. That always works for me.|`|23YPEAqBaa	I love plain celery, but not the strings.  Peel the big strings off, and try a bit of salt, but watch out for that cream cheese!  If you like cottage cheese, try a bit of the lower fat stuff on your stalk - or hummus, salsa, avocado, or apple butter in small amounts.  My sister likes to scoop fat-free chili with her celery.|`|agTCqkLDaa	If you're not allergic, try eating it with peanut butter.    Or if you're feeling really creative you could make ants on a log which is a piece of celery covered with peanut butter and either raisins and/or chocolate chips stuck to the peanut butter.  DELICIOUS!!!    Yes, you can make whatever you want taste good to as far as food goes.  It's called "Acquiring taste".|`|2sPGCkz4aa	i believe in the notion of acquired tastes. it appears that the raw taste of celery grosses you out.  however, there are ways to "mask" an unpleasant taste.     but then, will masking the taste of celery mean that you have an acquired taste for celery?  not necessarily, i think the taste you appreciate might be the masking flavor...the cream cheese in this case
zQbpJmESaa	There are many. The best advice I can give you is to work form the outside in. What I mean is that each course will have it's own utensils. All the forks and spoons are on one side of the center plate and all the knives on the other. The best thing to do is with each course use the utensil that is farthest away from the plate but still appropriate. Obviously you don't want to try to eat soup with a fork...if you think of the plates as a two level snowman, the head or the top plate nearest your glasses is a bread plate. As the courses come and go the servers will put the food on the correct plates. If you have soup remember to lift the edge of the bowl nearest your body to fill the spoon when you near the end of the bowl. There are several reasons for this but the important one is that it will minimize any chance of you spilling the soup on yourself.

tPPZ0QDmaa	If you're worried about 'burn', then you'll want the one with the least amount of alcohol / proof.  Either the flavored Bacardi or Capt. Morgan will have the least proof.  The higher the alcohol percentage, the more 'burn' you'll experience.<br>  <br>  If you're after taste, then go with Appleton.  The rest of the liquors you mention aren't aged beyond the standard 6 months and they are artificially colored and flavored.|`|N9g4hiwYaa	I'm the type that drinks hard drinks only and out of those I'd say Captain Morgan Private Stock it went down hella smooth no burn better yet I bonged it that tells you right there that it goes straight although I advise you not to do that or you'll probably pass out anyway hope this helps.|`|EPMtOJkbaa	capt morg spiced!|`|YUjVFkocaa	I know that drinking has long been established as being "tite" and cool people do it, blah blah blah...<br>  <br>  But I simply don't see why that's the case! Drinking has been shown to mess you up in every aspect of life.<br>  <br>  Intellectually, it makes you dumber- in the short run, AND in the long run.<br>  <br>  Financially, it kills your money, drains you of stuff, and being drunk can lead to you being robbed or raped.<br>  <br>  Morally, the Bible states that drunkards "will not enter into the kingdom of heaven". So not only does drinking lower moral standards and screw up your earthly life, but it screws up your afterlife as well!<br>  <br>  Physically, drinking severely damages your liver and kidneys, and it causes apparent but less significant damage to the brain, to blood vessels, and to skin cells. This is why alcoholics often have slightly bigger veins, and dry, wrinkly skin, and age much quicker.<br>  <br>  Emotionally, drinking causes you to forget what happened last night, which can lead to psychological/emotional breakdowns. It also can cause you to have a "lapse in judgment", which usually results in sex or crime, and this is usually followed by shame, guilt, remorse, hopelessness, fear, anger, and regret.<br>  <br>  ====================<br>  <br>  Good riddance to you. I've been drinking 3 times in my life- and I can remember them all. One was at a sophomore party, one was a beach party, and one was with my ex, about a month and a half ago.<br>  <br>  I'm a Junior now, and let me tell you this: I may not be mature in some ways, but certainly I am mature enough to not stick my head in a sand like an ignorant duck, when they teach us the long-term many-pronged dangers of alcohol and drinking. I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed... but at least I've learned not to intentionally kill myself.<br>  <br>  If you want to drink, then go ahead. If you want to pay money to damage, embarrass, exploit, use, and ridicule yourself.... be my GUEST!<br>  <br>  But I'm telling you..... you'll regret it. Everybody always does, in the end. Either you'll piss all your money away, get raped sometime from passing out from whiskey, or end up getting bad grades and a bad job, because the alcohol affected your brain and killed brain cells.<br>  <br>  Or you'll end up like my brother.<br>  <br>  ===================<br>  <br>  My older brother died in a car accident, coming home from a party. His car flipped on a curb, and he was thrown from the car, and killed. There wasn't another car in sight. The cause? Alcohol. And his girlfriend luckily was alive (although hurt, and drunk as well) because she wore her seatbelt. But let it be known.... alcohol KILLS.<br>  =================<br>  <br>  Guns don't kill. DRUGS kill.<br>  =================================<br>  Source(s):<br>  n my opinion, drinking alone proves the devil's existence.<br>  <br>  Why, you ask?<br>  <br>  Because only in a society where sin is promoted, SOLELY on the basis of sin...<br>  <br>  Would losing money, slurring speech, getting raped, getting robbed, having a bad job, losing friends, aging faster, dying young, getting bad breath and rotten teeth, and getting physically weaker and slower, BE CONSIDERED "COOL"!<br>  <br>  You can still go to parties without drinking! Good god! I know sooo many girls my age who love to go to parties and drink... I stopped going to most of them cuz of this! it just pisses me off, that they feel the NEED to drink.<br>  <br>  If they're horny, GREAT! LET them go to parties, hang out, laugh, talk, make out with random guys, and have sex. But why the hell do they need the alcohol to do that? Do they simply want an EXCUSE to act immorally?? I SAY, if you plan on doing sh*t like that, just throw your conscience out the window!<br>  <br>  Cuz a lack of a conscience for a night, is better than a lack of life or a lack of money, because you pissed away your life or money with alcohol!<br>  <br>  Alcohol doesn't do a single positive thing for you. The drunk feeling is equaled out by a hangover of equal value, as well as headaches that night, and a burning in the chest.... so why do ppl like them?<br>  <br>  The fact that it makes you more open to talking is good- but in my opinion, people who have to drink to become outgoing and popular are f*gs, clowns! Why the hell do you need a drug to make you cool? Shyyyyttt I was born that way. I can talk to who i want, when i want, how i want, and get a girl if i want... as long as i put my mind to it, and focus on what to say.<br>  <br>  People who drink alcohol to be cool are the same as people who take steroids or HGH to get better at sports. They are cheaters and frauds, and in the end, they are hurting themselves instead of helping themselves.<br>  <br>  The short-term gains by ppl thinking they're cooler for doing it, is more than canceled out by the long-term harms.|`|AA11707728	None of those rums is smooth or particularly good tasting.  However, of the ones listed, only one is appropriate for drinking straight and that's the Bacardi....because it is flavored.  Those other rums are for mixing in drinks or as a rum and coke.<br>  <br>  If you want to drink rum straight, you need something silver.  For example, Bacardi makes a silver rum.<br>  <br>  It's the impurities in the rum that both give it its flavor and make it burn.  Heavy types of rum like what you have there, have strong flavor and will burn if drunk straight...unless you either, dilute the rum with a sweet drink like cola or simply cover the flavor like with the Bacardi Limon.  The silver rums are alot more pure.  Their flavor is more subtle and will burn alot less, while still being rum.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is put the rum in the freezer.  If it's really cold, it will burn less.|`|NXAk99qWaa	I have to be begin by completely disagreeing with a previous answerer - I don't know where they got their idea that out of the rums you listed, "only one is appropriate for drinking straight... those other rums are for mixing". This is a very misleading statement, as I regularly serve people these rums neat (or more often just on the rocks) and I definitely wouldn't call that "inappropriate". Anyway, back to your question...<br>  <br>  Rum from Cuba is renowned for being smooth, so I would definitely go for your bottle of Havana Club A?ejo Reserva. I'm not normally a rum drinker, but this is one that I would definitely order if I saw it in a bar. It has a strong and complex flavour, but is also exceptionally smooth and doesn't have that burning sensation that some other rums may have. Highly recommended. <br>  <br>  I hope this is of some help to you.<br>  <br>  PB.|`|VJAYmZQIaa	That is quite a rant above.<br>  Anyway I like Appleton, it's smooth and I think it's good tasting. <br>  Sailor Jerry is good and fairly strong if I remember right.<br>  Captain Morgan is fine and Bacardi works for mixing. <br>  I don't know about Havana not familiar with that one.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	captain morgan spiced|`|jBM7e88raa	captain morgan spiced is good

ILpp3ncYaa	One of them uses real cocoa, the other does not.|`|4L8HpWPjaa	here is an article explaining the difference. Also hot chocolate recipes.|`|4bedkpvLaa	Most people, especially in the US, use the two terms to mean the same thing, and if you buy any of the hot cocoa or hot chocolate mixes available at your supermarket, they’ll pretty much taste similar regardless of how it’s labeled. However, there is a difference between the two.<br>  <br>  Technically, hot cocoa is made with cocoa powder, and cocoa powder is actually something that has no fat content which, in this case, is called “cocoa butter.” Most of the time if you even encounter cocoa powder, it’s the stuff that comes in a metal can and is used for baking purposes, and is unsweetened.<br>  <br>  Hot chocolate is actually made from melted chocolate, so you’ll have the cocoa butter contributing to the fat content, resulting in a considerably richer beverage than you’d get from what was the original hot cocoa recipe.<br>  <br>  There are some commercially available hybrids out there that sometimes package themselves as either “hot cocoa” or “drinking chocolate,” but these will certainly make use of the fat in cocoa butter in one form or another because its use results in a far more appealing beverage for most people.|`|q158XG8raa	To me, the difference is the one that comes out of a box and you mix with water is called hot cocoa and when you make it from scratch and use milk then it becomes hot chocolate.|`|9dd1996d5fe2889ddece4c461db89465aa	Yes, I am from the U.S. and from what I have heard and experienced, the terms used are generally speaking of the same thing.

hevSiWnzaa	Hi & good luck to you. I didn't start my veggie lifestyle ‘til I was in my 20s (22 years ago) & could happily get by on jacket potato & salad occasionally, but as you're rather younger & growing I think you should keep a bit of a watch on the vitamin (and nutrient content generally) of what you're eating. Plain jacket potato sounds a bit boring as well - what about spicy beans in it? Or flavoursome cheese?<br>  <br>  Here's an idea of what I generally do for protein (and I'm pretty healthy):<br>  All nuts are good protein sources, but beware of salted nuts cos of the salt content - too much is bad for you.<br>  <br>  All pulses are good (and low fat too); things like lentils & all sorts of beans. Beans (be adventurous with different types, not just tinned baked beans) are great in stews (I live in England & it's very cold weather here at the moment - just right for stews, casseroles & curries). Chickpeas work in just about anything with mixed veg in: protein high, good for cholesterol, available in tins so no need to soak overnight & very cheap (here anyway)<br>  <br>  Tofu is protein-packed. Very bland on its own though - spice up with chinese / stir fries.<br>  <br>  Personally, I quite like the "weird veggie schnitzels" & that type of thing; they're generally made from mushroom or soya derived ingredients, so good for protein & all that but if you don't like them then keep trying other things until you find a brand or type that you do like. Being veggie doesn't mean you have to suffer for your principles!<br>  <br>  For breakfast I usually have muesli & yogurt mixed half & half with milk. I suppose you could have any grain / oat based cereal if you don't like muesli. A banana at morning tea break time is also good.<br>  <br>  There's lots of info & recipes on the Vegetarian Society website:<br>  <a href="http://www.vegsoc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegsoc.org/</a><br>  This link<br>  <a href="http://www.youngveggie.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngveggie.org/</a><br>  goes to the page specially written for younger veggies which you might find useful. I'd suggest you particularly have a look at the "how to talk to your parents" link: <br>  <br>  If you type key words in the search box it comes up with info sheets / articles. You don't have to be a member but I'm sure they'd appreciate it if you joined! I don't know what country you live in but I'm pretty sure they're worldwide, not just UK.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to their info sheet about protein generally: <a href="http://www.vegsoc.org/info/protein.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegsoc.org/info/protein.html</a><br>  <br>  I hope that's some help - I'm sure you'll get lots more answers.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Martin|`|wX1xcnZOaa	Iron, maybe. Protein, not necessary.<br>  Most people eat more protein than they need each day and it's a bit of a myth about the whole vegetarian protein deficiency thing.<br>  And what you're eating tonight sounds fine!|`|Zbjr11aSaa	u should eat some sort of protein try tofu nuts or dahl|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Humans do not need to consume any protein at all as long as we get the amino acids we need.  Called the Essential Amino Acids.  They are called Essential because they are the ones that we do not make ourselves.  The reason we don't make them ourselves is because we don't need to; they are easily found in food everywhere.  We take these amino acids into our body, and when we need protein, the amino acids are formed together into a chain, and we call that protein.<br>  <br>  Amino acids are the building blocks for life on this planet.  Every single living thing on this planet utilizes amino acids and protein.  We can also consume a protein chain, digest it and break it down into amino acids, and take those amino acids into our body to use to make protein chains.  We do not take in whole chains. That is, we do not take in protein, we only take in amino acids.<br>  <br>  In food, you can find both amino acids (that are separate and not formed into protein), and protein (amino acids make into a chain of protein).<br>  <br>  Eating amino acids takes less bodily energy and resources than eating protein.  Breaking apart protein into amino acids takes energy/nutrients; it's less efficient than consuming while proteins.<br>  <br>  Veggie schnitzels and sausages are difficult to digest since they are highly processed products.  Eat them; if you like them.  That's okay, just not at every single meal of every single day.  Besides, when you finally move out and live on your own, you won't be able to afford such luxuries as these fake meat things.  Enjoy it while it lasts.<br>  <br>  You don't need iron tablets or whatever as long are you are eating your dark leafy green vegetables.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend that you get into gardening and learning to grow your own food.  Read One Straw Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka and get on your way.  It's not difficult, and it's very cheap, and remember to never listen to that other gardener that spends their time pulling weeds, watering, keeping everything in neat tidy rows etc.|`|0lRK1J5baa	Yea...don't worry about it too much...at least try and get one serving with protein ONCE a day if you can. Vegans have more to worry about that vegetarians though, so you should be alright. I'd reccomend taking vitamins though, just to be safe! Def. vitamin B complex, and just calcium and a multi maybe. <br>  <br>  Also, as an alternate source of protein, you can drink soy milk or eat a pb&j sandwhich, or just eat soy nuts or peanuts during the day.|`|llkSmgLJaa	Vegetarian protein - beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.

You do need to include a source of B12 in your diet such as tempeh and nutritional yeast. Incorporating tofu, beans and whole grains will keep you on track, and there is nothing really wrong with Boca Burgers or Lightlife Gimme Lean, or Tofurky Sausages for that matter.

De6n2MaIaa	you can't 'prove' it's wrong because it isn't. it's a lifestyle choice and you can't convert them just because you think it's bad.    it's wrong to you, but that's your choice. if they're too ignorant to accept that then don't bother. let them lead their lifestyle and you can lead yours.|`|GHefTsUyaa	Good for you Carol.  Stick by your principles.|`|AA11366224	If it's your choice, that's a good enough reason.  It shouldn't worry you that the rest of us think you're silly.  Make sure you get enough vitamins and protein - not many people can survive on fruit and veg alone and aplastic anaemia is not pleasant.|`|441GSyaMaa	You shouldn't try to prove her wrong because you choose to be vegan, it's like when Jehovah's witnesses knock at your door trying to shove religion down your throat, it's just not pleasant. All you need to do is ignore her.     See the way I look at it is that in every creatures life (well most, all but plant eaters :-P) they savagely kill each other (much more inhumane than humans do to animals...) and that's how they survive. So this is how we survive.     Just ignore what she says and do your own thing, if she doesn't like it then tough... Lol|`|2sEONDNKaa	You do not have to justify not drinking milk from a cow, goat, pig, etc.    When you say its cruel, you're inadvertantly putting them down, causing defensiveness.

Also, it would be advisable to check up the effects of vegan-ism on your body long term.|`|z5M8xfhXaa	tell her eating meat is cool|`|T4XPtQOeaa	Just as you don't like being hassled over not eating the foods you choose, others don't like being hassled over the foods they choose.  The best thing to do is basicly go, "This is my choice, this is how I want to live.  Please don't bother me about it.  I won't bother you."    It's a two-sided thing.    If you want to bother others about eating meat and drinking milk and eating eggs, then they are going to do it back on why you DON'T do those things.    The best thing to do, I find, is to show that this is how you intend to live, and that you won't bother them, if they won't bother you.  Plain and simple.    And you never know, as you do that, they might come to respect your decisions, and ask you questions about it.  Then, you may start to show why you find your way of life benificial. It's a much softer approach, and you'll find less harrassment on both ends.    I hope that helps.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	Don't try and impose your moral values on your mother.  Just do what you think is right for yourself.      I eat eggs because they come from our own chickens.  Our chickens are free range, happy and well cared for, living a regular chicken life, rather than being cooped up in a small cage with the lights on 24hrs a day.  So- I feel good about it.  I don't drink cow's milk, but I do have a cheese weakness.|`|9w9eXmpBaa	Did you know that a cow like humans has to have a baby in order to create milk?

You can't take every1 to the pond of knowledge expect them to drink.  Trying this knowing, its foolish on your behalf to try to teach 1 who doesnt want teaching.  Your their example.  Live your vegan life and let them live their meat-loving life.  No offense to your mom but shes rather foolish to persuade you not to eat health. As times are tough, economics maybe a reason for her reasoning.   But your wrong. There is something wrong with dairy products.  Not good for bloodflow, it will cause high blood pressure, and will cause your body to mulifuction as time progresses.  Diary benefits would include calcium and vitamin D but those 2 things you can get anywhere  for instance vitamin D's limited source- the sun.  calcium can come from almond milk which is healthier than hormone or non hormone cow or goat milk.  its your choice is a good enough reason.  as humans are suggestive beings-|`|jZRtTpZiaa	For the person who asked about eggs--  http://www.fowlplaymovie.com/display_vid...      Hens who lay eggs are produced at a hatchery.  Male and female babies are produced, but only females lay eggs.  So the males are picked out and killed.  They're not the same as chickens raised for meat, and they don't have any value so they're killed either by suffocation, just tossing them out in trash bags,  or often they'll use a shredder like the chipper shredder you may have seen people put tree branches through.  .     The females go on to miserable conditions in cages or on factory farms even when they're labeled as free range.  The law is vague in the US for what needs to happen for a chicken to be considered free range, so of course people try to do the minimum required.    The only way to be sure those hens are truly kept in conditions of which you approve is to go inspect where your eggs come from,  or raise hens yourself.      Hens in factory farms are most often placed in small cages where they have their beaks cut so they don't get frustrated and peck the hens next to them in those cramped spaces.    These hens are bred to maximize egg production,  and you wouldn't believe what some farmers do to try to stimulate increased egg production.  It's horrible.   After about a year-- year and a half--   when the egg production declines-- or when the hen gets sick--   they are removed and killed because they can no longer make money from eggs.      As for dairy--   For one, if you buy milk,  you support the veal industry.  Dairy cows must get pregnant to produce milk, so they're impregnated over and over again throughout their useful lives before they are killed for hamburger meat.   Their female babies may be used to replace dairy cows, while the male babies go on to be sold off to make meat--  often VEAL,  where the calf is chained into a small veal crate then later killed.        Often, cows will suffer mastitis and other health problems where they'll be culled and sent to slaughter just because they're not profitable for milk.      Cows are milked late into pregnancy in this part of the world, which means you get increased hormones in the milk regardless of whether the cow has been injected or not.  That has been studied at Harvard and compared with some places in the world where they do not milk the cow late into pregnancy, and they found  possible serious health risks associated with that.  It's done just so they can maximize the amount of milk and money from the cow.      Look into what they actually feed cows.  Most dairy cows are not out grazing on grass in fields.   They're fed absolute slop for part of their diet because it's cheap--  waste from the food industry,  even fish meal, candy factory waste,  bakery waste. slaughterhouse waste/ meat and bone meal.    If you don't believe me, ask the USDA, and not an animal rights group.  Or look at info from the industry itself http://www.milkproduction.com/Library/Ar...    A cow's milk is for a baby cow--  just as a human mother's milk is for her baby.   Human beings do not need cow milk or the milk of any other mammal outside their species.  And we do not even need that after we are old enough.    Cows do not need human breast milk either.     3/4 of the world's adults cannot even digest the lactose in milk properly-- as their lactase production drops off (enzyme needed to digest the lactose in milk).    The casein in milk can stimulate mucous production and make your nose run.  Have you ever gotten the sniffles after eating dairy?  I used to.    According to Dr. Weil,  a popular doctor and author  in the US, milk consumption is associated with recurrent childhood ear infections, eczema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and sinus conditions.   http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA182741|`|VHWdpvhKaa	congratulations and you will encounter more poeple in the world who are like your mother and worse she is just being a typical mom and worrying about you what you need to do is show her facts and educate her more so then argue with her that way she will better understand your decision and you need to let her understand that its your life and she needs to respect the fact you feel strongly about this and your not doing anything that will harm you and your being very responsible about it.....i also suggest you show her other people who are vegans as well and let them tell her their personal life stories and how they went vegan and how its perfectly fine .... i also suggest you do lots of research get books and join local vegetarian/vegan society groups that can be a support system to you   i love the following website that help me be vegan :  http://vegan.alltop.com/  http://veggielinks.com/linkexchange.html  http://www.vegetarianusa.com/restaurants...    hope these will be helpful to you and good luck|`|1d2d0fb9a5ef712a04bd7b849e5611a1aa	Congrats to you and the animals thank you!  I understand exactly how you feel!  Both my family and my husband got a ton of grief from our parents and siblings.  They thought it was extreme, ridiculous, brain-washed, basically anything negative.  We heard it for months and I still get it from my father in law.  However, my husband was overweight when he ate meat (like 70 pounds) and when he started going vegan-he started losing weight.  That helped quiet the family down a little but we still got grief.  Finally we both got blood work done and we are in excellent health, despite the fact that heart disease, hypertension, and all things associated with being unhealthy run in the family--this has really helped make both our families see the benefit of going vegan.  Overall, like everyone else says-you can't force or prove people wrong and expect positive results most of the time.  You can just live your life, be an example and hope they will see the benefits of that lifestyle and want to possibly consider it.  After all, studies have shown that vegetarians live 10 years longer than non-vegetarians so I imagine that vegans would live even longer than that possibly.    We don't argue with our families when they say anything--BUT we make sure we clarify and explain when they try and tell us some completely incorrect thing about being vegan.  It's gets better with time.

QEEweJUaaa	When you're feeling peckish, do you reach for the nearest bag of crisps or chocolate bar? Why not grab a snack that is going to make you feel good, as well as boost your energy levels and also be beneficial for your health.   Here are some healthy snack ideas:     nuts     Nuts are packed full of protein and fiber, and are a rich source of vitamins E, B6 and folic acid. They are also high in healthy polyunsaturated fats (especially omega-3), but this means they are high in calories, so eat in moderation.     Pick non-salted varieties of nuts   Nuts with lower fat levels are pistachios, cashews and almonds   Almonds are the richest in calcium, which helps keep your bones strong   Store nuts in an airtight container away from light and heat   Low GI Foods     The glycaemic effect of foods looks at how they affect our blood sugar.     The best foods are the ones low in the glycaemic index (GI). This is because they provide a slow release energy into our bloodstream rather than a quick sugar rush that soon dips, leaving us feeling hungry again. This is beneficial for long-term health and can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes, as well as helping to maintain weight loss.     Good low GI snack choices include:     dried fruit and seeds   fresh fruits   oatcakes or rye crackers   wholegrain bread  Raw fruit and vegetables     Choose fruit as a healthy and satisfying snack.     Variety is the key, so choose a range of colored fruits throughout the week to get the best mix of protective antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.     Raw vegetables make tasty, filling snacks. Try cutting them into sticks and dipping them in hummus.  Dark chocolate (in moderation)     Lots of studies have indicated that the flavonoids found in dark chocolate are powerful antioxidants. Cocoa has more phenolic phytochemicals and a higher antioxidant capacity than any other food, but processing of cocoa can remove many of these benefits.     Go for dark chocolate with at least 70 per cent cocoa solids and low levels of cocoa butter.     Eat dark chocolate in moderation: two squares of chocolate a day is plenty.  Snacks to Avoid     Cakes, pastries and buns: delicious, but high in calories, fats and sugars, and many store-bought cakes contain trans fats, which can damage heart health, as well as artificial flavorings, preservatives and dyes.     Sugary breakfast cereals.|`|NkqiRUgfaa	there is dried fruit it tastes good and it good for you|`|CnBMe52naa	Extra Easy Hummus     1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained, liquid reserved   1 clove garlic, crushed   2 teaspoons ground cumin   1/2 teaspoon salt   1 tablespoon olive oil     In a blender or food processor combine garbanzo beans, garlic, cumin, salt and olive oil.

You have my sympathy and prayer.|`|YUjVFkocaa	I know that drinking has long been established as being "tite" and cool people do it, blah blah blah...<br>  <br>  But I simply don't see why that's the case! Drinking has been shown to mess you up in every aspect of life.<br>  <br>  Intellectually, it makes you dumber- in the short run, AND in the long run.<br>  <br>  Financially, it kills your money, drains you of stuff, and being drunk can lead to you being robbed or raped.<br>  <br>  Morally, the Bible states that drunkards "will not enter into the kingdom of heaven". So not only does drinking lower moral standards and screw up your earthly life, but it screws up your afterlife as well!<br>  <br>  Physically, drinking severely damages your liver and kidneys, and it causes apparent but less significant damage to the brain, to blood vessels, and to skin cells. This is why alcoholics often have slightly bigger veins, and dry, wrinkly skin, and age much quicker.<br>  <br>  Emotionally, drinking causes you to forget what happened last night, which can lead to psychological/emotional breakdowns. It also can cause you to have a "lapse in judgment", which usually results in sex or crime, and this is usually followed by shame, guilt, remorse, hopelessness, fear, anger, and regret.<br>  <br>  ====================<br>  <br>  Good riddance to you. I've been drinking 3 times in my life- and I can remember them all. One was at a sophomore party, one was a beach party, and one was with my ex, about a month and a half ago.<br>  <br>  I'm a Junior now, and let me tell you this: I may not be mature in some ways, but certainly I am mature enough to not stick my head in a sand like an ignorant duck, when they teach us the long-term many-pronged dangers of alcohol and drinking. I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed... but at least I've learned not to intentionally kill myself.<br>  <br>  If you want to drink, then go ahead. If you want to pay money to damage, embarrass, exploit, use, and ridicule yourself.... be my GUEST!<br>  <br>  But I'm telling you..... you'll regret it. Everybody always does, in the end. Either you'll piss all your money away, get raped sometime from passing out from whiskey, or end up getting bad grades and a bad job, because the alcohol affected your brain and killed brain cells.<br>  <br>  Or you'll end up like my brother.<br>  <br>  ===================<br>  <br>  My older brother died in a car accident, coming home from a party. His car flipped on a curb, and he was thrown from the car, and killed. There wasn't another car in sight. The cause? Alcohol. And his girlfriend luckily was alive (although hurt, and drunk as well) because she wore her seatbelt. But let it be known.... alcohol KILLS.<br>  =================<br>  <br>  Guns don't kill. DRUGS kill.<br>  =================================<br>  Source(s):<br>  n my opinion, drinking alone proves the devil's existence.<br>  <br>  Why, you ask?<br>  <br>  Because only in a society where sin is promoted, SOLELY on the basis of sin...<br>  <br>  Would losing money, slurring speech, getting raped, getting robbed, having a bad job, losing friends, aging faster, dying young, getting bad breath and rotten teeth, and getting physically weaker and slower, BE CONSIDERED "COOL"!<br>  <br>  You can still go to parties without drinking! Good god! I know sooo many girls my age who love to go to parties and drink... I stopped going to most of them cuz of this! it just pisses me off, that they feel the NEED to drink.<br>  <br>  If they're horny, GREAT! LET them go to parties, hang out, laugh, talk, make out with random guys, and have sex. But why the hell do they need the alcohol to do that? Do they simply want an EXCUSE to act immorally?? I SAY, if you plan on doing sh*t like that, just throw your conscience out the window!<br>  <br>  Cuz a lack of a conscience for a night, is better than a lack of life or a lack of money, because you pissed away your life or money with alcohol!<br>  <br>  Alcohol doesn't do a single positive thing for you. The drunk feeling is equaled out by a hangover of equal value, as well as headaches that night, and a burning in the chest.... so why do ppl like them?<br>  <br>  The fact that it makes you more open to talking is good- but in my opinion, people who have to drink to become outgoing and popular are f*gs, clowns! Why the hell do you need a drug to make you cool? Shyyyyttt I was born that way. I can talk to who i want, when i want, how i want, and get a girl if i want... as long as i put my mind to it, and focus on what to say.<br>  <br>  People who drink alcohol to be cool are the same as people who take steroids or HGH to get better at sports. They are cheaters and frauds, and in the end, they are hurting themselves instead of helping themselves.<br>  <br>  The short-term gains by ppl thinking they're cooler for doing it, is more than canceled out by the long-term harms.

tSDzszLoaa	France's 400 sorts of cheese could puzzle Mickey mouse ...<br>  We also get confused when confronted with the uncountable designation of cheese (cheese of guaranted origin, made with milk or pasteurised milk, farm made or mass produced ...). It is a matter of local flavour as well as a matter of money ...<br>  We're here to help you and help you learn more about cheese, for a start, take a look at this map of France, with a few cheeses placed on it.<br>   <br>  <br>  The origin of cheese is lost in the mist of time. Thousand of cows and sheeps and goats have been milked since someone first decided to curdle milk. The French have always regarded cheese as essential, whether they buy it on site (in farms), or in supermarkets. But which sort of cheese shall you choose ? According to the legislation, cheese means " fermented or not fermented, matured or not matured food, made from dairy produce (milk, can be more or less skimmed, or cream or dasher). It can be used as such or coagulated, before it se drained, partly or not. It keeps at least 23% of dry matter". The kind of milk used has to be notified, it not cow milk.<br>  <br>  <br>  The 400 sorts of French cheese recorded can be made with milk or with pasteurised milk. The "milk" label means that the milk was not heated over 37°C. "This way, it keeps all its properties, although il lose certain pathogenic baceria which can prove dangerous for human beings", Mr Garsault, Head-manager of the International cheese Institute explains. Farm cheese bears such as label. "They back up the French cheese tradition", G. Ripaud, who is in charge of technical cheese related problems near the Food Office asserts.<br>  From a legal pont of view, farm cheese "is a hand made in farms, with the milk of a single drove, each day". Small scale production is back again as proved by the high price of products !<br>  <br>  The milk used to make pasteurised cheese is heated up to 72°C, for 20 to 30 seconds, which annihilated any pathogenic germ. Then, the milk is seeded again with lactic bacteria, in order to restore the flora indispensable for maturing the paste. "Is it a crime to take the main bacteria out of milk and to replace them by others, which are selected and standarkised in laboratories ? Is it a good thing to add to this milk other synthetic ingrediens ?" Pierre Androuet, a supporter of high quality cheese, asked as far back as 1973. In 1909, he opened a creamery in Paris, rue d'Amsterdam, which, since then, has been crowded by cheese lovers from the whole world. But P. Androuet's question has not been answered yet.<br>  <br>  For some, mass-produced cheese is not cheese actually : but it ranks first in house-hold consumtion. So, on one hand, you find mass production and low costs, and on the other small scale production. Prices differ mainly. "Still, cheese is a matter of native tang", Raymond Felix, a head cheesemonger at Androuet's notices. "Similar sorts of cheese cna be more or less expensive according to their fame and to the price of milk," Pascal Moingeon, sales manager in charge of Lanquetot labeled camemberts from the calvados region, sets the example fo camembets : "There is a segmentation as concerns brands : Lanquedoc, Lepetit, Gillot, Cooperative d'Isigny are made with milk. Their prices are over FF 10, and they are chosen by 15% of consumers . The pasteurised camenberts, branded President, Bridel or Coeur de Lion are the market core, with a 85% of share ; They are sold under FF 10 ; Ladle moulding accounts for the price difference. For Lanquetot camenbert, the mould is filled with five layers of curdled milk, which are spaced 40mm, so as to allow a slow draining and a different taste".<br>  <br>  "The difference between cheese made with pasteurised milk or with milk is a bit ambiguous", Mr Garsuault notices, "some prefer to give no detail about it".<br>  <br>  So, keep your eye skinned ! If you read "Normandy camembert" on the label, it means that it is a ladle-moulded camembert, made with milk : the origin is guaranteed even if for 15 years or so, most of the cows in Normandy are of Dutch origin. Camemberts "made in Normandy" are pasteurised mainly : for cheese lovers, this is not full flavoured cheese. The ordinary label "Camembert" can be used for cheese made in any French region,as well as in China; its main asset is its low price<br>  <br>  So can one actually see the difference between a pasteurised and a milk camembert ?<br>  <br>  Yes. Non-pasteurised cheese has an uneven rind of various colours, whereas it is even and white when cheese is pasteurised : the ripening process is stopped then. The sides of a ripen cheese are soft to the touch ; and it goes on ripening stores :a gourmet never mistakes one for the other.<br>  <br>  <br>  Is pasteurised cheese really inferior ? There is no answer : some unwaveringly support the category that other cannot bear. "Cheese lovers enjoy milk cheese of guarented origin. But 85% consumers prefer milder pastes, enjoyed by the whole family. "<br>  In French supermarkets, huge cheese counters are quite a sight.<br>  <br>  But should you buy it near a traditional or a self-service departement ? "As concerns supermarkets, it's a load of rubbish : suppliers have to pay to get a good place at the self-service departement; so they overvalue their products so as to recoup the expenses"; says claude Bajolet, who used to be the head of a Leclerc hypermarket dairy produce departement for over 6 years. Today, he manages his own dairy in Paris 10th district.<br>  Is the traditional shop better ? "Clients don't want to wait, and self-service buying is impulsive. People only care about the price of already packaged slices. That cheese is pasteurised, mass-produced and tasteless mainly : it is produced for just anyone, any Europeen folk; But the lower the price, the lower the quality..."<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Claude Barjolet favours traditionally sold cheese. "As a head departement, I was dealing with producers directly : this is a token of quality, and a real cheesemonger is able to tell clients when the optimal tasting is over : the colours of rinds change : no way to sell then !". Today, this experienced man fully carries on his job. "A professional cheesmonger, thanks to his know-how and to his presence in the shop, can sell any fresh product, while standing apart from mass distribution systems. Here, I offer my clients as many farm products as possible, plus Dutch cheese, such as old Gouda. I buy small quantities of cheese, in order to keep it splendid. I will soon care with the ripening of some sorts myself. My prices are not higher than anywhere else."<br>  <br>  For health-related motives, some make a stand against farm cheese, which, they say, is not asceptic enough, and which could harm fragile people. No fear ! "Agriculture and health Ministries would never allow the sale of any dubious product", Gerard Ripaud strongly retorts.<br>  <br>  In farms as well as in factories, hygiene is irreprochable.<br>  The veterinarian inspections are many, at any stage of the manufacturing process. The ticketing of cheese is also submitted to strict rules; several mentions have to be found on labels :<br>   sales designation (camembert, for instance)<br>   animal species (sheep or goat's milk; there is no mention for cow's milk cheese, excep for Roqueforts)<br>   minimal fats content<br>   manufacturing place<br>   additives<br>  <br>  Cream cheese bears a particular mention : "moisture content superior to 82% or 85%".<br>  Only cheese of guaranteed origin is exempted from bearing certain references.<br>  "Each sort of cheese reveals a pasture of a differente green , under a different sky". Italo Calvino wrote. And each sort will however please a differente consumer, with his taste buds and his gustative education.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Cheese  happened by a mistake of course.( like everything else)<br>  It could have happened many ways( eons ago).<br>  For instance( all conjecture because no one really knows).<br>  A farmer milks an animal and sets the bucket under a wild fennel plant, a leaf of 2 fall in and the milk coagulates( veggie rennet).<br>  <br>  ( another scenario)<br>  Eons ago, beverage holders were made from cow's/calves,goats stomachs.<br>  A new pouch is made and left to dry in the sun.<br>  A minute amount of a bile like liquid remains in the pouch( animal rennet) and that person fills it with milk( he just discovered cheese).<br>  <br>  We can date some cheeses.<br>  Parmigiano can only be dated 1100 years back( they found recipes that mention it, but no writings before that.<br>  The famous Basque Cheese( Ossau-Iraty) can be dated back more then 2000 years.<br>  But cheese has been made much earlier then that( albeit, simple Ricotta like cheeses).<br>  <br>  <br>  The second half of the question is huge.<br>  I'll make it short.<br>  The true deffinition of cheese is milk with rennet.<br>  So mascarpone isn't really cheese nor is cream cheese( and others).<br>  To make cheese you make a curd( with a certain enzyme that will define the cheese being made( along with the milk type).<br>  Blue cheeses milk+rennet+pennicillium roquforti, pierced in the center( to allow air to enter so the mold will form).<br>  <br>  Cheddars--cheddaring process is stacking the curds( like bricks) one on top of the other which changes the compexion  and desity of the curd.<br>  <br>  Washed rinds-stinky cheeses that are washed with either beer, salt water, brandy or marc.<br>  <br>  Bloomy rind( like brie) after the cheese is made, white mold is sprayed on.<br>  <br>  Natural rinds--the cheese are placed in a superaturated salt bath which hardens the outside of the cheese and forms a rind.These cheeses are the best for aging.<br>  <br>  Well, I heading to bed, you wore me out.

kpvsxlA6aa	Well, that's because to make wine, you have to choose your type of yeast, keep it at a specific temperature, and all the other things you've been reading about.  It really IS complicated before you understand the basics.  I'm not sure what you were expecting.  <br>  <br>  If you're just looking up recipes, those people are assuming you know how to do, and understand the chemistry and principles behind, the basics.  Look up "how to make wine" instead of recipes.<br>  <br>  Briefly, there are many many different types of yeast.  They live off the sugar, reproduce, and eventually they'll all die when there's no more sugar for them. They create the alcohol.  Each will cause your beverage (wine or beer) to be very different depending on the type of yeast.  They're living creatures, like a neighborhood... some are loud and strong, some are mild and quieter.  Champagne yeast, for instance, is very hard to keep alive and nourish properly.  When your yeast get sick and die, if you're lucky, you end up with vinegar.  If you're unlucky, well.... yuck.<br>  <br>  You might (MAYBE) be able to use pure maple syrup, but it's going to make for some strange maple-tasting wine.  And if it's pancake syrup, that's not maple syrup, it's flavored corn syrup and will almost certainly be a disaster, since it has preservatives and stuff in it.  Pure maple syrup is extremely expensive, so you certainly won't want to be experimenting with it.  I'm not sure it would work anyway unless it was very very pure and concentrated. <br>  <br>  You always need more sugar than is naturally found in fruit.  (Vineyards have been selectively breeding high-sugar grapes for wine forever.  I think the closest they've gotten to no-sugar wine is ice wine, which you can look up).  Also, even the type of sugar you use will affect the outcome of your wine.<br>  <br>  Also, distilled wine is brandy.<br>  <br>  Where are you looking that has "nothing really precise"?   A quick google search of "how to make wine" should yield millions of hits.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	If you have trouble selecting a yeast, there is no simple way and there certainly is no quick way. If you want to make a decent, drinkable wine, get Berry's book First Steps in Home Winemaking. Follow his instructions except make sure that any plastic used is food grade.<br>  <br>  The most readily-available yeasts are Montrachet and Champagne. I suggest starting with a packet of Montrachet from your local home brew shop. You can get a lot of good advice there too.<br>  <br>  Most fruit does not have enough sugars to keep the yeasts happy and produce sufficient alcohol, so it is usual to add table sugar. Pure maple sugar would work but the taste might not be desirable.<br>  <br>  Wine is pretty tolerant of normal room temperature and a lot more idiot-proof than beer is. Give it a try. You might like potato wine to start with. You can even eat the potatoes for dinner; the wine is made from the water used to boil them.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	If you just want to get drunk, why not get an older friend to buy some wine for you?  <br>  If you really want to make quality wine, it's not as simple as you think, and requires time and patience and a good deal of know-how.

tedJD26Uaa	yes you can grind them at night your coffee will taste the same. I always make mine the night before.  Hope that helped!|`|h0oHTKThaa	don't put them in the fridge! contrary to popular belief, coffee does NOT keep well in the fridge. in fact, its flavor is reduced. if you grind them, the air will bring the quality down a bit overnight, but not as much as if you put it them the fridge. your best bet is to grind them, then store the ground beans in an airtight container. it really won't make a huge difference in flavor to you (keeping the ground beans overnight) unless you're a coffee master of sorts. <br>  <br>  coffee likes cool (NOT COLD!), dark places. exactly like a cabinet! it won't go bad, just have a slightly reduced flavor, the next morning. you probably won't even notice. it's really good within the first 24 hours, so you'll be all set. it's considered fresh for a week, after that you'll start to notice definete taste changes. (stale)|`|n9vByQgdaa	Why not just buy preground coffee?<br>  <br>  Dont worry about making noise, you wont wake anyone up.|`|g5vQYWrzaa	Yes freeze them|`|2FKNZcRhaa	Dear Lee,<br>  <br>  The main reason for making coffee with fresh grounds is that the oils making up most of its flavor and aroma can oxidize when exposed to air.  This can make the coffee taste "off" and bitter.  (BTW, you can also get the bitter taste by using water that is too hot.)<br>  <br>  If you grind your coffee at night, place it in the freezer until you are ready to use it, preferably in an air tight freezer bag.  Ground coffee should keep for over a week stored this way.<br>  <br>  If you like full flavored, strong coffee that is not bitter, try the Brazilian way of making it.  In Brazil, the coffee is not made by running boiling water through the grounds.  Instead, they use a "coffee sock".  That is a cloth bag that permits free circulation of water, but keeps the grounds out of your cup.  Pour very hot, not boiling water over the sock and allow the coffee to steep like tea until the color looks right.  Remove the sock, wring it out. and drink.  Most of the coffee that I drank in Brazil came with cream and sugar already added.  It tasted like coffee candy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tiger Toy|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	Sure!  I do the same thing all the time!|`|6yoLxKuYaa	Yes, you don't really have to use them right away. Just put them in an airtight containter.|`|AA11562326	I guess if you're a real connoisseur (sp?) that might matter.<br>  <br>  But think about it, you can buy ground coffee, and keep it for weeks, even longer, before using it.<br>  <br>  For convenience, if I have whole beans, I grind either half the bag, or the whole bag, then store it in an airtight canister.  Seems to work fine.|`|7AfEG5rWaa	yes, you could freeze them too
53giV6PFaa	Use vegetable oil for baking.  Olive oil will change the taste of your cake.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	I use olive oil or corn oil. Olive oil is one of the best oils for your health and it doesn't make the cake taste different. I try to use olive oil in everything I can, but if it affects the flavor, I try to pair the oil to the flavor of the food. I also have cooked for many years.|`|2Ek0DM3Baa	go with the vegetable over the olive - no need to waste the olive oil in a cake, save it for something you want to taste the olive oil in|`|pNxuvKUOaa	vegetable oil or melted shortening. Olive oil can have a flavor, plus it's more expensive and you don't want  to waste it in a cake.|`|dmNO9G2uaa	a sexy one if it is for a guy|`|KWhKwgsSaa	I use vegetable.<br>  <br>  Been cooking and making cakes with vegetable oil for over 40 years.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	Olive oil has the least amount of flavor, but I tend to use veggie oil the most for baking.  Corn oil tends to mess with the cake's flavor a little too much.
0VrZ1xEsaa	Well...with technology these days...how about using www.evite.com?<br>  You can do both of them on there by creating their own.  <br>  <br>  If you make the invitations just write it as: "You're invited...to a Baby/Bridal Shower".<br>  Just make it clear that it is a baby AND bridal shower so any gift(s) brought will be appropriate.  You could have a picture of a teddy bear dressed in a wedding gown...that covers both and is cute. :-)  <br>  <br>  Here are some good sites for ideas on themes, decorations, etc.<br>  www.shindigz.com<br>  www.partycity.com<br>  www.mninternational.com<br>  www.orientaltrading.com<br>  <br>  Consider doing themed food for both.  Teddy bear shaped cookies, ring shaped cookies, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
