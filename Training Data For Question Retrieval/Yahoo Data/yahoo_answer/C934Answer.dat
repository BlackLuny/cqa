ckUbNSDGaa	I've used cash crate and I did get paid from them.  I found the site very easy to use and the support there is pretty good.  The one thing I didn't like about it is that they pay you 30 days after you get your points.  I found another site that pays instantly to verified paypal users (cashlagoon.com).  I would recommend that you look at several of them before you decide on one or the other.|`|8Eb7eP73aa	No...cash crate is not a scam.  But it is very time consuming if you want to make money.  The most I've received from them was a check for $10.50  IMO, places like these aren't worth the hassle unless you have your computer attached to your hip and have no real life.|`|uycrmv2waa	Try some online jobs, where you don’t have to pay upfront money. Online data entry is an excellent career to consider if you want to work at home. The equipment needed for this type of job is very minimal. You only need a computer with an Internet connection, a table and a comfortable chair. Data entry duties include the inputting of correspondence, reports, and spreadsheets into a home computer and then transmitting that data using the Internet. Work at home data entry personnel may also proofread text, edit information, and maintain databases. Data entry jobs usually offer flexible scheduling, allowing people to work when they want to and as little or as much as they want to. Some of the growing fields for work at home data entry include medical and legal transcription, medical coding and litigation coding. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://internet--jobs.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://internet--jobs.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  This type of work is becoming so popular that many fraudulent websites have emerged offering data entry jobs, which promise huge profits. The best way to find a legitimate data entry job is visit a reputable career website. You are more likely to find a genuine work at home job using these websites.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://workathome-sa.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://workathome-sa.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  There are several freelance websites that post freelance data entry jobs. Avoid responding to ads that do not list a company name or contact information. There are many reputable freelance work forums that can provide you with work at home data entry job listings. The forums are usually free to join and provide trustworthy information. Once you have found an advertisement for a work at home data entry job, check out the company by visiting their website. You can also do an online search using the company name and visit the Better Business Bureau website to see if they have been listed as a fraudulent company.

They said the total that ended in 1,2,6,7 would be rounded down. Totals that ended in 3, 4,8,9 would be rounded up to the next highest denomination. for example something that totaled $3.47 would be $3.45, something that totaled $3.48 would be $3.50. This is all fine and dandy and evens out slightly except most stores have things that are_.99 so everything would go up and stores would change their prices so things would be rounded up for fear of losing a few pennies. (and you thought pennies were worthless) However there is another detail that even enrages me more: this would not apply if you used plastic, only if you use cash. This is a benefit that supports the rich and punishes the poor of America.

The advantages for home buyers of having their own real estate agent looking out for their best interests are obvious. But the unlikely disadvantages are less obvious.  <br>  If a prospective home buyer wants to purchase a FSBO home, and if the FSBO seller refuses to pay any sales commission (very unlikely), the buyer then has a choice of either pay his/her buyer's agent a commission or don't buy that home.  <br>  A possible problem can occur when the home buyers don't have their own agent and the seller's listing agent offers to act as a disclosed dual agent. In that situation, the dual agent is not supposed to disclose confidential information to the other party.<br>  To illustrate, that means a dual agent cannot disclose to the buyer the lowest sales price the seller has indicated is acceptable. Nor can the dual agent disclose to the home seller the highest price the buyer has revealed would be acceptable.  <br>  But even the most ethical dual agent who knows this confidential information might be tempted to use those details to steer the negotiations, especially on price, to a successful sales contract. <br>  Overall, there is virtually no disadvantage for a home buyer to have his/her own buyer's agent looking out for their best interests, especially since there is no extra cost in 99 percent of home-purchase situations.<br>  HOW TO FIND A GOOD BUYER'S AGENT. The best way to find a superb buyer's agent is to ask friends and business associates for recommendations. Any licensed agent, except the listing agent of the home you want to purchase, can be your exclusive buyer's agent. Most buyer's agents do not require a written agency contract.<br>  But some real estate brokerages represent only home buyers. Unless you have received a superb recommendation to one of these buyer's agents, be wary of signing any exclusive buyer's agent representation for longer than 30 days. <br>  Some of these buyer's agencies insist on a 90-day or even a 180-day exclusive buyer's agency contract. Such contracts should be avoided unless you have been very highly recommended to the agent by a trusted recent home buyer who was very satisfied with that buyer's agent.<br>  SUMMARY: Just as most home sellers have their own listing agents looking out for them, home buyers also need their own exclusive buyer's agents looking out for their best interests. Home buyers should insist on a written agency disclosure so they are very clear who represents whom in the transaction.<br>  <br>  But, as the person above says, yes it is to protect us agents also.

4b4ae51e22f7a1ccbb2ef6e5f920f5e7aa	That depends on the state in which you live.  most states give the landlord anywhere from 15-45 days to return your deposit.  there are a couple states that don't have any regulations as to how long they have to return your deposit.<br>  i would send them a certified letter (make sure to keep a copy of it) giving them your new address and ask them where your deposit is, or if they are keeping it and why they are.  <br>  renters have a lot more rights then they think.  check with your local ( the state in which you rented) housing regulations as to how long the landlord has to get you your deposit back.<br>  if they don't give you your deposit back in the time frame, or if they keep your deposit, and dont get you the list of damages and why they kept the deposit in the time frame then you have the right to demand double the amount back from them.|`|AA10726655	The answer differs by state, and by circumstance. For example, in NY, a landlord with more than 4 apartments is required to refund your deposit, (with accrued interest) within 4 weeks of the end of the lease, or provide documentation as to why the funds were not totally repaid.<br>  You need to contact the States attorney general's office, and find out what the law is in your state. You should send a letter to the landlord, certified/return receipt, with the particulars... (date vacated, amount due, etc) and cc the Attorney General's office. It is not a bad idea to add a CC to a ficticious law office in your current State (CC: Wiell & Bloomberg, Attorney) for example. Use your wife's and mother's maiden name. Makes it kind of fun.

325543522d61fdf739d9d519bc6ab83eaa	You should discuss with the landlord/agent if signing the lease in your name only is an option.  Most landlords in my experience want all people who will occupy the rental unit to be on the lease for two reasons: 1) to provide them all rights a tenant has, such as legal access to and possession of the unit and a voice regarding service requests and so on and; 2) to have all occupants liable for payment of the rent in case someone leaves.  Imagine if the only person on the lease bugs out and leaves one or more "guests" behind for the landlord to deal with....<br>  <br>  The worst thing you could do is conceal the fact that the boyfriend intends to occupy the unit.  If/when the agent finds out - you're in breach of your lease and all the headaches that go with that - including penalties and possible eviction.<br>  <br>  Many apartment communities require a criminal check as a condition of occupancy and to limit their liability.  If you have an unauthorized occupant who also has a criminal history - not good.<br>  <br>  The landlord is likely going to require him to apply and qualify in order to make his residence "official" in the end - so you may as well be up front about his past.  If he explains the nature of his record, and provided his offenses were minor, he'll impress the landlord/agent as someone who is forthright and take much of their apprehension out of play.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	As long as the manager is ok with it, yes.|`|4b4ae51e22f7a1ccbb2ef6e5f920f5e7aa	Typically if he is not on the lease he can not reside in that unit with you.  I'm guessing that you're going into a complex that is handled through a management company so you will want to double check with them if they will allow him to live there without being on the lease, but odds are that they will not let him live there.  I work in property management and I will tell you that if we have tenant and they just allow someone else to live there after we rejected them, that tenant (being you in this situation) would be evicted for breaking their lease agreement, and that would end up just creating more problems for you later.|`|2904df5a431553f5a2509824028e9251aa	You are single still so why not....depends if the lessee asked for both of you to sign|`|72b1b35e81e7d39e237e18972e90ad30aa	A tough situation...Be upfront and list him as part of the agreement...Or do it in reverse.

However, they do expect the associates to be on the professional side and not offend customers.  I would stick to basic hair colors and not go crazy with the hair color.  I know associates who have bright red, a very dark purple or very distinct highlights and that is fine.<br>  <br>  To be on the safe side, you might ask associates in your local PetSmart what is allowed in their store.

The best strategy is to do our homework well and be honest and confident of our salary needs in the interview.<br>  <br>  The degree of salary negotiation depends on the position in question, the interviewer and the organization. Generally there is not much room for negotiation for an entry-level position. For a middle level position the range could vary from 10 to 20 percent.

Instead ask the interviewer to summarize the job responsibilities, to have a thorough understanding of the current position before discussing the compensation package. After getting an insight about the current position and the company, ask the interviewer to quote a salary figure that is most appropriate for a person with your kind of skills. <br>  <br>  Even if you are required to tell the expected salary, mention a range. If the interviewer offers a salary range given by the company for the current position and seeks your response. And if it comes close to your expectations, then quote a range, which places the top of the interviewer's range into the bottom of your range. <br>  <br>  Don't be exited or disappointed about the offer made to you by the interviewer. Take some time to respond to the offer. Don't jump to accept the offer. The recruiter generally starts with a lower range to make a room for negotiations. At times your silence may prompt the interviewer to increase the offer. Or if you repeat the offer and be silent for some time it could also leave some room for negotiations. If you say O.K. it connotes that you have accepted the offer but if you change O.K. to Hmmm watch the difference. <br>  <br>  Prepare for most likely objections from the interviewer, for example: you don't have enough experience, our budget won't permit us for that, that's what we pay to our new hires. <br>  <br>  Show the recruiter that you are worth much more. If your interview has gone off well, don't worry you have already won half the battle. Don't be afraid to ask for a higher salary, don't think that the recruiter may not hire you. Because it costs a great deal of time and money to the interviewer as well to start the selection process afresh. <br>  <br>  But always remember that if you are being paid higher to your market worth, you will be the first one to be shown the door in case the organization is downsizing. <br>  <br>  Determine the opportunities for promotion.

Study the lives of those in public service (Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Theresa, Ghandi, etc.) and you'll realize the paradox is true.|`|AA11770886	Absolutely. Bargain means, getting things for yourself. Strong conviction, confidence and good communication skills etc can get you there. Unless you know how to logically reason out, bargaining is never fruitful. Convince yourself firt that what you are going to bargain has earned your approval first. Any arguement against it should be thrashed with proper arguement and not contradiction. You will get what you want.

If your landlord says that your current apartment was not properly maintained then they may not be willing to move you into another apartment if they feel that they would need to do work on that apartment after you moved out.  She can't force you to stay in your current apartment, but she doesn't have to approve you to move either.  Small claims really wouldn't help you out in this matter either.|`|c7c83d576329d3814b9758f562e6a16baa	Once your lease is up with the apartment complex then you can move out to where ever you choose.

When i bought my flat I just got a building sruvey - obviously you're running the risk of missing a major structural problem but I suppose it's up to you to decide what you think is more important.|`|3e1433c6f5c0370ada723f76b1277e25aa	The survey that the lender will require covers what the lender thinks is important when evaluating the risk to the loan. Generally this is the minimum necessary and far from what might be of interest to the owner if they want to know about the condition.<br>  <br>  A full structural survey is normally the most complete, the most complex and the most costly. All details related to the structure's condition will be examined. <br>  <br>  There is many times an option in the middle that does not require a structural engineer but will look into more details than the bank cares to have checked.<br>  <br>  Expect that the cost for the bank required survey is the least expensive and a full structural survey by a qualified engineer will be the most expensive.<br>  <br>  The costs are relative. You are buying a house. The survey cost is really rather minor compared to the price being paid.<br>  <br>  You also have to look at the situation. A new build property constructed by a major developer will likely have a 10 year guarantee. Hence the financial risk to you as the buyer is greatly reduced even if you did not get a full structural survey.|`|6177583f74dcf44b4636facbd7db2be8aa	This is dependant upon the age and general condition of the property. For instance if you were buying a georgian house it would be wise to get a full structural survey carried out. Now if you are buying a property which, is only twenty years old and you think it looks ok, there is no roof sag or the walls are not bowing outwards. Check the light switches are they the old round type? or new square type? is the ceiling light flex white or brown? This could give you an indication if the property has been re-wired or not. Check to see there is no apparant dampness on internal walls or large cracks to the downstairs of the property, I personally would only get a homebuyer report carried out if all look in good condition. If the surveyor recommends to the mortgage company that it is ok to lend against then generally that can be taken as the property is not going to fall down within the time span of the mortgage.<br>  I am not a surveyor so please do not take this advice as if I were.<br>  But I do hope it helps you in making a decision. Enjoy your new home. When you have made loads of money on your new house perhaps you might want to invest in property abroad I did, I found this company very good.<br>  www.newshores.co.uk

Nothing else, it just takes a little longer to roll over to normal servicing of the loan, well, the TERM of your mortgage just decreased by four months, and your initially estimated payments?

If you are looking for a home based job, the majority of the telecommuting positions you will find will require customer service telephone work.  Freelance projects may be an option, but you'd need to possess a specialized skillset in areas such as programming, website design, or technical writing.  If you are looking for a home business, there will be some start-up costs involved -- I would not recommend paying any money for a "work at home kit" -- look for low cost start-ups with legitimate companies that offer tangible products and/or services.|`|1ea58c41c8d4e6552fe964bf24d2a325aa	Legitimate home based work links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.arise.com/Content/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.arise.com/Content/default.asp</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alpineaccess.com/external/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alpineaccess.com/external/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.liveops.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.liveops.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.workathomeagent.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.workathomeagent.com/</a>|`|m6DJI0TTaa	i work from home from|`|972c756a0dacaa8f78a3428843e01730aa	I have a webpage containing no-scam and no-fee online jobs.

0ZOHhCnoaa	The only true costs to the seller are the Realtor fees.<br>  When writing up a purchase contract, in the contract:<br>  - you must specify on what you will be paying<br>  - what you will not be paying<br>  - whether or not you'll be splitting costs with the buyer on specific things<br>  - whether or not you'll be contributing to THEIR closings costs.<br>  These are all your choices and you have the right to choose on all of them.|`|8ac2467fb20f72d90ec2b114546eaf0daa	closing costs are 100% negotiable. that's part of the offer / counter-offer process. normally, the seller pays for all closing costs and right now in a buyer's market, most buyers know they can get all their closing costs paid by the seller. so, don't be "penny-wise and pound-foolish" when it comes to closing costs. <br>  <br>  also, you're selling a house between friends? that's NEVER a good idea.|`|CvJfcqlLaa	You know, the norm is the buyer pays closing costs, unless the seller WANTS to help out. You do not have to pay anything more than what you have unless you want to, and both parties agree.Though, if the buyer is pushing for you to pay more, be prepared to lose the deal. The people who told you it is your responsibility either had the seller help them or they do it themselves as an incentive to sell faster|`|a93c54d8412e1e987185ad2dbe834400aa	Customarily, the seller can pay up to 6% of the closing costs. There are some things that are required to be paid by the seller (such as real estate brokers, a portion of the taxes, etc.). Mortgages that are usually sold on the secondary market will not usually be accepted by FNMA or other gov't agencies if the seller pays more than 6%.<br>  The GFE is only a starting point. The final is the HUD. Once u sell that you are bound. Don't ever think that you HAVE to sign it. You can always walk away. Just look it over really well before you do sign it. By the way, Regulations states you have the right to review your HUD 24 hours in advance. I suggest you do it.

q8vILEpfaa	Just something to add to the rest of the comments. <br>  <br>  If you had discussed with land Lord your pay cycle and they have agreed and allowed you for a time to do this, a precedence of late pay (and allowance) has been established if you have followed your agreement and paid when you said it will hold up in court.<br>  <br>  That being said you did not tell us what the reason for the notice to vacate, seams as though there is more than we are being told.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Sounds like your landlord wants rent paid on time.

We ASSUME that the averages will continue to have higher returns over cash, bonds, and inflation, but at what relative rate is not known for certain.|`|AA10007793	On a scale of 1-10 its at least a 9.  Thats about the historical long term return after inflation and taxes.|`|izLEVnKIaa	Have to side with NetAdvisor, According to Benjamin Graham (the man who taught Warren Buffet) the average equity returns over a long period are between 5% and 6%. There is a lot of writing in this space that argues that if you buy during a period of lower valuations (P/E under 14) then you can get slightly higher but guying at higher valuations will get you much lower! It should be pointed out that the S&P500 is at the same level that it was in 1997 - that means that if you had put your money into US equities 12 years ago you would have an average return of 0%!! Japan is even worse - you wouldn't have made any money for 26 years. If you invested in 1929, you wouldn't break even until 1955.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you are clever and get some good luck you could quite easily make 7% p/a as you can buy certain bonds that yield near that, especially during recessions. So on a scale of 1-10, then maybe a 7? this could be higher if you learn about trading - but will be much lower if you just buy and hold.

AA10259042	When you see the term 'high yield', think risk, lots of risk.  They normally invest in junk bonds, preferred stock, and other such stuff. The risk is normally a matter of the manager's ability but sometimes the risk transcends ability. Currently, almost anything with the term 'high yield' is performing very poorly because recessions are not a good environment for them.  <br>  <br>  Actually, Vanguard high yield municipal is of very good quality and should be relatively less risky.  Maybe.|`|izLEVnKIaa	They all take the same amount of risk! they are investing in low grade companies debt! Vanguard is the best one just because of the incredibly low fees they charge and a 10% yield is pretty good. tbh HY is a bit risky at this stage of the recession as these companies are at the highest risk of default during a period of high expected defaults. For risk of bond funds you need to look at the Duration. This is actually a measure of sensitivity to interest rates and the higher the number, the riskier the fund (kind of)
24H5tznkaa	You got a lot of great answers. :) In addition, I would use myspace and create a profile simply for your book. You can upload a pic of your book by using photobucket. Then look for blogs that chat about the kind of books that you write. Then request to add people who comment on those blogs, asking them to check out your page and your new book. Perhaps even have an excerpt from the book in your "about me" section. A lot of people on myspace do things like that. <br>  <br>  Even if the initial people you add don't actually buy your book, you immediately have a spot to advertise in. Once the people add you, you send them a comment saying thanks for the add, and you put your photobucket pic of your book in your comment too.

They always interview and hire people who don't care about others.  They never hire people who want to make the difference.<br>  (C) Customers aren't always treated with respect by supermarket employees.  When I applied to work for the supermarkets near me, my motto was "Costumers always comes first."  They wouldn't take a single look at me.<br>  (D) If these supermarkets would start hiring job applicants who care for costumers, supermarkets would be better for the environment.

And because of REG CC, banks can not hold the funds any longer than listed below if the funds are deposited into a Demand Deposit Account.<br>  <br>  If it is a local check it can be held 2 or 7 business days.<br>  If the check is non-local it can be held 5 or 11 days.<br>  Some banks have a different hold length for new accounts, ours is 9 business days.  <br>  <br>  ****If deposited into an interest bearing account such as a savings account, the funds can be held as long as the bank wishes.****
tmh42R6Caa	I don't know how quickly the collections agencies need to respond, but I would expect it to be a month or two.  As long as they report back that your collections are paid in full, you should gain those extra 18 points.  Also try to keep your credit card balances below the limit.  The closer you are to the limit, the more points you lose.

Property prices have fallen so yours might be cheaper now than 3 years ago.<br>  As to the mortgage - walk don't run. There are still a few lenders out there who will lend 100% of the discounted price. But be prepared to pay a premium because of your credit history. Many lenders treat defaults the same as CCJ's. The extension will have to wait until you are out of the pre -emption period.

The only exception is if you were on salary, but there are regulations of who can be on salary and unless  you were a manager you can't be salary at fast food. <br>  <br>  However, you really don't have much of a case for a lawsuit at this point.

I would hope that over time there will be room for personal development for personal satisfaction in the job, which in turn can only benefit the Company.<br>  <br>  Why did you choose a career in administration ?<br>  <br>  I believe the skills I have mean it is an ideal career option for me.  I am very calm and controlled, with a neat and orderly manner of working.  I am able to prioritise worlkloads to meet deadlines within desired timeframes and am neat, precise and pay attention to detail.  I have strong computer skills and familiarity with most Microsoft software at intermediate level and I can handle routine tasks without loss of concentration always taking a deep pride in all my work responsibilities. <br>  <br>  How would you describe yourself ?<br>  <br>  I would describe myself as honest and supportive of others, organised and methodical and task driven with a keen desire to be successful and meet high standards in any work I undertake.<br>  <br>  Can you act on your own initiative ? In what way ?<br>  <br>  Yes I am able to act under my own initiative.  I am a person who likes to be busy and driven by a pride in results.  If there is a task to be done I will do it and need little supervision as I am methodical and decisive when required, and will do what is needed to complete the task at hand to the required standard.  An example of a time when I worked under my own initiative is when I ...........<br>  <br>  In the past what time did you use your skills to resolve a problem ?<br>  <br>  A time when I resolved a problem was ..............<br>  <br>  I do understand that in order to resolve problems :<br>  <br>  - Decide how serious the problem is<br>  - Take into account how often it occurs<br>  - Decide and consider Health & Safety issues, breach of your    contract, not having been given proper training to do a job, poor instructions given so you’re not sure what you’re supposed to do etc<br>  - Try to decide the best way to solve the problem – this could be as simple as speaking to the person whose inexperience caused a problem<br>  - You could discuss a problem with your colleagues and pool ideas<br>  - Raise the matter with your supervisor or manager if there is a need <br>  - Make sure you are guided by the policies and procedures of the company<br>  - You must always remain calm and not let emotions get out of hand and give people chance to come up with a solution, and always be prepared to discuss and share ideas<br>  <br>  NB   Either list as above or ensure your example covers the points      mentioned above<br>  <br>  Hope these ideas are useful and best of luck.|`|ipiCyE3zaa	Why do you want to work for this company?<br>  "It seemed like a good move to make, considering the high level of sucess you achieve.

I am eager to move forward in the organization and learn as much as possible on the way up.<br>  <br>  Why did you choose a career in admin?<br>  (Admin really isn't a job.  Is this an Admin Assistant job?)  I am a very organized person.  I am very strong in keeping spreadsheets, calendars, etc.  I like being the "go-to" for Manager/Executives who need help with their daily tasks.

cK28Kl0Uaa	The website issue is really a "non-issue".  Companies often don't keep there website updated.  Inform them you would like your name/info removed from it.  They probably haven't even thought about it being there but would be glad to remove your name if you were fired.<br>  <br>  Companies with 50 or more employees within a 75 mile radius are required to provide you Family Medical Leave when you have worked at the company for a year.  I doubt the day-care center qualifies and since you just worked a few months you wouldn't qualify anyway.  The state of NY is a "right to work state", meaning you can quit at any time for any reason and they have the same benefit.  It might not have been cool the way they let you go, but there is nothing illegal about it.  <br>  <br>  Regarding the lack of break periods, go to the state wage & hour agency and file a complaint.  You will need actually documentation to show this was occuring.  They will then audit the company to determine the practices.  If they deem it did occur you will typically get 3x the missed pay (1/2 hour they made you work, would result in 1.5 hours of pay).|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	sorry but you have little rights and from what you said they did everything correctly, there is no federal law for breaks only for minors

AA11206283	Nope. One has nothing to do with the other unless you are involved in RICO actions by the Feds.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	No, but there are a few other things that could happen. If the sale of  your house doesn't cover the full debt, your bank can sue you and get your wages garnished until the difference is repaid. Your only option to get out of the debt at that point would be bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court would consider all your assets and may force you to spend everything you have toward the debt before your bankruptcy goes through. <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  If the bank cancels the debt they are obligated to issue you a 1099 for the amount of canceled debt. This counts as income and will be reported to the IRS. If the bank cancels a significant debt, then it could leave you with a huge tax bill and then the IRS would be after you. If that happens, bankruptcy won't help a bit and the IRS can actually take your stuff and sell it if you refuse to set (and stick to) a reasonable payment plan.|`|1OMpG5cPaa	NO <br>  They will take your house only There is a way to stay at your house <br>  Just say :Present the Note -and you can stay at your house until the Lender will find your Note on a mortgage which is impossible right now where everything everywhere is a mass
r9nxFkGtaa	You can call the electric company to find out what the average is for that house - this is paid by the month.  There will also be property tax - you can call City Hall to find out how much they are - this is an annual expense.  You should also have insurance on the house - another annual expense.|`|AA11206283	Should be able to find a tax bill; or call the county.<br>  <br>  Ditto with an electric bill.<br>  <br>  May be homeowner's assessments.<br>  <br>  Insurance<br>  <br>  Maintenance.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If your grandpa is still mentally able, just ask  him what the typical bills were. they really vary a lot from one area to the next so another option would be to introduce yourself to the next door neighbor and ask them. <br>  <br>  For my house, it averages $200-$400 per month for all the utilities with the highest months being in the winter when the furnace runs a lot. Plus I pay $2400 per year in property taxes and $500 per year in homeowners insurance.|`|irLnPW4aaa	You will have the bills:<br>  water/sewer (in my area they are billed quarterly)<br>  Gas (or oil, depending on the heat source in the home)<br>  Electric <br>  Phone<br>  Cable/Satellite<br>  <br>  and the biggest one:  Property Taxes <br>  <br>  The best idea for you would be to ask your friends Grandfather what these bills typically cost him each month.  Remember that the price of the bills may vary depending on how much you use the electric, heat, etc.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	You will have to pay for utilities (gas,electric, water, cable, phone, maybe heating oil if that is what they use).  Depends on where you live for these costs - but figure at least $200 a month for all of them.  Maybe trash pickup.<br>  <br>  You will also have to pay for real estate taxes - your town or county can give you the amount.  House insurance - ask an insurance agent - typically $500 a year for a modest house.<br>  <br>  You will also have to pay for repairs and maintenance if you can't fix things yourself.  Count on 1% of the value of the house for various repairs per year - so if the house is worth $150,000, set aside $1,500 a year for major repairs and maintenance.<br>  <br>  Also consider yard costs - snow removal, grass cutting, leave raking.   That depends on where you live.  Grass cutting in my area is $25 per mow, and it is weekly in the summer.<br>  <br>  You also might want to do some cosmetic things - like paint, new lighting, replacing fixtures.  Amount???<br>  <br>  Basically, ask your mom to go through every check and credit card statement for the last year and you will have a good budget.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Nobody here can give you that kind of information.  It all depends on where you live and how much of each of these you use.  We could live right next door to each other and our bills could be significantly different.  If you let your dryer run, keep your house warmer and keep your hot water tank cranked up really hot your bill could be hundreds more than mine!  Plus in some towns your property taxes cover things that other towns don't.  We just moved a year ago and in our old town we had a utility bill that was for water, sewer, garbage, fire department.  Here we have a septic tank and well, and the garbage and fire are covered with our property taxes so we don't get a utility bill at all.  Right there is a difference of $75.00 a month!<br>  <br>  I wish I could help more but I don't want to misinform you because even from house to house prices can change!<br>  <br>  You will have to call the electric and gas companies and see what the average cost has been over the last months.  Call your village hall and get the cost of taxes and ask if you have to pay a utility bill.  They will have all this information for you.<br>  <br>  If her grandfather has been living there he should have old bills that will give you an idea of what he has been spending so that will at least give you a minimum cost of what you will have to pay.
izLEVnKIaa	These refer to the two different types of underground gold that the gold bearing land has. They are purely regulatory terms and used in market filings.<br>  <br>  Reserves are known as proven and probable - This is where there has been a full investigation and drilling and mapping has taken place to a standard deemed acceptable to the stock exchange they are listed on. Proven can be counted on the companies balance sheet, probable is just that - what they expect to be there but cannot be guaranteed.<br>  <br>  Resources are known as measured and inferred, they are for new projects that have had a viability study but not a full drill and map to market standard. They let potential investors know that there should be gold there, but they cant say proven or probable as they are legal terms.<br>  <br>  Resources is also the generic term for gold in ground when talking about gold in an area.|`|ecg3Zeh6aa	1) Reserves are gold that is "above ground", refined and processed, in storage, ready to come to market.<br>  2) Resources could be what is in the ground waiting to be mined.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You might be playing with fire by moving because squatters rights, as I understand it, has to do with being in the same place for a certain length of time.  If you change apartments and utilities, etc., could turn into a liability to you someone more clever comes up with.  As far as the scam artist, I'm surprised anyone fell for it.  Until you're issued formal documents that indicate the new legal owner, ergo landlord, to whom you should pay rent, you don't have to worry about it EXCEPT, maybe, if the former landlord decides he wants the money.  The disposition of the property has nothing at all to do with your tenant agreements.  The landlord could potentially come back and decide he wants all that rent.  He can't evict you because he doesn't own the property, but he could win a judgment that you still owed the money and should have held it aside until you were provided a new remittance address.  <br>  <br>  But be prepared that when the time comes, it will all run on their schedule, and not yours, when it comes to getting deposits and rents.  If I were you, I'd just start channeling the energy into finding a new, legitimate place to live rather than live on a razor blade waiting for the axe to fall.|`|QCvt7txOaa	well wht i say to dat is..were u live.. i wana come check it out some time..and mayb look u ovr to;)|`|EXJfoGtAaa	That would be trespassing.  When property changes ownership, either by sale or foreclosure, the new owner must honor existing leases.  I recently found an interesting related site; www.sftu.org/sale.html.  If foreclosure hasn't been completed you legally owe rent to your landlord (owner).  You must make an attempt to remain current on you rent payments.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	There is an owner, there is ALWAYS an owner.  In this case, it sounds like the bank.<br>  <br>  The bank can come to you at any time and force you to pay rent, as well as suing you for back rent.  Are you prepared to pay the rent on the apartment you're moving into from the period the bank took possession.<br>  <br>  This is really risky, I'd stay where you are, at least you have a legitimate reason for being there.
9BnwWBVdaa	I agree with the "off to jail" answerer and have this to add: this kind of bogus reporting is half of what got this country into this economic mess that we're in.  People falsifying reported income, loan agents pumping people up into thinking they could afford more than they really could.  Do not jeopardize your career/family/freedom/reputation to help get someone into a loan that they may or may not be able to afford.  What you need to do is to give this former employee a truthful report when someone else calls you for an employment reference.  That is the biggest favor you can do.  He will have to get the home/job/etc on his own merits and abilities.|`|AA11173563	yes you will be committing fraud and off to jail you go.

This is exactly why the economy is the way it is. I used to be a mortgage processor and it's insane how verification of employment can make or break a deal.

Are a big chunk of the cause of the mortgage crisis!|`|d47305266fba2aad6e741727872855e1aa	Perhaps something could come back to you but the chances of that are very slim.<br>  <br>  This happens all the time and if you like the guy I am sure you fell compelled to help him.<br>  <br>  Its a tough call so good luck.
j1R3FBX5aa	Im a recruiter who lives in the Bay area now, but lived in LA from 1995 - 2006.  They are totally different worlds - if your looking for a fast paced enviornment, LA is the place to be.  The Bay area is much more laid back and relaxed.  Either locations have strong job opportunities, engineering a little stronger in the bay area, media/entertainment stronger in LA.  Both locations are spendy, but you can find reasonable housing if you look outside the prime areas (ie outside of SF and outside of Santa Monica/Bev Hills etc)|`|AA11988627	I’ve lived in both places and now live outside San Francisco. Opportunity-wise, SFO would be the better way to go. Expense-wise, it’s six of one half a dozen of the other: they’re both pricey and there’s a reason for that: they both offer a great deal, especially for a younger couple. As far as lifestyle goes, that’s quite subjective. I lived in LA the first 30 years (give or take) of my life and have lived here in the Bay Area for about 11, and this is the better fit for me.  A question: what are your hobbies? Are you into outdoor sports, museums, clubs, dining? What would you do on a three day weekend? LA has it all over the Bay Area in terms of climate, but it can’t beat SFO for various nightlife activities. <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Rita

sI3krJULaa	Okay you start with 800 units valued at 5,600.<br>  With the purchase, you have 800+1,700=2,500 with a value of 20,900 (5,600+(1,700*9)).<br>  <br>  Now, I'm assuming, due to the title of your question, that you're using FIFO.  If not, then the rest is going to be wrong.<br>  <br>  With sale on 6/11, 2,000 units are sold.  Because you have to use the oldest inventory first, you first get rid of the 800 you had from the previous year.  Then you need to take out 1,200 from the 1,700 you bought on Feb. 24.  You then have 500 left @ $9, or 4,500.<br>  <br>  With purchase at 8/17, you add 2,100 to the 500 for 2,600 units at a total cost of 27,600 (the 4,500 from above, plus the new 2,100 @ $11).<br>  <br>  With next sale, you still have 500 left of the 2/24 purchase (see above), so you sell those, and need to take 1,100 more from the 8/17 purchase to reach the full 1,600 unit sale.  You purchased a total of 2,100 on 8/17, so if you subtract out 1,100, you are left with 1,000 units @ $11, or 11,000.<br>  <br>  At the final purchase, you ad 3,000 for a total of 4,000.  You add 42,000 in value (3,000*$14) to the 11,000 you had left for a total of 53,000.<br>  <br>  At the final sale, you sell all of the remaining 1,000 from the 8/17 purchase, and need to sell 1,700 more from the 10/19 purchase to reach the total 2,700 units.  That leaves you with 1,300 units at 12/31/06 (3,000-1,700).  The value of that inventory is 18,200 (1,300 units @ the 10/19 purchase price of $14).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :0)
OFclTT5Uaa	Actually that's what's good about incorporating your business.  Its no longer under your tax ID and is its own taxpaying entity.  So if something happens to your business, it doesn't affect your personal.  <br>  <br>  For a better detailed answer go down to your bank and ask to speak with their finance advisor about your business.  Most will do it for free.  Even the manager there will know more about the corporate obligations and where they fall

vG0tsqJtaa	No not at all.. You can resell them.|`|on9xLWegaa	No.  People sell shoes on ebay all the time.  When you bought them, they're yours.  You can do whatever you want with them.|`|mmAjpMX1aa	It's perfectly legal to buy shoes as raw materials that you increase the value of by decorating, for you to re-sell at a higher price.  Once you buy those shoes, they are yours to do with what you want.  That's the way all manufacturing businesses work.  People who make dresses buy cloth from all sorts of sources, but they don't pay "royalties" to the cloth companies.  Computer manufacturers don't pay royalties to the raw metal companies they use to make their components.<br>  <br>  Do you know how entangled the process would become if everyone had to trace back royalties through suppliers, right down to the owner of the land who grew the trees that wood came from?<br>  <br>  No, what you're thinking of applies only to unique artistic license, it doesn't apply to materials used.<br>  <br>  What you're thinking of, and what would be illegal, is if you decorated those shoes and then marketed them under an already-registered copyrighted name.  Or if you decorated them with material already copyrighted by someone else.  You wouldn't be able, for instance, to buy Nike Air, paint them, and re-sell them as "Nike Air 2".<br>  <br>  Likewise, you can't legally paint scenes of The Simpsons or Harry Potter on shoes and then sell them, because those characters are protected by copyright laws and can only be sold with the authorization of the creators.  But decorated with your own unique art, that's certainly legal.|`|eecaa1fdbb1b78f2dd74a5ac8e2f021faa	nope, once you buy the shoes from a store or a vendor, they are yours to resell.<br>  <br>  it''s just like when a company buys hanes t-shirts, then screen prints their logo on it and sells them.<br>  <br>  i know a friend in las vegas that takes plain white stripper heels and paints them and puts stickers and rhinestones on them and sells them for about $100!|`|MuXcs6FTaa	Sure you can do that.

EzrdyxAiaa	of course!!!|`|yFG0NhD4aa	  sadly, everything is attached to our credit score these days: renting, loans, insurance, etc...<br>  <br>    2 years ago, a pretty good score was under 650, but over 600.  Now, to get approved, banks (many that I work with) require your score to be greater than 700.  If you are getting a loan via your LLC, they will ask for financial records, which will include copies of your last 2 (or so) years tax returns, and assets.  This will need to be updated every few years or annually, and each time you apply for a loan (for the most part, use this as guideline, not 100%, as all lending institutions practices vary).  You may need proof of assets, or for bigger loans, some institutions will require you to move your funds to their facilities and have monthly payments automatically drafted.  <br>    If money is an issue, and you would rather not deal w/ your credit, if you are a not for profit LLC, try to get donations.  Even if you aren't a NFP, have some fundraisers, raffles, 50/50 drawing to help support what you may need funding for.  <br>  <br>    If you don't have credit built up for your business and you get a loan, they will pull your personal score.  Even after you have established a positive business credit history via your LLC, your credit score as an individual still factors in.<br>  <br>    That is where a partner comes in to play.  If you can (in writing) agree to workout a deal where you do the labor for work, they do the financing end (if your score is an issue and theirs is satisfactory).<br>    GOOD LUCK TO YOU!

TQVMAZUbaa	Golferwhoworks is mostly correct, but you do not have to buy the security back before settlement.  <br>  <br>  When you sell short, you are hoping that the price of the security that you are "shorting" will go down over time.  There is no time limit to when you choose to buy to "cover" your short.  However, if the price moves up, your broker will require you to deposit additional funds to cover the increasing cost to cover the buy.|`|9w8EW24daa	when you think the price of a stock will go down, you short sell. if it goes down you earn money, if it goes up you loose money.|`|AA11173563	selling what you do not own.

The time is actually not easy to state your preferences, but sometimes we can keep ourselves financially afloat by doing a job which we know is bearable but not forever.  I have done so, out of need. I'm afraid that qualifications, although they may help, are not always a guarantee to work.  I have a uni degree but have not managed for all sorts of reasons to get an appropriate job.

You can't expect to find the exact right job for yourself, but then you may be lucky... <br>  What I have found is that one job may lead to another and it may help you just looking at the direction you want to go in, take whatever you can get, and just keep your eyes and ears open!|`|jNx9tVxqaa	Any job will do which catches your attention.

85a4c9cde9714c89ebb089295f22fa0daa	I used to get paid on the first and if it fell on a weekend, we would get paid the Friday prior. My employer changed it to getting paid on the 15th (once a month, it took me 2 years to get my bills all lined up for mid-month, because some places did not believe me, when I told them how I got paid), now if the 15th lands on Saturday, we get paid Friday, if it falls on Sunday, we get paid Monday (official verbage is " If the 15th is a non-workday, payday is the day that is closest to the 15th").

Besides, either way it will cost you alot more than 1,000.00 in the long run with all the interest they tack on, and in this mess of an economy it will only get worse before it gets better.

It also depends on how long it will take you to pay it off. If you can pay it off in one year or less and have good credit you may be able to get a zero intrest for 6 months or a year  credit card. If it will take you longer to pay it off then go with the bank loan. The intrest rate in the bank loan will probably be much better than a credit card for an extended amount of time..|`|AA11335536	First get a quote to see what insurance will cost.

At the expiration of the 30-day notice period, you must go to court and file An Action in Forcible Entry and Detainer.  A court date will be set and the sheriff will serve her with a summons.  She can then ask for a trial, and if granted, a second date will be set (usually within the next 7 - 10 days).  At that date, teh judge will hold a hearing and if you win, you will receive an order allowing you to evict her with a date for the eviction.

K45ZTwryaa	The website mentioned by DJ is just an attorney listing service.  It is somewhat self serving for attorneys and is not likely to be indicative of anything negative about a particular attorney.<br>  <br>  You can check with your state bar association to confirm an attorneys credentials and also whether any complaints have been filed against them with the state bar.<br>  <br>  Be aware that any complaints in and of themselves are not necessarily indicative of a bad attorney, especially where litigation attorneys are involved.  There are always clients that are unhappy with the results of their case regardless of how realistic their expectations may have been and there is nothing to stop them from filing a complaint against the attorney with the state bar.  With that in mind if a few complaints do show up it is important to see how they were resolved by the state bar.<br>  <br>  The other place you can check is martindale.com.  Martindale is another attorney listing service but it also includes a fairly objective attorney rating service that is based on peer review (i.e by other attorneys, judges, legal academics etc.).  It has one rating based on legal accumen and accomplishment and another based on professional ethics.  It is important to note however that like all listing services, if a lawyer does not choose to pay for listing you will not find them in there and many competent criminal defense attorneys choose to forgo the expense of paying for attorney listing services.|`|FeivZKiaaa	Check our the following:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Handelonthelaw.com     - they have a lawyer referable service for free

See below for the CRA page dealing with child care expenses.<br>  <br>  Also, I disagree with the "rule of thumb" about determining whether an item is deductible.  In my opinion, most of the existing tax credits and deductions were devised for political reasons, and do not necessarily represent good public policy.|`|MqNTKXlKaa	No, you cannot write off all of your daycare expenses.  CRA has placed limits on the amount.  For children born from 1992-2001 the amount is $4,000.00, children 2002 and later $7,000.00.<br>  <br>  Private school cannot be written off.  If they have an after school daycare program, excluding any sports or recreational activities, the daycare portion may be covered.<br>  <br>  A good rule of thumb when deciding whether something is deductible or not is to ask yourself if you think the taxpayers should pay for the expense.

O8qdCBzLaa	Right now, the housing market is still going down for two reasons: First, there is still a glut of inventory on the market, particularly distressed properties (foreclosures and short sales). Second, people are not buying - they're waiting for the prices to hit rock bottom or they simply can't afford it (poor credit, low income, can't come up with down payment, etc.). When prices do start to flatten, you'll see a run on property that will make prices jump up initially, dip down a bit, and then start a steady incline again. And, I would expect this to start in late 2009 or early 2010.<br>  <br>  If you are financially and emotionally ready to purchase a home right now, do so and don't look back. Prices are still very low compared with peaks a couple years ago, and interest rates are at or near historic lows. Regardless whether you buy now or 6 months from now, you will still be getting a good deal that will look like a steal 10 years from now.<br>  <br>  I bought a foreclosure condo as income property in July of 2008 for $200K. I could have gotten a similar unit a few months later for about $190K if I had just waited. But, the property I bought sold for $385K in 2005. So, I'll still be ahead on the deal 10 years or so from now and I'm making money (positive cash flow) on the rental unit. Should I have waited? In retrospect, yes. But, it will hardly matter at all when property values rebound 10 or so years from now.|`|ePkiOzPSaa	If you can afford it, then now is the time.  You may want to kick yourself if the prices go down a bit more, which no one will be able to predict, but your chances of getting in at the absolute bottom are near 0%, so it's all a concern of risk vs reward.  In my opinion, you are better safe than sorry, because when it does go back up, if it gets back out of your price range, it might be there for a while, and then you will be kicking yourself for years and years.  <br>  <br>  No one can predict exactly what will happen, but if you KNOW that you can get in now, and you don't know if you will be able to get in in the future... well, it just seems silly to me that you would risk losing everything in order to save a few thousand dollars over the course of 30 years.|`|CDqKAIEAaa	Real estate is a very segmented and not an<br>  organized market, so you will not see a V-type<br>  bottom.

Home ownership is one of the best choices we could have.  Homes will go up and homes will go down.  Are we at the bottom?  No one will know that until we are at higher prices.  We won't recognize that until it has come and gone.  That will be 3-5 years down the road when we recognize that a bottom occurred.

In order to conserve copper for the war effort, the government minted pennies in steel-coated zinc. They only did it for one year because the public complained about the new pennies- they were easily confused with dimes in change. They are relatively common so only ones that are in excellent condition are worth much; most are worth no more than 15 to 25 cents.<br>  <br>  <br>  But there is a bid on ebay for $2.05 for a 1943 silver penny.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	1 cent|`|JcOOvjIZaa	a dollar?

You want to write on the check that it is for the principal.<br>  <br>  You might also be able to set it up as an electronic payment, so the regular payment goes through automatically.  That way your additional payments will go toward the principal.

All of the appraisals I have been seeing are very much lower and very conservative.  You can get your own appraisal, but the lender may not accept it.  Remember, they are basing their decision on the appraisal and don't have to accept an outside appraisal.|`|806455f30adefbff1e3b1fbdc3ecc722aa	You can get another appraisal. Your appraisal, though, cannot be used for the mortgage transaction. The lender orders the appraisal. <br>  <br>  You pay for the appraisal to show the lender that the collateral is worth enough to justify the loan. The point is a licensed, trained, experienced professional lets the bank know that the value is there. In this case, the licensed professional did his/her job and let the lender know the collateral was not sufficient.<br>  <br>  The appraisal isn't a game you need to win to get a loan. The appraisal is an impartial observation that lets the bank know whether this is a good deal.<br>  <br>  You are looking at this the wrong way, though. Thank this appraiser. He/she likely kept you from purchasing a home that is over-valued. Over the past couple years, appraisers were pressured to inflate values. The result? Many people purchased homes for more than the actual worth, and are now stuck.<br>  <br>  Barns and sheds rarely have value attached to them.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL<br>  You don't purchase equity. The home is worth the lower of the appraised value or the sales price. If the home were worth more, someone would have stepped forward and purchased it for more. If the bank could have sold the property for a higher price, the bank would have done so.<br>  <br>  People watch HGTV and think value magically appears in a home. It doesn't. People who lived that dream found out it was built on sand. The wind blew, and the values fell. It's called California. It's called Nevada. Arizona. Florida. <br>  <br>  A home is a place to live, not an investment. If you feel you paid the right price and plan to live there, then you did good. If you purchased a place you don't like because you think you could turn around and sell it for a higher price even though nobody was willing to pay the higher price, then don't purchase the home. You'll be disappointed.<br>  <br>  Appraisals and appraisers are under such scrutiny right now that I can assure you no appraiser is just slapping a price on an appraisal. If the appraisal cannot stand on its own, or if inappropriate comps were used, or if the rational doeesn't make sense, the lender will stop using the appraiser. The appraiser can lose his/her license. The appraiser can also be charged with bank fraud. Yes. Bank fraud. <br>  <br>  If the lender did the loan based upon the appraisal, then the appraisal was likely done well. So many lenders are asking for field reviews, additional comps, etc. right now. Automated valuation models are telling underwriters when an appraisal is off in either direction. If the appraisal went through without any of those issues, then the appraisal is likely very accurate.

brOOXQfYaa	Start with your Note.  You should have your Mortgage Note, signed at closing.  It will describe how the ARM will adjust.  Many ARMs are adjusting down right now because of the drop in all of the key lending indexes.  If you have no trouble making your payments, I would consider getting aggressive with your payback.  Start adding major principal payments to your payments.  That will reduce your principal faster and lessen the impact of future rates adjustments.  Refinancing is not an option until you owe less than it is worth.  That will only happen 1 of 3 ways...  Pay down, Bring Money to closing, or wait for market appreciation.  A modification will not work.  You are not behind, you make plenty of money so you are in a positive cash flow.  Banks are trying to help homeowners that are in negative cash flow situations or are already behind.  hang in there.|`|3tuwWidiaa	You can't refi because your house is worth less than what you owe.  Your best option is to find the $30,000 in cash (plus a little extra) or from some other source.  Then, refi for 90% of the VALUE of the house with a fixed rate mortgage.<br>  <br>  You say that your payments keep going up.  Why?  Because you have an ARM.  Did the ARM not work out as planned?  Did some unexpected clause kick-in that's making this a more expensive mortgage than you thought it would be?<br>  <br>  Or can you not afford your payments because of a job loss or pay cut?  If your income hasn't changed (in the downward direction), you shouldn't be having any challenge in paying your mortgage because (unless there was a surprise clause) this is the mortgage you signed up for.<br>  <br>  That's good, because when you signed up for the mortgage, you had a plan for how you'd pay it.  Right?  Or was the plan to refi in a few years?<br>  <br>  If so, let's go back to the refi plan: find the $30K somehow and refi for a smaller mortgage.<br>  <br>  Other than that, can you think of why someone would lend you the money?  After all, the house is worth less than you're asking.|`|ExqJ0ge0aa	lol, I always love the assumptions people make here about people's personal finances.  Just because you got an ARM does not mean you are irresponsible.  I had one, and that is how my husband and I own our house.  We also refinanced into a 30 year fixed rate, when banks are at their tightest lending criteria in recent history.  However,m I have to say, much of what you are saying doesn't make sense.  Are you applying for a 30 year fixed, or are you applying for government programs to help you out of your ARM?  Govt programs will claim you make too much.  Banks would NEVER turn someone away because they had too much money.  Perhaps the problem is you do not have enough equity in your home to offset the $30,000 your house is no longer worth (for any haters reading this, it isn't the homeowners fault the market tanked...it's bad timing, and exacerbating the problem).  If this is the case, do what you need to do to find the $30,000 and put it down on the house when you go to refinance.  Best of luck|`|ePkiOzPSaa	The consideration of being "responsible homeowners" may not last, considering you clearly bit off more than you could chew with the ARM.  Anyways, it will be difficult to make any headway, mostly because you owe more than the house is worth.  That is the main reason that you are unable to switch to a fixed rate, not many people will want to offer you a loan for more than the house is worth.  You could try shopping around at different lenders to see if anyone will refinance, but it's not going to be a sure thing.<br>  <br>  My advice would definitely be to NOT fall behind on your payments.  Are there limits to the rate which your ARM can go up to?  Your best choice now would be to cut living expenses wherever possible and work more, get a part time job if necessary.  If you foresee having financial issues in the future, now would be a good time to start trying to build yourself a cushion.<br>  <br>  Definitely keep in contact with your lender about the situation.  Is there any way that you can go over the head of the person who you are dealing with now?|`|AA11173563	that is the truth unless you have a FHA or VA note. If you have either you can streamline with out an appraisal and get a fixed note with no problems as long as you stay current<br>  I am a mortgage banker in TN & KY|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Wait a few weeks to find out exactly how the Obama administration's homeowner "bailout" is going to work. It is my understanding that people who have a mortgage payment on their primary residence that is more than 31% of their gross income will qualify for mortgage relief in the form of being able to convert to a fixed interest rate at market rates. And, this is regardless of whether or not you are currently in default. Now, I don't know this for sure and could be wrong. So, just wait until everything is definite from the feds.<br>  <br>  Either way, I would highly discourage you from letting your mortgage go into default. It's a major hit on your credit that will affect so much more than just this mortgage. Just sit back and see what happens in the next few weeks before you decide to do something foolish.

5BTKscZraa	Per your update: the problem with a consolidation loan is that once your cards are paid off and you have all that available credit again, the temptation is just too great to start using the cards again...and the result is usually that you wind up with twice as much debt as when you started. It sounds like your wife already has issues with spending behind your back so this might be risky to do.<br>  <br>  CCCS is a non-profit...I think that there might be a $20 a month fee (check with your local CCCS). Considering her past behavior, CCCS might be ideal as part of this program involves promising to stop using debt. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Credit card companies only negotiate if you have either defaulted or are right at the point of default. They do not negotiate on current accounts. <br>  <br>  Your financial situation does not appear to be dire after reviewing what you've outlined. You should consider having her enter into a debt management plan with CCCS....that would put the brakes on her getting into more debt. <br>  <br>  Contact your local Red Cross for a referral to the local Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) in your area. They can negotiate lower payments and interest rates. They DO NOT negotiate settlements.<br>  <br>  They will require you to stop using all credit and to cut up your cards. Your credit report will be updated to "enrolled in debt management." This does not damage your credit, but it may make it impossible to obtain new credit while you are enrolled in their program....so don't use this service if you anticipate applying for a new apartment, car loan or mortgage anytime soon, as you would probably be denied while you're enrolled in the CCCS debt management program.... Otherwise, it can be a very good way to deal with your debt.<br>  <br>  Plan B would be to deliberately default on your cards to negotiate settlements. This is a risky/dangerous move to make...your creditors might sue you instead of settling. Of course this would also ruin your credit rating.|`|kifwyOgKaa	Since your home is paid for, you could contact your bank and ask about a home equity line of credit.

I took out a small loan (non-secured with a good interest rate) from my building society (￡500!) to pay for this, even before I had been offered a job.  I made sure the loan was for enough to use it to pay back the first few payments until I got a job & was paid.  I made sure I could pay it back in a lump sum with no/small penalty later when I had been paid enough, which saved money on interest.  The job I did get was quite good pay for my qualifications/experience but required smart clothes & a short commute on the train, so I really needed the money.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend everyone to do this - it was a bit risky.  You need to make the decision for yourself if you want to do this or not.<br>  <br>  I think your other alternatives are ask friends/family for a small loan, or see if you quality for a crisis loan from Jobcenter, or maybe try your local credit union, or (if you have to) a credit card with an interest free period (again I wouldn't recommend this to everyone!)<br>  <br>  When I started my job I was offered an advance of half a months salary early - I had been honest and said I had recently received Jobseekers & before that Incapacity Benefit.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you are working again soon.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	How to Sell on eBay<br>  <br>  Selling on eBay is as easy as going through a few steps. It's user friendly and can always be edited. Here's how you can sell on eBay. If there are any questions you can always go to the "Help" section of the site.<br>  <br>  Instructions:<br>  <br>  Step 1. Sign up. Assuming you haven't yet signed up yet, go to eBay's Main Pageand then click on register at the very top of the page to create an eBay account.   You will also need to sign up for a PayPal account.  Sign up for PayPal first, as it will take a day or so to complete the registration process for PayPal.<br>  <br>  Step 2. Build your account. It's a very good idea to buy a few things and pay immediately so that you will get some feedback ratings. (Don't buy things to resell, just buy things you'd buy anyway.) This will give you experience with the site and start to build up your "site cred". <br>  <br>  -Search eBay for items like those you want to sell. Read the listings. What sort of information or photos do you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer? What makes you think a seller is trustworthy? <br>  <br>  Step 3. Assemble the information you will need to place the listing. Usually this includes measuring the item, weighing the item so you can estimate shipping costs, and having your photos ready. <br>  <br>  Step 4. Log in and go to Sell either in My eBay or on the Main Page at the top. <br>  <br>  Step 5. Enter the title and description, after choosing a category. Be very detailed about your product, and include as many pictures as possible.  The more pictures, the better your item will sell.  Not including one will deter a lot of buyers from your item. <br>  <br>  Step 6. Continue to go through the options, and be sure to look everything over very carefully. There's a lot to look through and you'll want to make sure everything is correct.  Do not waste your money by opting for the "upgrades" for your listing.  In 10 years of selling, I have never upgraded any of my listings and have done great. <br>  <br>  Step 7. Double check everything before saving. Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the overview page) to double check and press submit. If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay. <br>  <br>  Step 8. Watch the auction. Once the item has been shipped, and they have left feedback for you, you should leave feedback for that person. <br>  <br>  *Tips*<br>  <br>  -Consider using a photo hosting service to add extra pictures to your listing for free.  If you use the ebay photo hosting service, the first photo is free, each additional picture is .15 cents.  I use Seller's Sourcebook for all of my listings.  I can choose from over 1000 different auction templates, add as many pictures as I want and I can even upload my listings to ebay from the Seller Sourcebook site.   Every one of my listings look very professional and I am proud to show my items using a professionally designed template.  Other photo hosting sites are Inkfrog and Photobucket.  There is a charge for Inkfrog, but Photobucket is free.<br>  -You need to have excellent feedback to sell well on eBay. <br>  <br>  -Sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback first.<br>  <br>  -As long as you follow the directions and press submit at the end, your product will be viewable to everyone.   It can take up to 12 hours for your item to show up under the general search.<br>  <br>  -Always answer a customer's questions promptly. Be clear, direct, and friendly. <br>  <br>  -Be sure to choose the correct category and keywords... the easier it is for your customer to find you, the better it will sell! <br>  <br>  -You will have to ship the product out on your own, so you're going to have to add shipping into the price; there's a section where you set the shipping. <br>  <br>  -You can always go back and edit it if you don't like something. Just go into "My eBay" and go from there.   Once a bid in placed on  your item, you cannot edit any information in your listing.  You can add to the description, you just cannot edit the main body of your description.<br>  <br>  -Keep good communication with your customer - they're interested in your product and you want to be ranked as a good seller in the end, so be a good seller! <br>  <br>  -Try and have it so your auction ends on a Sunday. Avoid ending auctions on Friday or Saturday when people are not home to bid. <br>  <br>  -Avoid using "reserve price" auctions. These auctions are a form of shill bidding where the bidders are bidding against the seller himself. A reserve auction makes some buyers angry because they have no idea what the seller wants. Instead, set the opening bid at the lowest amount of money you would be willing to sell the item for. <br>  <br>  -Help keep the feedback system honest by only placing honest feedback and avoiding the "trading" of positive feedback. A seller should leave positive feedback if the buyer pays promptly. A buyer should leave positive feedback if the item arrives in a reasonable time and is as advertised. A seller who waits for a buyer to leave positive feedback is really trading feedback. Such a practice skews feedback ratings.  Also, realize that a seller cannot leave a negative feedback for buyers any more.  So, ensuring that your description in your listing is honest and you ship on time, will help you maintain a positive feedback rating and keep your 30 day DSR stars in good standing.<br>  <br>  -People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, so include the shipping price in the total price (or min bid) and people will be more inclined to buy. If you offer it, make sure they know that you're offering it. <br>  <br>  -Packaging is also important. If items are fragile, improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers! Also keep in mind the price you pay for shipping: the box, padding, etc., to decide on a reasonable price or add it to shipping and handling fees.   Also, consider the possiblilties that can happen to your package.  Rain, sleet or snow.  Will the item that you are sending get wet in the packaging that you are using?  If so, wrap the entire item in plastic to prevent this from happening.<br>  <br>  -Payment will be vital. PayPal is the only form of payment available on ebay, and as a seller, you will want to understand how it works and sign up.  A seller cannot advertise these payment options:  checks, money orders and cash.  If you advertise that you accept these thype of payments, ebay can and will shut down your listing.  Now, if a buyer writes to you and offers a money order or check, you may want to consider accepting, since you will save 2.9% plus .30 cents per transaction.  <br>  <br>  **Warnings**<br>  <br>  -Do not sell illegal items. Doing so can bring heavy consequences upon you. <br>  <br>  -Negative feedback can lead to buyers cautious of you and makes sellers think twice about selling to you. Follow up any negative feedback with accurate facts. Do not call names. <br>  <br>  -Be careful when sending feedback. You can be sued for making dishonest statements on the feedback page, so keep in mind that you are responsible for your remarks. Keep it honest and professional, and above all, don't make childish and angry remarks. <br>  <br>  -Don't overcharge for shipping and handling. A reasonable amount for your materials and effort is okay, but buyers don't want to pay $15.00 for shipping and handling and then see on the postage label that it only cost you $3.85 for shipping. <br>  <br>  -NEVER put the starting price lower than what you can afford to lose by selling it! You need to consider the fees eBay, Paypal (if you offer a PayPal payment) and shipping. It is entirely possible to lose money on an item if you put a starting price that is too low for you to at least break even if only one person bids on it. <br>  <br>  -Be careful of selling overseas. Most items are perfectly fine, and can increase your bidding pool. However, what may be perfectly legal in the US may be illegal in New Zealand, Turkey, or Japan (or vice versa). <br>  <br>  -If an item is worth a large amount, you may want to take into consideration using a reserve price. This can prevent financial loss. This may, however discourage buyers on bidding or purchasing your product.  I do not recommend to ever use reserve price, because why keep your buyers guessing at the minimu price of the item.  What I highly recommend is starting bid or purchase price at a minimum of what you want for the item.<br>  <br>  -Do not ever make the following statement on your listing:  "I will not be held responsible for any item that does not have insurance, after I have shipped the item."   The plain fact is that you (the seller) are responsible for the item that you sell to get to your buyer in the condition advertised, regardless weather the item has insurance or not.  If your item sells for a fairly high price, you may want to pay for the insurance yourself.  But, always advertise on your listings that insurance is available to your buyer.  Sometimes, they may purchase the insurance for you.<br>  <br>  Hope you'll find the instructions above useful and have fun selling on eBay|`|MoUtk7cUaa	i've had the best luck on ebay, even when selling an item that others are selling, by giving more information and being more helpful in answering questions on my item.  in this day & age of instant gratification, most people not only want a good deal, they don't want to have to research what they want.  i include links to the manufacturer websites, pictures that are clear and have plenty of views and specifics on the performance or specific features that make my item a good product, even if it's used, how long i've used it and the success i've had with it. a competitive price and fair s&h also make an attractive item better than a competitor's listing. good luck.<br>  <br>  ps. be careful on craigslist, there's plenty of an old scam going on there in which a person sends money for your item, then emails you claiming 'there's beedn an accidental overpayment, could you deposit the check and wire the ballance back'. take these to the police w/o even opening them to perserve any eveidence they might contain.|`|BkLGpZmdaa	Ebay is a great place to sell items.

Gun3UGzaaa	Contact the housing authority in Miami to find out what the regulations are regarding minimum heat.  Also check your lease to see if it is spelled out there.  If either one says you are supposed to have heat, then send your landlord a certified letter advising him you will pay rent to an escrow account until heat is provided.  Don't just withhold rent.<br>  <br>  Or, you could get space heaters to warm up a bedroom for the kids and use an electric blanket for you and your wife.<br>  <br>  BTW - I used to live in Boston and would be deeply grateful for a 55 degree temp at night!|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	If you are withholding rent he can evict you. what you can do is take him to court, and pay your rent into an escrow account. He will not get it until the repair is done, and in the meantime you will be showing good faith.

fd8c319927a5f2a27cff6e99ea9ae84daa	I believe you're referring to leverage.  For mini accounts, they normally give you 200:1 leverage at FXCM.  <br>  <br>  What this means is that in order to control $200 in the market, all you need is $1.  Since mini-lots are $10,000, all you would need to control one mini-lot would be 10000/200 = $50.<br>  <br>  In your case, you opened one position with 3 mini-lots ($30k), and 3 more positions with one mini-lot each.  It looks like you had 6 mini-lots open at the same time.  This requires $50/lot * 6 = $300 in margin requirement.<br>  <br>  Conceivably, you could open positions totaling 50000*200 = $10 million in open positions with $50K in margin.

(Travel conditions, where the item is coming from, who is shipping the item, where you live, etc.)

5S9wqrAiaa	I have never been there. But Whitefish MT seems nice. I just met a girl from there, and starting researching it one time, and dream of living there, lol. I live in Louisville Ky, which is also a pretty big city, (not like cali, but still big, and a growing one too.) But its just takes forever to get anywhere, and it seems like people arn't as nice out here as they are in the country. For example, if you wave to a random stranger out in the country somewhere, like in Indiana, they will wave back. If you wave here, they would look at you wierd, and proabalaly ask if you wanna fight. lol. But I think Whitefish would be an awsome place. I'm an actor, so I can't say in one place too long, because I have to travel, but when I come ready to settle down, I think Whitefish MT could be nice. Let me know if this helps.

I used this service - creditreport.undonet.com|`|7QPv7ta7aa	You can negotiate a pay for delete settlement with the collector.  Send the collection agency a letter specifically saying that you are not acknowledging the debt but making an offer to expedite removal of the item from your credit file.  Offer a lump sum payment of 50% to 25% (depending on how old the debt is) in exchange for the collector removing the item from your credit report.<br>  <br>  Ask that an authorized agent of the collection agency sign and return a copy of your letter indicating acceptance of the offer.  When you get the signed copy, send them a money order.   Do not give the collector direct access to your bank account.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Health insurance does NOT cover all medical bills in full.<br>  <br>  If these bills should have been paid by the health insurance company, you might be able to get them to pay them now, even if you no longer have the insurance.<br>  <br>  If these bills are for copays, deductibles, or procedures not covered by insurance, then you were supposed to pay them, and should pay them now.<br>  <br>  In either case, they will not "disappear" from your credit report.  If you or the insurance company pays them, you are entitled to have your credit report indicate that they are "paid" rather than unpaid, but not to have them disappear.|`|kifwyOgKaa	Yes, these items will lower your credit score.  <br>  <br>  You can make the bills disappear by either:<br>  <br>  1) Paying them.<br>  2) Contacting the insurance provider you had at the time and finding out why they did not cover the bills.  If there was a mistake via the doctor's office as to why your insurance did not pay the bills, your insurance company might go back and repay the bills once resubmitted by your doctor with the correct insurance information.  Then you can dispute the items on your credit and have them removed.<br>  <br>  Some insurance plans do not cover all medical bills though, in which case, you would be liable for the bills.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	There is no magic formula to make your debts go away. If the bills were accrued while you still had insurance, contact the insurance company and find out what was paid, what wasn't, and why. It may take some time and trouble on your part to get this taken care of. Ask them to send a copy of the billing statement or go and meet with them face to face. Once you figure what they owe and what you owe, get it in writing. Then pay off what you owe. Once this is done, get a letter of discharge from the insurance company. Send copies of them to the credit reporting agencies and ask them to remove this debt from your report. They will probably be difficult, but hey, you can ask. If they don't remove it right away, you will have to live with it for awhile. At least your debt is gone.|`|HbnqO7Mtaa	making use of the SE such as google or yahoo to generate some ideas first if you would like to get the massive information,nonetheless if you would not  want to put so much time,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is a direct and useful resource for your questions.|`|5328e2d0d0f963d2ddb641db33165d74aa	the only way you can make them disappear it to pay them. i also have to add in that being over 25 is not a good enough reason not to have health insurance.

90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	oh poor you. you had to sit through all 265 questions, i would have pulled my hair out. heres the good news, the number of questions dont determine if you fail or not. i had classmates that had 265 question and was in tears and depressed thinking they failed only to find out they passed. and i heard of people that got the minimum of 75 questions and failed. <br>  <br>  heres how the system was explained to me, the computer will keep on giving you questions when you get to 75, if youve made the minimum requirements to be licensed in your state then the questions stop. if you keep on getting the same questions again and again then youre not doing so good in that particular area. for example my friend kept on getting all these drug question and he did suck at drugs. my other friend kepy on getting maternity questions so she firgured she wasnt doing so good in that area. <br>  <br>  so anyway for you to get 265 you were probably going up and down or down and up. meaning you almost made the minimum requirement then you dropped below, then you made it again then you dropped below, and so forth. and then i was told if you get 75 and fail you were probably really failing to the point it wasnt worth giving anymore questions because there would be no way to pull yourself up past the passing mark. <br>  <br>  so how true is this, i dont know, but thats what i was told. i know its easier said than done, but try to relax, know that people have gotten 265 questions and have passed and most importantly, THINK POSITIVE.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	It could go either way. . . how do you think you did on the very last question it asked you? From what I have heard, if it continued asking to the full 265 then the last question would end up determining your fate - otherwise it would have shut off before then, at 260 or even sooner, because there was no chance at recovery and getting enough correct answers.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!

And, you can still at least make minimum payments with a job flipping burgers or as a day laborer.<br>  <br>  Your options:<br>  Get out the Want Ads and find a job.  Anything will do for the near term.  The best place to be applying for a job from is when you already have a job - it tells a prospective boss that you're at least employable.<br>  <br>  Apply for Unemployment.  Hard on one's pride, I know, but the benefit is there so take the time and apply for it.  You were laid off so you should be eligible.<br>  <br>  DO NOT apply for bankruptcy!!!  Bankruptcy is forever.  Even though it doesn't show up on your regular credit history after seven years, if you are applying for a loan in the future it will ask "Have you ever filed for bankruptcy?" and you must answer "Yes" regardless of how long it's been.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing at the moment is: make a job of finding a job.  Get up every morning and go through your routine.  Get up at your usual time, have breakfast, get dressed, get out there and talk to people.  Keep it up until you have paying work.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|AA11173563	try getting another job asap so you can pay. If not then chapter 7 may be your only shot|`|dxeb0BfBaa	not a whole lot you are just f**ked|`|qjsXrMfHaa	There are other options before taking that huge step. One of the options that you should consider is Debt Settlement. With Debt Settlement you can cut your debt down from 50% to 75% sometimes even more. A Debt Settlement program will help you eliminate your debt within 2-3 years or sooner, depending on the funds available on a month to month basis. Your debt to income ratio will start improving as the accounts start to settle. Debt Settlement is designed to put money back in your pocket, so that you can take care of more important things while you're still eliminating debt. With a  Debt Settlement program, you will be represented by a federal and state arbitrator who will handle any type of collection activity that your creditors are looking to take, whether its a phone call, collection letter, etc.<br>  <br>  Think about it and do some research  before you file ch 7 bankruptcy. A bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years, making it difficult to acquire credit, buy a home or car, get life insurance, get a loan or sometimes get a job. <br>  <br>  Please let me know if you have any questions.|`|tmh42R6Caa	You'll need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney.  The laws are different in every state.  Here in VA, I would imagine you'd be eligible.  It's a legnthy process and will probably cost you about $1500.  If you have the money to do it, it's worth looking in to.  Good luck!

It shows you are more trustworthy.<br>  <br>  But its also a bad thing, because now you know you can spend more.  And might accidentally charge up a $1000, and be in debt.<br>  <br>  If I were you...  pretend the limit is still $500.|`|sryHuuqdaa	perhaps it is due to the type of card that you have. you may have the type of card that increases your credit limit after a certain amount of timely payments.

It also depends on how long you have.  With Obama's new bank plan FITB (Fifth Third BancorP) could possibly go up 500% in the near future (last time I checked it was sitting at $2.01/share).  Of course, this won't take effect until April, so how long is your project running for?<br>  <br>  In the near term, I'd go for one of the financially sound shipping companies.  These are also high-risk, but have potential.  Many have fallen 90% - 95% in the the last 6 months, yet their BVPS is 5 - 6 times the share price.  Try to find one with a D/E value of less than 1, but more than 0.5 to optimize profits.  Of course there's no guarantee these stocks will explode either in the near term.<br>  <br>  FITB is my bet.  Too bad you didn't buy in three days ago when it was trading at $1.01/share or you would have already doubled your money.  Good luck.|`|L9Cx70gtaa	McDonald's.

But what's interesting to note is that they are actually pretty low, historically speaking.<br>  <br>  And, believe it or not, interest rates aren't what keeps most people from AFFORDING a home.  It's lack of down payment and the inability to pay for the principal.<br>  <br>  5.25% or 7%, if you can't afford a $500,000 house, you can't afford it.

f9f4407b08469472a7b821eb01936d16aa	There's one very big problem with this scheme.<br>  <br>  Once you affix advertising to your car, your car becomes a commercial vehicle (as far as your insurance company is concerned). And your insurance coverage is not written to cover commercial vehicles. So if you get into an accident, you're essentially not covered (again, as far as the insurance company is concerned). So the tiny amount of money you might make from this isn't worth the risk of driving around uninsured. <br>  <br>  Sorry, but if something sounds too good to be true, it always is.

You might consider a 4 unit apartment for a rental. <br>  <br>  A four unit in the United States is considered the same as a single family unit. Of course your mortgage loan would be as a non-owner occupied purchase, therefore the interest rate would be a little higher, but the interest in the United States is a tax write off.<br>  <br>  The market might drop further, but will it be worth the wait and would the prices start climbing again? <br>  <br>  You need to take advantage of the lower cost of properties as well as the lowest interest rates in years. This is what a smart person would do.<br>  <br>  There are several things to take into consideration when purchasing real estate so make sure you get as much advice as possible from friends, professional real estate people as well as your tax consultant before you make your decision, then go ahead and do it.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|mTwn8p79aa	No, you'll just be crossing your fingers that you've already hit the bottom of the housing market value.

There is a lot of work that goes into it.  If you arecomfortablee taking the chance and understand the risks, do your homework and take a chance. The business has great rewards and great tax breaks.  No all of the risks/rewards before getting into it though.  I think real estate is one of the best places to still put money and yes you will make it back over time.  Good luck and do your research before getting into anything.

This is a written agreement where you get a signed agreement from the debt collector (PRIOR to making any payment) where they offer to remove the negative items from your credit files after an agreed-to amount is paid. They will NOT want to do this....all they want is your money and their commission and they could not care less about your credit rating....Still, you have something they want (money) and that puts you in a position to negotiate on this issue. Example letter:<br>  <br>  I am willing to resolve this issue if your firm sends me a written agreement that you will remove all negative notations from my credit report after the agreed-to amount is paid to you. Upon receipt of this letter I will mail you a USPS money order for this amount. <br>  ---------------------------------- <br>  Again, they are not going to want to do this...if they simply refuse...then go for a "Paid/settled" in full notation....If they refuse to remove the item from your credit report, then be sure to get the lowest, rock bottom settlement you can get...like 25%....Remember, get all terms IN WRITING PRIOR to paying....not after. Any promises made by debt collectors over the phone that are not backed up in writing are worthless. Never give debt collectors your checking account numbers for payment.|`|5328e2d0d0f963d2ddb641db33165d74aa	yeah a lot of times if you have a certain amount to negotiate with, they will work with. you should also call them, don't wait for the to call you, it'll seem like you're ducking them. make sure that you get them to clear the debt off of your credit report, if you can get the agreement in writing that'll be good too.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	You can sometimes negotiate a lower amount with them.

Check the unemployment laws in the country/state/province you work in.  <br>  <br>  Were I you, I would consider taking the job and continuing to look for something else.

So many people are without jobs as it is and would love to have one. Keep the income coming in  but also keep your eyes open for other jobs as well. Unless your coming out of the Military, you can only collect unemployment for 6 months and you still have to look for a job too. and there is no garuntee that you will find one.

Either way id take the job but look for something better at the same time. Good Luck.|`|rF1fpyenaa	I think in this economy, your only choice is to take the position.  It is at least a job.  One of the biggest mistakes people have made since layoffs started last year is that they thought they could get a job in a few months and are still unemployed.  The competition is fierce and there are hundreds, even thousands competing for one job at a time.  You can always keep looking while you are working.  And think about this, your wife may work now, but what if she is laid off or her company folds?  Don't let what has and what is happening to so many Americans happen to you.  Think of your family and take the position.  Whatever you do, good luck.|`|wYLWBufWaa	if you leave you won't be able to collect unemployment as your employer will say they offerred you a job in your same position and you declined a part of collecting unemployment is that you are ready and willing to work with that being said I would take the job and continue to look for a new job good luck

AA11622701	Net income is defined as any income left after taxes (and other withholding) are taken out.  It is not possible to tax "net" income, because if it is still being taxed, it is not yet the "net".  All taxes are based on "gross" income.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Taxes are levied on taxable income.  For a business, the starting point is the net profit for the business.  You start with gross receipts, deduct Cost of Goods Sold and then all operating expenses to arrive at net profit.  <br>  <br>  This net profit then becomes "gross" income for calculating tax liability.  On a personal return the usual deductions for itemized deductions or the Standard Deduction come off plus any reductions for personal and dependency exemptions.  That results in taxable income and that is what Mr Obama was using as his point for the claim that anyone with less than $250k in income would not see a tax increase but a decrease.<br>  <br>  I know several small businesses that take in well over $1 million in gross receipts but have less than $100k in net profits.  They will NOT see any tax increase when the Bush tax cuts expire automatically in 2010.
9k4d7Kytaa	Calling the owner of the car is going to do you no good.  From the sounds of it, I can tell you with almost 100% certainty what happened.  The other guy put in a claim on his insurance policy to pay for the damage.  His insurance collected his deductible and paid for the remainder of the damage.  Now they are attempting to subrogate (collect what they paid and their client's deductible from the responsible party).  They assume your father has insurance, and that his insurance will reimburse them.  He didn't have insurance, so he is on the hook to pay for it out of pocket. <br>  <br>  Have him call the other guy's insurance company and explain the situation, they'll let him know what his options are.  Basically, you or he is going to have to pay the insurance company everything they paid to fix the car, get the guy a rental, and pay for the guys deductible.  If you don't pay, they may sue...they  may not.  They may report you to the police, they may not, but that is what has to be done.|`|AA11908567	It doesn't matter when the bloke makes a claim and don't ignore it.|`|IXtiKaOYaa	appearently the other cars insurance has tracked your father down by his registration.  they most likely paid for the damages and want reimbursement.  <br>  if you call the guy and ask how much, you will most likely pay more than what a insurance company will pay or has paid.  if the insurance company has paid, the other guy cant collect, since that would be a double payment and illegal.  <br>  and yes, you can possibly lose your license for driving an uninsured car and your dad also for no insurance.  <br>  if you choose to ignore, they will sue you for the damages.  <br>  the fact that it took 5 months, may mean they had trouble tracking both you and/or your father.  or, the other guy did not want to pay out of pocket their deductible to have it fixed and waited.|`|kifwyOgKaa	You should call him and offer to pay for the damages out of pocket.|`|92yiQo7uaa	It is your Dad's car and he is the one with insurance problems so he better get off his **** and settle this matter.

They must have paid out something for the damages to the other car. Do not pay the other owner back directly because they may have already been paid. Call the insurance company and let them know you did not have insurance. If the car you were driving had insurance and you are not an excluded driver then the car you were driving insurance will cover this loss. Call your dads insurance and see if there is coverage. If there is still no insurance then the other persons insurance company may work out a payment plan with you. If you do not communicate with them, they eventually send the debt to a collection agency and this may effect your dads credit. You will not loose your license. If you are in California and the other driver filed a SR1 form then you may have issues getting a renewal and be forced to purchase state insurance to keep you license. I'm not sure about other states. If you are in a state that does not expect to have proof of insurance when you get your license renewal then you are okay. Take care of the debt and communicate with the insurance company or it will come back to you and dad and bite you in the rear. Hope this help.

AA10777253	You almost answered your own question! You said you loved your job before the new CEO took over and changed how the work is to be done. Now you're stressed and miserable. Basically, the management style changed. Since you can't change management (it's like moving a mountain) that means you need to move on. Considering your whole department is being let go, you are naturally going ot be laid off too. <br>  <br>  I experienced much the same in my original occupation. I was a high tech engineer for 15 years and worked at many different companies. Management style makes a huge difference in job satisfaction. Some places were heaven, some hell, others in between. Yet, my work was almost always the same. In the high tech collapse, I finally gave up trying to get stably re-employed (too little work) and one other reason was that, what if I'm lucky and do land a job? It coujld be in a hellish workplace. It wasn't worth it. So I started my own self-employed business in another field. Now, I like my boss!!<br>  <br>  Might as well start looking now. You might consider self-employment. You sound like someone who would enjoy it. <br>  <br>  Best,<br>  -- Liam

It is your responsibility to find a way to get to work. Maybe you need to buy chains for your car, get up earlier and leave earlier so you can drive safely. Some employees at my company even stayed in a nearby hotel for a few nights during a recent snowstorm in our area because they live far away. <br>  <br>  Where you live is your choice, but the bottom line is that it is your responsibility to get yourself to work on time regardless of the conditions. If you can't do that, then they can fire you. Their business doesn't stop just because of the weather. <br>  <br>  If you only get paid $11/ hour 2  hours per week, then perhaps the job really isn't worth it, in which case you shouldn't be too concerned if they fire you. If the job is important to you, then you should make it a priority by moving closer to the job and having a back up plan so you can get there in bad weather.<br>  <br>  EDIT: if everyone else made it in just fine, then what does that say about you? Your the only person who couldn't make it through the snow? Perhaps you should be like everyone else and find a way to get to work.

063a744af86ce2475af0170781e5d2f5aa	Yes there are paid survey sites in the UK ,<br>  <br>  The best way to make money doing surveys is to sign up for MANY survey companies that pay.  That said, no one will get "rich" doing surveys, unless they are registered with almost every survey company out there.  I do surveys, and believe me, I can't earn a living on my surveys.  I can, however, make life a little more comfortable for myself.  <br>  <br>  The survey companies that pay (or offer compensation) are too numerous to list here.  I will provide a link below for you, so that you can sign up for different companies.  One IMPORTANT thing to remember is to NEVER EVER pay a company to get you the "insider's track" on survey companies.  The companies that OFFER these "services" are fraudulent.  They have you PAY for information that you could find on your own, if you just search the internet.<br>    <br>  Now,  for the link.  I could provide you with my own referral links, but I will not do so here, because I would just like to help you out.  One REALLY GREAT site that has a listing of survey companies (there are MANY and you have to weed through the ones that may or may not apply to you) is the gurus eye.   In the survey section, you will find a tremendous amount of survey sites.  Here you go: <a href="http://www.theguruseye.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguruseye.com</a>  This is the main link that I give to friends who want to get into surveys and such.

When you have sorted that out, you can use your card to withdraw money. Best of all though, halifax let u do online banking, which means that by going to their website you can put in your username, password and security number to access your account online. It shows you how much u have in your bank, when you have withdrawn money and how much. And for example, if you owe your mum money, you can transfer that money to your mums account - simply all over the internet.

But if they say they are eliminating the position he's in and the only other place they can put him is in a job he cannot do, then it is legal to terminate him.  Since he is in a union, he should definitely get them involved.  It's always possible they want to get rid of workers who make the most money in order to reduce costs, so they try to put them in jobs where they will not succeed.  This is a misstep on their part because they were aware of the issue with him working on the heaters.

That will get heads to roll.|`|UYaWH7a0aa	To be honest it really seems like your Dad should contact a lawyer. They shouldn't be able to discriminate against your Father because of a disability but where to go beyond that is really something a lawyer would be best to handle. Sorry..|`|Maoj7HYSaa	Is you dad in the union? If so, he needs to talk to his union rep. They exist to protect workers from situations just such as this.|`|us8isFmiaa	You indicated that your Dad spoke to a Union rep. So, if it is a Union shop, that means the Union and the Company have a contract, a written legal agreement that covers any number of issues that may exist between the Union and the Company and how they will be handled. <br>  <br>  His current situation is either spelled out in the contract, or it is not. Even if it is well documented, the company is free to interpret it one way and the Union another. In their own best interest, some companies do what they want, ignoring the contract, and it is up to the worker to file a grievance and then the Union to fight for the workers contractual rights, Some grievances can go on and on unsettled for a long time. Meanwhile, the *issue* stays in limbo while the company continues to break the agreement. Sometimes an outsider, known as an arbitrator, is finally called in to settle things. When this happens, both parties must agree to accept the arbitrator's decision. <br>  <br>  If your Dad's situation is not covered anywhere in the contract, the company falls back on its own procedures manual to cover the situation, essentially a carte blanche to handle things purely in their best interest, not necessarily the worker's.<br>  <br>  If your Dad feels that the company's actions are in violation of their agreement, he needs to be proactive by exercising whatever rights he has under that agreement. He can't sit back and assume the company will do the right thing. They may... or they may not. In matters of health, he and his Doctor need to provide whatever supporting documentation they require. As for the outcome, it is a lot like going into Court- there are no guarantees. He has my best wishes.
Pjm9pg7iaa	The signing of the lease was the key. Once you signed, it didn't matter if you paid the deposit or not. You became liable for the rent. You could try to buy your way out of the lease by releasing some money and walking away. No landlord wants to keep a tenant who doesn't want to live there..|`|O8qdCBzLaa	No. It's the lease document that you signed that binds you to the contract, not whether or not you made a down payment.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	even with No deposit the signed agreement is legal. It is called agreement of the minds. And with a bad check to boot.<br>  You could be sued for breach of contract. The check you had written if it has bounced that would be added to the suit.<br>  So instead of looking for the argument of how do i get out of the lease, You should be looking for the landlord to let you out  by reasons of not able to afford the lease at this time.|`|1JbdCRdtaa	If you signed a lease they can hold you liable for the amount even if your check bounced. If the landlord is nice and you two can come to an agreement they can maybe let you get away with only paying the deposit and one months rent! Good luck, once you've signed that lease you are bound :(|`|QgRvJVasaa	sorry but u signed the lease u can be held to it
