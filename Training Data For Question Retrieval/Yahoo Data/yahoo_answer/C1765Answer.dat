A1iDPPOeaa	NOT true:<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Beginning April 1, 2009, the tables that calculate the federal tax withholdings from your paycheck will be revised. For the next nine months of 2009, certain people will have less federal taxes withheld from their paychecks, and take more money home.<br>  Step2<br>  The stimulus bill states that the maximum tax credit for a single person is $400, and the maximum tax credit for joint return filers is $800.<br>  Step3<br>  To receive the stimulus bill tax credit you must be employed or self-employed, and paying into Social Security. For this reason, the tax credit is known as a “making work pay” credit.<br>  Step4<br>  To calculate the amount of tax credit that you will receive you must look at your annual gross income. The amount of the tax credit that you will be eligible for decreases when your taxable income exceeds $75,000 as a single filer, and $150,000 as joint filers.<br>  Step5<br>  The stimulus bill tax credit is not available to single filers who make over $95,000, and joint filers who have a taxable income over $190,000.<br>  Step6<br>  If you are eligible for the maximum amount of the stimulus bill tax credit, and your employer begins using the revised tax tables starting April 1, you can calculate that you will bring home an additional $44 each month as a single filer, and $89 as joint filers.<br>  Step7<br>  If you have two jobs, and you qualify for the stimulus bill tax credit, you will receive the tax credit at each of your jobs, and receive twice as much back as you are supposed to. You will then have to pay back the extra money you received when you file your taxes for 2009 and calculate the amount of the tax credit you were actually eligible to receive. You may be able to adjust your federal tax withholdings with one of your employers if you want to prevent this from happening.|`|ARaOShgzaa	If this is true I want to set it up and just pay the taxes monthly. Instead of paying it at tax season. I wouldn't surprised. You probably should never trust high power people with alot of money. For that matter you should also never trust people that are desperate for money, or criminals. I have no personal experience of this but society for some reason has taught me this.

Why don't you look around and you'll see that the whole WORLD is in a recession? The recession has been destined to happen, and it will no doubt happen again in 25 more years or so. There have been many recessions in history, and everyone seemed to come out of it ok. Capitalism will pick itself back up again. I blame the banks, giving out loans that were never paid back, and the car companies, blowing all their money RECKLESSLY on nice vacations and lavish parties, and then asking the government and taxpayers for more, and then they could go spend it on more vacations and luxuries while people like you and me work our asses off for their vacations. There's where the blame lies, on the big businesses that like to live large and I'd like to see what you would do in the president's position. It is a tough choice, and there are limited options available.

Whatever her background, she is a product of a media that glorifies people who use their children as meal tickets.　　By the way, she was born and raised in the US which makes her American.  Her children are therefore American.  But really, does it matter?<br>  <br>  I really feel sorry for the kids, especially those born with physical or psychological problems.

xdUjRxKzaa	It is neither a deterrent nor is it justice for the people he killed irrespective of their ages - they were all entitled to a life on this earth. Unfortunately what he got was our stupid and totally misguided British Justice which today is enmeshed in PC rubbish. No matter what sentence the court handed out to him it would never, ever bring that beautiful family back to life nor atone for what he did so even i have to think about what is a fitting punishment for someone like him? The answer is - i don't know, i really don't know, beat him , whip him 'till his flesh falls off? What difference will it make? Lock him up for 10 years - what will that change? NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING. What we have to do is ring our MP's and tell them we want a total change in the law that would see any further abuses of our law on phoning , texting or using a computer at the wheel of a moving vehicle subject to say 30 years in prison. How many people would dare offend? We leave far too many avenues open for abuse of the law in our land, lets make it stronger.|`|Y4OatVl3aa	I know there'll be loads of thumbs down for thsi answer, but as far as I'm concerned it was an accident. There was no proof presented that the driver was using his laptop at the point of the crash at all. It's suggested he was using it prior to the crash but it's not proven at all. Lord Ahmed was jailed for dangerous driving because he was using his mobile phone to send text message before he had a crash - but that was before he crashed, not at the point of the crash. You can't penalise someone for what they were doing a few minutes _before_ an incident.|`|cKtyAmATaa	well he should never, ever be allowed to drive any vehicle of any kind for the rest of his life, he was careless and cavalier with a very dangerous lorry in the wrong hands. That may at least go some way, to deter others from such stupid behaviour. I almost had a head on crash with a van when the driver came around a bend, with a map full way across his windscreen, would have killed my family for sure if I had not swerved, irresponsible drivers.|`|AA11049477	Is he the killer lorry driver who MAY have been on using a lap-top computer at the time of the crash?<br>  If it was, 18 months is an insult to their family & a pitiful excuse for punishment.|`|bra1TFTDaa	3 months per person not 3 years. <br>  <br>  Disgusting.

The sad fact is, that Roads, and Cars/Lorries are more dangerous than People care to admit. And in this case, the sentence is not supposed to be a deterrent, as there was no decision by the Defendant to "go out and kill some folks".<br>  And even if he was only locked up for,say six months, the likelihood of him going straight out, upon release, and doing the same thing again, just because his sentence was short, is risible. He has to live with the fact, that his lack of care, caused the Deaths of Six people, and no amount of Prison time, is going to make this any easier for Him.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	I posted a similar question.<br>  There's no justice in this country. He should have got 15 years and charged with dangerous driving.Its so awfully sad that those innocent children died,especially the newborn baby.Lives snatched away fbecause of the poor driving of another who will soon be able to carry on living his life of freedom without a second thought for anyone but himself.|`|TBPzDU2vaa	Very tragic case .. mind boggling to have lost a family of six, in such a horrific cash, I too would never forgive, had they been my relatives.

It's a bloody disgrace.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	Well, the loved ones of his victims now have a life sentence.  I admire them for being so honest as to say that they can never forgive him as well.  To error is human, but to forgive....well, that is divine.|`|EEpBrsSnaa	No sentence will ever bring them back, but 18 months is ridiculous.<br>  it's no wonder the family  feel they dont have justice.|`|ZVDboZkPaa	I suspect that it is down to the police treating it as Dangerous Driving as opposed to Manslaughter.<br>  <br>  Driving offences carry shorter sentences in the United Kingdom and a judge has to obey the sentencing rules as laid down by the Director of Public Prosecutions also known as the Home Secretary.<br>  <br>  Unless there is proof that the lorry driver was driving irresponsibly for a long time before the accident it is unlikely that any driver would be charged under Manslaughter.<br>  <br>  In the main driving offences, even killing people, as a result of an accident are treated as simply that the driver made a mistake.<br>  <br>  Please remember that no matter how emotive the background to a court case, it is the judge's job to pass a sentence that obeys the rules laid down for sentencing and on that particular crime.<br>  <br>  A judge is not empowered to change the charge that is brought by the police, all that he can do is to pass the case onto a higher court if he has sufficient reason to do so.<br>  <br>  Also justice is not about revenge and it is not about making people feel better; it is about applying a fair and equitable punishment in the light of similar cases and similar circumstances.

In5yNXpsaa	The world waits for that answer, and I think most of us can agree an independent investigation is not optional if we want to have any faith in our government in the future..|`|8tcaTrIvaa	Beside conspiravcy, many scientific proof have proved that collapse were structural issues and it was natural.<br>  <br>  How was iron be refined to steel ? it was by fire.|`|Yjn1T4mNaa	I agree, buildings cannot just pancake on top of each other and go down, that is ridiculous. It looks like it was rigged with explosives. There's a video out there showing that right before the plane hit, there was a little explosion, like an explosive going off. Fire cannot destroy steel, but explosions/planes can make it weak until it falls.
HiS1zhXUaa	actually casey didnt even have a job for someone to watch her daughter she lied about working......remember when she took the cops to mgm and said she worked there and then said oh i dont work here anymore.....|`|4eLzY2hfaa	if you want ad nauseam coverage of this case watch greta van sustren on fox news.|`|0Y0XuneKaa	traces of chloroform, an anesthetic, were found in the trunk.  my guess is that casey chloroformed her daughter and left her in the trunk during the day, and one day she applied too much chloroform and the little girl asphyxiated.  <br>  <br>  oh, and nancy grace is disgusting.
AA11199260	The question is very elaborated inasmuch as this deals with the illegal immigrants in the country. If we think from the fundamental side of the case, it will be revealed that these people entered the country without due permission and as such they are to be deported as early as possible. This is one side to of the picture. <br>  <br>  On the other hand these immigrants are contributing to the national income of the country and they are also tax payers.They should be treat ed at par with other  nationals. However, it will be appropriate to accept them as national of the country rather than to deport them to the native country. They should be allowed to do the work, whatever they like to do, depending upon their proficiency and capability. I have seen doctors who are employed in US and they have been proved as a very good workers and dedicated to their professions. Similarly I also feel that these immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country and live their freely, without any checks and they should be told in plain terms that if they don't work in the interest of the country they would be deported to their native countries.|`|adznfYe3aa	I think you will find that many of the illegals who sneak in from France are here for the benefits and are not here to work. They claim asylum having travelled all across Europe to get here because they have little chance of being deported from here.<br>  <br>  As for giving an amnesty to illegals will they have to do the same again in five years or ten years because illegals will continue to target soft countries like the UK?|`|uKrdjrJiaa	I wont abuse you-I think you are right!At the end of the day the UK has enough unemployed all of its own without supporting other countries unemployed as well.It amazes me that Britain is such a soft touch that anyone(criminals,rapists etc) can get admission to this country.It doesnt happen anywhere else!|`|kiyto74Kaa	most important here is word illegal<br>  if you will do something illegal you need to be punished<br>  punishment for that is deportation<br>  only exception is when illegal imigrant would have any problems after goin back to his country, then he can get asylum|`|E9eQCm3Laa	Your thinking is what the plantation owners used to say. Well, whites won't stoop so low to pick my cotton.(work my fields,clean my table)It is still the same reasoning.<br>  Trying to make right what the law of the land says is illegal.|`|0aebbff58b269b16c27e116296297d9baa	this country is sinking fast with freeloaders wasters people who claim for minor things , basically the uk is knackered.|`|8ovTppsAaa	It costs a lot more than ￡11,000 and 34 years to keep them and their many offspring.<br>  <br>  Furthermore,amnesties send out the wrong signals to potential immigrants.<br>  <br>  There isn't enough work for british people.The infrastructure can't support any more people.Most of these people hate our country and everything it stands for.<br>  <br>  I think all immigrants should be deported whether they are legal or not.The only difference between legal and illegal is how the corrupt labour government chose to massage the figures that particular week.<br>  <br>  The argument about British workshy and foreigners doing jobs that we wont is simply idiotic propaganda thrown into the arena by the lefties to confuse the masses and direct their anger towards fellow British.<br>  The British have managed adequately for a thousand years,incidently masters of the wordls largest ever empire during that time.<br>  I don't see how stabbings,rapes,poverty,bombings,freeloa... queues,fraud,ghettos,drug dealing,prostitution,honour killings,forced marriages,gun crime and rioting is enrichign our culture or propping up our economy.<br>  the argument about British unemployed assumes that all foreigners are hard working and gainfully employed.<br>  The truth is that most of the unemployed figures are actually foreigners.Being in a minority  and given unfair advantages in the job market further reinforces the truth that one is more likely to be claiming dole if that person is a foreigner.<br>  <br>  Finally,any social problems of our country are our business.<br>  Would anyone here swap their unemployed child for someone elses because they had a job?|`|s8nPN7pVaa	NEVER!<br>  <br>  Why encourage illegal immigration?<br>  <br>  The next thing you know is that half the world will be queueing up at Calais or booking flights to the UK for the purpose of 'visiting friends'.<br>  <br>  Who the bloody hell thought this little gem up?<br>  <br>  Edit.<br>  Boris, well that say's it all doesn't it, ***kin idiot, he comes from an illegal immigrant family doesn't he?<br>  <br>  Edit.<br>  Just a note ..... most illegal immigrants in the UK are thought to be of other ethic backgrounds than Black.<br>  <br>  Also, giving amnesty would allow them access to the benefits system.|`|9iEhlRgUaa	What's the problem with illigal immigrants paying tax? They do al the jobs other people think they are too good for. It's our own fault they thrive so much.|`|eO1o511daa	They don't need to spend that sort of money. Just offer a reward for naming them. Let's do some illegal trafficking back across the tunnel.|`|0gNlwcaVaa	We should deport them all. We should use whatever it takes to remove them all  <br>  <br>  We should put this question to a REFERENDUM .We should be prepared to take whatever minor temporary economic  problems this would cause  until real British take over their jobs.<br>  <br>  <br>  NO "amnesty" for people who all KNEW they were breaking UK law,  so no rewards for criminals.Also how about asking the countries they came from to pay the  UK tax owing from their illegal activity in the UK?<br>  <br>  Another idea would be a reward for information leading to a deportation of an illegal immigrant, neighbours  could know. Also hospitals banks and probably the pro immigration BBC will also know of the status of their employees. It should be a criminal offence not to report an illegal immigrant as it is not to report any crime.|`|bwygouP8aa	I can't believe the various answers here. <br>  <br>  Illegal is illegal, and should be punished. Ownership of one's actions.<br>  Allowing this to go on promotes other to do the same thing, Why go through the legal process and pay money when you can get around the process?<br>  <br>  What makes people think that illegals are paying taxes? Hello, you are illegal!  To servive illegals need to live in a cash only life. No records.<br>  <br>  AND - what about those hiring illegals? Government can't find them? <br>  <br>  Lets face it, the laws are inforced by threats, <br>  "you better not do that", <br>  This time I mean it you better not do that, "<br>  You better not do that again" I<br>  <br>  ts a joke <br>  <br>  Oh, the government is NOT 'pondering' an amnesty on illegal immigrants. Sorry guys|`|9xgGd9praa	I think we should boot the all out and keep Britain british, whether they have NI numbers or pay tax, it's not their bloody country.<br>  I think this country is getting ridiculously stupid, letting all these people in that do absolutely jack for us.<br>  <br>  I'm not abusing you btw, just this country's idiocy.|`|rHSh8DDAaa	How would you define workshy, and if they are born in the in their country of origin, they cannot be deported anywhere. As far as illegal immigrants are concerned, illegal means just that..ILLEGAL.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	Its a good idea, but I feel that at the mere mention of being deported there will be a sudden influx of the long term work-shy unemployed Brits working at waiting tables and sweeping the streets...then what would all the immigrants do for employment?.......|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Ha ha I like your thoughts!
dDrhBnpxaa	Well I know you are only after her money, MJ.<br>  <br>  I think you should email her back, saying you are so happy to have found your future soul-mate that you have sold your family to a double-glazing salesman for some Snack-a-Jacks, so that you can dedicate at least 44 hours a day to help her obtain her ￡12.7million, and that you will gladly marry her, but only in a bizarre ceremony involving an Elvis impersonator and an electric chair.<br>  <br>  True love is so beautiful. I'm filling up here.....|`|s8nPN7pVaa	Well reply to 'her' email asking for full & complete details of the 'proposal', once you receive a reply, email again saying that you do not quite understand what 'she' is saying..... ad infinitum.<br>  <br>  BTW. a lesbian partnership by contract is recognised in this country.|`|va8quhPtaa	I do not enjoy wasting peoples time.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	As Michael says, drag it on. If the standard of English is as poor on your email as the ones I've received, querying certain words and phrases should take up at least 8 emails to start with!<br>  <br>  One of my Mates has a good way of getting rid of those annoying "0800"  telephone calls. He answers the phone, and if they ask for him, he asks "who's calling?", then passes the receiver to his Wife. She informs the caller that she is his widow, as he died 30 minutes ago, and the person who answered the phone was the Undertaker! One less firm to bother you.|`|Wmn5Bh1Zaa	This is a complete scam.  This scam is very dangerous and very VERY common, in fact, people have been killed over this scam.  Stay away from emails like this, give them no thought.
AA10560132	I totally agree with you!|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Its nowhere near as good as the first one and I agree it should be on later.
