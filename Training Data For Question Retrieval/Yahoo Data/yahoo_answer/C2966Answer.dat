f9cea979889f6003f11944e23024c9e4aa	There are kits for converting cars in general. I googled 'corolla electric conversion' and got quite a few hits. You might also rummage through the EV album (listed below). There's a search bar at the top which will cough up pages like:<br>  <a href="http://www.evalbum.com/type/TOYO" rel="nofollow">http://www.evalbum.com/type/TOYO</a><br>  One very reputable kit dealer I've used is at<br>  <a href="http://www.kta-ev.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kta-ev.com/</a><br>  Phone Wistar and tell him what you're thinking.<br>  <br>  Beware though that converting a car will tend to give you a range of around 40 miles (maybe that's ok!?). Sharpen your math pencil...<br>  <br>  A 'normal' car carries about 12 gallons of gas or 433 kWh (kilowatt-hours) of energy. $2000 of deep cycle lead acid batteries will load up the car but only give you less than 30 kWh of energy.  The efficiency of a gas engine is only about 35%. The efficiency of an electric motor is 90% but _lead_acid_ batteries have their own efficiency problem called the Peukert Effiect. In my EV, it's about 66%. The net efficiency of the EV will be about 60%. That means it's like you only have 18 kWh of energy, compared to the 433 kWh x .35 = 151 kWh for the original car. 18kWh/151kWh x normalCarRangeOf350miles = 40 miles.<br>  <br>  There are other types of batteries 'out there'. Perhaps you can find some NiMH.<br>  <br>  And the 1st guy was right: you can't use the automatic.<br>  <br>  The Brant book is great on theory, why's and wherefore's.<br>  The M. Brown book is more nuts and bolts.<br>  <br>  I've read that it takes a couple of long weekends to do the conversion. That seems optimistic to me; it takes me a couple weekends to clean the garage...|`|0d78403582fb776161f7bfecfda2df86aa	It wont be easy at all to do this you will need great amounts of money and time and I also think you cant do it on Automatic.

This is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, like methane and carbondioxide. <br>  <br>  Unlike many people will assert, there is a consensus among scientists that the current increase in temperature is caused by humans. This is supported by analyzing our emissions, testing the effect of these emissions and modeling natural climate changes. Trying to explain the rapid increase in temperature during the last decades using a natural cause is impossible. There is no weather model capable of predicting it and there is no cause to be found other than humans. <br>  <br>  The greenhouse gases emitted from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil etc) and from other sources (lifestock/vulcanic eruptions etc) increase the temperature by allowing radiation from the sun to reach the surface but absorbing the radiation emitted by the surface. Therefore it acts as a blanket.|`|qO2l2QH6aa	yes it is happening as we hear a lot of glaciers melting causing floods in many parts of the world.<br>  Recently a hole has been discovered in earth's ozone layer which is not a minor issue.

5c33a755ef9b542e1bec57c8a02ea6f4aa	First congratulations on your research and thereby forming your conclusion.  Some people even beyond seemingly irrefutable evidence will deny that global warming is occurring.  The only debate is to how much of the global warming is our responsibility. <br>  <br>  For some additional essay evaluation I might also refer you to my response and some others on a similar question.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309150628AAoHPr2&r=w#QZctWWO7VDVRhx5FE8OEAWQdJhzoNmuX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  The references I included in that answer is only a small source, yet it might give you insight for even further research.  I found the JOE report to be very interesting even though it is written as reference for the Department of Defense.  It includes many forecasts for water and fuel.<br>  <br>  Although Omega3 does bring out some interesting data, it's unlikely due to his presentation that it will be heard.  It is best when writing an essay or giving a presentation to preclude debate by using only data without too much conjecture.  If the idea of an essay is to communicate an idea, it is best to come from a common point of reference.  <br>  <br>  I don't know the content of your essay, but as an introduction you might use this;<br>  <br>  Global warming is a highly debated and controversial subject in todays politics, news, and ethics.  It seems fitting that in our political world where nearly everything seems equally split down the middle; that in environmental concerns, there would be no difference.  The following is my conclusion based on my study of the evidence that I have gathered from sources that I believe to be unbiased.<br>  <br>  ***LOL John D talking about illiteracy??? LOL Read and examine his statements.  His history  needs a brush up too. LOL- geez, I can't stop laughing...

During the next decade with rising world temperatures  we could experience :-  increased frequency and intensity of storms, hurricanes, floods and droughts, increased frequency of forest fires, melting glaciers and polar ice , rising sea levels,  hundreds of millions of environmental refugees, the climate change will threaten our health , malaria , asthma, encephalitis, tuberculosis, leprosy and measles are all expected to become more common  <br>   For years scientists and researchers have been warning us of  world wide disasters due to global warming , it may not effect this generation but you have been warned  these  things could happen , and may have already started. Climate models show that atmospheric temperatures will increase by between 1.5C and 4.5C by the year 2100 if a "wait and see and do nothing" approach is adopted .<br>    Because of thermal expansion of the water and melting of continental glaciers sea levels would rise, possibly as much as 0.6 meters (two feet), by the end of the next century , resulting in the permanent flooding of vast areas of heavily populated lands , the additional fresh water dumped into the Atlantic could switch off the Gulf stream making Ireland as cold as Spitsbergen a city well within the arctic circle.<br>    At the 160-nation climate summit held in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, industrialised countries agreed to cut emissions of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane( CH4), and Nitrous oxide , the main problem gasses  to  below 1990 levels within 10 to 14 years. They are still arguing over how to make the cuts , governments and indeed their voters have not really bothered to do much about global warming and to a large extent its  a “ wait and see and do nothing “ policy. <br>     <br>  Who are the big polluters ?<br>   We all contribute to the vast amounts of CO2 gas mainly from burning fossil fuels our unhindered use energy contributes to the ever increasing emissions .<br>   Huge amounts of Methane are produced from Coal mining , China, the former Soviet Union and the United States combined produces two-thirds of the world's methane emissions from coal, this not from burning coal, but mining it . Domestic animals kept for food , currently account for about 15 percent of the annual methane emissions.<br>    <br>  Methane versus Carbon Dioxide<br>   Global Carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and domestic uses are estimated at  7 billion tons this is added to the 750 billion tons already in the atmosphere  , 4 billion tons of this will be absorbed by plants , marine life , and the oceans , each year the CO2 in the atmosphere increases by 3 billion tons . Thankfully the oceans seem to have a limitless capability to absorb and hold CO2 . Carbon Dioxide held in the oceans is estimated at 35 Trillion tons . <br>  <br>  Methane :- It has been estimated the total annual global production is somewhere between 400 to 600 million tons , this is equivalent to 36 Billion tons of CO2 , domestic animals mainly cattle , sheep , camels and goats , contribute approximately 65 to 85 million tons . Methane is also produced from land-fill sites , but these take some years to produce large quantities of the gas. As a  greenhouse gas methane is 20 to 60 times more potent than carbon dioxide, it remains in the atmosphere for about 15 years then breaks down into Carbon dioxide ! Methane is not absorbed by the oceans .<br>   <br>   Since the early to mid-1800's, the amount of Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by about 25 per cent whereas Methane concentrations have risen by about 150 per cent. Methane is currently the second largest contributor to global warming , ( Carbon Dioxide being number one ) but levels of Methane are rising at a rate of 1% per year , which is faster than the rate CO2 increases.<br>  <br>  Governments concentrate on CO2 reductions mainly by bigger and bigger fuel taxes , but many believe that Methane emissions would  be the better target all be it harder for the public to swallow .<br>   So the question really is, could we globally, stop using ruminant domestic animals for food , shut down all the coal mining and land-fill operations , thus saving the equivalent of 12 years Carbon dioxide pollution , it  would go a long way to controlling  the greenhouse effect or shall we wait and see and do nothing .
mMFJrPbvaa	Because those are the words associated with the bright object in the sky. When it is bright out we could have called it night if we wanted to, right?  I mean the words and their meanings were created by man.  Just like we could have easily called when the moon came out and when its dark out-Day. <br>  <br>  But darkness doesnt really exist, its just a way of saying there is very little ambient light. Theres less and less light, so at a point people call it dark instead of saying gee theres extremely low amounts of light.  Sorta like hot and cold.  Cold doesnt really exist either...theres always some heat, absolute 0 has never been reached.  Cold is actually a measure of heat or how hot something is....get it?<br>  <br>  Benji:<br>    You were ok upto your last statement, which is that the moon does not rotate.  It does rotate, all celestial bodies rotate.  However, the moon is geocentric.  Meaning you always see the same "face" from that geological location.

NC5GCk5Yaa	Don't listen to the two dumb ppl above me.  There are always trade offs to everything in life.  Economics teaches us that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Meaning we live in a world where there are limited resources, from anything from time to space.  <br>  <br>  So are the down falls?  Here are some,  <br>  <br>  If you use alternative fuels, farmers grow more, they plant fields there were previously used as natural habitats.  The use of alternative fuels also makes it more lucrative for farmers to grow crops that are used in alternative fuels rather than food.  Thus driving up the price food.  <br>  <br>  As farmers make more money they cut down more forests, plow up more fields, and drain swamps.  Look at the rain forests are cut down to plant sugar cane.  <br>  <br>  Just think that for every action there is always gonna be a counter action.  <br>  <br>  If you build a coal powered plant, you will pollute the atmosphere.  If you build a nuclear one, you will emit radio active particles.  A hydro (water) powered dam you will change river flows and effect fish runs.<br>  <br>  The hope is that you do the minimum amount of damage.

Apart from the easy availability, solar energy helps control environmental pollution. Most of us shy away from installing solar power solutions at home thinking them to be expensive and cumbersome. You will, however, be surprised to know how easy it is to employ these power solutions. Moreover, these will help cut down your power bills. Finally, you will be delighted to know tat you are doing your bit to save power for the future generations.<br>  <br>  This article will explore the various solar power options available for home use. <br>  <br>  Solar cooker: A solar cooker is a cooking utensil that uses absolutely no fuel for cooking. You can cook food for up to five people in the small box. If you are thinking that using a solar cooker will reduce your chances of spreading up a varied platter on the dining table, you will be surprised to know that you can not only boil food items in the cooker but also roast and bake! The only limitation with the solar cooker is the time it takes to cook. However, given the free source of energy it uses, this is a great option for cutting down those sky-rocketing bills and saving some power.<br>  <br>  Solar home lighting: A solar home lighting system converts solar energy into electrical energy for your home. This is done via cells that are charged with solar energy. So, in the night, if you wonder how the lights are on in the house, it is because of the solar energy stored in the solar cells. You can install the solar home lighting system in your house and not worry about the electricity bills anymore. <br>  <br>  Solar heating system: Installing a solar heating system in your home helps cutting down your electricity bill along with saving the world’s quickly-exhausting power. If you are worried that a solar heating system will turn your sweet home into a gadget house or that it will be an expensive investment, your concerns are misplaced. Companies providing solar power solutions for homes make it a point to install aesthetically-pleasing heating systems in your house. As per as expenditure is concerned, investing in a solar heating system is wise because you get a return on your investment within 3-4 years, giving you absolutely free service after that.<br>  <br>  There's a bit of info for solar energy for more info on wind energy check out the source box.<br>  There's great tips for home improvments!<br>  I hope this helps!|`|6074ba9150b4dd8433de8921a00a080eaa	Not really any big problems.

Some energy used in its production.<br>  <br>  Pine wood can also be sustainable if from managed, 'farmed' forests where new trees are plant to replace ones harvest in a continuous cycle. Pine trees are soft wood that is fast growing.<br>  <br>  Acrylic does come from oil or gas originally but can be 100% recycled. An acrylic sheet can be depolymerised back into the starting monomer and used to make a new acrylic sheet. It's possible to make an acrylic sheet of good quality made from 100% recycled acrylic. However there is not always systems in place to ensure that all the acrylic manufactured is recycled.|`|vDG6yLjQaa	Am I right in thinking you mean plywood when you say pine(wood)?<br>  <br>  If so, not sustainable at all, I think., because they contain high inputs of plastic derived from fossil fuels.

8c97dcbb7a9885fb95ecc7b00dbef5b7aa	It should be pretty easy to do.  At one point the world was either water or one big land mass called Pangaea.  You can find drawings of Pangaea which will identify which parts will become the future continents we know today.  You can print this model and glue it to some cardboard, then cut it along the lines where it will break up in the future.  Set this model on a second sheet of cardboard and spread the continents out to where they will go when fully split. Trace this location on the cardboard. Glue a small wooden dowel to the bottom of each continent. Reassemble Pangaea and punch holes for the dowels to slide into. Now cut a channel from this dowel to where the continent will go to. Attach strings to the different dowels and you can pull Pangaea apart.<br>  <br>  'Tis an idea.  Maybe you can improve upon it.  Good luck!
n6xqkPhXaa	Some people in the north rely on polar bears to make a living either as hunting guides or tourism guides.  If polar bears were extinct these people would have to find other ways to earn money.  Other than that, the interaction between people and polar bears is very minimal, so their extinction wouldn't have much effect.  You'd never want to meet one on the open tundra, that's for sure...they're huge, fast and really dangerous.  <br>  <br>  There's no danger of polar bears becoming extinct, though.  In the 1950s there were an estimated 5,000 of them worldwide.  Now there are between 25-30,000 so their numbers have increased substantially.  Their species is doing really well and still growing.  Al Gore's movie stated that they're declining, but he didn't have a clue what he was talking about.|`|DDw6k8JOaa	Polar Bears can swim for miles in Arctic water.... <br>  haven't you ever seen them hunt for fish or seals on the discovery channel? If their habitat is in any sort of danger, chances are they will take up residence at the nearest coastal regions surrounding the area. Possibly they might also breed with the other bears already existing in those parts as well. There has been speculation that some hybrids have been birthed lately.|`|tM9g60AWaa	As said, it will affect people up north who hunt polar bears and rely on them for food and income.  Also, polar bears are an important part of the ecosystem.  They help control the populations of the seals and fish they like to eat.  <br>    The ice cap has been melting for centuries.  But it's sped up considerably now- polar bears that leave the ice for a day or two of hunting are now in danger of drowning because they can't find the ice when they are ready to return.  That's how fast the ice sheet is receding.|`|AA10755943	If polar bears go extinct, it will have no effect on us.  The seals might be really happy about it, though, since Polar Bears love to eat them.

AA11264399	Well the world is definitely warming up - there's no question about that.  There's still plenty of debate about all the factors that could be causing it but the vast majority of climate scientists agree that increased greenhouse gases produced by humans are having a substantial impact on the climate.<br>  <br>  The best resource is <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipcc.ch</a><br>  <br>  Evidence for climate change:<br>  <br>  Rising global average air temperatures (0.13C per decade).<br>  Rising global average ocean temperatures.<br>  Rising global average sea level (3.1mm per year)<br>  Observed decreases in snow and ice extent.<br>  Thawing of permafrost by up to 3C since the 1980s.<br>  Cooling of the stratosphere (i.e. more heat retained at lower altitudes).<br>  Significant increase of precipitation in some areas (e.g. eastern US).<br>  Significant decline of precipitation in other areas (e.g. southern Africa).<br>  Fewer cold days, cold nights and frosts over the last 50 years.<br>  More hot days and hot nights over the last 50 years.<br>  Increase in North Atlantic tropical cyclones.<br>  Spring is starting earlier in many regions.<br>  Autumn is starting later in many regions.<br>  All but one of the warmest years on record occurred since 1995.<br>  Average atmospheric water vapour content has increased since 1980s.<br>  Mid-latitude westerly winds have strengthened since 1960s.<br>  Changes in ocean salinity due to changing precipitation and evaporation.<br>  More intense and longer droughts.<br>  More frequent heavy precipitation events.<br>  Observed ocean acidification.<br>  <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report...</a><br>  <br>  Phenological records for the past 30 years in Europe indicate that spring events such as leaf unfolding have advanced by about six days, whilst autumn leaf colouring is delayed by nearly five days (Menzel et al., 1999). Conditions in Britain are changing even more rapidly, with spring arriving six days earlier each decade, and autumn being delayed by two days each decade, an extension of the growing season of 24 days since records began 30 years ago. The thermal growing season extended on average by 0.7 days per year between 1920 and 1960 and by 1.7 days per year between 1980 and 2000 - <a href="http://www.rhs.org.uk/news/climate_change/chapter2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rhs.org.uk/news/climate_chang...</a><br>  <br>  None of this is due to natural factors, because solar irradiation and volcanism and all those other things taken together would have produced slight cooling in recent years, whereas in fact the world is warming substantially, and that can only reasonably be explained by the dramatic increase in greenhouse gases produced by human activity.|`|MBFeHS22aa	Let us assume it is true. Would we not be doing things to combat it? Co2 by any ones estimate will take years to heat up the Earth. If we really had global warming we would be trying to cool the Earth.

I don't hear any of the fruit's advocating this. <br>  Now if I look back in time I know that in the great state of Michigan where I am seated there was once large sheets of ice. So I know it was colder than it is today. I also know that we were tropical at one time. All this happened when man did not exist or was in the stone age. <br>  I have never seen any hard data.

Even 20 years ago most respected climate scientists (who are the ones who actually look at this question objectively) knew that the chances of human activity causing climate change were much higher than us not causing it. All the evidence has been there for years, although it has become much more abundant and clearer and clearer as the years have gone by. Even people who were skeptical about humans being the main cause of global warming have never really doubted that global warming was occurring - that was never really in doubt (except for a few real crack-pots who were just laughed out of court straight away). The issue was really does human activity cause it, and although a majority of scientists have understood this since it was first understood all those years ago, public understanding and a majority of politicians have only fairly recently taken this on board - maybe in the last 3 or 4 years (partly because of the scientific evidence becoming more and more overwhealming, and partly because of publicity with films like "An Inconvenient Truth").<br>  <br>  Just to add, the scientists who look into this use methods like looking at cores of ice in places like the Antarctic and Greenland, where they can look back for hundreds of thousands of years at the effects on the world's atmosphere, which can be seen by careful experimentation.

b0oCFZ5Maa	One of the simplest adaptations is to build sturdy buildings out of wood, rather than brick or stone. Wooden buildings can naturally flex more to dampen the oscillations associated with an earthquake, whereas a brick structure would be more prone to crumble.<br>  <br>  There are high-tech solutions too, employed in, for example, tall buildings in cities. Large masses with some degree of constrained movement can help dampen the motion of an earthquake. Alternatively or additionally, there may be measures taken to construct building that are partially decoupled from the ground (eg, on rollers), so that if an earthquake occurs, only a fraction of its energy is transferred into the building.<br>  <br>  On a related note, one of my favourite examples of construction around tectonic or seismic events is the Alyeska Pipeline in Alaska. Where the pipeline crosses the Denali fault, it's built on rails, so that if there is any fault offset (such as there was in the 2004 Denali Earthquake), the pipeline will slide and escape serious damage.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.photoseek.com/alaska-show/images/06AK_3195-Alyeska-Pipeline.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.photoseek.com/alaska-show/ima...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

It's ability to moderate climate is because it is a greenhouse gas, is often at or near the melting freezing point, and because it evaporates and condensates as rain.  Greenhouse gases typically will raise the coldest night time and winter temperatures more thus having a moderating effect on temperatures.  When it is very hot, water evaporates.  The water then condenses where it is cooler.  This provides an efficient mechanism for redistribtion of heat.

If it sounds like what you are looking for you should read the entire article.<br>  <br>  Mr. Dan Henderson, a Senior Manufacturing Technology Engineer at 3M, shared with me a formula for springs. All other factors being equal, the strength of the spring is proportional to its width: in other words, if we double the width, we double the strength. Similarly, the strength is proportional to the cube (to the power of 3) of the thickness: if we double the thickness, the spring is eight times stronger (2x2x2=8).<br>  f=kbh3<br>  where f is force (or strength), b is the base (or width of the mainspring), and h is the height (or thickness of the mainspring). This means that the 0.014 inch mainspring has 47% of the strength of the 0.018 spring. I would be very careful in replacing a mainspring with one that is less than half as strong as the former.|`|QGrnEIETaa	What's mainspring energy?????<br>  :?

gwindStOaa	Look up the number for the extension office in your county. In the phone book it should be listed as Warren County Extension Office, or something similar. Call them and tell them you'd like to sign up for 4-H. They will most likely tell you to come by so you can learn about the different 4-H clubs, or you can just be Independent if you want. If you have any more questions feel free to email. <br>  <br>  Edit: Go to this website: <a href="http://extension.missouri.edu/warren/4-H.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://extension.missouri.edu/warren/4-H...</a><br>  <br>  It tells who to contact about joining! Good Luck!

They are going for short term gratification and ignoring the bigger picture.|`|csynpFFhaa	Actions speak louder than words. If the worlds politicians and their ‘experts’ really believed human CO2 activity was responsible for global warming then surely they would start by curbing or stopping CO2 emissions produced by non essential human activities, like the manufacturing of fizzy (Carbonated ) drinks and beer, they haven’t have they ! It’s a con : Global warming is due to the residents, the 6 Billion humans and who can change that ?|`|7ad016542c50c46a01ee556a55c69f76aa	You can slice it, dice it, throw it a pan.
