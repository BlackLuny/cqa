3cwY3Lcpaa	Congratulations!|`|1CryEnb3aa	This has not happened to me, but I wanted to congratulate you!!|`|UtvBfdR3aa	You're pregnant.  Congratulations.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	nope been pregnant 5 times.  I would take 1 pregnancy test and believe whatever it said, and have a professional do the next step!|`|HEOyvmYFaa	i would definitely go to the doctor to make sure. or if you cant g to a doctor go to a clinic. good luck and congrats if you are having a baby.|`|3OHzn5B0aa	I would not worry until your dr appt.  I know its hard not to worry  when you have had an eptopic pregnancy already...if you start having severe cramping and bleeding I would go to the emergency room asap...otherwise I would relax and wait to see your dr.    this happened to my best friend, the first test was a positive..but the line was very faint...the next was neg...she waited a few days and had another positive....shes now 6 months!   don't worry good luck!
AA10610460	He probably has Roto Virus and needs to go to the doctor before he is hospitalized for severe dehydration. go NOW.|`|1e4385b333fdc39a5947962d4e029837aa	Time to take him to your doctor.|`|hMS2BUzIaa	GET HIM TO THE DOCTOR ASAP!  DUH!|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	you need to take him to the Dr. asap|`|rfB8G7skaa	What the F*** kind of a parent are you? Idiots like you don't need to have kids and pass on their stupid genes. Take the kid to the Doctor as soon as possible you idiot.|`|EyKJ737daa	I would seriously be taking him to the doctor if not the hospital.  A child that young and not taking enough fluids in is at a high risk of dehydration.  How wet are his nappies? If he is not wetting more than 4-5 disposable nappies in a 24hr period, then I would be taking him to seek medical attention.|`|ENANtueuaa	You should take him do the emergency room asap! 6 days of vomiting is very serious for a toddler! Buy some Pedialyte, and have him drink that, it'll help keep him from getting dehyrated, or help with the dehyration if he already is!    EDIT: If they really told you that, you need to take him back! ONE wet diaper a day? He needs to be on an IV...and i can't believe the emergency room would send you away!|`|YV52jdEPaa	they are at great risk of dehydration,take to the hospital straight away!|`|MzHwklzKaa	Anytime a child under the age of 3 vomits for more than 48 hours, you need a doctor.    At this point, you should head into an emergency room.  1 bottle a day is not enough to sustain him on a good day, and sickness requires more fluids.      He's a sick little boy and should see a doctor as soon as possible.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	6 days?  And he's still alive?    Wow.    Troll babies must be tougher than human babies!|`|VzOokYEqaa	you should really have taken him to the doctors after the second day. i bet he is very dehydrated and will need an IV. take him to the hospital now or call the docs to see what they think.|`|4rV15ZYuaa	To the emergency room immediately, dehydration is obvious at this point. You're not going to be able to fix it at this point with anything but an IV.|`|AA11526235	Take him to the doctor or ER as soon as possible.  He's dehydrating and evidently has a virus or illness that his body is having a hard time fighting.  Give him sugar/water in a bottle and go.
pFDu5I3Uaa	why have an abortion just to turn around and have a child?|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	Ermm, even though she didn't take the pills did she finish getting cleaned??  I think she should go to the doctor to have herself checked out. She could get an infection and get very sick if she did not pass all the tissue and stuff inside her uterus.|`|lHKQdwsnaa	she needs to have her follow up three weeks after the abortion.  most people throw the pills up anyway the just help undialate your cervix|`|1CryEnb3aa	She really should go to her OB/GYN and get checked out prior to getting pregnant again.  Good luck|`|r39EDGhPaa	If the procedure wasn't performed right, she could have become sterile.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	she needs to go to a doctor and get checked she could have gotten an infection and could make it where she cant get pregnant|`|DNygQdmVaa	she may still have stuff inside her uterus.  she needs to go to the doctor.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yes,it's very possible her fallopian tubes could be blocked. She should see her doctor asap!|`|yfcJwQr8aa	Im assuming the abortion was not done anytime soon and you are referring to this happening a while ago and she didnt take the pills then.  If she is trying to get pregnant now, she still has a chance to get pregnant unless her dr has told her otherwise.  She could not be getting pregnant because she is not trying on her ovulating days. you only ovulate 3-4 days out of the month.  Also tell her dont be so quick to think its her, it could also be her partner.  Alot of women fail to look at their partner. he could have a low sperm count or be sterile himself and not know it.  Tell her to go get checked..  thats the only way to tell
l46COY9eaa	Sorry but no. You did the right thing by calling the doc. For my ivf I was on b/c's for 2 1/2 weeks then had to stop them, then that is when AF came.  Good luck on your ivf journey!
AA10142346	have compassion for other people, treat people w/ respect, manners, teach them what kind of jobs there is out there. Teach them what a nurse does.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	A four year old should not be putting on bandaids - they are not responsible enough to be sure they have cleaned the wound properly first.    I think you're pretty much limited to handwashing - especially when they should do it even if their hands don't look dirty, such as before eationg or after using the toilet.|`|PrxlHUT5aa	show them health hazards like big gum balls that can choke them or poisonous chemicals or even medicines left by their parents on tables... can you teach them first aid kiddy style... dialing 911 in cases of emergency or no going near hot food/drinks, or fire isn't something to play with... or in cases of fire what are the basic steps to do... i'm going for basic safety and health.|`|VXG7fc8Laa	know how to call emergency services, incase one of their parents or guardians has a bad fall, and they can't wake them.     i done first aid training, and my trainer taught kids of 3 and 4 how to put grown adults into the recovery position.|`|4rV15ZYuaa	Recite their phone number, Know their parents names, tie their shoes, manners, brushing their teeth...|`|Xp2De933aa	hand washing and  putting on a band-aid are good ideas, how about, learning to tied shoes, teaching them what to do in case of an emergency, what to do in a fire, what to do if (god forbid) someone tries to kidnap them, basic safety instructions. and maybe even give a head start in the ABC's and 123s categories.  good luck!|`|EyKJ737daa	Definitely reciting their full name and address.  Remembering mummy and daddy's first names.  How to dial for an emergency.  Teaching the alphabet and numbers of course. Teach them stranger danger and who are safe people to go to for help if they are lost. May be able to even teach them how to spell their name, my 3 year old can already do this and absolutely stunned me when she came home from daycare and spelt it for me "K Y M spells Kym".  Good luck and have fun, their little minds are sponges at that age, the more you can teach them, the more they will love learning.
UUpsa35Daa	I have the blackberry and i really like it. It's easy to use and they're not as over rated as some people say they are. Plus, it comes with a few websites to get free ringtones, wallpapers and themes, which is always great. And i'm always texting, hardly talk at all (makes me uncomfortable) an i've found it really easy to text on my phone.    And blackberries are really sturdy. My sister also has one and accidentally dropped it outside a target store. When she realized it, she went back to look for it and found it UNDERNEATH the tire of an SUV. She had to  wait for the owners but when she finally got it back it worked perfectly and absolutely no physical damage.    I think people just hate on blackberries because they're so well known (aka over used). Whatever, a phone is a phone is a phone...it doesn't matter if they're over used, all that matters is that the person that's using it likes it.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Get the rant.  i have one and i love it (;|`|DNygQdmVaa	Samsung Rant? -|`|c2IqfXVfaa	anything but blackberry. they're stupid. and don't get a pink phone. that's worse.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	the rant!  i dont have one but i love them!  dont get a blackberry. my dad has one and i HATE using it. its not user-friendly at all.  my friend also has the pearl and she HATES THAT THING WITH A PASSION!!!|`|MnuQlfWYaa	OMG, you should sooo get the blackberrry with that Im not even calling anymore, all my friends have blackberry and we talk to each other FREE on blackberry msn!    If you get one dont forget to add me!|`|NznZENTqaa	i like the blackberry pearl personally
yLviMU1Gaa	If your doctor says he's fine then he's fine...with every baby/toddler when they stretch you will see their ribs...my youngest is was a porker...basically doubled his birth weight in the first month and everytime he stretched there they were...his ribs. I wouldn't worry too much. If anything just get a second opinion from another pediatrician|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if doc isn't worried, u shouldnt be either; i have a petite gal myself, but she is healthy as a horse..|`|y4Uliyq3aa	Your Doctor knows best. It sounds like he has a Great Appetiate!|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	hes fine. as long as he dosent look like a skeleton he should be fine. i would feed him a bit more for a couple months and see if he gains weight or if you can still see his ribs|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Sounds like you are doing a great job feeding him.  You are giving him what he needs to grow and not just junk.  If he's not hungry then I would not worry about it.  Kids will go through stages where they eat more and then less.  The only other thing I do is always offer fruit or veggies.  My kiddos know they are always welcome to fruit or veggies no matter what time of day.|`|DNygQdmVaa	He was a preemie i take it?  my son is 13 months old, 11 corrected. and that sounds like eating habits to me.    my son is 30 inches and 20 pounds...    i think your baby is a good size.|`|AA10142346	Your child will not starve and will eat when they are hungry, The amount toddlers consume will vary from day to day depending on activity levels etc. Dont worry about it so much, if you find your little one is getting cranky more he may need some more to consume.|`|ldcs7OdXaa	My son is the exact same way and about the same age; and my son weighs barely 20 pounds; his diet is great is seems to me. Ya, I'm young but I have done all those nutrtion classes for my son, and your sons diet seems good. He's getting his milk; lucky; my son HATES milk unless its chocolate milk and I didnt even start him out on chocolate milk. With my son I can see his ribs without him stretching. Most likely he is just scrawny because he is so active and on the go all the time. He sounds fine.|`|C67B7n9Waa	I think the doctor may have been wrong. You are feeding your child perfectly. I only think you should give your child vitamins and minerals and milk more often. Good luck!
K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    it is very possible that pregnancy may occur.  defiitly take a test date period is meant to be due.    yes the cramping and spotting most likely ws implantation bleeding.    god bless x all the best|`|ejHfqSD1aa	It is very possible.|`|eGmbnQMuaa	possibly, you can get pregnant whenver, even after ur period..
wz9szz3Gaa	Good question this is what I read! No good studies have been done on teeth whiteners that definitively say whether they're safe to use if you're expecting. And some makers of whitening products do caution against using them during pregnancy. Some dentists also encourage waiting until after pregnancy to get your teeth whitened, whereas others say the procedures are safe. The concern is primarily about the chemicals used in teeth-whitening products, which could be swallowed, and their potential effect on a fetus.    Talk to your doctor or dentist before plunking down the cash on whitening products. If you'd rather wait until after your pregnancy to try to make your teeth pearly white, simply brush regularly with whitening toothpaste, which may give your smile a little extra kick.|`|YqdU6SS6aa	Yes, you should be fine using them!

7b9950c99c6ea90a89b5e6b29c014f81aa	Macy's carry some of those brands for baby's. Try online too.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	perhaps u should google it and see if you can find what u are looking for online....depending on where you live there may or may not have a store nearby that carries the clothing u are looking for...btw; designer clothing is nice, but don't buy too much bc baby will outgrow it soon! my gal has some very very nice clothes that she outgrew before she ever got to wear it once!! arghhh  sucked to pack it up brand new....:(|`|xp0BnsD0aa	The baby will grow so fast - dont splash out too much.  My son grew 4cms in 2 weeks....  Stick to size OO or higher.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	Great.... chollo baby....|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Try this store called Rainbow. They got House of Derion, Roca Wear, ackademiks, baby phat and sean jean and they sell it cheaper than a department store. IDK if they have a Rainbow where you live at, but they have one here in Chicago.|`|AA11431340	I've seen Sean Jean, Rocawear and other hip hop brands at discount stores like TJ Maxx and Ross.|`|AA10142346	speciality boutiques, I had a juicy Couture baby jumper bought for my little one. Dont bother with the designer clothes for babies waste of money!! They grow too quick. but if you like too waste your hard earned money try Holt Renfrew
HVWAq4u9aa	I would stay at home...not necessarily because of the hotel room itself. It's more the case of walking in and out of the lobby with the baby.  I'm sure you'll be leaving the hotel intermittently (you can't stay in the room the whole week...you have to eat) and there are a lot more germs in a public place than there are at home.  Newborns don't have a very good immune system and a cold can be a big deal with a baby that age.  Also, if you're going to have relatives visiting and seeing the baby, you need to keep some hand sanitizer around and have them use it before they touch the baby.  And naturally, anyone with the flu or something like that should wait.  It's mostly for the first couple of weeks you have to be really careful.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	Stay at home!  Your family will honour your requests for some privacy.  They are well meaning and will only want to help you.    Let's face it - you are not going to be in any position to 'get jiggy' after having the baby so a room is not required.  Take it slow so you can be sure he has changed.    Your baby may disturb the other guests at a hotel anyway.|`|wFVLP5l3aa	when our baby was 1 week old we stayed in a hotel for a night because we were visiting my partners nan and pa  hes 7 weeks now and fine    we just kept him in our arms or in his pram and didnt let him touch anything in the room|`|4rV15ZYuaa	Stay at your fathers house. Even my housekeeper hates staying at hotels because they do such a bad job of cleaning them!|`|bog5bCiBaa	It really depends on the hotel and how management supervises the housekeepers.  You should check the hotel first and ask to see a room.  A hotel will probably be fine, but if you do borrow a crib from the hotel I recommend wiping it down with Wet Ones (or something along that line).|`|yLviMU1Gaa	I wouldn't suggest a hotel room because yes they don't get cleaned properly the way they should. If you want some alone time just ask your dad and stepmom if you could have a couple of nights at home and they go out to dinner and a movie or whatever they like to do. I would not stay overnight in a hotel with a newborn. I didn't stay at a hotel with my first son until he was almost a year old and even then I brought my own portacrib because I don't trust the ones they have. Just go with your gut instinct.
K2jT1z5jaa	hey    i was going to say 26 - 28 weeks. But 30 weeks is really good time.  yes you will be able to see bubs face.

vImloZKOaa	Do you really want to ruin your relationship over this petty issue? Kids are a stress factor and will ruin your relationship.    I don't blame him for not wanting kids. I'm childfree and would never marry a woman who wants them.|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	It is good you are asking each other these things before you get married. Did his father abuse or hurt him as a child? Ask him why he thinks he would hurt kids. Maybe he is a afraid of the responsibility of taking care of children? Try your best to convince him without breaking up.|`|y4Uliyq3aa	People change over time. He may say now that he Is not willing to ever have Children but In the future he may decide he wants to be a Father. All I can suggest Is to follow your heart. Don't make someone else change your mind about having Kids. That Is something you have to decide on your own!    God Bless~  Morgan Leilani|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	If he is telling you he would be a "violent Father" he is not the person for you. Both of you are at opposite ends of the baby scale, so if you want them, and he doesn't, you can't force him to want them. He has made of his mind, and so have you. You either force losing him as a friend, and lover, or you don't have kids. There is no two ways about it. It's up to you.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	I think your friend was right.  You have to take some time away and not push this issue with him.  You have to weigh what you truly want in life..  He's been open and honest with you about the fact he does not want children.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Then THESE are your Choices: Keep this guy you love & forget about having Children, -Or get a new boyfriend who wants kids the SAME way you do... I KNOW this doesn't sound like much of a "choice", but it IS the Reality of your Situation- & You need to face That. DO what's best for YOU... -& good luck!  :)|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Understand this and this only........just because somebody makes a good lover, doesn't always mean they make a good family man. Its like the same as saying "He's good in bed, but not someone I want to spend the rest of my life with." Or "You can't turn a whore into a housewife." Ever heard of that?     You cannot MAKE somebody into to something they choose not to be. The man is 33 and his mind is made up! That's it! Let it go. Move on.|`|BeNazR8Jaa	if he wants you to have his baby, he would ask u to marry him at some point.|`|koXcq0l1aa	I would definitely look into what you said, "He is afraid he will be a violent father."    If he said that, chances are he is telling the truth.  Do you want that for your child?  You need to decide what's more important; him or your yearning for children.    Also, asking a question and then arguing over my or someone else's answer is really tactless.  You may also need to decide if YOU are mature enough to handle that responsibility since you can't even take someone advice...when you have children, people everywhere will be giving you advice.|`|p0CgyG4raa	Do you have any friends with kids that you could 'borrow'?    Tell your boyfriend that your friend really wants to go out or has a really important meeting or just something urgent that needs to be done and they do not/cannot find any one to watch the kids. So they happened to ask if you could watch them?    Older would be better because those are the ones who would misbehave and you and he would be able to see how he handles it.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	i hate my parents   and since im a kid, most of my friends, enemys , and people i don't know hate there parents   therefore i will not have kids, im not going to be a crappy mother  kids are to hard to understand and really annoying   there cute and all but wait till they get into kindergarden and starting leanring about po*n and tell you to f off thats when you'll regret it    as for ur man, hes a guy why would he want kids???|`|VzOokYEqaa	this is one of those things that will make or break a relationship. if you know it isn't going to work save yourself all the heart break and end it now.|`|0odNqJTBaa	You said not to bemoan the obvious, so I won't go into the fact that he's old enough to be your daddy, that you aren't married, and if this relationship had been discovered when it started, this guy would be considered a sexual predator, regardless of your consent.     Nope... I won't go into any of that.    Not all people are meant to be parents. Your boyfriend might change his mind in the future, but he might not. What will you do if you're suddenly 35-40 years old and he still isn't convinced?    I think that if you really, really want children in the future, you owe it to yourself and him to leave. You can't keep pressuring him to change, only to feel upset when he doesn't. After all, he isn't telling YOU not to become a parent. He's just telling you that HE doesn't want to become one.    You put yourself in this position. It's time to get yourself out.

Lots of people are choosing not to make babies these days.|`|3135ab19db583d6656692a4eb559d3e9aa	Wow, when I was a single girl all we ever cared about was actually landing the perfect-for-us guy.  Girls today have made babies too much of the happily-ever-after equation.  IF you have been fortunate enough to land the love of your life, take it, sister.  Everything that happens after that is bonus.  It may lead to kids, it may not-but don't ruin it by making babies a priority when you've been blessed in other ways.  Just say, Horray! I've met the man of my dreams and he wants me ALLL to himself!    Childfree and loving my husband of 7 years.
5ieWhvYCaa	Tell him your sorry and that you won't disrespect him again and the only reason why he would pick your lock when when you locked is probably because he thinks your doing something with another guy.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Apologize.      Let him yell until he's finished yelling.  Then apologize again.      Maybe leave the battlefield for a while, at least 20 minutes, and then try again.  But say NOTHING except "I'm sorry I did X.  I apologize."  Do not say much of anything else, or get dragged into an anger contest.      Keep doing it until he's finished.      He will let you stay.     BUT THAT's JUST STEP ONE    Step two is to decide whether you'd rather live with mom, dad or your grandfather.  Whoever it is, you have to mend the fences.  And make a commitment to stop the insanity by saying you're sorry and meaning it - with eye contact - when you make a mistake.      You lost an expensive item.  Have you apologized?    You have bad grades.  Have you apologized?    What's wrong here isn't that you made mistakes.  It's not that they're unreasonable.  It's that you're not owning up to your mistakes, and trying harder.  He's yelling at you because it seems to him that you're not listening.  Which tells me that you haven't told him you're really sorry for your mistakes.  Or he wasn't listening when you said that.  So you just have to repeat it until he hears you.    Look into his eyes, and say you're sorry, over and over until he hears you.  Promise that for one month, you will not lock the door except for short periods (less than one hour) so you can dress and undress yourself in private.  And keep the promise.  Use a bible if you believe in that.  Promise on it.  Do what you have to.  Be sincere.  Mend the fences.  You can get along.|`|VhLnzDYgaa	im having that problem with my dad  and i want to leave to but my mom lives here to so it would kill her if i left  and i know i have another place to live    but idk its up to you if you want to then do it

Can you not afford them, do you think you have special powers that makes you not be able to impregnate a girl?    Im sorry to sound rude, buts its just so simple to avoid, use a condom and you wont have a baby!    It is possible for her to be pregnant, theres such thing as "precum" i.e the guy (you) doesnt actually ejaculate but a few drops of *** do come out during intercourse.

mKqfIgKtaa	I know that you should not give a baby milk until after 12 months.  Also, with my daughter too she naturally just started weaning herself off the bottle- so maybe just save it for bedtime.  I wouldnt worry too much unless he's not eating and drinking.  good luck.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	you need to ask your doc what the minimum amt of formula baby needs now and make sure he gets it even if u have to cut back on the solids....it he is hungry enough he will take it....if u arent already, give him the bottle before he gets solids, my gal drinks hers that way; if she's already had the solids she is less likely to drink more than a couple ounces...no cow's milk until a year old or ok'd by doc|`|rh9CRcXraa	I think its normal at that age to have less formula, if he doesn't want it all the time he is old enough to have juices (watered down of course), and plain water as well. If he is eating enough baby foods he will get the vitamins he needs from those foods,, that's probably why they tend to drink less formula at this age. I'm not recomending it, but just fyi, my oldest started on whole milk at about 9 months,, but all babies are different, and it is ultimately your choice when to give him whole milk.|`|QNuW7ivyaa	I have ZERO experience in this, and i personally have just started my 5month old on solids - so... i have no authority, just an idea.    i've noticed when you warm Bananas and the fruits in particular - they get very thin.  Perhaps shaking in a few spoonfuls of soupy solids in with the formula.  Put a little flavor in the mix!      Let me know if that works!|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	My daughter was breastfed but did the same thing when she was eating more of a variety of foods it's perfectly normal she usually only wanted breastmilk at night before she went to sleep about that age if you're really concerned ask your pediatrician but typically as long as they are getting the nutrients somewhere it doesn't have to be from the formula babies tend to wean themselves when they're ready|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	My kids started getting milk at 7-8 months.  The formula was not cutting it.  I would use half formula and half whole milk in each bottle, and as they got older I reduced the amount of formula in the bottles.  By the time they were 12 months, it was just milk.  Each Baby is different and trust his instincts ( they are ingrained).      My kids are strong, healthy and full of life, as kids should be.  My youngest even started eating fully solid food at 4 months- nothing else satisfied him.  I was careful to cut it very small, and it worked out great.    Medical advice on formula is just that, advice.  Trust your instincts and pay attention to his clues.  BTW- "normal" is in the eye of the beholder.|`|yLviMU1Gaa	You should not give him milk until he's one year old! You should really only be giving him the bottle when it's nap/bedtime or if he still wakes up in the middle of the night. Other than that he should be eating the rice cereal and baby food for his meals. Don't be too hard on pushing the bottle or the sippy cup on him. Again he's 9 months so he's more active and needs more food than just the bottle can provide. He's just transitioning into the toddler phase where at one year he should be more on the sippy cup than the bottle. Don't worry and if it bothers you too much just talk to your pediatrician.
5lfnpGmUaa	Hahaha.......silly babbies.|`|3klIx1Egaa	give him a wet face cloth, and that will usually keep them from chewing other things for awhile|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Time for some discipline, you cant let him rule you, they do it from an early age you know|`|jC1Mdsefaa	you have a phobia of your own childs spit!?!?    wow!!!    tell him NO BITE!

qA9JtQBMaa	Why not put a movie on for them and lay on the couch. That way if they need you, you will be close by and wake up easily.|`|VHHis05Naa	No way!|`|UUpsa35Daa	No, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to leave your 2 and 4 year old alone while you were sleeping. What if one of them fell and you didn't wake up to it and they couldn't get to you and they had gotten seriously hurt? Would you feel the least bit guilty?    I understand that you're tired but you can't just leave toddlers alone to fend for themselves. Put them down to sleep then go take your nap.|`|uW4npxzFaa	No, sorry as a mother I understand you are tired, but you need to be alert, if you really cant be then call a friend to help out. Little ones get into trouble even with gates up.|`|fdP9UJOsaa	I think it will be ok if you keep them all in your bedroom with you while you sleep. Leave snacks and sippy cups on a little table for them and keep the tv on a toddlers channel. Make sure the one who's patty trained went to the bathroom before you lock them in the room with you.    ... but then again, they'll find trouble before you even fall asleep.|`|5lfnpGmUaa	They'll be alright if you lock them in a closet.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	no way - not the 2 year old.  maybe the 4 year old. put on a video and lie down with the baby in the same room.  give everyone blankets and pillows.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	it only takes second for a two year old to find trouble|`|AA10718199	umm how about you send them 2 a friends house, and you have more than an hour ;)|`|UsojaTuuaa	i wouldnt.  thats just me. i dont think a two or four year old is really capable of looking after themselves.  what if they choked on food?  have them sit and watch a movie and take a rest in the room they are in|`|aqsUNGfEaa	No. What if one of them fell on thier head or something. Better safe than sorry|`|sbJCyPtlaa	you say they have food and water available like they are dogs , why don't you just leave the doggie door open for them to, that's so great that you are going to let them eat without being supervised , wouldn't you like for them to choke on that food.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	hell no, i would never go to sleep while my 2yo is up.  could get into anything.  what if the 4yo some how gets the front or back door open and the 2yo runs off.  what if the 2yo chokes on food and he cant tell you.    im not being a smart *** but there is so many things that can go wrong.    go have a big caffeine hit.|`|lGrcLQ49aa	If you wanted to be able to leave your kids out with food and water then you should have just tied your tubes and bought a dog.|`|jQwYoRCXaa	when i get tired i actually block my kids into the living room and make sure everything is picked up and there is nothing they can get hurt on, turn on the baby monitor and lay down for a lil bit...even if i dont sleep. i will occasionally go lay in my bedroom, which is right off of the living room or just lay on the couch. your 4 year old should be able to run and get you if your 2 year old is doing something wrong or is hurt.|`|wMkNpL6zaa	it should be fine|`|EIr9e67eaa	I guess O_O but not really.|`|dFyRPqY1aa	umm no...just wait till they go to sleep.|`|tJzlPhm5aa	i think that it wouldn't be safe.  What if they choke on something?? I wouldn't do it if I was in your shoes!|`|xS0edNocaa	why dont they lie down, too?|`|PMOHeWmtaa	NO!!! of course not!! never leave a child alone, in 1 hour anything could happen.|`|eDnWMm3maa	do you know what kind of trouble two toddlers can find in an hour? Access to food and water = things they could choke on.    I sometimes lay down on the couch while my son is playing in the living room right by me.. but I don't leave him completely unattended.. and I don't sleep.|`|oyK7FGynaa	I dont know what you're thinking but I have a 2 year old and i wouldnt and CANT leave him unattended for more than 5 minutes. he will either hurt himself or get into something.|`|0Ngi2keVaa	i don't think it's that bad, make sure they have a way to come get you though if something really bad happens. my mom does that but she sleeps right up the stairs from were they play, so she always no's if something bad happens. i think a half hour might be more reasonable though, a full hour is kinda long to leave kids that long alone.|`|F1W37rMmaa	It's not a good idea. Little kids can do bad stuff, and to themselves. Look after them. Hispanic people as myself leave their kids alone everywhere, but that's not a good idea.

It is funny in life, strange things happen when you least expect them. You will enjoy yourself because you don't have to be all up under him all night just cause you arrived at the dance with him. It is a status thing to boys who they show up with. So consider it a compliment. If anything at least you have the opportunity to make another friend.
efyp5CaRaa	In prenatal yoga we do crunches.(you don't come up all the way) Lie on your back and bring an elbow to your opposite knee.(just barely lift your back up off the ground) Some woman find laying on their back in later pregnancy to be uncomfortable which is fine. It doesn't bother me and my doctor approves. Your best bet is to make sure your Doctor approves of the exercise before you do it.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    no there arent because the stomach is growing out that way. and its not good to be puting work on the abdomen that isnt nessary as baby is growing inside.    god bless|`|AA10458750	No stomach excercise is recommended during anytime of pregnacy.

2H6j4j8taa	Just apologise. You don't have to be sincere about it, just try and look it at least. I know it feels like you are losing, but sometimes you just have to pick your battles. Whenever I have an argument with my mum, even when she is blatantly in the wrong, I always end up apologising to her. Now I just apologise pretty much straight away, because it makes it easier. I know I'm sometimes right, which is all that really matters and this way I just avoid all the not talking to each other and being angry with each other.

Sounds like the parents are VERY lazy!|`|AA11499514	I have 2 kids and one on the way and I do think a 2 1/2 yr old is too old to still be on a bottle.  It is bad for their teeth especially if they go to sleep drinking milk.|`|QePbhS8Caa	It is bad for the teeth, constant bottle use messes up the alignment of the teeth and if a kid sleeps with a bottle it damages the teeth themselves and can cause gum disease.    Usually the longer they stay on a bottle the harder it is to get them off. Mine were off at 1 yr with no problems. We started introducing them to the sippy cup at 9 mo. By the time we stopped giving them the bottle, they weren't fussed. My youngest went pretty much straight to sport sippers because she likes straw tops and won't really drink out of sippy tops.|`|5jhXkfDFaa	at like age 1 1/2  parents should be training there child how to use a sippy cup...( bottles can mess up the way there teeth grow in later and will make them want to drink out of a bottle Forever & that's not cut when you still have a 4 year old drinking out of a bottle.    Please don't feel offended by my word "training"|`|KihffCc5aa	There is no medical reason for a child over 11-13 months to have a bottle other than comfort and easy on the parents.    It's HARD, I know, my first born was a bottle addict!  It takes a huge amount of restraint from the parents to get rid of the bottle at that age!    The child should be using sippy cups, straws, or cups.    By the time a child is over two, you can use imagination to rid the bottles.    The parents can create a bottle fairy who needs to come collect bottles for newborn babies, and leave a suprise for the toddler giving up the bottle.    It should be a big deal, the child should set out the bottles to be collected, and wake up to a BIG surprise for letting go of the bottles at that age - a TOY and BIG CHILD sippies,and more.  Bottles are GONE FOREVER AFTER THIS!  Parents might have a night or two of sleepless nights.    the parents need to reinforce it!  There might be hell to pay for two nights, or not.  A gentle reminder that the bottle fairy came for babies, and gave the tot a bigger reward might just work.  It did for mine, and my first was a bottle addict!  Make sure one of the rewards is a snuggle to sleep with, a stuffed animal or blanket left from the bottle fairy.  Often, the child only needs to switch over to another comfort at this late age!|`|AA10526033	in my opinion and the opinion of almost every pediatrican no a 2 1/2 yr old shouldn't still have a bottle. like mentioned above all the problems with teeth are a big problem and weening them at that age is going to be traumatic for everyone especially if the kid is used to taking a bottle before bed. my first was weened straight to cup at 10 months due to medical problems and it was no trouble at all, she never used sippy cups. my 2nd was done at about 13 months no problem, and i plan on having my 3rd off at 12-13 months.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	"Should a 2 and a half year old still be taking a bottle"    No, but as I stated previously on another posters question, it's not the worst thing in the world. I have seen 5 year olds with binkie's, and 4 year olds nursing in public.     "what problems can this cause?"  That all depends on if the baby is falling asleep with the bottle in his mouth, and/or brushing regimes.     Doctor Green says:    "Cavities result from the interaction between normal mouth bacteria and carbohydrates in the diet. The sugars are converted to acids as they are fermented by the bacteria. The acid then etches the enamel of the teeth if there is prolonged contact. Saliva helps to prevent cavities by digesting the sugars and by washing the teeth.    When one falls asleep, saliva production decreases rapidly. Swallowing also decreases, and liquids present in the mouth at the time of falling asleep tend to pool for long periods. Moving the bedtime bottle forward, so that your son is awake for even fifteen minutes after finishing, can significantly help his teeth.    Baby-bottle tooth decay is the specific form of severe decay found in the teeth of infants and toddlers who fall asleep with a bottle of milk, juice, or any sweetened liquid in the mouth. It is the only severe dental disease common in children under three years of age.    Unlike adult cavities, which are largely invisible, baby-bottle tooth decay causes cavities on the visible portion of the front teeth. The top four central teeth are the ones affected. Their counterparts in the lower gum, protected by the tongue during sucking and washed by saliva, usually remain sound.    The process of tooth decay is quite gradual. Over time the teeth are weakened. Usually, the enamel is finally breached sometime between 12 and 18 months of age. The cavities first appear at the gum line as subtle, white, decalcified streaks. The process then begins to accelerate. In advanced cases, the crowns of the four upper incisors are completely destroyed, leaving decayed brownish-black stumps which distort the spacing of the permanent teeth. I have seen this many, many times.    Cavities may not seem like a big deal, and your son could be happy even with them. But these are the only teeth he will have during the years when much of his personality and self-image are formed. Even though it may seem loving to give him a bottle to go to sleep, it may be more loving to help him fall asleep in other ways."|`|PrxlHUT5aa	in this part of the globe where I currently reside, 2 1/2 with a bottle is pretty normal up until they will have to go to preschool at age 3.  however in the united states where people don't realize that there are actually other cultures besides theirs, taking a bottle or even breastfeeding past one year old is a BIG no-no.  I suggest you follow the norm lest you will be ostracized till kingdom come.      the problems it can cause is that prolonged sucking that pushes the roof of the mouth upward, affects the gum tissues making the permanent teeth grow crooked or outward causing overbite.  Our dentist has told us all about it.  However, drinking milk will not cause tooth decay as long as the child swirls water after every glass/bottle besides of course tooth brushing after every meal.|`|AA11371251	I personally wouldn't give my 2 and half year old a bottle still but to each it's own but I do know that a child sucking on thinks like bottles, thumbs etc....are more likely to have their teeth come in messed up.|`|sDHxandWaa	No, and it's probably because the parents are not weaning him away from the bottle. My son hasn't had a bottle since he was a year old. He went straight to sippy cups after that, and now he's on regular cups with straws, and he'll be 3 this year. That kid needs to get away from the bottles. If the parents say he cries....well, kids do that. It's called a temper tantrum, but as a parent they have to be stronger than that and not give in.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	its fine, let him take comfort from it|`|h9L1AtMsaa	It is really bad for their teeth and their gums.

The child will be fine with a bottle still, they will eventually grow out of it, by the time kindergarden comes around, just start introducing the big kids cup more. the ones with spill proof lids.|`|RzYePezkaa	No a two year old should be on a sippy cup by now because bottles can lead to bottle rot on their teeth especially at night and that can have prolonged problems with their adult teeth when they are older.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	it causes tooth decay and is even worse if they are having sugary drinks in the bottle, no i dont  think they should be useing a bottle at this age|`|eDnWMm3maa	If they aren't walking around asking for them all the time, I don't see the big deal honestly. My son is two and a half and I still let him have a bottle at bedtime. It's the only time he has one. He drinks out of a normal cup all day.. his teeth are fine and his doctor is not concerned. If he was running around with a bottle all day, I'd have a huge problem with it, but one at bedtime? I don't really care if other parents think it's "bad". I don't have any qualms about allowing it for the time being.    He doesn't take a bottle to bed, and he brushes his teeth afterwards.. and he NEVER asks for a bottle at ANY time during the day. He CAN go to bed just fine without one, but it's a comfort thing he enjoys while we read his stories. It's not like it will go on forever.    My brother used to have a bottle at bedtime until he was three, and he has perfect teeth.
0Ngi2keVaa	it could be your period. it should be around that time of the month now you know. and it might be different from normal, since your body is probably still off from having your baby.. don't be worried unless it becomes very painful with really bad cramps.|`|1CryEnb3aa	I think its your period trying to regulate after child birth.

And congrats!|`|rh9CRcXraa	It sounds like its probably your period,,,,|`|EvodAqEkaa	doctor for sure girl|`|laSYIzULaa	Heavy bleeding during the first few weeks after delivery (postpartum) because the uterus has not contracted to the pre-pregnancy size or because fetal tissue remains in the uterus (retained products of conception).    But I do recommend that you go to the doctor. It is always better to be safe than sorry.|`|nv0x6x13aa	Well I had the same problem. (gave birth Oct 20) The doc told me it was my period. He said it was natural to have it be a little discolored for the 1st one.    Also it could be stress. It takes nine months to make a baby, so it takes your body awhile to recoup. Too much lifting, excerise, etc can bring it on too.    Always when in doubt about something, call your doctor. That's what they're there for and that's their job. There is no dumb question when it comes to your health.    Oh and congrats!|`|lvfPrS6saa	Your having your first period (its been 28days)    All my afterbirth didn't come out after my first kid and 3 days later I was literally dying from infection.So I seriously doubt its still afterbirth.|`|PIrwKaNWaa	everything is out of wack when you have a baby mines only 9 months and it took atleast a couple months to have a normal period i was bleeding like crazy then nothing then spotting then ...you get it lol now ikm okay...so hang in there dont worry...and i never had cramps now i get them sometimes..pregnancy is the craziest wonder in the world lol|`|8FiJ5i81aa	probably period thats what happened 2 my sisters|`|eMFRN0HCaa	Never heard of it? Sounds like a job for your local neighborhood doctor to investigate the problem|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	It could be your period. If you're really concerned go to your doctor|`|HgeBc8IPaa	If you choose to feed your baby through bottle, or combine breastfeeding with bottle-feeding, you are likely to get your first period after pregnancy about 5-6 weeks after delivery.     If you breastfeed regularly (with no bottle-feeding), you may not get your period until you cease to breastfeed. This is nature's way of protecting your body from an immediate pregnancy while your child is in infancy.     Even if your period starts while you are breastfeeding, don't expect it to be regular. It is common for your menstrual cycle to be of shorter or longer length than normal during your breastfeeding days.     The first period that you get after delivery is always peculiar. Don't worry; it gets better after this. You will experience the customary pain as well as heavy bleeding after delivery. This happens because your body needs time to get used to regular ovulation and menstruation after a gap of nine months. Therefore, the first period always takes a toll over your body.|`|QAGhFzFsaa	My doctor told me this could happen for months after giving birth. If you are breast feeding normally you won't have your "period" for a couple months at least, BUT if you're anything like me... I got mine 5 weeks after my son was born. I was told by my doctor to watch the bleeding and if it becomes heavy (like filling up a heavy pad within the hour) or clumps bigger then a golf ball are coming out to go to ER right away... it could be a hemorrhage, but other then that normal after stuff! Good luck and congrats on the baby!!!|`|7PXFXcKfaa	its your period!!!     or sometimes if youve been overdoing it your lochia (post partum bleeding) can come back. Try relaxing for a day and see if its stops. if not its just your period coming back to normal.    if your soaking more than one pad an hour then go to your doc.|`|qyAyLFw1aa	Gross. Any girls out there want to go through this? I dont think so|`|H5kqjJZ7aa	It's called a period. I would have thought someone that squeezed a pup out woulda known about those.|`|PAthNpkRaa	some womens bodies do that after having a baby! if you feel sick or feel something isnt right go see the doctor!|`|eJkzHQvjaa	if it's not bright red blood and you're not feeling light headed, dizzy, or having any blurry vision then you're okay!    it's normal =)
nIkFQfE2aa	haha your cuuute :) my cars name is yolonda the honda       How about something with the LT? like lucy or lola|`|xp0BnsD0aa	I would go with JUICY since you will constantly be filling it up with juice!

4k5NJN29aa	Why not just save up money for a trip and name your kid something not terrible?    Colorado? Hawaii? Seriously? Just because Georgia works doesn't mean you can plug in any old state and still look educated.    What's wrong with the name Wyoming or Connecticut for a child? They don't sound appealing because you don't dream about them? Well, that's exactly how the names you picked out sound to normal people. Sad.|`|HurPmgSaaa	I dont really like the state names but all your twin names are cute|`|Elxuvon8aa	skylar and sky are to much the same sorry woould not do it   I hate both chloe and Zoe because they were names of dogs    I really hate the names of places so I guess I am not help here|`|DNygQdmVaa	cute :]|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Colorado James- Love it!!  Hawaii Grace- not really    Twins names- rhyme too much for me but they are your babies not mine so Not my place. Skylar and Skye same name...|`|5DK546BUaa	honestly - I think you need to grow up some before you name a child...  You do realize that the child will one day be an adult, and will be forced to live with this name for life or until s/he can legally change it?!|`|6d4ece3a1fb5d79a4049183612706ce8aa	If You Do Have Twins I Think They Would Resent Having Rhyming Names.|`|XBpfbjCiaa	I like them.|`|f1de2e7e6c3445e8601e1d2bd92cd759aa	Please don't give twins names that rhyme.  They will thank you for it later!|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	state names are just awkward. There is a junior at my school named California, and she hates her name with a passion because it stands out too much and everytime her name is mentioned in a history book or something, everyone turns towards her and snickers.    As for the twins names, they rhyme too much. Cute, yes, but think about how their names will sound in the future.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	i wouldnt name my children those names in a million years,  but its up to you entirely.    ps- James is a cool name ;)|`|n4Ewusysaa	everythig except zoe & chloe, skylar & skye works for me, skye is cool though.    the best one for me was HAWAII GRACE. it feel good kinda name.|`|8wn7rQH4aa	Well, I love the name James, but that is about it from your list. Colorado is kind of cool, but Hawaii is not. I prefer Gracie over Grace.    And as far as the twin names, I hate rhyming names, and names that are basically the exact same thing - eww.
b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	This is something that deserves professional attention. The only thing I can suggest is to see a specially trained psychologist. Many teenagers are in the same position as yourself. But you are already a step ahead by understanding and confronting your situation. Good luck.|`|Ethykzkoaa	Hun..if you are bullimac, really bullimac then you just are.  I told myself for years i wasn't, that I had control over the vomiting...but yes, I am bullimac.  You need to realize you are( thats the first step)  and then you need to have someone( a therapist maybe) help you control the "bullimac" voice( what I call that little voice in my head that tells me I am worthless and fat and ugly, etc).  You can get past this, it is NOT a life sentence. Good luck sweetie. If you ever need to talk you can talk to me . :)  -Katie|`|WMffEu2waa	just don't think about it  i know its hard  but eat well and exercise and enjoy lyf    55kgs is not fat... by the way and i would tell you if it was|`|OwfoyXpraa	sounds to me like you eat when you're bored?  if that's the case, I'd start chewing more gum or something. :P  When I was younger I had a bad habit of going and grabbing some junk food when I was watching TV or something, even if I wasn't hungry, but just because.. although if I had something to chew on, like gum, I wouldn't have the craving for goodies. (:    Also, on Google search up foods/drinks that will boost your metabolism, which will help you lose weight.. like, water, green tea, soup, apples, pears.. just to name a few. (:    Hm. Perhaps you're not exercising long enough, or you're doing it incorrectly? Try exercising steady for about 30 minutes - 1 hour every day, along with drinking lots of water.    Oh, and also, eat slower.. don't just stuff your face. It's been proven that slower-eaters tend to be more slim, because they find that they "fill up" sooner. This is because it takes a long time, about 20 minutes I believe, for your brain to pick up the signal that you're stomach is full. Now, I'm not saying that you should eat barely anything and wait 20 minutes though.     Hun, making yourself throwing up or starving yourself doesn't work. You'll feel even hungrier after and will eat more, therefore you'll just gain wait. Look for weight-loss websites, or speak with your doctor about this if you need further assistance. :)    It's also important for you to make realistic goals. Don't say, "oh this week I'm going to lose 20 pounds," because it doesn't work like that, and you'll end up feeling even worse when you're not able to lose all of that after all of your hard work. You should feel proud of yourself no matter what, whether you lost 5lbs in two weeks, or even just 1lb, or even if you don't lose anything, because in the long run, all of this will help you in the future; it's best to start getting into these good eating/excersising habits as soon as possible to keep you healthy. :)|`|lmG2hCIqaa	it all has to do with your self esteem. this deserves medical attention. you really should begin talking to someone about this distorted body image that you see because hun, youre not fat, AT ALL. you need to start building your self esteem and accepting yourself for who you are. dont let the pressures of society take a toll on you. there is no "certain way" to look. just love who you are, and once you can do that, all the other things will just go away. i know its hard, and if you need help, which most people would, thats fine, but please do it as soon as possible. good luck hun |`|tg9D0tVGaa	that sounds kinda of underweight  i think you need to change your way of thinking, cos thinking like that isnt goin to help you  in fact it will probs lead to an eating disorder  i think just eat fruits and a balanced diet(diet as in what you eat not a losing weight type thing)
k0QRfQ00aa	It is said that saliva can impair some sperm BUT not all but no one really knows for sure how accurate that can be so if I were you I would go to the dr and get Plan B if it hasn't been 72 hrs yet if you are trying to prevent pregnancy. Good Luck.|`|CRVi3YsOaa	it is possible. i don't know about saliva killing sperm but if any get near your vagina then it is possible to become pg. I don't think the chances are high but they are there.|`|YqdU6SS6aa	I would say the chances that you got pregnant are very very slim. But I also know that I guess just about anything is possible...|`|XZlBUaN3aa	I have also heard that it kills the sperm but anything is possible. My cousin got pregnant after a dude ejaculated on her pubic hairs and some how it rolled down and she got pregnant. (The didn"t have sex at all)
pfm0wcEIaa	It doesn't matter how many children you have.  Each child you have has the same chances of being a boy or a girl.  Even if you have six girls the chances of the seventh child being a girl are still 1 in 2.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	50-50 like it was before...|`|VClxXNs3aa	50 %.|`|3klIx1Egaa	50/50 ..|`|a1ymHaWAaa	it's up to the guy his sperm determines the sex|`|f1i6DPHFaa	Technically, the chances of having a girl are much higher than a boy. The woman has an XX chromosome, while the male has an XY. If the male's X bonds with your X, then it will be a girl. If the Y bonds, it will be a boy.         X      Y  X   XX    XY    X  XX     XY    50% chance girl, 50% boy.    The male is the deciding factor.  Good luck.|`|89lEF1bwaa	1 in 2  hahahha  im great.|`|sLGlL17naa	You can have a boy/girl. So its fifty fifty really.|`|RZfDrdIRaa	You get what the good lord gives you sweetie! No matter what the sex...love that child with all your heart and thank god for her...or him!    CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!|`|ldcs7OdXaa	Well it depends on what your babys daddys genes are. I am a teen mom also and have a little boy. So your chances on having a girl depends on how you and the fathers genes mix!   Girl names I like:  Payton Leanne.  Aunjel Gizelle    Or you could choose your favorite first name and then put your middle name and your moms middle name together?     Boy names:  Carter James [my sons]  David Lee  Chauncy  Marcus    Good luck baby girl! Show all the people that look down on teen moms that anyone can take care of their kids and be great at it! And make up for all the bad teen moms out there! Hope you get what you want [boy/girl!]|`|yJXX9kLqaa	Just because you already have a daughter doesn't mean this one will be. In fact it is the sperm that is the deciding factor. So studies show that if you conceived a few days before ovulation that it is more likely to be a girl and that if you conceived during ovulation its more likely to be a boy. (the boy sperms are faster swimmers but the girls sperms live longer even up to 5-6days)|`|mKqfIgKtaa	I'd say fifty/fifty  :0)|`|32uGH3cVaa	well do to gentectics and dna.  you can just use the mathematical equation for birth  and genter basics.    m+f /2x + (-50)m - (50)f =%  mf / 2x + 50m -50f =%  mf/2x +100mf = %  m/f (2/100)mf = %  xmf = 50%  /m      /f  m=50% f=50%    therefore your chances of having a girl are a 50% chance.|`|wXloRCegaa	You have the exact same chance as you did for the first one.  It's a 50/50 chance.  The next time you get pregnant it's the same chance.|`|XADP739faa	50 percent|`|rvGw1nKXaa	It's a 50/50 chance of either.|`|62c2549bf9bf598fe305e8a16c9967e3aa	You have a 50% chance that it will be a girl again.|`|kjOsSmM0aa	As much as I hate to tell you, I can only say that it seriously is a 50/50 chance. There really is no other way of telling aside from ultrasound after about the 20th week. As far as names go, that is such a big preference issue. We had names like Marshall Tucker, Olivia Grace, etc. We tried to stick with countryish names that are not so common. For ideas, though, check out these web sites.  www.babynames.com  www.babynamesworld.com  new.babynamesindex.com (that's "new" instead of "www")  www.babyzone.com    There are many more sites but these should keep you busy for a while.  God Bless!|`|Ur5MffQOaa	um.. well its actually 50/50 because no one really know what are the chances.|`|sux1aIHEaa	It's a 50/50 chance. Everytime someone is preg it is a 50/50 chance no matter how many children they have.  even if you have 20 girls previously, the chance is still 50/50.  plus the male parent determines the sex cause you have two X chromosomes.    one chromosome comes from you which is automatically X since you have two X chromosomes  and either a X or Y from the father because males have XY chromosomes.    if it's XX it'll be a girl  XY and it'll be a boy  and that's why it's a 50/50 chance EVERYTIME|`|jPOtfICyaa	50/50 chance lol     Names I like:    1. Stephanie    2. Alexandra    3. Noemi    4. Denise    5. Randi    6. Jessica    7. Catalina    8. Jasmine    9. Catrina  10. Irene        P.S.

iUMrd7qlaa	In my opinion either go to the doctor and get blood work done or wait until your next period. Good luck|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	You will just have to wait and see. And why not take birth control pills? If you don't want to get pregnant again, this is a great way not to!|`|yJXX9kLqaa	It all depends on when your last period started( the one before the 3day period). Technically when you are pregnant they consider your pregnancy to have started the day of your last menstrual period. So you would probably be like 4 weeks along if you are pregnant and not 2 weeks. So you could probably take a test now and have it be accurate. If your not sure you want to be pregnant again right now then you should go get on birth control (and use a condom, i am a big believer in using BC and a condom at the same time)   Any way good luck|`|ymnWL2czaa	well you might be pregnant or its a good chance that your not

How about: Nicholas William|`|930CUTk1aa	zachary.. it's kinda rare to have that name..|`|4k5NJN29aa	I said all the combos aloud and like Zachary the best. I'm fond of the name, too. I had a great friend named Zach and all my nicknames for him (yes, I'm weird) were Zachie, Zaquis, and Strawberry Zaquari (when we were being funny).     I love the name William, but have a moral objection to people ruining it by going by Bill, and Will isn't fantastic either. Nicholas is also a nice name, but doesn't "fit" like you want it to. The problem with Ashton is that his nickname would inevitably be Ash, as is the case with the name Ashley.    Also, I lovelovelove the name Anthony. It's really refreshing to see people give their kids respectable names.|`|n4Ewusysaa	Zachary|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Nicholas is great.  William is classic  Zachary isnt great  Ashton is pretty modern    i dont know, too hard!

If this is your first that is why you bump is small.  1st time pregnancies are usually smaller to start with but will grow more toward full term.

846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	My girl was prone to that, as was I.  Bananas are a good way to help regulate her.  The best way I found was watered down pear juice.  It works fast and, in moderation, will keep her from getting too stopped up.  1/2 and 1/2 is good for her age.  My Pediatrician told me about it and it worked wonders.  She was going without too much trouble within 2 hours of drinking it.  As the days went by, giving it to her once a day, she had normal consistency 99% of the time.  As she got older, she started regulating herself and I was able to phase out daily pear juice.  She loves fruit drinks, fruits and veggies, which are good normalizers.  I hope this helps, I know it did me!
ENANtueuaa	A good rule of thumb is 2 hours, just like formula. If it's been out any longer, toss it.|`|AA10628838	You should throw out what is left. Once at room temperature bacteria begins to grow.|`|Aw26KuJcaa	either microwave it or use a stove top, test on wrist, milk can get bacteria quick and can also spoil causing an upset stomach, if not finished then don't give them as much, use less|`|AA10788801	No for long, i dont recommend you to save it. Just put it on the freezer, then heat it up for later!|`|AA10283296	Oh my god, no wonder we are the sickest nation on earth.    Unless the milk is spoiled (and even if it is) it is HIGHLY unlikely that it would make you sick.    How on earth did any of our ancestors live long enough to continue our families?    We are bacteria and germ phobic, instead of trying to live in a sterile world--which is impossible--we should try to cut out the chemical fest in our lives and strengthen our immune systems naturally.    I finally did, after 20 years of allergy medicines and listening to doctors/popping  pills, I cured my allergies.  Amazing and NOT done with a pharmaceutical nor my doctors help.    Just pay attention to your child and if you notice bad reactions (vomiting/diarrhea) you know it was bad.|`|EyKJ737daa	Offer her smaller servings of milk sweetie.  Warm it up in the microwave and offer it to her.  Because it has now been warmed though, it should not be returned to the fridge. I'd give her half an hour with it and if she doesn't finish it, throw it. If you are finding it is still too much for her, then offer smaller serves again. She can always come back for more if she wants it and it does only take a couple of secs in the microwave to heat.  I use to do this for my 16 month old and gradually reduced the heating time each time and now she drinks it straight from the fridge.  I watch her with it and once she puts it down to start playing with toys, I take it off her and put it straight back in the fridge so it's not getting a chance to warm up. Her cups have a one way valve on them so she can't spit back into the milk either. I will keep offering it to her through out the day and refill it if necessary.  She now loves her milk.  When I'm out and about with her, I buy the small long life (UHT milk) in little popper packs and fill a drink cup up for her then. Gets tossed the moment we head home though.  Good luck and all the best.
Xnr5Y7Coaa	A little cramping is fine. I got cramping at the beginning too and the doctor said it was fine. Just take it easy and relax.

If not, then just call your doctor and explain the pain and ask him/her if this is normal. It may be nothing to worry about, but you are better off to ask just to make sure that what you're feeling is nothing to be concerned about. No doctor will be upset at you for calling. If the pain isn't too terrible, then call during business hours and ask to talk to your doctor's nurse. They will consult with the doctor and get back to you about what you should do.  God Bless!|`|QAGhFzFsaa	It could be implantation cramping...this is normal. When I was first pregnant I had cramping all throughout the first 3 months and every time I was totally freaked so don't worry... If you're really worried, do call your doctor because any added stress can be harmful to you and the baby. That is what you pay the doctors for... if at any time during your pregnancy you're worried (even 130pm) CALL they all have overnight nurses that answer the phone and will page your "on call doc." ... they;ve heard everything questions so no matter how "stupid" you think it is (and most of the time it really won't be!) just give them a ring... it's better to keep yourself at ease then to stress about something you don't need to be!

You could easily have abdominal pain from anything but the higher it is the less likely it's related to your pregnancy. The lower it is on the other hand... Let's see, above the navel is probably OK, anywhere below that is questionable.    Bed rest is not a bad option until you can confirm the cause of the pain but this early in the pregnancy (presumably 1 month) even if you went to the hospital there isn't really anything special that can be done which I am aware of.    Oh by the way, do you have any food allergies? Lactose intolerance? Are you having diarrhea right now? You probably wouldn't mistake an upset stomach or a pulled muscle under normal circumstances but in your excitement you might not have tweaked something without realizing it.     Now that I think about it I'd recommend calling a "nurse line" to get live support. If you or your significant other has health insurance you should have a number somewhere.|`|H5kqjJZ7aa	I have no idea what you're asking. If you're asking for tips on what to do, no idea. If you're asking for doctors, you're silly because you didn't say where you lived. If you're just posting this because you're super excited about your baby, and you're looking for someone to talk to, refer either above or below this post for more useful tips.
8wn7rQH4aa	Yea I know what you mean, but it was the opposite for me. I had never heard of Kroger until I went away to college.|`|VHHis05Naa	Whazzat?!?!|`|vwTyihvvaa	This ain't no baby name question.  I think you have the wrong section my dear.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	baby name?
4kfljeIGaa	I have been told that a baby's eyes are usually the color they'll be as an adult by the time the child reaches one year.  Both of mine have blue eyes and I don't expect they'll change to any other color, though my older daughter's eyes have turned a lighter blue as she's matured.      If one parent has brown eyes, there's at least a 50% chance that each individual child could wind up with brown eyes as an adult.  Brown eyes are dominant and blue eyes are recessive.  For more insight on whether or not the brown-eyed parent is a carrier for blue, I would check out the grandparents.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	My son had bright blue eyes but within the last few months they have started to become more hazel blue and he is 18 months old.  Experts say that eye color develops during their first three years and will even change through adulthood.    http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions...|`|BA3y6MBlaa	I've always heard that their color is pretty solid after six months.  You've got a blue eyed baby sweetie...cool huh?    You also have your hands full with twins.  They'll be what they'll be...it's all good right?|`|eN5xA6RKaa	my nieces eyes didnt change until she was almost 2 years old. they went from blue to green. so there still might be time for them to change, or they might stay the same.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	Babies' eyes may change by the time they reach 1 year old but since one parent has blue eyes there is a great possibility that they remain blue.|`|Xxf5dA9jaa	They'll change.
gG8oyymiaa	Is this the women who already as 6 kids. In her early 20's. And still live with her mother? I don't think people should be paid for stupidity sorry.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	I think people need to get off her back, and let her live her life!|`|t5tU3Xe8aa	I FULLY agree with Mommyof3 It's HER life not anybody elses!!!!  What if someone told you that you can't have kids because they might not be smart or cute?  What would you say to them or what if you didn't find that special someone and you wanted to have a baby and they implanted 10 embrios into your uterus and you popped out 10 kids and then your mother or father went behind your back to tell the world what a worthless person you are for having all these babeis?  I know I wouldn't want someone to tell me that I couldn't have anymore babies or anything of that sorts!  I think if she wanted to have 14 kids LET HER!!!!!!!!!!  IT IS HER LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (I'm not yelling at you sweety I'm yelling at the situation)|`|AA10526033	first off mommyof3 she DID NOT pay for it, she was paid FOR it. she just filed for bankruptcy 2 yrs ago and lives with her parents. and it is a problem when/if she cant afford to care for her own children and relies on welfare to support them. i have heard nothing bad about the duggers..they work hard to support their family and i applaud them. the lady with the 14 kids has problems and whoever implanted those embryos is just stupid and should get in trouble. she put her life at risk and her babies lives by doing that. those kids may be ok now but chances are they will have some health problems later on. it was very irresponsible of her and her drs and should never have been done.   to answer the question..NO i do not think she should be paid for anything. she is NOT a baby expert or she would realize what harm she could have just caused these kids. even her own mother doesn't agree with what she did. i think she did so she could get a tv show.|`|vcfFQSvTaa	jon and kate plus 8 is from 2 pregnancys not one. twins then sex tuplets|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I am horrified by this situation.  Why would doctors implant 8 fertilized eggs into the uterus of a 33 year old woman, especially when she already had 6 kids at home?  She needs to do whatever she can to support these kids.. but at the same time: The only other octuplets born in US (one baby died when he was a week old) were raised without themselves and their family being in the spotlight.. until these babies were born and they went on a talk show.  I wonder who is going to support these kids.. she is single and doesnt work.|`|yV373JUiaa	yes they could call it Jon and Kate plus bankruptcy.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? I know what you're going through. I have a similar issue at work. This guy looked really nerdy, and I assumed he had no friends so I was nice to him. Then, he wouldn't leave me alone. He stalked me and talked all the time. I suffer with migraines, so this guy would not only set one of my migraines off, but would irate me on every level.     I'm not a mean person either, and I didn't like ignoring him, but it worked. He eventually got the hint and left me alone. I feel awful about it. But if I continued allowing him to do this, I would always be unhappy at work. He would move on.    Just ignore her again, it is best for you. ??|`|kRaVa0Wraa	you need to tell her this, honestly. make it has sensitive as possible. say something like "i just dont feel as though we mesh as people...i dont know if we should be friends anymore. its nothing personal, i just feel as though i am kind of changing when we hang out and i dont want to do that."  or whatever.  be nice though. well...as nice as possible in this situation.|`|r6nQeB0oaa	just gradually distance yourself from her  Or maybe she'll change and you'll become friends again|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Talk about those things you argued about.  Try to work them out.  Probably they aren't resolvable.  So you two will just go over them again, more rationally, and decide, rationally, that it's not a good plan to be friends.      Doesn't sound like those things in the past have ever been resolved, so if you try to work them out, you'll probably argue.  Which is good because you'll see each other with clear eyes again.      Next time, don't talk to her, and if she talks to you, say, "I don't want to be mean, but I don't want to talk right now."  And don't talk to her later either.

Not even sure of how you pronounce the name properly??|`|qa4gjD52aa	I kinda like it.|`|WyQuDaRyaa	I'm going to get a million thumbs down.    But I ALWAYS defend this name.    I don't see a problem with naming your little girl this, if you like it, go for it. I've never actually met anyone in person who disliked this name, it wasn't until I joined Y/A that I realized, most of them CAN'T STAND IT. They say "oh it's heaven spelled backwards, that means hell" stupid stuff like that, just because it spells heaven backwards, does not mean it's meaning is negative. Did you know it has a hebrew meaning, meaning "Life". You could always refer back to that, I think it's a very nice meaning for the name.     I only know one little Nevaeh and she is a very beautiful little girl with two well respected parents and neither one them have ever gotten any hassel for choosing this name.    Good luck. Just thought I'd say the positive because I knew people would have a lot of negative things to say to you. I know this because although I am not considering this name, I have posted questions about it regarding why people think it's made up, when it's not. It just didn't get popular until the whole P.O.D. story which I'm sure you know..    =)|`|vwTyihvvaa	Over used a lot nowadays.|`|JWhmiehzaa	I like Nevaeh Muclana!

I think it's kinda unusual, I don't know anyone personally named that.

HyknHVV5aa	to loose fat "at breast" like you asked, here is a great exercise:    lie on a bench on your back with a pair of medium heavy dumbbells held by the sides of the chest just below the chest. At this angle the arms are bent to form right angles. Keeping the arms bent like this, push the bells upward and backward until they are behind the head and hanging down, almost toughing the floor behind you! As you do this part of the movement just inhale deeply through the mouth, getting as much air as you can and lifting the chest as high as possible. From here pull the bells over back to the starting point with a strong deliberate motion, breathing out as you do. This movement is similar to the bent over pullover done with a barbell!|`|AA10950898	Put the baby in the stroller/pram and go for long walks.  You will both enjoy the time.|`|ysJA71Bpaa	ALOT ALOT ALOT of cardio and healthy eating.  make sure you don't eat to little.  you want enough to give you energy and work off the stored fat on your body.      try running walking, or look for cardio work outs without weights and equipment online.|`|7Y3yhUtcaa	Cut calories and exercise.  This online program (I used the free version, it rocks.) helps figure out how much food to eat and how much exercise you need to do to reach a goal.  It also helps with nutrition and sort of serves as a good distraction from dieting.  It made it interesting.  That sounds strange, but it did.    http://www.fitday.com/    Also, there is no way to lose fat from one part of your body unless you have lipo.  Toning muscle might make an improvement in appearance though.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? You should definitely apologize! Hanging up on someone is a huge slap in the face. She was worried sick about you. ??|`|6CxIDIQcaa	Yes apologize.  This will show her your maturity level.  But also explain to her what happened and that you were frustrated and that it wont happen again.    She'll understand and being mature like this will gain you a lot more privileges.    Hope this helped(:|`|Cu8svhwAaa	Of course you should apologize, and the sooner the better.  Hopefully, she'll have had time to have calmed down and you can both talk rationally about the problem.  Good luck. I'm sure everything will be okay.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	Yes, you should go apologize even do I know how you feel, but she was just worried, that's all.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Yes apologize|`|hsnSuB9gaa	Wow we're the same age and the same thing happened to me last week...i got in2 more trouble for not charging it..and the question of why i evn hav a phone if i don't charge it...well u should apologise...but not as if u feel completely guilty|`|A4UiGRs3aa	she should apologise to you!!!|`|i6tyscumaa	Ahh mums - what are they like?  Even if you feel you haven't done wrong, i say apologise, this will show her that you're mature enought to be the better person and say sorry first.    If she doesn't accept your apology, just walk away, don't argue, she is the one who will feel bad about it in the end    Also, if your mum shouts at you, as difficult as it is, don't rise to it, don't argue back. If my mum is annoyed with me, i just let her shout at me for 15 minutes, she gets it out of her system and then we are friends again    Good Luck!  xx

Thats scary.|`|3haXFtx7aa	holding their hand in the store at 6 is a bit ridiculous but the parking lot they should at least be walking near by.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I have 3 kids under 5. It's impossible for me to hold my 9 month old, 3.5 year olds hand, and 4.5 year olds hand. The older one knows not to run and will walk beside me if I don't have the option of putting my youngest in a cart while in the parking lot. None of my kids are unattended, I just don't have enough arms. So I save them for the baby, who still has to  be carried, and my younger son, who still needs to be reminded to look before running. My almost 5 year old is big enough to walk beside me without holding my hand. And no, my kids don't run around anywhere other than where they are supposed to. They are supervised the whole time we're at the store or anywhere else in public.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	That drives me mad!  Take responsibility for your child, for god sake, cause you will only have yourself to blame when you child get hits by a car in the parking lot cause you were not paying attention!

rhPCJfeuaa	My 5.5 yr old daughter and 2 yr old son have never had soda, and I will put it off as much as I can.  If it can take the paint off a car,  I don't want to know what it can do with my child's insides.  What juice they get is light and also cut with 50% water.  My daughter gets light chocolate syrup 1x a day in her milk.  a tsp at most.  My son doesn't like nor does he get any chocolate in his milk.  I hear so many people say it isn't fair to drink soda in front of a child and not let them drink any.  I think that's a bunch of crap.  i also have an occasional beer and have no guilt about not sharing it with my children.  there are just some things adults can do that children can't.  that's life.  the same goes with coffee.  Kids are still growing and their organs are, too.  Why would I even take the chance that this stuff could damage them or stunt their growth in any way.  Not to mention the sugar does nothing more than rot their teeth and make them hyper.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	My son is about to turn 6, he has soda sometimes when we go to mcdonalds or out to eat.. but not at home unless he takes a sip of mine.  But ive gotten lucky with him, he prefers water or milk by choice.. and ive noticed when i do let him have soda he is more interested on the can and only opening it half way lol.. takes about 2 drinks an it gets waisted an thrown away lol.   My sister gives her son soda everyday since he was 2, he is 4 now  an what blows me away is she is a dental assistant lol.   But i dont think a soda here an there will hurt a kid, as long as it isnt cosistent which is habbit forming.  As far as koolaid, we really dont buy that, he prefers capri sun.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	no.  i didn't taste soft drink until i was 10yrs old, and even then i was only allowed one glass on my birthday and one glass at christmas.    i hope i'm able to do something similar with my son. it will keep him healthy, protect his teeth, teach him good habits and save a lot of $$$ in the long run.|`|n2Jromq6aa	Occasionally my daughter will share some soda with her dad, but I've never liked those sorts of things myself (I was always the weird kid that hated koolaid and soda and gatoraide and stuff) and so we rarely have them in the house. I prefer to have juice, but I'm careful to read the labels on everything I buy to make sure it is actually fruit and not sugar (plus being a vegetarian, I've learned to check everything I eat).     I think moderation is the key to everything in life, and so whatever works for each individual family works for them. Sugar drinks just don't happen here because I rarely buy them (only when hubby really wants some! Lol)|`|TSsT8QGgaa	i have,,,it is not like that is ALL they drink,,,moderation is key.   my kids drink alot of juice, strawberry/choco milk, water, gatorade, etc.  the big thing is to NOT let it be the ONLY thing they drink,,,,a soda here or there is not going to make your kid balloon up.    you also dont mention how old the child in question should be.  as toddlers they rarely got pop, maybe a sip out of mine.  for the post that says diet soda tastes the same as regular,,,,no it dont. my kids wont touch it as "it tastes funny".|`|jLYTKr33aa	No soda, no Kool Aid, and no other sugary, fake junk in our house.  My son does get chocolate milk made with organic chocolate every now and then, but that's for a treat.  As a result, he drinks water, milk, and a small amount of all natural juice just fine.|`|BqyFacf6aa	iv been drinkin coke since i was 4|`|VHHis05Naa	Nope.|`|69SHxWA9aa	Hi,    Soft drinks are very acidic, and for that reason once I understood all the things that can go wrong with your health over time, I stopped drinking soft drinks about 8 months ago.    You can get chronic joint pain by being overly acidic, as well as diabetes symptoms.  So I would not recommend soft drinks for anyone, especially a diabetic, or their family that has a higher than average risk of developing diabetes.    Is it any wonder why now that there is 50 gallons of soft drinks made each year for every person in the United States that there is a higher incidence of diabetes?    Another food that a diabetic person should not use is cheese, and caffeine.    Good Luck!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	On accasion.|`|Ee4y7OJzaa	give them diet sodas. they have the same taste and they have no sugar|`|nqcnylFpaa	ya i do why not give one reason why not.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Kool-Aid, Chocolate Milk, and juice pouches are the "bad" things they occasionally get.    I Prefer giving them Gatorade Rain, flavored waters, regular milk, and Crystal Light.|`|eDnWMm3maa	No. He gets a SLIGHTLY chocolatey chocolate milk with his snack in the afternoon. Other than that, it's water and juice|`|vzZE0ktYaa	No way. We drink a lot of water.  He sees his father and I drink water all day, so to him it is normal and he loves it. I usually even mix the juice with water.But at the very least don't give them soda, especially diet soda. Check out this link about aspartame http://www.dorway.com/  Or just go to google.com and type in aspartame. That stuff is no good.
jC1Mdsefaa	You sound very intelligent to me.  I think that what you are saying is the absolute truth!  I never allow my children to misbehave in public.  I too was told this.  (*little did they know I am a mother already*)  I look so young so they had no clue.  Of course I got to throw that in their box of kudos.    I would say that since you already raised a child that you have the full right of thinking the way you do!|`|7CoVXfA1aa	I think it's great that you already have some strong ideas on parenting. You don't need to be a parent to be able to know something about parenting. I think what is important to remember is that when you do become a parent you are likely to break some of the rules you set yourself and engage in some of the behaviours you said you wouldn't. So approaching your parenting with your ideals is fine, as long as you acknowledge that sometimes you will fall short of these and that it doesn't make you a bad parent, just human!  There will be those things that you wont ever compromise (such as abusing your child!) but other ideals may fly out the window at times (e.g. not taking your kid to McDs).  Some parents have no idea still from what I've seen! Attitudes do often change as a parent though -  I had a friend who said when he heard a child cry he used to think "shut that thing up!", after he had kids he'd think "thank God it's not mine!" lol  As long as you know what you're getting into then there's no reason why you can't be clued up, even though you're not a parent!|`|UUpsa35Daa	Nobody, parent or not, is an expert on parenting. Nobody knows everything, understands everything...anybody who says they do is completely full of themselves and needs to be brought down  few notches.    Parents aren't the only ones who know about parenting. Sure, there are certain things you won't fully "understand" until being a parent but when it comes to most things, having steady interaction with children and having your own life experiences will teach you.     I'm 17, no kids and i know spanking won't be an option in my family. Simple as that, it just will not be used. I don't have to have a kid to know that because i'm choosing to not have that option based off of my childhood. I've been working with kids since i was 11, babysitting and working in daycares and being a mother to my boyfriends adopted son so i do have a bit of a handle on some parenting techniques.    Do i think i know everything there is to know? Absolutely not, i definitely still have A TON to learn. But i do have my opinions on certain things when it comes to the parenting world and i do expect to be respected for having them just like other adults do. Respect is a 2 way street.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I never try to judge mothers that I see out and about.  It is really hard to tell what kind of parents they are by just that encounter. My kids know what I expect of them in public but when they are having off days things dont always go as planned.  It really is easier said than done.  I have three kids: 12, 3, 18 months and as each one grows I change my parenting styles.  I realize what works for one may not work for the others.  I also dont believe that there are any experts at parenting.  Yes, some mothers and fathers are better than others, or at least better at somethings, but no one is an expert.  Its good that you have an idea of how you want to raise your kids but dont beat yourself up if they dont behave like you expect, even if they are old enough to know better.  Two things I have learned from my 12 years of mommyhood: Dont let everyones elses time table be yours (baby sleeping in their own room, potty training, etc.) and let kids be kids.     I also helped raise my little sister who is 13 now.  I have to say that I am different with her than I am with my own daughter.  While you cant see that now, your feelings may change about certain things once your children are born.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	A lot of things are easier said then done of course...  but you raised a child that you loved as your own, so you pretty much do and did have a child.. and it wont be any different from one that is your own.    Its the parents fault if they can not control their child...  i was just about to strangle my son in the store today, i always saw little kids running mad in the store an did say i will not allow my child to do that, yet today my son wouldnt stop whining an cryin and runnin in circles around me.... he also thinks he needs something in any store we go to, i was sooo mad.. so we had a long talk and he cant play his nintendo ds for a few days.. he calmed down real quick!  However what im saying is its my fault he did that, well beside the fact he is a hyper 5 year old lol..  but i without really paying attention buy him somethin big or small in every store we go into for as long as i remember, it just kinda clicked to me today when i actually said no an he threw the biggest fit ever..  an now i have to unwind this horrible habbit ive tought him.. ugh
rh9CRcXraa	You've had 5 already,,so you know what's coming,, I think it's completely normal to get freaked about what your body is going to go through.|`|efyp5CaRaa	I'm sure it is. I'm 28 weeks with my 1st and I am nervous all the time. I even work in Obstetrics so I'm around woman being pregnant and having babies all the time. It sounds completely normal to me. I've seen women who have had previous kids and say they are still as nervous as they were with the first.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	yes, i'm having number 5 in april and im still freaked out especially since the last one was 9 1/2 pounds and the stupid nurses wouldnt give me pain relief then it was too late, So this time im more freaked out then i was last time|`|hAuemuWTaa	Oh of course as every birth is hard work and be painful. But it will be easier than the one u had before.|`|eiWy4RiJaa	I am 39 weeks due date feb 15th or any day now i have bad pains all the time , i am really, really scared because i can still remmber the pain of my secound child  9lbs 4oz and that one i had no epidural with him. i dont know what to expect with the labour how to know if i am in actuall labour because  my 1st and 2nd kids  labour pains both started out differently but i guess its gonna hit me  the pain there will be no more time to be scared about it. when the baby wants to come hes gonna come. good luck with your baby and congrats.
2HETgiwgaa	It varies from woman to woman, and if you're breastfeeding that can delay you ovulating and menstruating again.  I breastfed my son and it was a few months (about 5 or 6 I think) before I got a period again.  But, if you have a period, it's a fair bet you have already started ovulating again - you could try charting and/or an OPK if you want to check.  A lot of women notice their periods are different to before they had a baby, so no cramping and light bleeding could be a new pattern for you, or it could just be your hormones settling down again.  Congratulations on the baby - and good luck with getting  2 when you're ready.|`|CRVi3YsOaa	there have been plenty of people that go to their six week post-partum check up, already pg again. Your most fertile time is actually right after you give birth. So you should already be ovulating, just get an OKP (ovulation predicotr kit) and you can see when your fertile days are.
8D6IbrcTaa	Have a steam bath to help with you nose.  Take lenty of vitamins esp vit C as it will decrease your cold symptoms. Hope you feel better soon.|`|FEzmVmFjaa	I had the same kind of bug and I asked my OB what I could take and she safe Sudafed it safe for me and the baby. So I took that and took a steamy shower and that helped alot. Feel better!|`|rh9CRcXraa	I don't know of any over the counter cold medicine you can take while pregnant.  I do know when I was pregnant with my 3rd baby the DR said it was okay for me to use the nose spray Flonase,,but that was 5 years ago,,and Flonase you need a prescription for,,I think you should call your DR and ask him or her what you can do.|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	Just use a humidifier and rub some vicks on your chest. Not really much else you can do. Get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids. You don't want to get dehydrated along with your cold. It's not good for you or your baby! Hope you feel better.|`|efyp5CaRaa	Tylenol Cold and Sinus or Tylenol PM. It's completely safe and helps a lot. Good Luck!|`|n3n4ze4Daa	there is nothing better than a naturall remedy. There is a tea i drank when i was pregnant with my  5th child . chamomile tea. and nasal spray will get all that nasty's out. drink chamomile tea while hot and use nasal spray if u choose or if not just make sure u drink that and cover up ur feet and back and chest.|`|3OHzn5B0aa	my dr. said I can take original sudefed...not PE...you have to get it from the pharmacist but it is otc you don't need a perscription...and you should not take it in the first trimester|`|Cu8svhwAaa	Sudafed and Robitussin are safe.  You can also take Bendadryl at night to help you sleep.|`|QAGhFzFsaa	My doctor told me Tylenol cough and cold... or sinus was ok... I was too afraid to take anything though... I just took a cough drop, humidifier, and Vick's and off to bed I went. Do be careful though, because I let a cold go and it turned into a sinus infection TWICE! I ended up having to go on a Z-Pack... congrats!

vYAfNGmfaa	My niece was a preemie and my sister said its easier cuz they're not as big.    My sister still got an epidural.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Like the other lady said it's not so much the pushing that hurts it's the contraction and no matter how small your baby is you will still have painful contraction . I had an 8.2 l b baby no drugs. The pushing was work but not the painful part it was the last few contration that Hirt like hell . So no matter the size giving birth hurts.|`|2lDQktYjaa	It hurts the same. I had twins, delivered at 35 weeks, little less than 5 pounds each. I was in labor for 3 days bcz of some accident. I heard so many women having their babies while I was waiting on my bed. They would scream like maximum 3 times and the baby was born. In my case, I pushed for 2 hours, and the last hour was just hell. It hurt so much I almost gave up pushing and wanted to die. At some point I felt like they were cutting me to make it easier for the baby to come, or maybe the skin just ripped off, I never asked the nurses what really happened. I had stitches anyways, which hurt me for months. The fact that I had twins is not the reason why it hurt so much, the second baby came out after two little easy pushes, because his big brother already oppened the way for him. My point is, some women have 7-8 pounds babies without suffering too much and others suffer with premiees. It all depends on how your body is made i guess. My doctor told me next time I have a baby it will be much easier. So it also depends if it's your first baby or not.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I have no idea.  I hope you don't have a prem baby as they need so much help in hospital.  Hopefully you will go fullterm.  A friend of mine had a prem baby and had to push for four hours.  Apparenlty it can often take longer as your body is not quite ready to have the baby and hasn't softened enough yet.  So I think it is probably better to go to at least 37-38 weeks before going into labour.|`|eiWy4RiJaa	most people get the epidural to deal with the pains of the contractions when the contractions  get bad and you cant handle it anymore you get an epidural,it really not that bad to push out the baby full term 9lbs 4oz with no epidural, feels like u need to poop really bad and like a big bowling ball stuck there for few minutes till u get it out, so it may be little easier with preemie. i am 39 weeks pregnant and this ones gonna be another 9lb baby|`|yJXX9kLqaa	Personally i think when it comes to giving birth a few pounds more or less probably doesn't make a huge difference its still going to hurt (alot) . But it is SO much better for the baby if its not a preemie|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	its going to feel the same as pushing out an 8lb baby
Y9qhkO1faa	"Right now, only California and New York have restrictions against selling breast milk. But other states are considering legislation to ban the practice." Quote from, http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2007-0... According to this, it sounds like it is illegal to sell your breast milk in California.    And why do some of you find it disgusting? Is cow milk better? Or formula made in factories? Let's not forget about Chinese formula that killed and made ill many, many babies. Human milk banks offer a wonderful and potentially life saving service to babies that are for some reason unable to receive breast milk from their mothers. Google it and educate yourselves before passing judgment.|`|oIFMohfUaa	I tried to find it, couldn't.  I have never heard anything about it being illegal.    They sell just about anything on Craiglist and Ebay...    Good luck~ and I hope money situation gets better.      P.S. you might want to contact the milk banks and get their advice on handling and packaging the milk for transport to whoever buys it!|`|gG8oyymiaa	I would imagine you would have to go threw an agency for that. its not uncommon to sell breast milk. You can make a lot of money off of it actually. Theres a lot of mothers out there that can't produce it. My mother said that i should look into this after I am done breast feeding my own. Still trying to decide if I want to or not.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	Call your local hospital and ask about milk banking and how it works. I know they have milk banks out there, but I'm not sure how it works. I just know that they screen the milk and make sure the milk is safe and stuff like that.|`|IvU7WH8baa	i believe its truly expensive and i believe its legal as long as u go though an agency but it does happen some kids need it and mothers cant produce it. and there are some sick kids that need it and cant get it. i think its a great idea if u do ur homework. its kinda gross but hey if ur baby needs it go for it. and if u can produce it than hey there are sick kids out there.  heres a website u might wanna look at.  http://pc540.blogspot.com/2006/01/got-br...|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	They have breast milk banks your hospital would know more about it and I don't think they will take the milk unless they check you out. But I'm not sure about it. I know I would not buy breast milk from just anyone.|`|2lDQktYjaa	I tried to buy breastmilk online, and I googled a lot, without success. I couldn't find any serious website, I seriously don't know anyone who bough or sold brestmilk. When you search online it seems like lots of people buy and sell because there's so much discussion about it, but I seriously never saw any website actually offering the service. I think you would need to find yourself someone in your area who needs breastmilk, you can't really ship it because it's gonna get spoiled.  It's most likely illegal, only milk banks are allowed. But if you're doing a private transaction with someone, who'se gonna know?|`|4jeqIx6Paa	Thats disturbing !!! would be very nasty from someone else im sorry im not buying no human breast milk! i rather can produce on my own or cant !|`|vcfFQSvTaa	Umm i say eww thats discusting.  it should be against the law. but you never know. the US is kinda  really messed up
1IDSGM71aa	First of all, MAJOR KUDOS to you for breastfeeding! (I'm not saying there's anything wrong with formula because I had to switch to formula for various reasons and I miss breastfeeding SO much and I'm trying to go back.) As far as the pain goes, I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's kind of normal. I had the same type thing happen to me while I was breastfeeding. If you find any tiny lumps (that feel sort of like a pea or something) it could be small clogs, so you'll need to pump or feed your baby ASAP (or jump in a warm shower or something to get your milk to let down) because after a while if a clog goes un-"treated" it could cause mastitis, which from what I hear is very painful. If you get really concerned with it, or if you don't get a good enough answer here to ease your mind, give your OB/GYN a call, or if you have one in your area, a lactation consultant. Good luck and keep up the good work mama!  EDIT: Sorry I'm the only one that answered. I hate it when I post a question and only get one not so helpful answer. You might want to try asking again.
HyknHVV5aa	www.target.com    www.ebay.com    www.kijiji.com    I recently bought this one: http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?... it has the car seat, and stroller in one! Great deal.|`|4TNavgDuaa	www.walmart.com|`|06GF0APWaa	E bay has stuff like that. Oh and have you tried any 2cnd hand stores in your town??|`|fjHpA5oiaa	I would hit the garage sales early Saturday morning. Check the Goodwill and other used clothing stores, too. If you know anyone who has children that have grown out of the stroller stage, they are bound to have unused strollers around somewhere. I know you said the stroller is for a newborn, but I have found umbrella strollers at Wal-Mart and other cheap department stores for no more than $10.00. Good luck!

Also keep in mind that you don't want your kid to be teased because of their unique name
yJXX9kLqaa	To me it sounds kind of like a missed miscarriage. ( I had one last summer) Bascily the baby dies but your body doesn't realize for a while (my body took 9WEEKS!) there no bleeding and there is a positive pregnancy test because your body still thinks the baby is alive. You could go down to the local ER and ask for a vaginal ultra sound, they are better than regular ultra sounds for picking up on stuff like this. I don't mean to freak you out, and i really hope this isn't the case, just figured i'd let you know it can happen.|`|kjOsSmM0aa	Okay, last three questions first.   You should slow down your activity to keep the baby safe. You should never take any medication that says that you should contact your doctor when pregnant... unless your doctor said you could.  A miscarriage will require some bleeding, but if the baby has died in the uterus then the doctor wouldn't be able to get a heartbeat. A test will probably not be negative yet.   I don't know what state you're from, but you'll have to tell your parents and then just apply for medicaid after yours expires.  Hope this helps.  God Bless!|`|0aGTgxONaa	Running is safe, to a point.If your dr oks it, but there is a possibility of injury if you fall.  NEVER take advil. Only Tylenol if you must take something  If u had a miscarriage I think yes if would be a negative test.
paHjJrrdaa	I'm there with ya on the whole trying for a year thing!  I know it's hard for some people and it sucks.  It's hard to say if your pregers or not.  Maybe take an early detection test.  Although it's not that accurate right now, you might find what your looking for if you are pregnant. Just wait another day or so and you should know. Good luck!|`|4TNavgDuaa	Sounds like your pregnant to me. That's everything I had. Try taking a test. If your not pregnant I recommend this site yourdays.com if you never heard of it. They have a Calender that helps you keep track of your days. I try for 2 years until I found this site than I was better at keeping track. I didnt even get to use the calender long cause I got pregnant within 2 months of finding this site. Good luck!|`|ctE1mihuaa	Hmm.. the only way you will know 100% is if you take a blood test, or go to a clinic and take a test its free. Also you can go to a drug store & get a pregnancy test there , and thats the only way you will know if you are pregnant or not.
U9pnPXnpaa	Yes severe headaches are normal.  Some, like the link below, say that people with mono should never be given tylenol.   I know my doctor gave my daughter codeine for her headache but plain codeine without tylenol.      http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/Handouts/in...    It is hard to watch our little ones be so very sick I know.   It helped when she was in a dark room with it very quiet.  Cold cloths helped as well.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	My older brother had mono. His room was always dark and he slept because of the headaches. He was weak from lack of sleep and it was very hard on him. He had mono for six months and got better. It took another couple of months before he was strong enough for sports. Keep lots of fluids, and a good multi vit when he won't eat. Soft boiled egg and toast was my brothers fast food and puree of milk shake with ice cream and fruit was a way to get his attention for food. I remember it was cooling his neck, wrists, and forehead that seemed to help with his headaches. Hope this helps and Good luck.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes, when I was in Junior High...8th Grade. I don't remember having headaches, just extreme weakness and tiredness. If the morphine and tylenol isn't working, there is something wrong. Go back to the doctor and ask for a Cat Scan.|`|819156a741cc08dc5425bd505ec43f1aaa	I had mono as a teen and yes I remember having really bad headaches during that time. Sorry for your kid but make sure they gets tons of rest and liquids. pedialyte would be good for them now.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Yep, i had it when i was a teenager.. it sucked soooo bad!  I thought i was going to die because my head hurt so bad.   It was horrible, i feel so bad for your child :(  No child should have to suffer through mono.. my son is 5 an i hate it when he has a little cold lol..    Thank god its not meningitis!  I would call the doc an see what else they can recommend for the pain, rub her temples for her.. that might help a little or relax her.. poor thing.  GL!
DuLhv7Ajaa	My first two the doc told me to start giving them cereal in their bottles around two months old. My son was in the 100th percentile and my daughter was in the 97th percentile. Neither were fat just really big kids (and they still are.) My breast milk was not enough to keep them satisfied. After I followed my docs advice they were able to nurse, then have a cereal bottle and were both much happier babies.  And don't listen to those people telling you how wrong it is to give them cereal at that age, they've probably never had very large hungry children and had to deal with this issue in their own lives.  And for what it worth my kids are very healthy and still very tall.

Anyway, I gave my baby cereal and fruits and veggies around 3.75-4 months old. I think she was like 15-17 weeks, can't remember exactly. But I just gave her little tastes of a couple of things as a sort of experiment. I won't be giving it to her regularly until she's about 5 months old, maybe 6 months. I personally don't think it's a bad thing to give babies cereal before they're 6 months old. I was given baby food at 2 or 3 weeks and I'm fine, same is true for everyone in mine, my husband's and our friend's families.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	when they became 4 months|`|FYi8nNzcaa	Found this out for you:    Should not give solids before 4 months read on....    When should I introduce solid foods?    The Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding until your baby is six months old. After six months, breastmilk alone doesn't provide your baby with enough nutrients, in particular iron, so other foods are needed.    Waiting until six months to introduce solid foods into your baby's diet will help minimise the risk of her developing adverse reactions to foods and allergies. This is particularly important if you have a family history of allergies, as the incidence of adverse food reactions, allergies and coeliac disease does decrease if you delay weaning until this time.    If you feel your baby needs to start solids before six months, do discuss it with your health visitor first. This is particularly important if your baby was born prematurely. The Department of Health states that solid foods should not be introduced before the end of your baby's fourth month (20 weeks). If you do decide to wean your baby onto solids before six months, there are a number of foods that need to be avoided, such as those containing gluten, eggs, cheese, dairy products, fish and shellfish.

His intestinal track got clogged and he was very constipated, he had to go through xrays and all types of stuff just to find out what was wrong. It was very simple to cure, but he was in alot of pain. I would suggest to wait until at least 4-5 mnths before giing him/her anymore.|`|fFZVo3c8aa	i started my daughter out on cereal at 1 month i gave it to her right before bed every other day and now shes 2 months i give it to her every night before bed in warm formula...i give her 2 tsp in 4oz of formula everyone is diff go with what you feel and plus it made him eat which is what you want and it didnt cause her to be constipated she went regular everyday and still does
Iz5tNA5aaa	All people who are around children in a team/classroom setting need to have background checks.  I would find out who the league reports to in their district and complain there as well.  For example, if it's Pop Warner football your league would report to a Pop Warner district manager to ensure rules were being followed.  Go this route.    I'm in Florida and any coaches, assistant coaches and even the team moms must submit to a background check before they are accepted as volunteers.  If a dad/mom helps out during a practice, there is no way to know, but the people "in charge" should always have a background check.  Every year I go through a background check for baseball (spring) and football (fall) so that I can be team mom for my kids.    I wouldn't let it go.  Like I first said, go to the district level.  Maybe you could also speak to the local police department or even the city management to find out the protocol for this.    Good luck!|`|H2IqzG12aa	I'd be more concerned about the ones you don't know about than the ones you do.  The idea of registering is so that you can keep an eye on him, not to hound him all his life to keep him from ever being a productive citizen.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I can understand being concerned.  However you know he's not a child molester.  Whatever happened was against his wife at that time.  You didn't say how old your son was.  I do however believe that anyone who works w/kids should be fingerprinted and the background check done.  Of course, any charges of him vs. children would and should disqaulify your son.  If the man hasn't acted inappropriately toward any of the team members, I think I would let the matter rest.  Your son is going on to another team.  Go through your legislator to get a law into effect to background check volunteers, teachers, etc to make sure they are safe to be around children.|`|6Oprylquaa	Report it to whom ever you can in the district, AFTER you do more research on the matter. He may be violating his parole he may not, do the work then you will have a better idea of what measures need to be taken.|`|zi9knUCGaa	Dig deeper into his record. Look up your states rules and regs. regarding convicted sex offenders. Does it say on the website if he is on supervison? If so, then contact the probation/parole officer. It may very well be that he is violating his probation.   The commissioner sounds like a real a$$. Not doing background checks on coaches/assistant coaches -anybody that comes in contact with children- is just asking for trouble.   Put everything in writing. Have the commissioner respond in writing or even email. Then go to your local news station's "problem solvers" division and see if they will research this for you. Once the community sees this on the news, I bet you that the rules regarding volunteers will be re-written asap!!|`|5f2e5da7d48269806f35d9ae5290b898aa	I really don't know what you could do other than talk to the president of the association. However, that blows me away that they don't do a background check. I live in Oklahoma, and my husband coached my daughters soccer team. It's made up of all volunteer coaches, and they all still have to have background checks. If they have a record, they can't coach.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	As you say its not the guy himself you object to but the fact that no checks are made.  In the UK (im on scotland) all volunteers have to be police checked by the care commission and no one with a sex offence would be allowed to work with children or vuneralble adults.|`|HVWAq4u9aa	I would make a police report.  Or at the very least, call and speak to someone at the police department in your area.  They'll at least be able to tell you if he's violating any laws or terms he's got to abide by.    As far as "the association" I don't know the answer to your question, but I do want to tell you I agree with you 100%. Registered sex offenders shouldn't be allowed to coach any children's teams.  And they should be screening coaching candidates much better and/or notifying parents if they should decide to hire the coach.  But at least you did your job as a parent.  From now on, I guess you'll just have to check out your kids' coach every year. (and I hope you told every one of the other parent's about  the situation!)|`|1ViGcF3xaa	This is exactly why you shouldn't trust someone else you don't know with the safety of your children.  You have to take it upon yourself to check out people who have contact with your children like you did!  If it was me I would tell every parent I could and maybe even put an ad in the newspaper stating that fact.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	"My concern is the fact that we as parents, putting our children in an organized sport, assume that all proper precautions are being taken when placing our children in a situation"    This is where the problem lies.      If you want to make sure that background checks are performed on the adults volunteering in organizations that your children participate in, then you need to ask about that before signing the kids up for the programs.      If you feel that the Pee Wee Football League should be checking the backgrounds on volunteers, then you should sign on as a volunteer yourself and make those changes from the inside.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	I find it very odd no background check is required for volunteers.  I was a Brownie leader for the girl guides and I had to go through a criminal check (at my own expense) before being allowed to be in the organization. You should lobby for making background checks mandatory for volunteer positions.  Get a petition signed and take it to your local congressperson and get media attention if you can.  To me that is the most effective thing to do.  Having said that now that you know for the time being a background/criminal check is not required then you must be very careful when putting your kids in extra curricular activities and make sure you get to know the coach and even do your own background check on them.  Keep in mind that not every pedophile has a criminal record so it is really up to the parents to get to know the coach and keep a dialogue going with your child to be sure nothing inappropriate is going on.|`|spuz7DvNaa	No felon should be around children. Contact the organization that hired him and tell them you will be notifying every parent WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR CHILD INVOLVED. This organization is careless and dangerous if they do not check people out that will be around children. Predators target venues with children. Most parents will assume in this day and age that people would be checked out before being hired.
f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	Have you tried giving him popsicles?   Some who can't hold down liquids can handle something frozen that goes down more slowly.   Do you think your 1 year old would like something that cold?|`|uW4npxzFaa	Take it into your own hands, tell them he is dehydrated and needs medical attention. This is their job. What is with doctors and nurses not caring like they used too?|`|rhPCJfeuaa	Find the nearest hospital with a pediatric ER.  some hospitals just aren't equipped to admit young toddlers.  Go where they do.  Let them know that he has stopped taking any liquids by mouth and continues to vomit at the age of 1.  They will test him and if he's dehydrated, they will admit him until he can take in an ounce of fluids per hour.  Does he have a fever or diarrhea?  Is he very congested and coughing?  If he's not congested and coughing with a low fever, I would think it's not the flu.  If he has the diarrhea and a high fever it might be Rota Virus.  the diarrhea has a distinctive scent of infection to it.  And it's greenish.
2HETgiwgaa	Congratulations on your pregnancy :-) A company that supplies rhogam says you need to have it during each pregnancy, "because every pregnancy puts the Rh-negative mother at risk of being exposed to the Rh-positive red blood cells of her baby".  They say you'd normally be prescribed a dose at around 28 weeks and then again around 72 hours after the birth (if the baby is Rh-positive).  You need to talk to your doctor about this hun.  Good luck.
sxo9dznQaa	Hate and clinging on to the past is a sin. Try to talk to her, TRY to apologize even if your mad. but if it doesn't work, then F her. Don't talk to her no more. But eventually, you'll get over your hate.|`|VZaqk5CYaa	i would dwell on these things for a long time. and to be honest its not worth it. Vent to someone. like a parent. or vent here online where its not going to back to anyone at the school and make crap worse. but where you can get a 3rd party responce. it does help to talk about things. it really does. but i would say drop it there are a lot of things i wish i would have droped. i wrote letters. but thats way worse cause then they have written things of what you said. and trust me its just worse.     good luck. and just put it behind you. be the bigger person :)|`|efyp5CaRaa	It sounds like it's time to get over it honestly. You should never point out someones wrongs and flaw in an argument because then it will go nowhere believe me. At some point in time you just have to learn how to forgive and forget. Maybe you didn't get to say everything you wanted to, but it was probably for the best because in the end it would have just created even more drama. The mature thing to do is just drop it.
YrK7S8xtaa	i would be mad at you too, if my partner done that i would probably slap him. Why on earth would you bite her breast at any time.|`|bSZK2tVtaa	Well it will teach you not to do it any more.

Apologize and be more careful in the future.  I enjoy it when my hubby nibbles on mine, but I do have to let him know when he's getting a little too hard and he will lighten up.  Maybe you need to work out something like this.  All I do is say owe and he calms down. It works great for both of us.|`|PAwqjxvaaa	well when you are pregnant, women's breasts get very tender and sensitive and hurt to the touch....OUCH! i would have been pissed too, it's like biting your nut a little, would u like that?|`|hAuemuWTaa	We are not a piece of meat if u want to chew on things get a teething ring u baby as baby bite.|`|8c4NySt2aa	lol

r39EDGhPaa	I agree.    Peer pressure isn't a big deal anymore.  And anyone who pressures someone else into doing something is dumb anyway, and anyone who gives in needs a backbone.  But you're right, kids are a lot more open minded than before when peer pressure was "big".|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I guess it depends on the particular group of people, 'cause I know that if I'm at a party and I don't feel like drinking ('cause I'm driving or whatever) people will look at me like I'm no fun or something.    So it's probably similar with younger people.  They'll look at you like you're scared or something, while others really don't care.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	WRONG!!!  That commercial was telling kids to say 'NO' to drugs.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	well, there are different types of peer pressure.  for example, a lot of my close guy friends smoke pot.  ive always wanted to try it, even though theyve never come out and been like "Charlotte! lets toke up!"  see? thats still peer pressure.    (the reason i havent is because i promised my friend that i wouldnt. she has a cousin who REALLY screwed up her life because of alcohol and drugs, and she got started on pot.)|`|xfpJGBfwaa	1.  Everybody has peer pressure.  40 year old teachers have peers, and they pressure each other to do certain things, or not do certain things.  If a 40 year old teacher had a different opinion about adolescents and drugs, they had better keep it to themselves because the peer pressure of teachers says that they must all beat the same drum or be drummed out of their job.    2.  It's not "kids today are open minded" it's "kids are open minded."  I've never met a kid who wasn't open minded about drugs.  I've never met a pusher kid who was a control freak about making everybody else a drug addict.  I've never met a kid who ridiculed anybody for not doing drugs.  I've met some adults who ridiculed me for not doing drugs, as if I was too much of a child to appreciate it.  Often they were doing hard drugs like opium or heroin.  I had the sense to get out of there.  Kids have always been open minded in my experience.    3.  Being open minded is not a bulwark against addiction.  Curiosity killed the cat, and didn't bring it back.  As long as that door is open, curiosity perks, but if someone is rude, like that adult I mentioned, the door closes as soon as you walk away.    Get a copy of the old Dragnet TV show (the black and white one), and find the Drugs episode.  Notice how nothing in the War on Drugs has changed?  Since the 1950's, we haven't changed the way we fight drugs in this country.  Now why is that?  Stupidity, ineptitude or simple lack of caring?|`|0b5OTYbeaa	Peer pressure still exists but, its not as prevalent as the media and dumb movies play it out to be. in most instances the kid will chose to do drugs on his own, no one is pushing him.|`|KoJwe8e9aa	i think the idea of peer pressure is kind of silly.  if anything its probably more of a "bandwagon" mentality, but i think people are smart enough to make their own decisions, esp regarding drugs and alcohol.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Doing anything to "fit in" is a stupid move. You are accountable. Not them.|`|PAwqjxvaaa	exactly...open minded is good.....it's less laid back ya know?|`|47bd091e352a1041ddc990445284a7e2aa	Yes it is.  Stand true and firm to your convictions.|`|r6nQeB0oaa	people usually do not pressure you to do drugs, i just feel left out when all your friends are getting high and you are not.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	??

There are also a lot of horrible horrible effects on you from abortions. You should feel lucky that you still can have a baby after one abortion. Another one and you may not be able to.

If I were you though, I would probably ditch the BF.|`|wdIMPKyVaa	im a single mom before at the age of 20 i got pregnant by my b.f but he don't like to have a son yet so i decided to continue the baby on my own..i was so scared that time because i am still studying but my parent's did not leave me even do they really feel bad about it.now i am very happy because i have a 2 year old son and my father really loves him so much...i am now a ESL teacher i serve my experienced as my motivation right now....|`|Cu8svhwAaa	Keep the baby.  Tell him that you aren't ruining your lives. You are enriching them with a little baby who didn't ask to be created but is begging you to save its live.  Congratulations if you are pregnant.  Abortions are no good for your health or your emotional state.|`|hAuemuWTaa	I say keep it there is  help out there for single mums and if you cant see urself looking after the baby than give it up 4 adoption.|`|9A0xTHS2aa	first of all u hv done a big mistake by havg sex without precaution. but now pls dnt repeat the mistake by keepg the baby. i thk first u should b stable in life n only whn u r able to tk care of the baby both mentally n financially u should give it life.  pls dont delay...  god bless u|`|n3n4ze4Daa	my two first kids had a bad birth dad , so iwas a single mom for awhile.my third childs dad was a mamas boy so ionce again did it alone. i pregnant with my 4th child and knew that it was too much cuz the dad was not going to be there and i wasn't ready for another one so i put up for adoption to a very loving family . he is noe five yrs old and very happy . i married and have a child with and am expecting in a few weeks . it takes two to get preganat but if the feelings not mutual about a baby maybe he should of kept it in his balls! dont be intimidated by his imituraty, go and do what is best for u. killing a baby is never going to be able to be taken back . there is a loving caring family who needs and wants to be completed . or you can take advantage of that love a baby has to offer. if you were given this child its because God wants to bless u ! do the right thing . its not the baby's fault . dump the man not the baby!!!!|`|dwAZSVFHaa	if i were you i would keep the baby, remember a child will always be yours, but men come and go.  he sounds lazy if he has no job, dont kill your baby because  the father didnt want it. its YOUR baby.     women say they are raped and need an abortion? rap is an excuse, its not the babies fault someone was raped, why kill a child? why take it out on them? did you know that for every child aborted there would have been 10 YES 10 loving families that would have given it a life.     teen girls may say they are too young for a child, well if you are to young to have kids, then dont have sex, and plus its called let the child live and adopt it out.       and overpopulation is a HUGE terrible excuse, why would someone kill a child because there are too many people?    and because the father didnt want a child is another excuse, why kill a child because your man didnt want one? that shows both immaturity and selfishness.       a babies heart starts beating at 22 days old, and by that time brain waves start, a unborn baby has,eyes,toes,fingers,blood, a brain and if its not alive, then why and how can it kick its moms tummy form the inside? its not a blob of cells its a child!! its a child not a choice!!       and heres some thing abortion can do to the women that have them.    first off, in some rare cases, abortion can cause the woman to die.    abortion causes breast cancer, and sometimes part of the baby can remain inside of the woman,making her hemmorage and can ruin her tubes, and her chances of having a normal child, or even having any child.     abortion causes POST ABORTION SYNDROME, and yes it IS REAL. some women have even killed themselves over having an abortion, women regret and have to live with it for the rest of thier lives.       heres what abortion can do to the fathers.     abortion can cause POST ABORTION SYNDROME, to fathers also, remember, the father helped make the child,a nd fathers DO have hearts. some have even commited suicide, along with needing counseling, and some have even went as far as divorcing thier wives for having an abortion.       abortion also hurts many other people, including a family that would have adopted the child. and abortion hurts family members of the woman and child, such as aunts of the child, uncles,grandmothers and grandpas.      abortion takes away a child chance at life.    its takes away a family who cannot have kids's chance of getting to raise a child.     it takes away the mother happiness and in some cases even her life.    its takes away a fathers dream to have a child.        IM PROUD TO BE PRO-LIFE!!!
Cu8svhwAaa	When your period is late of course.  But if your coloscopy is before then, definitely mention it to the doc so he/she can do a test before the test. I'm not sure that is a safe thing to have while pregnant.|`|HyknHVV5aa	It takes usually about 2 weeks for the pregnancy hormone to show up in your urine from the date you conceived. So if you conceived during Jan 18-24th, lets say you conceived on the 24th, the best time to do a home test would be February the 8th.
YjE0AJSnaa	It sounds like you really care about your family, but you have to start thinking about yourself. I moved in with my bf after high school and we're now married. You are not her mom and shouldn't worry that much about it. And she is still just a kid so she is always going to be arguing with your mom. So i think you've been a referee long enough go have fun and think about ur future too. Ur sis is preg so she is not gonna help u get through school.|`|upK8oN2oaa	You have to do what is best for you. I have a similar role to you in my family. I think if you really love your boyfriend then go. It is your mothers job to look after her daughter not yours.     You need to give your future the best possible chance. Perhaps if they don't have you to fall back on others will 'step up' and be the people they are supposed to.    My advice: Go with the boyfriends family.|`|CqJnT2Oqaa	Perhaps you could stay with her until she has the baby, and then move in with your bf?  If you're still worried about her being at home, then maybe when you get a house of your own she could move in with you if your bf didn't mind.  Since you're almost 18 you should be able to get a job and move out on your own soon.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Your happiness should come before making your sister happy.  You've obviously been there for her for a long time and she knows you love her.  SHE got pregnant, not you.  She shouldn't be holding you back.    Move with your boyfriend's family if that is what you want to do.  Your sisters pregnancy should not even play a role.  She got herself knocked up, of course her mom is going to fight with her a lot... she did a stupid bullshit thing which is stressing her mom out as well.  You don't need to be around that either, none of that is your fault.|`|3E6Kz2ygaa	You pretty much answered it yourself, hun. You don't want to be the mediator anymore, so don't.    Don't chase after James just because you want to run away. He might think he's being used as a scape goat, which will hurt him; running away from your problems to him. Moving in to a place with James is shaky ground especially if you're not really sure where he stands with you. He's going to have to like you a lot more than he does now for you to consider moving in with him. If you choose to live with James, it might be dangerous because you would be reliant on him and family to be there for you and/or provide for you. Which ultimately, is his role in a marriage.     If you are going to be with him, and you're serious, marry him or get out of his life, since he's moving far away. You guys don't sound that serious. but, I may be wrong. Just don't move in with him on such thin ice. It's also dangerous, just in case you get pregnant, There is no marriage to support a baby between you and James. Moving in with the guy makes it easier to sleep with him, and you don't want the same thing happening to you that happened to your sister.    Now would be the best time to think about yourself, or you might never get a chance with the growing baby, and being and aunt, you will be assigned responsibility with the child. Where do you want to go in life? Do you want to include your sister's mistake of having a child out of wedlock? Although, it's kind of inevitable, and would be unkind of you to leave since she looks up to you so much, and because she's so young. You just being there might help your mom and her bond again. Also, this may be a time where it is solely between your sister and your Mom. It seems like your Mom may be bitter about having the responsibility of taking care of a baby shoved upon her so suddenly.     It's true, you've come to a real crossroad. It's time to really think about yourself, your growing family and your future. I suggest getting a job (if you don't already have one) and moving in with a best friend that's a girl, and maybe got to school to provide better for yourself. What do you want to do for the rest of your life?    Last August I made the biggest decision of my life. I flew to Florida to marry and move into my husband's house with his parents and brothers. My mom thought i was crazy and she never let me hear the end of it. Everyday, up until the last day before I left, she insisted that I was going to make the biggest mistake of my life. And she was also bitter because I left my responsibility helping her watch my brother (6) while she worked. (Mind you, there are other people at home who watch him too...)     And, Nope, she's wrong. Im still here in Florida happily married. and by the way, I'm only 20. (I moved only because God led me to do so.)    A solution might be to live close by of you can afford to move out, and visit often and offer to provide help to your sister. She's 15, for God's sake...    Or, maybe just stay put if you can't afford it, or jobless, but try to move out once getting a job. (good luck trying to in this horrible recession)    You should put yourself first because you should be doing something more with your life than watching over your little nephew/niece. Your family should support your choice to put yourself first.    But sometimes your family really needs your help and that should be okay too. Just make sure you don't have an attitude taking care of your sister's baby if you choose to stay with them. Also, Investing in your sister may be very rewarding. It's your place to decide what's important.    You should demonstrate your willingness to support your family, while also thinking about yourself.    Keep in mind that your Mom and sister might make you feel guilty for leaving, if you choose, because of the responsibility, but in the end they should be happy that you are beginning your own life, also appreciating that you are not completely unreachable.    What it comes down to is what you are willing to sacrifice for them, and balancing that with what you are going to do for yourself and the your future.    You could choose to stay with your mom and sister, and that would be fine if you're not exactly ready to be out on your own yet. Just keep in mind that time ticks away fast, and you don't want to find yourself 10 years from now sitting at home watching your little niece/nephew.    Always be making constructive, little steps towards what you plan to do next with your life. Pray to God about what you should do. Let him guide you if you're really lost. Sorry for such a crazy-long Answer.  Take care and God Bless you.|`|UPVJ6Sj2aa	ok another long story. my gf and i got together on my 18 birthday we knew each other for a couple years in high school but then i mover 1100 miles away so she moved up we were living together for a few months when we found out her parents were getting divorced (by the way her 15/16 yr old sis was still down there) so we both took a semester off school and went down there, only to find out that she couldnt help the situation at all that there was just too much hostility in the house her sis has issues with her dad, and now her mom moved out and wont let her sis come live with her cuz she is selfish and wants to have fun with her new bf. so after all the depression and anger her dad was giving out and her sister just locking herself in her room it was tearing u our relationship so we decided that if we wanted us to work we couldnt b in this hostile house so we moved back up and are doing great. you situation is of course different and maybe it sounds selfish what we did but in the end you have to do what is right for you and the one you love. (we have been together over 2 years now)
ZejwYamhaa	Depends on when you took the pill? Usually they are not affective after 48hours after intercourse. The morning after pill is an emergency contraception and as everyone should know, no contraception has a 100% success rate. The morning after pill acts both to prevent ovulation or fertilisation and possibly post-fertilisation implantation of a blastocyst. The pill may have not worked because implantation had already occurred, (the pill is ineffective after implantation has occurred) or because the drugs failed to prevent ovulation or fertilisation. The morning after pill has a success rate of 75% (that does not mean that 25% of women who have unprotected sex around the time of ovulation get pregnant).|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	because it's not 100% effective.|`|FXPTeTcPaa	It's not 100% even if taken in the first 24 hours.

t9FCNQtDaa	Fitted diapers such as the Drybees bamboo fitted or pocket diapers are usually less bulky than a prefold.     Also, you can try folding the prefold differently. I use the "twist" fold method on my daughter a lot. Just put the baby on the diaper, pull it up between her legs and then twist the top half of the diaper. It'll look kind of like a bow tie with her sitting on half of the tie and the top half across her tummy (pictures in the articles section of my web site below).    Since you have already invested in wool covers, the most cost-effective method would most likely be fitted diapers. BumGenius Bamboo are nice, as are several other brands.|`|kzyEuRroaa	Prefolds tend to be that way, as you're folding about 2 yards of fabric between their legs.  Try the twist fold, that may lessen bulk, also as she grows into the size more they will be less bulky.  If you're wanting trimmer, you may want to switch to fitteds or other styles, as they are made to fit and not to fold.  My son is 7 months old, and some of the diapers he has make him look so bow-legged it's hilarious.  He also has a hard time rolling from back to belly- maybe too much diaper (or too much baby fat, who knows lol)|`|S6Kb2VU9aa	The wool cover is also adding to the bulk -  I would recommend using the wool cover for nightime, and using a Bummis cover during the day. They are lightweight and add no bulk.      Prefolds tend to be bulky - you could always cut and serge them to your babies shape if you are handy with a sowing machine. Remember though that your baby will grow into the diapers nicely.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I love prefolds too, but yes they are HUGE lol!  I do the twist fold as well and it seems to help.  If you want, you can buy some fitted or contoured diapers to put under the cover; they are trimmer.  I like my Swaddlebees one size organic velour, and my Baby Beehinds one size bamboo.   :)|`|1IDSGM71aa	I agree with what the others have said. I'm not cloth diapering yet (we're about to order some in the next week or two), so I just want to thank you for asking this because I was considering prefolds. From what I've read while researching cloth diapers, prefolds do seem to be the bulkiest. Good luck, sorry I'm not any help I just wanted to thank you for asking this because I was going to ask something like this.|`|SBZOVEueaa	it is completely normal that they look as if they can not move their legs - my daughter was the same way - then about 3-4 mos they looked better - my daughter learned how to crawl in them and now is learning how to walk in them - it is just how they look on a very small baby - nothing to worry about -     you can use flat folds when so tiny (i used the kite fold) and it helped a little - it is just that the babies are so small anything looks big on them -
HyknHVV5aa	Well, I think you should talk to her teacher and ask if anything is happening at school. If she is getting teased, maybe she doesn't want to tell you out of fear of the teasing getting worse (the whole "you ratted on us" thing from the bullies). If you speak to the teacher and she/he say they haven't noticed anything, ask them to keep an eye on her for a few days and report back to you, and make your daughter go to school. Maybe then they will notice teasing in the school yard or what not. If they say nothing is going on, you should sit your daughter down and explain to her that she has to go to school unless she is actually sick. Maybe she just wants to hang out with you alone (does she have other siblings that take up your time?). Explain the "kid who called wolf" story to her and explain if she pretends she's sick all the time just to hang out with mom that when she is actually sick you won't believe her and end up sending her to school which wouldn't be fun.   If after speaking to her teachers, having the teacher watch her for a week, and their is no teasing, the best thing you can do is explain to her about lying about being sick is going to backfire, and send her to school. I know it's hard to do when she is puking, but if she can smile after she's puked because she is not sick, tell her to change and she is going to school. Once she realizes you aren't messing around she will hopefully stop pretending to be sick.|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	You need to talk to her teacher and see if you can get any feed back.  Does she interact with other kids in the classroom well? Does she play with other kids at re-cess.  Where does she sit in class and who does she sit next to. Are there any bullies in the class, on the playground.  How is her behavior towards the teacher in class?  As a parent of a 9 year old I learned from the beginning that you have to show interest in your child by asking a lot of questions and you would be amazed as to how the teachers are willing to answer your questions and willing to work with you to make sure your child succeeds in school.  Express your concern to her teacher and I am sure she will be willing and more than happy to help in the situation.  When parents don't care, teachers don't care, but if you show that you care then they are happy to help.  I had a teacher tell me this because I am one of the few parents that communicate with her on a regular basis. I also work an educational company that hire retired teachers and I've learned quite a bit as to what to expect in schools and classrooms.|`|Bmqcva3daa	uh because school sucks butt >.>|`|MQg3mBibaa	She might have a crush on a boy, and he doesnt like her back, or someone might be bulling her badly. You should talk to her teacher(s) and see whats going on.|`|c55O7jqXaa	This screams pysch evaluation. Has she seen someone else throwing up and getting their way? She is clearly showing you that something is wrong in her life or at school. I suggest having a meeting with the Principal and Teacher and find out what is going on during the day at school. I would also go in and watch her while she is at school without her knowing.     I would also get her a pysch. It sounds like something is more deepseated here that needs immediate attention.     Going to Dad's= hummm. something going on in that environment that you don't know about? Things being said or done. I would check and snoop around. It is not normal for a child to vommit like this and expecially a ounger child. Older kid maybe.     She needs to be seen by a docor asap and you need to find out and demand to know what going on before this really gets out of hand and she starts vommiting more and more and then she can't stop when she is upset.|`|HVWAq4u9aa	Well, I have to say, I'm a little appalled by some of these answers.  Your child's being molested?  Get her to a psych?  Oh my god.  Let's leave the most drastic possibilities for last and be rational people!    First, check with her teachers.  Ask how she's getting on in school.  Do they see her playing with friends/talking to kids at lunch/does she seem to be having fun during class or at recess/etc.  Tell the teacher what's going on...ask her opinion.  If you don't find out what you're looking for there, consider your child.  Think about her overall behavior lately.  Have you noticed any other changes in her behavior?  I must admit that throwing up is a little drastic for her, but believe me...she could have very well gotten the idea from another kid at school.  Maybe little johnny was told by his big sister that it'd get him out of school...you see where I'm going.  I will tell you too, that around that age of 7-10, kids do go through a phase where they don't like to be scheduled.  They've been in school for a few years now, and they're bored with it now.  Having to do classwork EVEN when you don't want to.  Only getting 15 minutes for recess!  Getting up early!  Of course it's not fun anymore.  It's not a very far stretch to say they might try and come up with an excuse to get out of it.  And remember to talk to her dad too.  Is he a lot more strict with her possibly?  Does she have chores or something like that to do there that she may not like to do?  Just do some investigation...I'm sure you'll see the answer.|`|WBorc6Btaa	I think you need to contact the teachers there and make sure she is making friends and not being bullied. Bullying is horrible but it can be as sutble as leaving someone out of an activity and making them stay by themselves.   Could the teachers be putting too much stress on her with homework or class performance. That's another factor that could be at play.  I think you need to gently question your daughter until you find out what the problem may be.|`|qQxmRxA0aa	OMG! It sounds like your precious child is being molested. Keep in mind molestation isn't necessarily sexual. It's just some sort of physical touch/bother. I truly believe someone is hurting her. You as a parent have the responsibility to go up to your child's school, demand a parent/ teacher conference with all of her instructors, and maybe take a couple days off work and sit in class with your child. Monitor your child's surroundings and how other kids interact with her. Then one day sneak up on her while shes at recess to see whats really going on. If someone is bothering her (which probably is true) press charges, and home school your baby. Remember, shes only a child once, so be the best Mommy you can be; she'll thank you later.
i2nCISQtaa	i too have been ttc and i have irregular periods. when i stress out my period comes out brownishy pink, so it could be a possible implantation bleeding or just a stressed out period.    good luck ttc =)|`|l0edsGtcaa	Sure does sound like it's the time!

Be careful that you don't become overweight because you run the risk of getting gestational diabetes.  Eat a number of very small meals throughout the day (say between 6 and 8 meals) and this should curb your hunger.  Just make sure the meals are healthy and small.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	just try not to eat  alot of junk food because they have empty calories that provide no nutrition for you or baby|`|PAwqjxvaaa	i'm more hungry too, and i'm about a month in...i think it's cuz we're pregnant, makes us hungrier cuz we have another body to feed basically|`|4TNavgDuaa	I found myself to eat more if I was bored or not doing anything.

But the only way to be sure if you are eating too much is to check your weight.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Apparently you only need 200-300 extra calories per day when you are pregnant which equates to a bowl of cereal and milk.  So if you are eating way over an extra bowl of cereal then I'd say you are probably eating a little too much.    Generally it pays to go for low GI foods like whole grain breads and cereals and vegetables and fruits and makes sure you have a little bit of protein at every meal (even just some nuts) and that should make the food stay in your stomach longer and help you avoid snacking all the time.  If you do need to snack - choose fruit first before going for the chips and biscuits.  It pays to eat well as you can end up with a big baby to push out if you eat too much sugar and too many refined carbohydrates (white bread etc).    Hope this helps!|`|2HETgiwgaa	Everyone is different - But, your doctor should be able to give you a guide about what is normal for someone your size to gain over the course of your pregnancy.  If you try to stick to healthy foods - lots of fruit and vegetables, light on the fats, etc - you should be able to feel full without having to worry about gaining "too much".
2HETgiwgaa	It sounds normal to me - I usually go to the lotion-like CM, then sticky before AF.  If it's lotion like, the site I chart on describes CM as "creamy".  The most fertile is the "egg white" (like it suggests, it's like egg white, and it should be stretchy) - sperm survive best in this type of CM.  The next is watery (also sperm friendly); then creamy (less friendly) and sticky (the least sperm friendly).  You might also find times, like after AF where you have none.  For more info, and if you're interested in charting for yourself to help you pinpoint the five or so most fertile days each cycle - try a site like fertilityfriend.com.  Good luck and baby dust to you.|`|XZlBUaN3aa	Im no expert but I've read numerous places that one of the reasons some women don"t conceive is because they don't really know when they ovulate and it may be possible that you are ovulating now. But I don't know. Double check. Or you could just be extra juicy. my cervical mucus is the same ALL the time. It never changes. Good luck and lots of Baby Dust.|`|BaXruEcqaa	http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/cervic...    This link will explain everything to you about CM.
M1gL4Jd6aa	The creamy stuff is after ovulation apparently.    If it is clear and slippery then you are ovulating.  It doesn't matter how much fluid you have, just the consistancy apparently.  It goes from very thick like clear egg yolk just before ovulation, then thinner and clear during ovulation and then back to the creamy stuff you have at the moment. Then you get your period and the cycle starts again.  You can time sex from anytime after your period until the fluid starts to go creamy.  Or just have sex every second day and you will eventually get pregnant.     Try to have fun trying with your partner instead of worrying too much about cervical fluids!!!!
f8epBxFOaa	of course you can be i had absolutely no symptoms at all.... just take a home pregnancy test|`|5nfqY9T7aa	If you had unprotected sex, there's a possibility. Even w/out symptoms.|`|yJXX9kLqaa	Anything is possible, but i doubt that you are pregnant based on the timing. If you don't get your period by later this week then i would buy a cheap test.|`|kjOsSmM0aa	Do a home pregnancy test. Every pregnancy is different and some women don't feel a whole lot of symptoms while others may feel them all. I'd do a test and go from there.  God Bless!|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Take a pregnancy test.  It is the only true way to know for sure.  If it is negative and you still haven't got your period in a weeks time, take another one.  Good luck!|`|xo1Lbui5aa	I'm almost in the same situation as you, except I only have one symptom.  Tomorrow, I'm going to go buy a pregnancy test and check though.  You should go buy one too.  And to answer your question, yes you can have no symptoms.  My aunt didn't know she was pregnant until she went into labor. =S|`|lCWIYPLtaa	i am guessing you meant to write supposed to get your period 31st. you can test 7days after a missed peroid. get a test. if you had unprotected sex then yes there is always a chance
DuLhv7Ajaa	I had the same thing happen to me too. I allowed to go on too long before I went to the doctor. It was so bad that I had a 70 day period, a week off and then a 40 day period. I was exhausted and became anemic. When I finally went to the doctor, she ran a few test and found that I had a major imbalance in my estrogen levels. She put me on birth control for a month and that completely fixed the problem. The very next month I got pregnant with my oldest son!!   Don't wait, trust me, it can get worse, go see your doctor.|`|XZlBUaN3aa	Is it possible it could be stress? I hate to say it because I hate hearing it but try to see a doctor. I know I need to. I just had a period for 3 weeks.
xIHjqiOxaa	babies need there sleep and therefore are usually pretty good at sleeping through alot. so i wouldn't worry about training him or her to sleep through noise. when my babies sleep i like putting on the fan for some background noise so the other kids won't wake them up. babies will sleep when the need to sleep regardless of the nosie level (to some extent)|`|ysJA71Bpaa	Usually milk helps, and also walking around while humming.      I don't know about you but milk helps my little girl.    try putting the tv or raidio on to drown out noise so it keeps her from waking up too.|`|4kfljeIGaa	That depends on the individual baby, but like some of the previous posts said, babies can be notoriously inconsistent sleepers.  My daughter could (and in fact, did) sleep through heavy rock music one night and then be woke by a dropping pin the next.      What I recommend is to try to establish a bedtime routine.  It doesn't matter so much what you do, just that you do all of it in the same order more or less every night.  You could start with a story, then give her a bottle, then brush her teeth, then cuddle before bed.  Ours usually goes as follows: milk, then diaper change, tooth brushing, lotion application and baby massage while putting on the 'jammies, followed by singing and cuddling, then prayers.  You can try different sequences and see what your child seems to prefer.  Obviously you want to avoid anything that will get him or her more riled up, such as playing right before bedtime.      Hope that helped you!  Good luck!
xFcvh2KKaa	You should see if you could get someone to take you and your friends to the movies and go see a movie that just came out.   Then, just go to the park and chill out and play around or go home and borrow somebody's rockband to play at your house.   Then have everyone sleepover and maybe make brownies or cookies? There's a lot of fun activities you can do at home and especially at a slumber party! (truth or dare etc etc.)  As long as you have your good friends with you, it will be fun, garunteed!|`|p3GZERIsaa	Ice skating then a dinner out? :]|`|kWPvBwkSaa	aww well good luck to your dad! talk to your mom and ask her if she would rather you stick around the house or be out. if she wants you around the house and it's warm, do something outside- play basketball or softball or something, go for a walk, etc. if it's cold, hang out inside. watch movies, eat popcorn, other good food =], wrestle (  me and my friends did a lot of that on my 14th birthday), take lots of pictures, all that good stuff. if your mom wants you to go somewhere, be a kid and have a skate party haha! it'll be a blast! or go walk around the mall and hit a movie or something. just having your friends around you will be fun.|`|SiNzpgEwaa	It seems like most people just invite some friends over, you know, have a barbecue, hang out and do what you guys enjoy, maybe video games or a pickup basketball game, then prepare a couple movies to watch, and then maybe have them spend the night. From prior experience, I've found having great food is most def a necessity. This can be one of the least expensive ideas, and yet it can be enjoyable.
x6IyESABaa	I suggest you change doctor, get a second opinion. Sometimes they might miss the birthsac. Also depending on the equipment that they are using. Some hospitals use high definition ultrasound machines instead of regular ones.    All the Best!|`|yJXX9kLqaa	I know that it is really hard but try to relax a little. If i had to take a wild guess i would say that you are probably 5-6weeks pregnant and not 7weeks but even if you are seven weeks then it is still possible to not see the baby on an US.|`|YyX0EJDRaa	I can only wish you the best, and hope your baby is safe. Don't lose hope.
rE15gSFraa	Your daughter is one year old, she really should not be watching any TV of any kind, educational or not. She is a baby and the first five years are the most formative and important. Personal interaction with your child is far more important, so get her interested.  Reading to her can be a great time, buy or better yet make some puppets to go along with the book, act the plot out, use characters, change voices and intonation in your voice.  Build a puppet show stand, better than a TV and you can both use your creativity while you paint and decorate.  Children, esp. younger kids, love to get involved with any art project. Other ideas, have a pajama jumping party.  Put on your jammies, put on a music CD, and bounce around adn dance, do this for about 10-15 minutes, then change music to slow soft music, and cool down in "slow motion". Then she'll be ready physically and cognitively For a bedtime story, crawl into bed together and read a book.  At this age, she will want to hear the same bedtime book over and over again. Good luck to you.  Enjoy this magical time with your baby.|`|1ILYNExFaa	I had the same problem with my toddler. We let her watch The Wiggles which encouraged her to dance all over the living room and one day she learned how to turn the TV on by herself which snowballed into her thinking she had to turn it on anytime it was off. I solved the problem by plugging the TV into a surge protector which I sat on top of the entertainment center. Flip the switch and the TV didn't turn on. She gave up after a few days of it not working when she pushed the button and now she actually brings me her DVD asking me to watch it instead of insisting on it herself.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	Sounds like you recognize this as a problem, which I think it is too.  One year old is way too young to be a couch potato and addicted to TV.  If there is a playroom you two could go to that does not have a TV in it, you could set up camp there and play.  Try a myriad of toys, easy puzzles, blocks, stuffed animals, books, balls just about anything.  If you have a portable CD player, bring that along and play kids music.  That's exactly what my Wife and I did and our daughter really enjoyed it.  TV for a one year old should be limited to somewhere between 0 hours and 1/2 hour.  If you need a few minutes to do something where you need her still, that shouldn't be a problem, but I'd really limit that too.  TV is a cancer on developing brains, contrary to what Disney and the folks at the baby Einstein division will lead you to believe.|`|637SBLmIaa	turn it off.. set a timer for  her to watch 30 min of TV only. .and that it..that what we have to do with our kids..if not they would watch it all day long|`|Irdj2KAFaa	Believe it or not, she will eventually become board of the TV. I would become concerned if she was 2 or 3 and still 'LOVES' the tv as much as she does at 12 months.    My wife and I sometimes wish we could get our 3yr old to watch cartoons when we need him to. :o)    I also wanted to add that I'm not condoning TV in any way. As your daughter continues to grow, she'll become interested in other activities you introduce, slowing the TV watching process. Be careful of how much TV you watch as she will no doubt want to be just like mommy.     I disagree with about the Baby Eisenstein comment from another poster. My 3yr old learned how to count to 20, and his entire alphabet from watching educational DVD's.|`|uX5hO3d8aa	She's 1 and Noggin is stimulating her brain in ways that are difficult for you to reproduce. At this age, too much TV shouldn't be an issue as long as the shows are appropriate and you aren't ignoring her (which it sounds like you're not).    At 1 there's not much else that she can do and understand. Try taking her to the park or to the zoo or even to the mall when it's not too crowded. Find other ways to stimulate her brain and fire those neurons.|`|5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	break the TV naaa, just old fashioned dicipline & tougher rules should work|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	remove the TV you are an adult|`|xIHjqiOxaa	somehow make the tv unavailable to her except at certain times in the day when YOU say its ok. just tell her no if she asks and give her other options of things to do. she's one, she needs you to tell her no when its appropriate. she will probably always want to watch tv over reading or playing.. thats just how most kids are. she'll probably whine and cry for it but eventually she'll stop and realize playing or reading is more fun than crying.|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	Distract her with other activities, take her out for a stroll in the neighborhood. Give her toys to play with. Do more interacting activities instead of letting her just watch tv. And sure it's easier to let her watch tv but she's ur child don't let her be a couch potato already, and if it comes down to it get rid of the tv.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Just tell her one show a day. Get her interest into the computer. I sure noggin has a web-sit with activities for her age. Buy her book from Characters from noggin. Try fingerpaint and art activities something that she will think is cooler than Tv.|`|vM5f3WwNaa	remember who is the boss you or your 1 year old. My children learned how to turn the tv on so i put the tv up higher so they couldnt get near it. they get to watch tv a bit right now but soon there in kinder and childcare so they wont be around it much. the trick is not to turn it on and get her interested in other thigsd not just books, but maybe taking her to the park, or to playgroups
n2O0NwR6aa	Think of it this way: if your daughter loved to eat ice cream, would you give it to her whenever she wanted it?  Or let her eat as much as she wished?  Of course not.  You'd let her know that it's a special treat; great to be eaten once in a while, but not whenever she has a craving for it.  And one bowl at a time.  If she started reaching for it all the time, you'd put it away and tell her that now is not the time for ice cream.      TV is no different.  Choose a few shows that she enjoys, and let her watch them.  But once they're over, the TV goes off.  If she tries to turn it on when the selected shows aren't on, just tell her, "No, Noggin isn't on right now.  It's time to do something else."  Direct her to some other activities, and do them along with her, so she'll learn that reading or coloring or playing outside is just as much fun as watching TV.|`|HyknHVV5aa	Look into buying this Tv Timer: http://www.gizoo.co.uk/Products/AvCommun...|`|TyZ3OX0Oaa	Studies have proven that for each hour of TV that infants watched, they knew on average six to eight fewer words.     See attached link for the entire article on this study.     Unplug the TV.|`|5HwgJHutaa	sounds like you're doing every thing right just keep it up,let her watch her noggin its educational,keep up with the reading and play when she's interested...she's still only one after all and as she gets older make play dates for her so she could play with children her age.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	why not put the plug on a timer so it comes on for one or two of her favourite shows but can't be turned on by her at other times...she will soon get bored of a blank screen :)  Good luck :)|`|G50ucmllaa	She's one!  Turn it off, unplug it, take her in the other room and get out some toys.  Good God,  I hate to so cruel, but act like a damn parent.  What on Earth will you do when she is 15 and not getting her way?|`|7HhWPKrAaa	Kids programming isnt so bad anytime of the day. I would say its ok for an hour to an hour and a half of tv for your kid. IF your kid likes dora the explorer or sesame street, its good to get those books for her.|`|Db5ntACOaa	i personally am not a father or even a parental figure of any children, but to me the most logical answer would be to try to get your daughter interested in other activities. though i realize this could be difficult considering she is so young but maybe you should try to get her involved in more outdoor activities whether it just be taking her with you to retrieve the mail or something a little more complex like feeding the family pet. though these are not very time consuming children especially young children crave to learn. that's what they are doing 24 hours a day and for something as simple as this just might do a lot for a child. it may take time but she would get used to these things and begin to enjoy them and look forward to them. if she refuses you could try educational shows and movies.|`|P8bluetcaa	First and foremost she's 1 Y.o and a 1 y.o is the kin o a sweet and innocent kid who trust whatever people say .just divert her mind by saying "Hey wanna new toy!?" etc.,. and im sure she would kick the habit of 2 much TV  wish u all D best|`|HVWAq4u9aa	She's 1.  Just unplug the tv.  Better that you do it now, while she can't complain and whine.  It will be much harder if you end up with a 4 year old addicted to tv watching.  And when you're trying to interest her in other stuff, remember: 1 year olds have very short attention spans. She's not likely to listen to you read a book more than 1 minute or even play with the same toy for longer than a minute or two.  Just offer her plenty of different toys to choose from (a toy box she can access on her own is best) and sing songs with her here and there.  Roll around on the floor with her...just anything that makes her happy at the moment.  She's at an easy age for entertaining.|`|aSKsDtwLaa	The remote can go out of reach and you can put a clear plexi shield over the buttons on the front if she can reach those.  You are learning the first rule of Parenting.      Rule 1:   Say no.  Mean it, don't say sorry, and don't change your mind no matter how much the baby cries.  You must remember you are doing what is best.  When my son told me I was the "meanest Mom!", I smiled and said, "really?  I used to say that to my Mom, and she was right, so I must be on the right track myself."|`|UrrRgmDwaa	well a book doesn't compare to the flashing lights and sound of TV. You need to take the TV away for a little while a week or more. Just unplug it and tell her it's broken. If you need a break it can magically be fixed. This is renew her interest in other toys. I read a study once that said that TV watching before age 2 increases a childs rate of ADHD. Kids who play with the TV in the background also play with each toy for a shorter amount of time and become bored faster. Just a little motivation for you.|`|Tvq32ptlaa	The logical answer has been given, repeatedly.  Turn off the TV and unplug it so she can't turn it on herself.  She will eventually learn and ween herself of the "craving"    Will it be hard?  Absolutely!!!  Will she get over it? Absolutely!!!  You understand that she needs limits and you need to determine what you feel is long enough for watching and stick with it.    I would suggest checking with your local public library and see if they have child/toddler/infant programs.  Ours has different ones geared for age groups on different nights of the week.  Maybe being engaged with other children in the library will help encourage her to get into books more.    Good Luck!!
kjOsSmM0aa	You were probably pregnant since November. Some women produce less of the hormone needed for the positive at the beginning pregnancy. This means that it just won't come out positive until that level comes up later in pregnancy. You should maybe tell your doctor about the bleeding during intercourse. By the way, now that you're sure you're pregnant, go to an OB-GYN right away.  God Bless!|`|n3n4ze4Daa	that last tiny period was like ur last sooooo, start counting weeks from the 27th of december and make sure you take vitamins. u see your body cleaned itself out on thet last tiny period so your probably 7 to 8 weeks pregnant. congrats!!!!!!!|`|6avKnzkoaa	Your doctor will be able to make an estimation for you based on LMP. So your last period (when it began). Then later, they'll probably do an ultrasound to do a more accurate estimation based on its measurements.

Zb0WIXrlaa	I know its easier said than done... but... It will be okay!! The doctor is keeping a close eye on it, and trust me - she will still be gorgeous. Don't beat yourself up for one more second! There are some excellent products out there to help with skin scarring. Not saying that they will be miracle treatments, but it can't hurt.    I recommend: Pure 100% shea butter or 100% aloe vera. Also, I know there are tons of products out there to specifically target scars. One that I wholeheartedly recommend is the Arbonne RE9 body serum and body lotion duo. A girlfriend of mine had a white, raised scar on her body and it is now no longer raised and it is much, much MUCH less noticable. The duo is expensive, like $90, but I know there are lots of Arbonne consultants on here who would help you out. I don't work Arbonne anymore, but I will still say that yes this product duo is very very good.      ALSO- spf of course. The sun will make it more pronounced.|`|UUpsa35Daa	You'll probably have that bit of guilt inside you for a while.    When i was 1, i was crawling around on the floor and the family dog took my pacifier out of my mouth and started to walk away so i crawled after him and pulled his tail. He came back at me and got me good. Bit the right side of my mouth, ripped it open. I have a 2 1/2 inch to 3 inch indented scar there now that's can be noticed really well and i'm 17 now.  My entire family was around that day and they felt incredibly guilty for not watch me but they started to get over it when i didn't make a big deal of it. I went through the years, not getting teased, but of people asking what happened. It's just something that i used to. That scar is part of who i am now, it's a part of my appearance and childhood. I actually find it a little funny, whenever i'm around babies, they trace my scar, say "owie" and kiss it to make it better.      It's a hard thing to get over, especially since it's on your daughter's face. But you didn't ruin her. As she grows, make sure she knows that she's still beautiful and that it doesn't matter. If you make a big deal out of it, she'll make a big deal out of it.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Stop stressing yourself out, accidents do happen.  There are no perfect people in the world you are human.   Give yourself a bit of peace.    I kicked the door handle of a moving car on the M1 motorway in the UK @ the same age & got sucked out of the car, my mum jumped out after me & picked me up before I was run over like a bundle of rags.  My entire left side of my face was ripped apart.   I'm fine now & you can't see any damage, the only reason I know about it is from old family 8mm films.    The advances in technology are huge, start a small savings plan so she can have surgery @ a later date.  In the meantime get yourself some vitamin 'e' cream or Rosehip oil & rub it into the scar every day, keloid scars react well to the application of Rosehip oil in particular. My friend used it on her keloid scars from a shoulder op & they are less raised & red now.    The more you stress about it, the more your daughter will pick up on it. I know kids can be cruel, but you must remain strong & true for your daughters sake. Leave it in the past & look forward to improving things & stop beating yourself up.   Take care.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Honey, I can only image how you are feeling right now.  There is nothing that anyone can say here that will make you feel better except that as she grows and develops the scar may not be as obvious.  Please make sure that you are aware of how you are feeling and seek counseling if it becomes worse.  It was an accident and they happen, but I know first had that knowing that isnt going to make the guilt you feel magically go away.    She will be ok and I am sure that she will grow up to be a very beautiful and well adjusted women.|`|AA12074512	that's life you got to go on. it will get better you'll see.|`|qRElKKjXaa	Aw. I'm really sorry that happened. Forgiveness is only necessary when you've done something wrong, and you have not.     I can only imagine how painful it would be, though. When my cousin was three he was playing in the yard of their vacation home when a Rottweiler suddenly ran up and bit him right on the face. My aunt was sitting on the porch but she still couldn't rush to him in time. He had to undergo reconstructive surgery and still has a scar on his cheek, and she felt awful. There wasn't much she could have done differently - they didn't know about the dog - and he was just ten feet away. Things happen quickly. You couldn't have done anything either.     Maybe professional makeup would be helpful for concealing the scar. Just a bit of concealer might do it, and if it doesn't then maybe pancake makeup. I saw something on Oprah once about kids with things on their faces - scars, birthmarks - using it and it looked awesome. Good luck.     I love Courty21's answer. Confidence can take you far.   : )|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	Nobody is perfect, people accidently hurt their kids, and other kids when playing all the time. Start saving money now so when she is older you can afford surgery.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Plastic surgery can do wonders. How about you start a savings account now, which you may not need for many years, but for only her surgery? As she grows older the scar may get less and less but if she does want it fixed when she's a teen or something, then you'll have most of the money available. Accidents happen.|`|SRF2FiWPaa	--- I think time will have things better-- many pilots shot down in the second world war became guinea pigs ( for plastic surgery ) --- technology is going so far so fast --- just try to be the best mom you can be --- when I was in grade two -- there was this girl I really liked in my class - well one day she walked down the back alley and I climbed a picket fence to look at her -- I stood on the edge of the picket fence and my feet slipped and I fell with my chin catching the picket.- I was hung in the air with the picket sticking in my throat -- my feet couldn't touch the ground I was hung up with my chin bone on the picket and blood gushing all over.--- well my father ran out and grabbed me and rushed me to the hospital -- slapping my head all the time-- well I only have a tiny scar. I should have lots of scars but I heal good the secret is to not rip the scab off put bandaids on it so your kid cannot pull the scab or play with it--- young people heal fast and later if necessary there is plastic surgery if needed--- then there was the time ( before I was in kindergarten ) I was home alone ( not home alone home alone my mother was next door visiting a neighbour if she saw me get the sheet she would have killed me )so I got a sheet and made myself a parachute, climbed up the garage and played paratrooper.

It's just one of those freak accidents....|`|Vad64Jjoaa	My son was bit by our family dog when he just turned 6 (he is 10 now). He had 18 stitches put in his face and most of them were right under his eye. We used Mederma and Vitamin E oil. It looked horrible for the longest time. I almost couldn't stand to look at his eye sometimes. As time went by so did the scar and you can barely tell now. I was told that he was lucky it happened at such a young age because it will heal a lot better and it did. My poor son notices it, I just keep telling him that girls like boys with scars. But nobody else even knows that it is even there. I would just give it a lot of time, the scar will start to fade on its own. It is going to take a lot of time for you to get over as well. I beat myself up forever that  I was not in the room when the dog bit my son. I felt like if I was just there I could have stopped it. After seeing how resilient my son was it helped me to forgive myself. Time is the only thing that can heal it. Just know that is was an accident and she will be just fine.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	beating yourself up over it isnt going to help her. and you know you didnt do it on purpose.  i have a keloid - now she's young so i dont know how that works, but go see a pediatric plastic surgeon now.  keloids get bigger.  i actually had mine removed and it made a bigger but flatter scar - its on my shoulder so i've gotten over caring about it.  i don't know how they handle the nose - if they tape it after surgery to keep it flat.  they can also do radiation - harmless - on the area.  anyway, they may be able to find a way it can be covered by insurance - preventative so it doesnt cover her nostril and affect her breathing - i have no idea what it looks like so i'm guessing.  anyway, don't wait until it gets bigger - see what they can do know.  and get over your guilt and just help her.  find the head of pediatric surgery to treat it - the best of the best.  good luck.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	There could be a medical foundation or organization that would give the grant for the laser procedure, i am  not sure how to research that though?I am very sorry to hear from your daughter's situation|`|uhj76Fkpaa	you should realise that accidents happen all the time and that you never meant this to happen when you were playing with her.It was just an accident.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I dont think anyone can actually get over something like that, even though it was just an accident an those happen alllll the time with kids.  But as she gets older it will fade, and there are lots of procedures an creams that can reduce the appearence as well.. and it will probably end up as  just a little scar and she will have a funny story to tell when she gets older.  I look at scars as battle wounds and good stories lol.  I have a pretty good size scar down my cheek, its not repulsive lol but noticable, i had a cat attack me an rip my face to shreds.. i have a scar on my forhead where her jaws of life where in me too, i can laugh at it now, but at 16 with a swollen cut up face i was not so happy.. an it was my fault, i picked her up when she was spooked by a dog.    My mom dropped my cousin when she was a baby, she is now 32 and has a permanent bumps on her head..    Im sure by time she is at the age kids start teasing, which is about 2cnd grade, it wont be so bad, her skin has so much growing and stretching to do.. and if it doesnt put a little bit of money away each month and by time she is in 2cnd grade u can then get it removed.   When she is older tell her what happened, make it funny for her.. she will share that story with kids at school at a young age an by time they are old enough to tease it will go overlooked.       Im glad she is ok though, time will make u feel better, dont worry :)|`|2b26e0986ec3f26e787808e309b0220aaa	Ok here it goes... I have five boys.  My oldest decided when he was 2.5 years old to take a key and stick into a live socket. Yes an electrical socket.  And before anyone judges.... we where moving and i was all alone (no family to help).  I was waiting for the Rental Agent to come and finalize the house so we could get our deposit back.  And I was finishing up some packing....  he had asked me for some juice and while i had my head in the fridge he grabbed the key off the counter and off he went.  Fast as lightening.... it was as if he had it planned.  By the time i took the juice from the fridge and turned to place the jug on the counter... boom the lights flickered and i just knew what had happened.  Especially when is saw that the key was missing.... i jolted to streight to his room where his lil brother was asleep in a portable playpen.. Whom had awoke and was crying.  Needless to say my son stayed the night in the hospital.... and they told me that he was fine.  Later in life it was discovered he has silent siezures.... i always blamed myself and never could rid the guilt.  I recently found out that his siezure disorder is hereditary.  But my point is for many years i hated myself for not being more careful.  Please, by all means don't go the rest of your life punishing yourself.  With children come surprises and accidents.  This is mearly an accident... its not like you her hurt her on purpose.  And as far as children making fun.... I wouldn't worry about that till the time comes...  My other son has a defective ear and wears glasses...  sometimes he says some kids say things, but he has learned to laugh with them and then they stop... its no fun to make fun when the person your making fun of laughs with you.  Children will be children and will find something to poke fun of no matter what.|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	there was a guy that was born with no arms and he was so acustomed to being made fun of but rather than giving up he trained himself to use his feet to do every thing. he can drive, read, drink, write, and many more with his feet. teach her to never hate herself for this accident. she will get friends she can still be popular. people may make fun of her but she will live. as people say the only beauty is on the inside. i believe that. i am fat but the nicest guy around. there can be a beautiful girl but is a complete witch. the fat and the ugly go through the most mental pain but the tend to be the nicest for they have experienced the worst.
uhj76Fkpaa	maybe you should wait to find a job first and then take the responsibility of a child.So you don't claim it...for now!|`|15b20bc2f63d778baab60d206ce6c1a4aa	huh? would u even file taxes if you don't have a job?!
BeNazR8Jaa	I had that done few years ago... LEEP is supposed to scrape away the abnormal cells that eventually could turn cancerous later if not taken care of.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I dont' mean to be rude but why didn't you ask your wife this question??|`|a1ymHaWAaa	they cut out the part of cervix that is affected with the dysplasia.If it was invasive they would have reccomended a full hysterectomy.I doubt it's invasive.Dsyplasia is cancer cells that could very well lead to cancer if not removed.Also she will need to do pelvic exams every 3 months to make sure it doesn't come back|`|RrhS0Qidaa	The LEEP procedure would be done in place of a laser treatment or cryotherapy. It's usually done as the physician's choice.  It's just as effective as a cone biopsy, but it removes more tissue (if need be) than a cone biopsy.  Another useful thing about LEEP is that it can remove most of the precancerous cells and no further surgery is needed.|`|7QkKTBsmaa	The LEEP procedure can be used for either biopsy purposes or to treat dysplasia. I wouldn't be worried about seeing the doctor again, it is normal to have a follow up appointment.

tSHvPjsEaa	I have always been the same way with stress.  I was a nervous wreck for the first trimester and I couldn't calm myself down.  It will get better as you get used to the idea of being pregnant.  It was almost automatic when I went into the second trimester that my nerves calmed down; I felt more confident in my body.|`|f35d52f95d2dd53b628490e6c24b8a1caa	This may sound like a ridiculous answer, but try to stop worrying about worrying! Obviously you should try and avoid unnecessary stress during pregnancy, but it perfectly natural to be a bit worried. Your body (and the baby) can cope with this. Just try and accept that you're going to be permanently slightly worried until the baby is born (and for about 18 years afterwards!).    I'm 24 wks pregnant with my second child and am waking up about 4 times a night thinking about random things like what kind of nappies to buy, what brand of wipes are best, all kinds of pointless things that I know are ridiculous.     Try and relax if you can, but as you've said, don't try too hard because you'll just end up more stressed !    Good luck ! :)|`|1CryEnb3aa	Take a nice soaky bath and play dome relaxing/soothing music.  You need to relax and get some rest.  Don't worry everything will be fine!  Congrats!!|`|KNcZTbqQaa	keep busy if you can - like through work and hobbies. Chat with your friends / family who have had a child or who are currently pregnant. Also, try those traditional things like watch an animated dvd, bath, relaxation tapes - but try to keep around your family (mum's are great) to help chill you out :)|`|M9wAOlk3aa	take some time out to relax or meditate if you can   dont forget its normal to feel different you bodies coping with massive changes   just take one day at a time|`|4lpJRXYsaa	drink plenty of water (i know that sounds weird, but some how it lowers your heartbeat if your heart is racing), go on walks, watch your favorite movies, do things that get you in a REALLY good mood and kind of distract your mind, also when you see your Ob/GYN ask him or her about it and they should have some better more knowledgeable advice for you|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I've been listening to a relaxation audio track.  If you can get hold of something like that it can really help.  You can even get ones that tell you everything is going to be ok with the birth etc, or get a book from the library that has a script you can record onto your ipod etc.  It can really calm you down, especially if you are nervous about being pregnant and giving birth.    The other thing to do is if you haven't gone to sleep in 20 mins, get up and do something around the house for an hour.  Then go back to bed.  I don't recommend TV, but do something constructive like cleaning etc and then it is so much easier to go back to sleep.  Also have a milky drink to calm you down.      These things seem to work for me.
UUpsa35Daa	I think it's natural for babies and toddlers to want to be rocked or carried to sleep, it gives them a familiar and comforting feeling.    But at his age, i would say it's time that he be cut back on him getting what he wants so he can learn to comfort himself back to sleep. Maybe start at putting him to sleep 1 or 2 times a night and then letting him comfort himself the other times, whether it be a special stuffed animal or blanket, a sipy cup of water or soothing music. And then just cutting back as the nights go by.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	our youngest daughter was the same exact way. we just stopped getting up with her, we gave her a blaket. after about a week she relied on that blanket for comfort. she kept that blanket for years it finally fell apart from beiin washed so many times. try it ill bet it works.|`|3haXFtx7aa	Im a nanny and lots of parents just dont want to deal with the child sleeping "i have a meeting in the morning" "i cant be up all night" but truth is after a few night of not getting what he wants and still sticking to a strict schedule he is going to stop waking up and start sleeping the whole night without your wife carrying him. just make sure your not checking on him much or giving in, wake him up at the usual time and have him take regular timed naps and going to bed at a scheduled time is a must for him. its not going to be instant but in the long run it will be well worth it. give it a few days, wont take long.|`|I9LTTno2aa	When your child wakes up, you need to walk him (not carry him) to his room and place him in bed without saying a word to him. Yes he will cry and throw a fit but you just have to do this till he gets the hint. If your wife keeps giving in to him soon he will be sleeping in your in bed.|`|7CoVXfA1aa	That's a hard question. My son is 14months and still waking in the night. people would tell us it was best to let him scream himself to sleep but that was horrible and I didn't like to teach him that when he needed us we wouldn't come (sometimes he would wake because he was twisted up etc.) I breastfeed my baby so if he sees me he wants milk. The way we've been coping with it is to send my husband in instead. That way we are still checking everything is okay but not letting him run the show. My husband checks the bed, nappy and offers a drink then gives him a hug and puts him down. We then wait 10mins. If he is still upset, my husband will go in again and tuck him in. Each time he visits he interacts less with our son, until he goes off to sleep. It's hard work for a few days but it seems to do the trick! (Until he starts teething then he wakes lots, even with bonjela). If you start going in instead of your wife you are not giving in to him.  Another way I've heard of is to sit in their room till their asleep, creeping further to the door each time until they're happy to sleep on their own. (May take 3 or 4 nights).  As a 2year old I'm not sure how much reasoning will work, simple explanations may get somewhere depending on the child. Punishment is not really suitable - how will you implement it in the middle of the night?   There are lots of books on children's sleep habits in the library that may also help as every child is different..  Good luck :-)
OHfZFR31aa	Bella is also beautiful in Spanish and can be used as a name. Linda means "lovely" and is another word that is used as a first name.

HyknHVV5aa	Exposure to allergens such as dust mites, cockroaches, mold, pollens, or animal dander can trigger or worsen symptoms in some children with asthma. This is referred to as allergic asthma. Seasonal allergies to outdoor pollens (also called hay fever) won't usually be a problem until your child is 4 or 5, because it can take that long for him to be exposed to enough pollens to develop a sensitivity to them. Allergies to dust mites, mold, or animal dander may develop earlier in life, though. other possible triggers include cold air, viral infections (such as the common cold), tobacco smoke, and other air pollutants. If your baby coughs frequently and has allergies or eczema, and your family has a history of asthma and allergies or eczema (especially if you and your partner both have them), there's a good chance that your baby has asthma. His symptoms are likely to be worse at night    One common condition that mimics asthma in infants is bronchiolitis, which is usually caused by a viral infection, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The infection affects the tiny airways called bronchioles. The airways swell, making it difficult for a child to breathe. Infants are often affected because their airways are so small that they become blocked more easily than those of older kids or adults.    Symptoms of bronchiolitis include rapid breathing, a cough, wheezing, and fever. Infants who develop bronchiolitis may be more likely to develop asthma later in life. But it's unclear if that's because RSV infection causes asthma or because the child was born with a tendency to wheeze and was therefore more prone to both bronchiolitis and asthma. Studies are being done to clarify the relationship between bronchiolitis and the later development of asthma.    There are also less common reasons for wheezing in infants. A foreign object or piece of food inhaled into the lungs may cause wheezing. Premature infants who have insufficiently developed airways may wheeze. Cystic fibrosis can cause a child to wheeze, too, but it usually involves additional symptoms such as delayed growth.    It's important to remember that just one instance of wheezing isn't enough to diagnose asthma. It must happen more than once. But even when wheezing happens on a recurring basis, a doctor may still not be certain the cause is asthma, especially in young children. More time, and sometimes more tests, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and decide on the best long-term management plan for the child.    Doctors want to avoid an incorrect diagnosis, which might unnecessarily disrupt the lives of the entire family or label a child with a chronic condition he or she may not have. Fewer than one third of all infants who wheeze on a recurring basis during their first 3 years continue to wheeze into later childhood. In other words, most kids who wheeze as infants outgrow it and don't have asthma when they get older. But making an appointment to see your family doctor is the best thing to do to be safe.|`|Me6WL4dSaa	well if you think hes having asthama THEN go 2 the doctors rigth now....    dont delay....it could be harmful...    continue breastfeeding the baby...till he turns 1(one)..trust me nothing works like breastmilk...it will make him really immune internally...my partner is feeding our baby...and its the 6th month|`|HzKEkMgvaa	Here is what I am worried about, when it is only during feedings it could be a heart problem.  My doctor told me to watch if my son wheezed while eating.  Does he sweat while eating too?    Call the doctor tomorrow and tell them it is an emergency and you want to get in right away or you are getting a new doctor.    It could be a respiratory infection, but your doctor should treat this quickly.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	even if they can't see him right away, you can call them and tell them what is going on and if u should be worried between now and your appt...that's what they are there for and what you pay for when you go in.....|`|AA12096768	It could be asthma/allergies but is it possible he might also just have a cold? I would suggest giving him a warm bath, using a baby nose-sucker thing and using baby vicks and see if that helps.  You can also use infant tylenol drops if he seems uncomfortable.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	if its athsma the noise will come when he breathes out.     my tiny one does this when bfing, check your boobs arnt squashing his nose!!     perhaps he just has a cold - remember babies cant clear there nose like we can. try using a suction bulb!
mjlhZAVxaa	Well I was a 10 pound, 22 inches baby and my husband was a 7.5ish pound, 19 inches baby.  Our son was 8.11 pounds and 21 inches.  Congrats!  But you really never know how big they are going to be.  Both of my parents are tall, mom is 5"11 dad was 6"3, I have 5 sisters and 4 of them are over 5"8, the other one and I are both 5"4.  But we did gymnastics hardcore, and they didn't, so...??? maybe that has something to do with it.  Anyhow, my sister Rose who is 5"10 had a 6.4 pounds, 18 inch baby and her husband is 6"5!  And my other sister who is about 5"8 had a 6.1 pounds and 19 inch baby!  So you never know what you are gonna get.  And just remember, just because the baby is big or small now doesn't determine their future height as a fully matured adult!|`|xp0BnsD0aa	Hi there!  My midwife told me it is the maternal genetics that will determine size more than anything.      My sons were 8pd 14 and 8pd.  No drugs, no dramas.    Mind over matter!    You can have growth scans later in pregnancy to check on size if you are worried.  They are not too accurate but worth it for peace of mind.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Well it depends you might get lucky cause my friend thought she was going to have a big baby. She was around 10 pounds and her husband was 8 and they had a 7lbs 4 oz baby.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	My daughter was born 9 lbs. 3 oz and 21 1/2 inches long.

My three kids ( 4 due May 4th) were 7lb 12oz, 7lb 7oz, and 8lb 1oz. My husband was a little over 7 lbs. My midwife told me that babies (born full term) usually fall between the mother and fathers birth weight.     You just might be headed for a big baby. Labor doesn't last forever though, and I would rather give birth to a healthy 10 pound baby than to have a really sick 2 pound baby. Don't let it scare you, congratulations and good luck with your pregnancy!|`|b5lzqQEBaa	The weight of you and your hubby when you were born dosnt really have any effect on the baby. My first was 7lbs 9oz and my second was 9lbs10oz. When i was born i was 9lbs10oz along with my bf.. I guess it really all depends on how much you wat, J/p . Dont worry so much. When both of my sons were born i could really even tell the weight difference. There is always another way you can determin. With my second i knew he was  goin to be big because i looked like i was carring twins the whole pregnancy. Good luck and cangrats :)
4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	Is anything happening (like a new baby) that would cause her to regress like this?  Usually children who have been potty trained will regress if a new baby is coming into the picture.  They want to remain the baby, so they'll start to act like a baby.  And since babies wear diapers, and a new baby gets an awful lot of attention, she figures this is how to get the attention back on her.  I'm just kind of guessing this because of your screen name here.      If she's having nightime accidents, I'd start to limit liquids before bed, and make her go potty before bed.  If it keeps up, have her start wearing a pull up to go to bed in.  Don't worry about it.  She's still rather young--my kids were 3 1/2 before they were completely trained, and my youngest wet the bed at night for years.  She'll grow out of it, and like my mother always told me, no one ever started kindergarten in diapers.|`|OqcTPhiSaa	This is common if you ask me. All three of my toilet trained kids (I still have one in diapers) went through a strange "accident" phase long after they were trained.     There's tremendous pain with bladder and kidney infections as far as I know, but none of my kids has ever had one. I think a kidney infection would bring on other symptoms as well, like fever for example. I really don't think you have to worry about that if your daughter is acting healthy and well :-) You can call your doc just to get more info and feel reassured.    But I have a theory that when they start toilet training it's a big conscious effort. They're "thinking" about the importance of going to the pot all the time, and we're constantly reminding them too.    After awhile going to the bathroom becomes automatic, like a habit. They're not thinking about it so much anymore. They've done it so often they just go when they need to go.    Enter regression. Not paying much attention to a full bladder. Forgetting to go pee before going to bed. Maybe even getting a little lazy about it. But they haven't been trained long enough to really get away with this automatic function ... and they have a stage where they just have accidents frequently.    I think this works on them to help reinforce the need to be slightly more conscious about going to the bathroom, and after a month or two of frequent accidents they're fine again.    That's just my theory as a mom of four whose had lots of potty training and regression experience LOL. We're always the most worried about our first child because we don't have any prior experience to compare what that child does with, but you'll get through it. Even if you have to dig out the sticker chart again :)|`|aNGzulgpaa	My daughter is almost 3, and has been potty trained (accident free) for about 8 months.  Her father works out of town so she hardly ever gets to see him.  When he came for a visit a few months ago, the day he left she had 2 accidents during the day, and wet the bed that night.  That went on for about 3 days after he left, then she was fine.  Also, my aunt came to visit us from out of town, and the same thing happened when she went home.  My daughter had accidents and wet the bed for a few days after my aunt went home.  Sometimes just the slightest change in a daily routine can cause them to back-track in potty training.  Hope this helps.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	maybe something bothers her.Is she nervous in general?Anxious about something?Did you make any change in her everyday life?All these things mentioned may affect the child.I really don't think it's an infection...if it was she would be in pain everytime she goes to pee.Make her feel that it's ok and that's there nothing wrong with her just because she had a couple of accidents cause she may feel embarrashed about it.Good luck

Wait for a good nice guy who will treat you well.|`|ni7Qgt3Raa	Let me make this simple for you ,   Man will show interest to a girl mainly because of reproduction  basically everything they do or tell you (except if it's their job) is being done or told to you in order to hopefully seduce you and to get closer to the main goal which is to eventually copulate with you .|`|EkXQVZU5aa	He thinks you're a taco, he's probably has the munchies and is on acid, run.

Ever since '98(6yrs. after the wedding; 1yr. after the separation; 2yrs. before I divorced her) when she said that, she had wished my health problems would 'just go away', I have hated her and, my family is always happy to see her.

1ILYNExFaa	I have a 14 month old daughter and have started weening hers away from her slowly. I've slowly worked her into a routine of giving it to me when she woke up and then only giving it to her when she actually asked for it at night. She has gone a few nights without asking for it and has stopped completely asking for it during the day. Pacifier weening takes time and alot of patience but just stick with it. Work out a routine with her where she wants to give it to you in exchange for maybe a graham cracker or something in the morning and just put it out of her sight. My daughter did great with the out of sight out of mind concept. She didn't even ask for it unless she saw it.  Good luck!!|`|n2O0NwR6aa	My daughter was a binkaholic until she was 3.  She not only used one binky, she had to have 3 - one for her mouth, and one in each hand, which she used to rub on her face while she fell asleep.  It was bad!  I thought we'd be looking for a white lace binky to match her wedding dress!      We finally convinced her to give them up on her 3rd birthday, when she became a "big girl."  We tied them to some balloons and let them go, so the babies up in heaven could use them.  It worked - briefly - but then she started swiping her baby brother's binkies!  She just couldn't fall asleep without one.    What finally worked was a trip to the dentist.  I noticed some pictures of some really nasty looking teeth - so I asked the dentist to show them to her, and tell her that her teeth would look like that if she kept using a binky.  It worked!  It was a little tough at first - at bedtime, she'd wonder how she was going to fall asleep without one - but then she'd remember those teeth and decide she could do it after all.|`|bc8a8d7595f1051b6a4ba4c3045875ddaa	i'm taking it a binky is some kind of blanket or soother?    i wouldnt fret about how long she has it, every child has a comforter of some kind my daughter has a teddy bear and she is 3 the teddy goes everywhere except to nursery. my eldest son had a dummy until he was 5, and my other son had a blanket (danky) until he was 4, but they all grow out of it when they feel they dont need it anymore. you dont see many school age kids with their comforters and if they do still have them at home they soon realise their isnt any real need to depend on them anymore x good luck|`|dDVAUA9saa	She's still a baby for heaven's sake, what's the big deal???  My daughter is 22 months and still has a blanket at night and nap time and in the car.  And she probably will for a few more years, which is fine by me!!|`|urarletqaa	Don't worry, 15 months is still a baby and they need comforts. If there is a day when she doesn't need it or ask then thats good too but for now its fine. Its only for sleeptimes and its not all day anyway.|`|AA11349925	It's up to you, you know what is best for your child. As much as any of us can disagree and come up with a million reasons why she shouldn't at the end of the day she is your baby and you know what is best!    If it's any comfort I know children who still have a dummy aged 3 and four years! they come to creche every week with it, hand it over to mum and she takes it home then brings it back when she picks him up, that is entirely up to that family and no one should judge them for it.|`|rISHTfK3aa	My opinion does not count. You know your own child and what she needs. If she is thriving and happy then don't rock the boat. Just leave her alone.|`|PpYBnxgpaa	I wont say that it is horrible but i believe that after 1 year a child should be off the pacifier and the bottle .|`|29528aba49608c87d4de0499f1885c1aaa	i would start to get her off of it. I would use the nukk fairy method. one night you take all the binky's and nukks and hang them in the tree and tell your child that the fairy will bring toys back in the morning and will give all the old nukks to babies that need them. in the morning you hang the things from the tree, like little cheap toys,  and take out the nukks. i did it with a sixteen month old and she fully understood.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	i have seen kids that were 5 years old with them in their mouths at the mall....that is totally uncalled for. 15 months isnt that bad. but just remember, the longer you wait to take it, the more the child is going to be attached to it and fight with you. i took it from my son when he was 12 months but he wasnt very attached to it. most people shove those in when their baby makes the smallest noise, thats why kids get so addicted to them. if its not that big of an issue now, take it before it becomes a problem.|`|1CryEnb3aa	YOu have to consider the harm it can do at this point.  Her teeth development and ear infections.  Sounds crazy I know, but this is what my nephew went through.  So, start weening off and you should be fine.  Its ok if she has something else for security like a blankie or a teddy bear.  But, as far as something in her mouth, not a good idea.  Good luck.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Just keep weening her off of it. If you don't give it to her already at bedtime or nap time you've already started. Keep dwindling the times she can have it down and in no time she won't need it anymore.|`|145RUNQHaa	Not bad at all.if she had it in her mouth all day i would say cut it back to nap times but you have already done this and if it helps her through any sickness then that is great.there really is no harm whatsoever in a toddler having a binky to get them to sleep and help them when they need a bit of extra comfort.x x|`|TORBP6QIaa	I think if she still wants it let her have it...Chances are if you dont make a big deal of it she will eventually start to forget about it and in time wean herself off it.    My 3 sons all had Dummies (an Aussie binky!) and I absolutely do not remember ever feeling like they were too old for them...they just weaned themselves off them eventually, probably somewhere between 12-18mths.      I think you are doing fine mum...eventually she will accidentally fall asleep without it one night and then 2 nights and before you know it she will have given it up.  I think as she only has it at sleep times then you are in no danger of having a 5 year old still sucking their dummy/binky.    My 3 sons have perfect teeth...there were absolutely no teeth issues from their dummy use...sucking thumbs...now that is a different thing...dummies are soft and flexible.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well it's best to wean her off as soon as possible, it can develop a problem with speech delay|`|UUysEV0yaa	No thats not a bad thing at all! She's a baby still. She needs that binky for comfort and security as well as for tactile development.    My son is 15 months also, and he has a wrap (blankie) and he loves it. He uses it for bedtime and naps. When he is tired he goes into his room, pulls out blankie from his cot and drags it into the living room. Then i know its time for bed :)    As long as the binky doesnt worry you then I say she should be able to hang onto it for a bit longer yet. Lots of kids still have a favourite teddy or whatever for bed until school.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i do the exact same:) as long as you intend on weaning it off her theres no harm:)|`|jC1Mdsefaa	im against binkys after about 4-6 months.  due to teeth cutting and this reason!  I think you should take it away.. I believe she is too old for it..    I hate seeing toddlers walking, and getting ready for talking and potty training having a binky in their mouth.  You should find her some other form of security!|`|dPmK83UYaa	it can be bad for her teeth. She needs to find comfort in other stuff. It can cause dry skin problems around the mouth area from all the saliva...that doesn't look too pretty in pictures.    If she is sick, give her YOUR comfort...not the binky. stroke her cheeks, belly or whatever you can find that soothes her. Ur her momma u just gotta find her likes.

ed4cafee439e74492042c4399754b451aa	I agree about the liberals.  I was spanked and am disciplined and only fought a few times, mainly just because of high school and college athletics.  I am not violent, and am married and doing pretty well.  Also, my wife was not spanked and she said that we will spank our kids.  I was spanked, hard be-it, but only spanked.  3 licks with a belt, no more, no less, and never hit.  I was always explained why I was spanked and told I love you and the reasoning behind it.  I have the utmost love and respect for both my mother and father.  When I see these liberal's kids and the countdown method or time out, I see how the kids have no fear of getting their phone taken away or being in time out.  That is a joke, and I would like to beat the crap out of those parents with my fists - just kidding a whole play on the me not being violent, for the slower people.  But really it is crazy how little respect some children have and the parents that say one thing and do another.  1...2...3... Haha, what are you gonna do after you count to three? Give me time out, oh wait you'll forget before you get home and I will lose that much more respect for your not doing what you will say and walk over you even more - this is what most of those kids think.      Also, I have picked if all of my friends were spanked or not, at least about 90%  I would have thought my wife was spanked with how she has respect for people, so I guessed her wrong, but my friends that walk over people and never do what they say - were not spanked and my reliable, honest, stearn friends who do what they say and say what they do, were spanked.  Go figure!    BTW it is an instinct to physically discipline your kids, look at most animals and see what they do.  Mammals of course.  You will find that most discipline there kids, not by mental or emotional discipline - but by physical discipline.  If a much simpler animal can understand that it gets the point and does not beat around the bush, then why can't some people quit whinning and realize that is the most effective form of discipline.|`|u00IalCZaa	I am a new parent but I can tell you one thing my child will mind me and wont misbehave that much and when its age a ppropriate if the child does wrong she will be punished. By no means will spanking be the first line of method unless its a really bad thing like running off or breaking something when told not to touch and if it couldnt be replaced. ie if it came from my travels that will not fly to mess with it. If its just breaking a kitchen plate etc. it wouldnt warrent  a spanking unless she breaks the whole set THEN we might have an issues.|`|vk1TcfTeaa	I was spanked as a kid and I turned out well. Many of my friends were spanked too. When I was spanked, it was a clear punishment, never out of anger. my parents would say something like, "i love you, but you acted naughty when you talked to me like that, so i will give you 3 spankings" and they would do 3 brisk spankings, hug me, then let me go...and the issue was dropped. I think it's a relatively effective way of punishment, especially for kids like me. I was bad and I'd say "it doesn't hurt!" for other kids, timeout is very effective... i enjoyed time-out... i would just imagine things and it would entertain me so I needed some other punishment! when i was older, I was "grounded", because then I was more into social things. However, I have read about how bad spankings can be for children. so i suggest to read literature supporting each side and form your own opinion. No matter WHAT method of discipline is used, it's important to do these things: 1.) love your child- tell them 2.) acknowledge the BEHAVIOR was wrong and explain why 3.) establish boundaries 4.) define punishment and stick to it 5.) never act out of anger when disciplining, cool down first.    Ps- I think spanking is wrong if it hurts more than a few minutes. If there are marks or injuries of any kind, that is abuse. There really is a fine line there. And it does take a lot of self-control and structure to make spanking effective, in a positive way.    Do what you're comfortable with, they're your kids. Raise them carefully and with love.|`|o0QVfQJgaa	Spanking is good, I am 16 and when I was younger my parents would spank me when I did something wrong,or lied,or broke something, I'm glad they punished me instead of letting me get away with it. I am responsible, mature now, and my parents trust me. so don't be afraid to spank your kid if they miss behave, they won't hate you if you do. :)|`|aJ6TJ6rOaa	If logical reasoning does not work and their is obvious disobedients, then a spanky can be a discipline action...Never do it when you are angry and don't leave marks...  Also, spedn the time to talk through why you had to do this...  The liberals will ahve you believe that spankying is wrong and barbaric (right, and abortion isn't). I have see all these liberal kids raised with time outs and loose boundaries only to grow up with no respect.  TOugh love is just that... It is tough on the parent to follow through....|`|ieCuJVZtaa	Spanking is old school and its easy to mess up your kids if you do it incorrectly. Being stern with kids is important, but spanking them is too far.    The wikipedia on spanking is very informed and it cites its references on the subject.    On the whole though, no. People who were spanked when they were younger and think that its okay now were obviously spanked in a manner that wasn't traumatizing (presumably, hell they could be messed up for now for all we know), but the risk of spanking creating other problems in the future of a child is too high for it to be a reasonable punishment. Avoid it and find more effective and logical ways of dealing with a misbehaving child.|`|weBvwrloaa	it is still legal but you do have to be careful and you should check with your local state laws on it. Spanking cannot leave marks(welts) which last more than an  a 1/2hour, cannot break the skin, cannot be hard enough to leave a bruise later.l Believe in spanking up to about the age of 9. After that it's pretty much pointless. You should be enough of an authoritarian to "put the fear of God" in your child by using a firm strong voice. I was spanked once in my childhood.   I spanked my own child maybe two or three times if even that. Just a good swift swat. No repeated hits.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	In the UK it is not Illegal to smack /spank. I dislike however the term "spanking" as it implies repetitive blows.  From my own experience I have smacked my children, a single tap to the bottom between the ages of @ 2 1/2 to 4..(and really by their 4th year only once or twice) . By the age of 5 there is no reason why you should have to smack child, they are able to be told the consequences of their actions and have privileges removed, as toddlers I think there is nothing worse than seeing a parent trying to "reason" with a 2 yr old who has bashed a kid on the head ("now I understand your upset and your just taking out your frustration on little Johnny blah blah blah") A child that age has little to no CONCEPT of what you are saying all they remember is that bashing little johnny= mummy talking= hugs from mummy, hardly productive.  There are many arguments for an against smacking, my own feeling is that it is still a free country and so long as a child is raised without fearing his/her parents (and here lies the line between A smack and spankING) you should feel free to parent how you see fit.  No one was ever mentally scared by having a tap on the behind. :)|`|e7rKwI30aa	Depends on the kid. Some kids will respond well, others won't. When I was a kid I liked to think I was really tough so I was never afraid of being spanked. The only real way you can scare kids off misbehaving this way is if they really don't want to be hit, if your kid has a high pain tolerance you'd have to go to inhumane lengths to physically punish them.    If you're talking about your kids, try it out and if it doesn't work don't step it up a notch, try something else. Also don't hit them really gently, actually make it hurt otherwise you're wasting your time.    Don't get caught up in the morality of it, obviously it is TOTALLY immoral to physically hurt anyone (in most societies, I'm assuming you live in america or something when physical abuse is looked down on). Generally people think 'oh, a little is ok' but morally, it isn't =]|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	spanking is not illegal if it is not abusive.  Spanking should be a last resort if time outs and taking away privileges does not work.  Take away for instance TV time, or a toy for a day.  Spank the top of the hand, not their rump. Spanking the bottom can jostle the kidneys and damage them.|`|7KZMMYjQaa	I think it can be a useful tool if used properly, and here in NY it is legal under article 35 of the NYS penal law:    35.10 Justification; use of physical force generally.

Those things I think it is inappropriate to use that sort of discipline!|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Absolutely.  If we spanked our kids 20 years ago, they wouldn't be wearing those dammed pants around their knees and beating up old people.    I live in Texas.  The cops told me AND my daughter that they would come over and hold her down for me to give her a whippen'.  She smartened up after that.    I know a lot of parents that don't believe in that kind of punishment, but even my 21 year old daughter spanks her son.  I just wish my niece would spank her son, as he's he!! on wheels.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	the key with spanking is starting young. If you pop their lil hands when they are little (old enough to give you that eye that says I am gonna do it anyway).. then spankings will be a rarity when they are teenagers, they already are aware that you will do it... they just don't wanna debate on when it is coming next.|`|dPmK83UYaa	its ok in moderation---by that i mean only in serious cases where the child has done something really wrong (run out in the street, try to stick something in an outlet...etc) But you should never hit a child in anger. Let the child know why they are being spanked and how many they will be getting. Then shortly thereafter talk to your child about what they did wrong and how they should never do it again. These are the only times a child should be spanked. Other instances, time outs or a scolding is fine.     U should also be at eye level when u talk to a child...You don't want ur child to be afraid of you, simply know that there are big consequences to big no-no's.    I also believe it has a lot to do with the child's temperment. Is your child a wild child or a soft and sweet one. I have 1 of each. One needs spankings and the other is ok w/ just a scolding. The one in the terrible 2's is the one who gets spanked for Major No-No's    If you feel you are hitting your child too much or out of anger please talk to someone about it and try to get some help. Excessive hitting can also lead to the bad behavior of your child hitting other children or even you.|`|ZZJKTV8laa	no way. people need to quit saying kids wont be disciplined if parents dont spank/hit them. my parents NEVER did that and i wasnt a troubled kid and had a lot of respect for them and still do. i think people use spanking to cover up that theyre a bad parent and too damn lazy to talk to you about right and wrong.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	You'd have to check with your State's version of a Child Protective Services, to make sure it's legal there, and with what limitations, but...    As an alternative punishment, by which I mean that ever frightening spanking that looms behind other front-line punishments, I believe it's not only good, but necessary.  When started young and kept consistent, the spanking (or fear of) lends teeth to all other punishments, as they ultimately must be obeyed to avoid the spanking.    It will be tested, of course, but the more swiftly and consistently it is applied, the less often it will be needed.   Just make the rules, agree on them with the other parent, make the child aware of them and then never, ever back down....ever.|`|AA11586439	in parenting, it is NEVER a good discipline to spank your children! this kind of discipline will bring nowhere than trauma, hatred, anger! the best way is to talk to the child and make deals, like if you do this again, we will not bring you to the movies, you will not have desert, etc.. Make him accountable for his actions by letting him understand, not by hurting or abusing him. the child learns by example. we prepare him to the world by showing him how to love, not how to be violent.|`|Wytd3dajaa	The reason why I don't think it's a good idea at all, is not only that I couldn't bear to harm a child in any way, but it also teaches them to use violence to solve problems. It's just too negative a thing to do.    I don't think people are evil for giving their toddler a little smack on the back of the hand if they're trying to put a fork in the powerpoint or something, but I don't agree with hurting children in any way.    If spanking works for a child, no matter how bad they are, something else will work too.|`|PYyUvN05aa	The short answer in today's times: YES    The long answer: Yes, but depends on the degree.

When comes down to teaching a baby NOT to touch expensive possessions that belong to a neighbor, parents just refuse to use spanking as a form of behavior management.  They'll insist upon finding other less "abusive" ways.      In an LA times article I read 2 years ago, a writer speaks of how a couple came over to his house for a party.  Their little 5 year old happened to be with them.  No more than 15 minutes from the start of the party, a $75,000 violin dating back many decades happened to catch the toddler's eye.  The child climbed over to the pedestal (somehow) and grabbed the violin.  He proceeded to run around with it, banging it into other objects as he ran about.  The parents didn't notice until the violin was completely smashed up.  They began BEGGING the child to hand it over.  They made promises to buy him more toys if he handed it over.  Complete appeasing.    The lesson?  Children are naive and young, yes.  But coaxing and "begging" a child to not resort to an action are NOT ways to show children that actions have consequences.  All you do when you beg a child to stop is let the child control you and NOT vice versa.      So your options:    1. Grounding.  Have to do it early and make the kids respect you.    2. Spanking.  Use it in a limited fashion.  A few hits to the behind with the hand should be enough and is NOT legal as long as they don't leave marks.  NEVER to the face or to areas where sensitive organs are located.    If you wanna use a stick as my mom and dad did, that's your business, I don't know anything about it!|`|JsSeo5YEaa	my personal belief is that spanking is a good way to rear an obedient and respectful child, but it is also important to know when and to what extent to use this. It can become an advantage if honed correctly, or could become a serious problem if handled badly. In the end, it is up to you. I say yes, but many disagree. look into it some more for your own satisfaction, but good luck with whatever you decide. I hope this helped, =) -Kaleigh|`|K7NC9WLiaa	Spanking is a great form of discipline ONLY if done in love. Give them a hug afterwards and be crystal clear on why the behavior was unacceptable and what needs to be changed. It should be immediately after the behavior and not delayed. There is a fine line between spanking in anger and abuse. Only ever the bum. Nowhere else. Never spank children but your own and utilize the naughty room as an alternative measure.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	well my daughter is not 2 yet, and she has never gotten a spanking. i use time out as my method. it works great. a jumpy almost 2 year old HATES having to sit in a corner for one whole minute.   i was spanked also..but i ran away alot, and was totally disobedient. i dont think it is nessecary. you always have to have one parent who is always quiet (my husband) and then you can call on him in the hard times, to let out a stern voice, and it scares the crap out of her!!   NO SPANKINGS !|`|xQQwiiIEaa	Only one of my three siblings wasn't spanked as a child and she's the worst behaved of all of us (she's a middle, not a youngest). We were told how many spanks to expect and when the punishment was over, it was over. Spanks were only reserved for Seriously Bad Behavior; otherwise we got Time Out.|`|m3L6pLBaaa	yeah if it is your child. bend them over your knee and tear the behind up. what did mom always say besides life is like a box of chocolates. She always told me she would dial the number to child ware fare for me. Unless you just hurt them and leave bruises then you should not get in trouble. No body can tell you how to deal with your children|`|lVaC4Ga4aa	Mi mum hit slapped me when i went out of line when i was younger and i think that it helpped me relies wat i had done wrong. She only eva did it though when i was really out of line, not just 4 the little things, just when i chucked a tanti in the wrong place, wrong time 4 a bad thing kinda thing. She hardly eva did it, but i dont c anything wrong with it if u dont abuse ur kid. Sometimes it the only thing that works|`|21RH8bo8aa	I believe spanking is ok, especailly with younger children. This is coming from the kid that got spanked till he was 13 years old with anything that was handy, such spatulas, wooden spoons, belts, and ping pong paddles. This seems to work especially well with younger kids, because even though a kid is told something is wrong and is disiplined verbally, honestly the child in question probably wasnt paying attention for most of the verbal disipline. Spanking grabs the childs attention, and associates the bad behavior with pain,and kids tend to pay attention more to pain than words.  But at a certain point most kids can take a spanking no problem, like when i was ten i could take a hit without blinking.  It all depends on the child.|`|N1gjj0i0aa	If you spank your children, they will always fear you, and wont feel as comfortable to tell you what they feel, and what is going on in their lives. I was treated very well by my parents, they treated my as an adult, but always guiding me when i did something wrong. If i did something wrong, they always told me WHY it was wrong, and they never needed to get mad or punish me. If i wanted a toy really badly and started throwing a fit, they would sit me down, give me a glass of water and say: youre not going to use the toy for that long, wont you like to save the money to get something nicer?    Hope this helps!|`|mwVCFlLTaa	No.    Spanking is a reactive method of parenting- kid does something wrong, out comes the punishment- which has some not insignificant side effects.  Kids learn that violence is a way to get what you want, and can learn to equate love with violence.  They also focus on their pain and how to prevent it, rather than the rightness/wrongness of their actions, and change their behavior based on fear, rather than on a well developed conscience.    Try being more proactive- catch the kid doing things right and give the kid more attention at those times.  Don't set the kid up for failure by expecting a two year old to handle shopping all day and postponing a meal until he gets home and then the kid has a tantrum in the store.  When the kid does something wrong, there are other options.  One of my favorite parenting books is Parenting with Love and Logic (there are also teen and grandparenting versions).|`|sxt41jwSaa	I have 4 children, my eldest 2 have had several smacks, but they are 11 and 6. My 2 year old has  only had one or two when her behavior is really bad, she can be a nightmare and throws tantrums when told off. My youngest is 1 and when he does something really bad, ie pulling on of his sisters hair, I tend to smack him on the hand, he gets a shock and they can see that he gets a punishment too, unfortunately, his latest trick is to smack me back till I end up smacking his hand harder than I wanted too. I think a smack works, I've tried the naughty step but my kids just treated it like a joke. Best punishment for the older two is what I call going on the wall, making them face the wall with their hands high above their heads, till they think about what they have done.  I wouldn't smack someone else's child, but like my folks say a smack never hurt me nor my brother|`|JgFcC9Wyaa	It depends on the parent and child and the situation, you can't generalize!  However, if someone choose to spank then it should not be painful (it is not about hearing the child) and NOT in front of other kids or grown ups.    My parents never spanked me but I did  it  to my son when he was3 yr old a couple of times (for he attempted to do something dangerous and could not could comprehend the harm that could happen to him), it did work!
r07mkYWHaa	The three month rule is not true, sorry to who ever wrote that. Check out the menstrual cycle. You start ovulating 2 weeks after the first day of your last period. It is common to have breast tenderness. I would advice not stressing about it and get a pregnancy test in about 3 days. If it's negative then wait until you miss your period to test again. Your hormones could just be changing. Our bodies are very strange some times especially under stress|`|1CryEnb3aa	When was your last period?  Do you know when ovulated?   Need more info to answer your question.  But, if all the dates line up, very good chance, but would be too early to tell.  It takes any where from 4-16 days for implantation to happen.  Then you will start to produce hcg levels.  So, to test before that would be too soon.  Go back and count 15 days from the first day of your last period. This will give you the date you should have ovulated(if normal 28 day cylce).  This is where you should start.  Then take a hpt if your period in fact late.  Good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's conceivable if you implanted early. Most people implant around 7 days but it can be anywhere from 4-16. I believe that's when I started getting my symptoms with my current pregnancy. About a week. Breast tenderness is also a PMS symptom though. Take a test if you miss your period.    Add: The person above me is very wrong. I've been pregnant twice and started getting symptoms before my missed period. They also state that pregnancy symptoms can start before a missed period on all the medical websites and doctors will tell you the same thing. In fact most women have symtoms by at least week 6.|`|p8sJm5ckaa	women do not get any syptoms till about 3 months into the pregnancy you could just be sore from a certain bra or they could just be tender recently but i say take a home pregnancy test and if still worried talk to your dr and take a blood test to see|`|0iuvUhMpaa	Hey hun,   I got my first sympton 3 weeks after contaception and it is a bit early to tell yet. how do you no you are defiinatly pregnant??
BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|2HETgiwgaa	The easiest way to tell is to start charting your temps and other signs of ovulation - try a site like fertilityfriend.com.  The only thing you'll need is a thermometer - but you can try using an OPK (ovulation predictor kit) if you'd like.  In the meantime, I'd say your plan for this cycle should be fine.  Good luck and baby dust (BTW - I think you mean baby dance :-))|`|IvU7WH8baa	there is an ovulate test u can buy at any drug store  its by the preg tests. it looks like one too. it will show u a postive when ur ovulating and neg when ur not. another way is take ur temperture when u wake up every morning and when ur ovulating ur tem should be sightly higher than normal or they also say when ur "in the MOOD"  and when u notice a clear slimy liquid coming out or ur vagina ur ovulating. well good luck|`|akDgTIQ4aa	There are several ways to narrow down the window of ovulation.     Cervical mucous (vaginal discharge) changes throughout your cycle. If you monitor these changes, you may be able to pinpoint ovulation. CM after your period is generally creamy or sticky, white in color, and doesn't stretch at all. As you near ovulation it will start to get clear with white streaks and stretch further. 2-3 days before ovulation and for some women on the day of, CM becomes watery or thick, clear, and stretchy. It can stretch between your fingers 2-5 inches. It resembles the consistency of raw egg whites. This is known as fertile cervical mucous, or egg white cervical mucous. There are 2 ways you can check your CM. When you go to the bathroom, before you pee, take toilet paper and wipe the outside of your vagina. Look at the discharge on it and determine whether it is fertile or not. If you're comfortable with your body you can insert 2 clean fingers into your vagina and get a sample of your CM that way. I personally think it's easier to examine that way.     You can also chart your basal body temperature. This is your temp upon first waking up in the morning. You need a basal body thermometer, not just a regular one. You can buy them at any drugstore for $8-16. You must take your temperature before doing anything. Don't talk, move around a lot, get up, go to the bathroom or anything. Just wake up and take your temp. You must have gotten at least 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep before temping, and you must temp at the same time every morning for accurate results. Just set an alarm next to your bed and put your thermometer next to it so you don't have to move much to grab it. You can temp orally or vaginally. If you sleep with your mouth open, you should temp vaginally for better results. You can print out BBT charts online or there are several websites that you can enter your data in to and it will tell you when you ovulate. A few good ones are www.fertilityfriend.com and www.babymed.com. After you ovulate your body temperature will rise due to an increase in the hormone progesterone. After 2-3 months you should be able to compare your charts and figure out when you ovulate.     You can also purchase Ovulation Prediction Kits (OPK) These work similar to a pregnancy test. You pee on them (or dip them in urine) and they will tell you if you have a high level of lutenizing hormone, which is present 24-36 hours before ovulation. You can purchase these at any drug store as well.     Most women with a typical 28 day cycle will ovulate on days 13-15 of their cycle. Your cycle begins with the first day of your period and ends the day before your next period begins.     Sperm can live up to 5 days in the vagina, so the most fertile times are 5 days before ovulation, the day of ovulation and the day after. If you can narrow down when in your cycle you ovulate and have sex every other day (or every day if you can manage it) during that window, you will have pretty good chances. But also remember that it can take time, a normal healthy woman only has a 20% chance of conceiving in any given cycle under perfect conditions. It usually takes around 3-6 months for a healthy couple to achieve conception, and sometime up to a year. Anything over a year could signal an issue with either you or your partner, and should be checked out by a reproductive endocrinologist. You've got a long way to go, just be patient :) (stress can inhibit conception)    I hope this will help you out, and I wish you luck!

uuQrhnJ4aa	Lets see: ur 25, tan, muscular, was in ltr and u want a piece of @ss.  you must have a fabulous personality since u've lost touch w/the girls u used to know. you'd prefer a fat chick or a mother over going to a bar or club to actually meet someone (probably becuz that requires engaging someone in conversation & u don't want to do that- u just want a piece). it appears your world is coming to an end cuz u've gone w/out for 6 mos at age 25.     you have several options: call girls/escort svcs, trying to convince your former ltr u r not a jerk & to have pity on you since you are obviously on the verge of death, a sleazy strip club, calling phone numbers on bathroom stalls, going online to sex hook up sites.     if you're too lazy to go to a pick-up joint to get laid u r in desperate straits. how do u maintain a job? everyone knows the section of town where the 'friendly' girls hang out...can u bother to go there?     it's not going to come knocking on ur door unless u call a svc or hookup w/someone on a chat room, sex site, or similar. i still can't get over the fact that you're in this predicament since you're all that & a bag of chips. funny how you've 'lowered your standards' to mothers & fat chicks...but look down upon other options.     most girls on online dating sites actually want a date...unless it's a specific hookup site. make it known in the beginning that's what u want or you could find yourself w/a po'd woman on ur hands who might make that 'piece' a very expensive & unlpleasant experience in the long run.     try an ad in the personals column of the paper. it's usually cheaper than online dating svcs. you don't sound like ur looking for quality material here.     call ur mom & ur friends moms. & if u think 130 lbs is a fat chick, ur one hypocritical selfish horny dude who should probably make really good friends w/your right hand. it might be the only piece u get for quite a while.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	do it mang - go get yours|`|MK8TLyG8aa	Hell yeah, go to the eastside and pick upsome tuts and hookers, if your despret, go ahead.

I just can't get over how incredibly desperate you sound...|`|3haXFtx7aa	lol adult friend finder. and ur really ****** up 130 being fat? u must not be that hot if its been 6 months. damn.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	In parenting?

I can already tell she's gonna be a joker (like her dad) just  because her natural facial expression is so pleasant (even though she doesn't really smile yet).

bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Just take the drugs|`|5HwgJHutaa	just try to concentrate on your breathing and push when the doc says push but your body will let you know when to push also ,the hardest thing for me was when the nurse said don't push. any way it'll all be worth it once you hear your baby's first cry and have your little one in your arms.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	i'm a big girl too and i can tell you i was sooo relieved to discover that labour isn't as hard as everyone says!  i walked for 30mins 3 times a week and i was worried i wasn't fit enough for labour - i was wrong.    don't try to lose weight now, enjoy what you can of your last two weeks.    raspberry leaf tea is supposed to help, but i didn't try it.    i suggest you get down on your hands and knees as much as humanly possible. do lots of crawling and rocking on the floor. sounds crazy but i will put your baby in the right position for birth!  having baby in that position with make it virtually painless!   it worked for me!!   i felt like a dill, but gee it helped and my 17hr labour was ENJOYABLE and the last 40mins of pushing wasn't hard at all.    trust your body, believe you can do it, and get down on your hands and knees to help bub get ready for birth :)    good luck!|`|eiWy4RiJaa	UMMm i am due  feb 15th or any day rite now  my 3rd baby i am having bad pains everyday nothing is gonna help the pain except epidural. but with my 2nd baby i did not get epidural  when i was having contractions i found as they had me walking around the hospital  walking slowly threw the contractions helped little bit, sitting in  warm tub may help, breathe threw the contractions will help little bit|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Raspberry leaf tea - 3 cups a day from now on will help with the efficiency of the contractions.  Walking might help you lose a bit of weight but I wouldn't overdo it too much.  30 minutes a day sounds about right.  Eat really well with no sugar and whole grain breads etc.    You need to read up on pain relief you can do at home before you go into hospital.  Directing a showerhead on your stomach during contractions is wonderful.  And staying upright as much as possible should help.  Don't lie on your back during labour as this is the most painful position you can be in.  If you can get hold of a Swiss ball to use as a birthing ball, they can be wonderful.  In hospital if you are in tremendous pain then ask for pain relief.    You will be absolutely fine.  I'm due in three weeks and am thinking about all these things now too.  At the end of the day the baby will come out and it just pays to relax and let your body do the work.  Relaxation is the best thing you can do for yourself. Breath deeply and imagine your gorgeous baby in your arms.  Good luck!!!|`|fjHpA5oiaa	Seriously, you're probably not getting out of the whole pain thing entirely. Walking 30 minutes a day is good for getting the muscles toned and ready, and the arteries to practice flowing, and could help you have a shorter labor. Shorter labor isn't exactly less pain, maybe condensed into a smaller amount of space, but when it's over, you'll be glad it was shorter. I don't know about the lesser weight gain being an advantage, nor the tea, but I can remember some things that helped me:  1. (haha, don't laugh), Hypnobirthing is a handy way to cope. More info at www.hypnobirthing.com. They promised me painless labor, and I wouldn't exactly call it that, but I was able to go to another place during the contractions, and probably truly didn't care about the squeezes till the last three centimeter of dilation.   2. Don't let them give you any OXYTOCIN to "speed things along" at the hospital. Especially not to start labor because you're sick of being pregnant or because the doctor wants to save himself from delivering in the middle of the night. It's a hormone that mimics the one your body will make all by itself to put you in labor, but on occasion oxytocin sends the uterus into overdrive-squeezing that doesn't necessarily make for good time. More painful than it needs to be, I think. Just say "no", sister. You do have the choice, even if the nurse acts like you don't. Remember, it's a hospital, not jail!  3. When things get intense, get on your hands and knees, let the belly hang, maybe stick your butt in the air, and you can ask someone to squeeze your butt-bones together. Oh the relief.  4. As above, so below. Which means if you want that cervix down below to open wide with each contraction and get it over with already, open your mouth up wide, like a huge "O", make some noise. Make noise that doesn't stop till every molecule of breath leaves your lungs.   5. Don't be tense, or fight against the contraction. If your contraction comes and your eyes squinch up and you grit your teeth, all your muscles are squinching tight down yonder too, when it needs to do the opposite and open. Relax. When it hurts, breathe out forever. If it hurts during this forever, again, make a long humming or grunting noise instead of the squinching (I think I made up a new word.)  6. When it comes time to push that baby out, for the love of Pete, SQUAT! Oh if I had just squatted the first time. If only it had occurred to me! We're talking a couple minutes of pushing, instead of an hour. (Although I'm sure everyone is different.) Like I said before, if a hospital employee says "No squatting" (never know what they will say you can't do) remember it is your life, and you can just squat if you damn well want to.      These 6 things have gotten me out of some really tight spots. (Haha, get it?)  I really hope some of this helps, because I know right where you are right now. I know this sounds crazy, but if you close your eyes and go through it pretty relaxed, it's kind of a trip. Your mind does new things like Timothy Leary. I think the body releases some powerful drugs of it's own.     Oh my gosh one more thing. FIRMLY MAKE YOUR DECISIONS AHEAD OF TIME IN YOUR MIND. When you are in psychadelic-labor-land, you are going to do those things you decided to do, and if you don't pick your path ahead of time, you WILL let someone else make the decision because you just want someone to help. What's so bad about that? Well, you can't prevent a long or painful labor using the "no oxytocin" rule, or the "hands and knees" rule, or the "I'm going to squat and shoot this baby out like lightning" rule if the people around you don't know about them and help you off in another direction.     So yeah anyways, congratulations to you! And remember, they (babies) always come out!
LNnRSLdtaa	they should be forced to wear a chastity belt for a month|`|rHufcHwHaa	sorry, but it doesn't make sense that you would say 'this is just among one of the many things wrong with parents these days.'  This may occur in rare cases, but honestly, how many times has anyone seen this happen?  Parents in general should not be put down for this type of practice.      To answer your question, though, I think that a child should be able to call social services or the police, and have them handle the matter.|`|3a0d6717f085518722c0b3739942ccc2aa	Chastity belts are abusive for anyone, not only males.  Anyone who applies such practices on other people should be forced to wear one day in and day out.  Not to mention that they have no business raising children to begin with. methods|`|rid4brOnaa	What is the reason for the chastity belts? Is this a religious thing? I'm not sure that a chastity belt would restrict growth, but as the body itself grows, a larger size belt would be needed.
kaqPSgTVaa	4-16 days. On average it's about 7. That's why it's good to wait to test until 14 days after ovulation or sex because your body does not start producing the pregnancy hormone until AFTER implantation has occurred.|`|Fq7FHQ44aa	takes 72 hrs for sperm to fertilize with the egg. The implantation in the womb, takes about a week.    hope that helps!
akDgTIQ4aa	There are several ways to narrow down the window of ovulation.     Cervical mucous (vaginal discharge) changes throughout your cycle. If you monitor these changes, you may be able to pinpoint ovulation. CM after your period is generally creamy or sticky, white in color, and doesn't stretch at all. As you near ovulation it will start to get clear with white streaks and stretch further. 2-3 days before ovulation and for some women on the day of, CM becomes watery or thick, clear, and stretchy. It can stretch between your fingers 2-5 inches. It resembles the consistency of raw egg whites. This is known as fertile cervical mucous, or egg white cervical mucous. There are 2 ways you can check your CM. When you go to the bathroom, before you pee, take toilet paper and wipe the outside of your vagina. Look at the discharge on it and determine whether it is fertile or not. If you're comfortable with your body you can insert 2 clean fingers into your vagina and get a sample of your CM that way. I personally think it's easier to examine that way.     You can also chart your basal body temperature. This is your temp upon first waking up in the morning. You need a basal body thermometer, not just a regular one. You can buy them at any drugstore for $8-16. You must take your temperature before doing anything. Don't talk, move around a lot, get up, go to the bathroom or anything. Just wake up and take your temp. You must have gotten at least 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep before temping, and you must temp at the same time every morning for accurate results. Just set an alarm next to your bed and put your thermometer next to it so you don't have to move much to grab it. You can temp orally or vaginally. If you sleep with your mouth open, you should temp vaginally for better results. You can print out BBT charts online or there are several websites that you can enter your data in to and it will tell you when you ovulate. A few good ones are www.fertilityfriend.com and www.babymed.com. After you ovulate your body temperature will rise due to an increase in the hormone progesterone. After 2-3 months you should be able to compare your charts and figure out when you ovulate.     You can also purchase Ovulation Prediction Kits (OPK) These work similar to a pregnancy test. You pee on them (or dip them in urine) and they will tell you if you have a high level of lutenizing hormone, which is present 24-36 hours before ovulation. You can purchase these at any drug store as well.     Most women with a typical 28 day cycle will ovulate on days 13-15 of their cycle. Your cycle begins with the first day of your period and ends the day before your next period begins.     Sperm can live up to 5 days in the vagina, so the most fertile times are 5 days before ovulation, the day of ovulation and the day after. If you can narrow down when in your cycle you ovulate and have sex every other day (or every day if you can manage it) during that window, you will have pretty good chances. But also remember that it can take time, a normal healthy woman only has a 20% chance of conceiving in any given cycle under perfect conditions. It usually takes around 3-6 months for a healthy couple to achieve conception, and sometime up to a year. Anything over a year could signal an issue with either you or your partner, and should be checked out by a reproductive endocrinologist. You've got a long way to go, just be patient :) (stress can inhibit conception)    I hope this will help you out, and I wish you luck!|`|2HETgiwgaa	Try charting your temps - get a BBT (basal body temperature) thermometer, and take your temps each morning around the same time, as soon as you wake up and before you do anything else.  You should see your temperature rise and get three days of high temps in row - then you'll know when you ovulated which is the day before the temperature rise.  You can also try checking your CM (cervical mucous) and position of your cervix (you get egg white, stretchy CM and a high, soft cervix when you are at your most fertile).  Try using a charting site like fertilityfriend.com - the software will help you see when you ovulate|`|MpzmnbCZaa	have your gyno put u on provera to jump start ur periods if that doesnt work he or she may give u metformin(regulate periods) and clomid(help you ovulate and release and egg.. i wish u the best of luck
1CryEnb3aa	That is exactly what I told my co-worker who was accusing me of being pregnant.  She was right!  The "flu"  never got worse, and I got a + on my hpt!  It was morning sickness.  I couldn't believe it, thought it was too soon to feel that way.  I was only 4 weeks.  I stayed sick the whole time with that pregnancy.  My first however, I never really had morning sickness.  Go figure.  Good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Not the flu no. I did have sore breasts/nipples but I would get that occasionaly with my period as well so I figured I wasn't pregnant.|`|Fq7FHQ44aa	not flu exactly but temperature fluctuations for sure!|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	both times that ive been pregnant i felt like i had the flu really bad. it lasted about a week. i had a blocked nose and achy muscles. my nipples both times got sore a few days after i concieved.  for me these were early pregnancy signs,but everyones different.the only way to really know is by taking a test.  good luck.|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Yep that's what I thought I had. But then found out I was 3 months prego|`|f2d89272f3e228493a1f7ea002fea3efaa	Not that early..I started getting symptoms at about 6 weeks and got flu like sickness at 7 weeks and it stuck around until 16 weeks.  To me it sounds like you are either getting sick with a virus or you have PMS.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I didn't get the sore breasts and nipples, but I did just feel weird.  I nearly fainted once, I was moody and I just didn't feel right.  I thought I had cancer or something - ha ha.  Little did I know it was very early pregnancy.      You shouldn't really be feeling like you are getting the flu though.  It could mean you have a UTI which are common in pregnancy - so if it continues to get worse please go to the doctor asap.
n6XYYyoLaa	find a way to destress; imagery, music , whatever works for u...u don't say how old ur baby is or if bfing is already well established; u could also pump between feedings to try to keep the demand side up....supply and demand....take a warm bath when you get home...and go from there..gl|`|oIFMohfUaa	Oorah...THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING!  I think the best thing you can do is try to keep yourself hydrated, extra water and juices.    Be sure when you nurse to sit back and relax...focus SOLELY on your baby and don't sit and think about other things for that time!  There are some teas that help to keep milk production up.  Go to www.kellymom.com/herbal/milksupply/fenug... for some advice.    This sounds silly, but my sister in law taught me to sing or hum a Christmas song, such as Silent Night, etc...it helps you to relax because you are breathing deeper and exhaling which forces you to relax!  Baby also loves the sound!  It's actually been proven that you can't be "down" humming/whistling/singing a Christmas tune...it just ups your mood! Haha    RELAX...meditate, swim, etc.    Good luck~|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Just keep feeding and take time to chill if you can. Keep breast feeding and if you need to you could see a doctor about a medication that helps your body make more milk|`|7Y3yhUtcaa	I tried the herb (seeds, actually) fenugreek and it really, really worked to increase supply.    http://www.babycenter.com/404_can-the-he...    You have to keep taking it but it works!  Also nurse as often as possible when you're with the little one.|`|e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	If you need to go to a bottle don't worry.    When you breast feed try to get yourself and the baby in a zen like place. Actually nursing releases hormones that make you relax.    First drink hot milk or non caffeine tea or just some hot water.  Start some slow deep breathing while you set your quiet place up.  Turn down the lights. Put on some quiet relaxing music. Put your head back to rest and concentrate on your body relaxing. The baby will sense your mood. You can also take a hot cloth and put on your breasts before hooking the baby up.     You can perhaps do some stretches before sitting or laying down to breast feed.    Some mom's drink a can of beer before nursing. Not every time they nurse  but in the evening while the family unwinds. You can check with Laleche league about that|`|dPmK83UYaa	Keep feeding, maybe the baby is not eating as much and that's why there's not as much milk. U can pump when she is not feeding just to stimulate and make ur body think baby needs more so that u have more but if the baby doesn't drink it all then you will have to pump when she is done to get the rest out.     Baby's appetites fluctuate. Don't worry so much and just relax and enjoy your little one! Find a method of relaxation! Pray. or something|`|cfda3b7dd50be9f4212c9c47c45cc4b9aa	Drink tea with milk to increase the supply of milk. Just boil some water, add tea into it then after some time add milk. That will increase the supply.  You can eat wallnuts, those make milk thicker.

wVvdVJJraa	Yes, it is very possible!! I have a two year old daughter, and had sex 4 days b4 my ovulation day! Sperm can live in your body for up to 4/5 days with the right conditions. If you are planning on getting pregnant, I would try having sex again in two days, and another two days after that.. U want to give his body time to re-create more sperm, and having sex every other day, even after u think u have ovulated will up your chances, and you will be covering any bases incase you ovulate late!! Good luck to you! And if you weren't planning on becoming pregnant, go to the pharmacy and get plan B.|`|weBvwrloaa	quite possible. You can get pregnant at any time honestly but more likely when you ovulate. You generally ovulate 10 to 12 days before you start your cycle but it is not unheard of or uncommon to conceive  when you arent' ovulating. If you arent on a prescribed form of birth control, unless you want a baby, go get the "plan b" pill. It stops pregnancy up to 72 hours after sex. If you are 18 and over, you can buy it at any pharmacy without a prescription for anywhere from $25- $75(depends on your state and the pharmacy) unless you have insurance. If you are under 18, you must first obtain a prescription. You just walk up to the counter and tell them that  you need the plan b pill and show i.d. It's that easy. No questions asked.|`|BaXruEcqaa	oh yes, sperm can live in you for up to 5 days.|`|vNaAZU3gaa	yes definitely.  It is said that if you get preganant before your ovulation you'll have a girl and if you get preganant near or after you'll have a boy. Good luck.|`|IvU7WH8baa	yes it takes about 3 days for the sperm to get to the feb tubes to get federalize|`|KlKomVgPaa	yes it is possible ...A lot of baby dusts to you|`|nU5rIC2oaa	It is possible to get pregnant due to that sperm lives for 72 hours.  If you are not planning to get pregnant my recommendation for you is to go to the pharmacy and get the Next-Day pill.|`|RINX5KTTaa	Very likely,   one thing you must understand, is that most people who accidently get pregnant, dont know when there ovulation days are exactly, so therefor, they get pregnant at diffrent times of the month. You can get pregnant anytime of the month regaurdless. Check in a couple of weeks if you are pregnant, by takeing a test. Some women wont get pregnant when the man has ejaculated in her right away, so if you are trying to get pregnant, dont be to anxious!    Good Luck :)
0OTV0a4Zaa	of course you can still be pregnant unless you took plan b or something. sperm can survive in the uterus for up to 10 days,some people ovulate twice in one month,and it is very very hard  to determine when your going to ovulate because it's different every month. you can take a test in 3 days,when your periods due the test should be accuarte by then. or you could go to the doctors and have a blood test done which would tell you by now.  good luck|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	yes|`|bAkYn7ySaa	50/50 next time make sure u use it proper if u dont want to pregnant|`|vNaAZU3gaa	usually your best chances of getting pregnant is during your ovulation which is in between periods. My girl friend and i was wondering the same thing along time ago, so I looked it up on web md.. If you want to know fast if your pregnant get the 5 days before your missed period ept test.Good luck..|`|LgC2oA77aa	probably not|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Just what you said. Ovulation can occur at any time so yes you can still be pregnant. You can always go and get the Plan B morning after pill at your local pharmacy. It has to be taken within the first 72 hours to prevent pregnancy though so get it soon.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	yes and sperm could live in your vagina for days|`|4TNavgDuaa	Possible!|`|pWDYcBA7aa	Yes it is very possible!
M1gL4Jd6aa	If you are breastfeeding then the baby will act as a liposuction machine - ha ha.  It really does suck the fat out of you.  If you are not breastfeeding then I suggest gentle walks with the pram and then maybe some Pilates which is good for toning your stomach and getting everything back to normal.  Also eat good nourishing food and cut out all the sugar in your diet.  You still have to take it easy for quite a while in terms of exercise as all your ligaments and muscles have the hormone Relaxin acting on them  and it is easy to do damage to yourself.  Remember it can take a good year to get back to your pre-pregnancy size and even then you will not look exactly like you did before baby.  Just learn to love yourself the way you are and work on losing the weight slowly.  A post pregnancy body should be seen as a badge of honour!!!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Diet if you aren't breastfeeding. Diet and exercise.|`|0iuvUhMpaa	hey hun  are you breast feeding? that is spose to help women slim down really quickly but apart from that all you can really do is exercise, squats and crunches are good =]  congrats on the baby!!

Also if your truely having the symptoms and not just thinking of them go see your doctor.     I would say wait 2 days if nothing go see your OB/GYN|`|EcA8khvAaa	It depends on when your period was supposed to be. If you really think you could be pregnant, then make a doctor's appointment.|`|AA12313700	I would say it would depend on how late your period is. If it is at least a month late then yes have a blood test done but if not give yourself at least a month because sometimes a woman's body has similiar symptoms for your period coming as it does when your pregnant.|`|UTiV9xTYaa	That will tell you one way or another for sure. It cost $50 normally. I suggest waiting it out a couple more weeks and take another home test, you are probably testing to early.|`|7d3fad3c1155c7afa9f7842d8d09f641aa	It depends on how late you are...if you are only a couple days late then I would wait because believe it or not thinking your pregnant can actually make you have symptoms of pregnancy.  However if its been longer and it is always on your mind then sure, go ahead, it cant hurt and it will definately give you a sure answer.|`|yIsY81pCaa	yeah|`|s6MzpFVYaa	go make a Dr app they will give you a urine test, their test will tell you or go to your local health/wic clinic they give them for free but you still need to see your gyn you may be stressed and that's why your not having a period this month|`|kqTbzCXGaa	Did you take the pregnancy tests a week apart?  Be patient. Make sure you wait until you have skipped a period, then test every week or so. If you skip more than one period, go see your OB/GYN|`|jGkQvgsYaa	I would wait for a few more days to test at home again before I would ask for a blood test because you might be testing to early! If you are really late then go in to your doctor and tell them that you might be pregnant and all the hpt yo took were neg! Also try a different test with a lower level of HCG needed! A good web site to find out the levels is listed below!
qVh1PMiwaa	If you mean tanning from the tanning beds then yes it is bad for your baby because of the radiation and the heat at least that's what the doctor told my sister when she found out she was pregnant and plus the tanning beds aren't good for you either it can cause skin cancer and other problems.But if you mean tanning outside then I don't see how that would be bad for the baby just make sure you don't get to hot and drink lots of cold liquid like water ,gatorade,and powerade.|`|JBcd1Q5Daa	its worse for you than it is for your child (cancer)|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	The only time it's okay to tan is after you give birth.    When the baby is in your womb, you are the thermastat. You control the temperature. If your body temperature gets above 100*, you are going to be basically boiling your baby!!    Use a gradual tanner and protect yourself and your baby.|`|AA10140930	i wouldn't|`|2mXSfZJTaa	no way|`|PUluFXlsaa	I was told by my doctor not to go tanning for 2 reasons.     1 the heat...it's the same reason you aren't supposed to go in a hot tub or sauna while pregnant.     2 because a pregnant womans skin can react differently to things you used to do. I can't wear the same makeup I used to and I will burn to a crisp in the sun unless I wear SPF 30 or higher. I used that same makeup for 2 years and I never used to burn.    But then again, that's not to say I don't have a bottle of tanning lotion and 20 tanning sessions already bought for after the baby is born!! :) Good Luck!|`|b1128bab52b8a8244f716a257c7d914eaa	I wouldn't tan at all.  Heat is bad for the baby, and why risk it?  When you see your precious child's face, you'll be happy you took EVERY precaution and a missing a more tan body for one summer is no sacrifice.|`|W8sYapAeaa	I'm not too sure about it. I don't think a tanning salon will allow you to tan. If you're going to be lounging outside, I think it will be ok; just not for long periouds of time.|`|VAToKGwSaa	No excessive heat just like taking a hot bath can cause brain abnormalities in the fetus especially in the first trimester.  Stay away from tanning beds... if your doing it outside there is still a danger of becoming over heated.|`|YeZuty3Qaa	you can cause skin problems to your baby|`|Z6Nuz5I1aa	I can understand why you would want to be tan while your pregnant--its sexy! However, I think that tanning is one of those things that causes unnecessary risk on your fetus. Tanning yourself is questionable when it comes to cancer risk, so why would you want to take any risks on your baby? I wish I could say just do spray tan, but what about the chemicals in those? Basically, when it comes to pregnancy always err on the side of caution. Here is what one site said in an article about the subject:    "The main reason that using a tanning bed or similar is bad for you and your unborn baby is due to the level of heat your body reaches during the session. Think about how hot these sessions are and how uncomfortable they are for you at times, now imagine the affect that this would have on a developing baby. We all feel much better with a tan and there's no reason not to continue tanning while pregnant, however choosing lotions and oils rather than beds is much the safer option."(http://www.pregnancywizard.com/...  Another article:  http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/pregnanc...    Good luck with your pregnancy, and good for you for seeking to do the right thing. If anything, always check with your OB-GYN.|`|cb76b5cf2e273e704d7f31195504dc33aa	The poster who commented on the heat is right. You shouldn't tan for the same reasons you shouldn't get into hot tubs or extremely hot baths. If your body temp rises, it can raise your risks for miscarriage or brain damage for your baby. Your baby won't be able to control it's own body temp, sometimes until after it's born. It's up to you. Mystic Tan is always a great alternative.|`|Wgv3psAjaa	I used the Jergens tan lotion. That way I avoided getting skin cancer and still had a nice glow.|`|dU7lpZFSaa	I asked my OB/GYN the same question and she told me that when ever I warm up my body I am warming up the fetus. A tanning bed gets very hot and your body gets even hotter on the inside for the fetus, whihc is not good! She advised me against this for my entire pregnancy.  There are lots of self-tanning products that have a great effect and don't put the fetus at risk.|`|lJSHAkoraa	WOULD U WANT YOUR MOM TANNING WHILE YOU WERE IN HER WOMB?|`|dbbc96707652448861857d7e1a147af3aa	Tanning beds are a big NO.  Why don't you find a self tanning lotion and use that?  I am using one and it really works.    As for outside, guess its better then tanning bed.  Make sure to have lots of water or gatoraid to drink.  Also limit time outside when above 90 out.
9OrQiohSaa	Look at the back of the birth control box you have, it should tell you or "Google" your birth control brand and research it on it's official site. I'm almost positive birth control doesn't harm the baby if you are pregnant.|`|ay7P57XLaa	OMG YES!!!!! If u think ur stop taking them Please!!!! u can miscarry or cause birth defects.|`|HblNpxGraa	No!! Read your Birth Control info from the box and it will tell you that it's not harmful for the baby!! When you don't know you are preg your body doesn't respond until you realize it and take a test. Once you find out stop the pills. Go read the Info on your birth control!!|`|0Sy5sFnHaa	My mom was on B.C pills when she got pregnant with me.  I was the only one born with birth defects out of my siblings. Not serious ones, but they include a heart murmor, poor eye vision, my teeth weren't straight. and I was born with 2 cysts on my head {they were removed} the doctors blamed it all on the B.C pills.|`|J9oQ8dCYaa	If you want a physician's answers, please call your doctor.  Current literature does not indicate that birth control causes harm to a fetus.  There is potential, which is why you are supposed to stop.  There are some anecdotal cases where stopping birth control suddenly led to miscarriage (research hasn't really born this out so it's just as likely coincidence).|`|fnP5yLvPaa	my friend found out she was 8 wks pregnant while taking the pill(during that whole time) she has a beautiful healthy 9 month old girl|`|iuUEB0heaa	Some birth control box inserts specifically say it will not hurt, but if you are pregnant, discontinue use immediately.  One particular commercial comes to mind recently where they say, "Women who are pregnant should not take the pill."  Talk to your doc and read the box insert or go to the website to be sure.  It should alleviate your fears until you reach your doc.  If you catch it early enough, you should be fine.  Try not to stress out about it right now and just start taking care of yourself the best you can physically and emotionally starting today.  Congrats if you are!|`|938aefe2015bdad9a64549c10e00812eaa	Yes!  Birth control works by preventing the fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine lining.  If you are pregnant and taking the pill, it will definitely cause a miscarriage.
w8zZrbxWaa	You can get pregnant after anything....you think people would know this by now.|`|OaxWErLraa	yes! And sometimes it's not a good thing. Let your body have time to heal before trying again.|`|J9oQ8dCYaa	Yes you can.  Unfortunately, the miscarriage rate if you got pregnant the very next cycle is somewhat high.  Not a guaranteed loss however, but you should just be aware of that.|`|1ddcbe75f31dd36391d2ce294a3e3c02aa	yes|`|0MbiROgJaa	Yes but yuo shoul wait like 3 months or at least till your menstrual cycle returns to normal. Let your body heal and chances are it will be safer also.|`|b86f5c1719ebb70ca65aeaa7b8f26dc5aa	yes you can but when I miscarried I was advised to wait  3 months before tryingto get pregnant and then it took me 8 months to concive|`|rv90J4kJaa	Can you get pregnant? Yes, however, it's not advisable. You need to give your body time to heal, plus sex right after a miscarriage isn't a great idea because of the risk of infection.

I like that Lincoln has the nickname Linc.  But it is a surname.  Still a favorite and I love Everett.    Oliver is a favorite also, but I don't like the nicknames.  It has the advantage for me of not being a surname though.    Roberts is okay, much prefer Everett.    If I had to pick, I would probably go with Oliver.|`|0xGm3lrxaa	Oliver Roberts|`|4OUszQ6zaa	I like Lincoln Everett. I think it's a really nice name. It's very unique and original as well.

krQiDGCHaa	Stop giving him a choice.  He is 2 1/2, he can understand your words.  Tell him he gets no milk until he eats some food -- period.    At this point, however, since you've allowed him to "rule the roost" so to speak, you're in for a long battle.  Your son probably will have texture problems at this point, having not eaten solid food before.  It will probably take a lot of practice before he will actually eat and enjoy anything.    Deny him the milk until he eats food.  And stop giving him a bottle, please.  He is 2 1/2, using a bottle is bad for his teeth.  Get him a sippy cup.  Nuby brand sippy cups have a top that is similar to a nipple of a bottle, which helps.  Or, get him a sippy cup with a straw -- which are best for your child's teeth.    Also, speak with your doctor about options to get him to eat solid foods.  They may have a suggestion.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	He can probably start taking vitamins & Pediasure. My 2.5 year old won't touch milk. She sure does love junk food. I give her supplements and she thinks it's candy.    **My goodness. She gets her nutritional balance still. Doctors says it's common for kids to not want milk at this age. If you can't get it from food, supplements are a great option. My daughters eats food all day long. No one's kid is going to want everything that's good for them. You're not a bad mom! You're concerned and expressing it. =)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Have you spoken to his doctor about this? Sounds like you need some outside help. Just don't give him a bottle is a start. He'll eat eventually when he's hungry enough. Stop babying him and he'll do what he's supposed to. See a doctor though.|`|XjtZAFOyaa	1st of all a 2.5 yr old kid should not be drinking from a bottle. not only does it make you look stupid as a parent because you do not know how to wean or raise your children but it also messes up their teeth.  and trust me a child will eat if they are hungry. do not give in to what they want. who is in control in this relationship? do not give him a milk bottle, only milk with a meal or after a meal.  in order to get him to eat give him small amounts of food and tell him if he eats it all he can have milk (from a cup!)...you are saposed to be in control don't be a pushover.|`|xOr67VDiaa	he is still coming to terms about not being a baby anymore, give him time and dont rush it, just let it come naturally with a bit of mums help. they still get the satisfaction from milk, it makes their belly's feel really full and they can relax.. he really shouldn't have a bottle from now on, but slowly minimize the about he has.. don't stress he is only 2.it will all work out.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Interesting.. I am anemic, wonder if I was the same!!!    Good idea possibly... He will most likely LOVE it...  at walgreens they sell Ensure for kids... It is packed with vitamins, and things..  it is specifically designed for tykes..  Might help..    I couldnt find the exact link for it, but on some other reviews it said it worked great for this other womans child who did the same as yours here is the link with the review from her..    I hope it helps, almost guareenteed he will like it, cause he think it is milk or nummy nummys :-)    Good luck he will come around.. :-)    (*edit, the link i posted is for the regular ensure, you could ask pharmacys if they carry ensure for kids, there are alot more vitamins and such int them!*)|`|dPmK83UYaa	ya that's the age of defiance! hee hee. mine is the same age. It usually takes a lot of bargaining. The boy will cry and whine but he's just testing you!    Bargain 4-5 bites of food (or 2-3) for his milk...Make it fun...count w/ him while he's taking his bites and give him LOTS of praise and love. Boys love praise and feeling like "THEY DID IT!!! YAY!"     If this works try to entice him to eat some more a little later. :-)  Hope this helps!|`|Heux22X5aa	Don't offer anything but food. Eventually he'll eat what's offered.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	first of all he's old enough to drink from a cup and not from a bottle,So you could try to throw away all the bottles and maybe that will lead him to decrease the ammount of milk that he's drinking.You could use plates that have all kind of pictures on them so that he can play while you feed him.Talk to a padiatrician for sure!Good luck|`|E5CnUdhsaa	take him off teh bottle and see your doc about vitamins. he will not starve himeself, if hes only ever taking a bottle you may struggle to feed him as he wont be used to all these textures so take it sloooowly|`|Irdj2KAFaa	Prepare an activity that involves your sons assistance in throwing away the bottles and nipples. He needs to be able to see them going 'bye-bye', into the trash, never to return. When he asks for a bottle, remind him that he threw them in the trash; because he is a big boy now...etc. This was suggested to my wife and I, and within 48 hours we were successful in weaning.    Forget about everyone's careless remarks of how your 2.5 is too old for bottles. There are worse things in life, such as, like when my wife and I saw a 5 year old with a binky while taking our 3yr old to the movies. If your brushing his teeth regularly, he should not suffer any pre-mature tooth decay.    Again, if you follow my suggestion, be prepared for the next 48 hours of whining/crying.     Also, (this might have helped our situation) my son used to drink from my Arrowhead sport-top bottle, which I think also helped in the transition.    HTH
Lor20kXcaa	I couldn't walk for two weeks, couldn't get up the stairs for four...    I couldn't even lift my baby daughter for the first 6 weeks of her life.    I couldn't get up by myself, even pull myself up to sitting.    C-section is MAJOR surgery.     However, if you give birth naturally, your vagina will be fine, and you'll be up and walking the same day.    C-sections are not easy or desirable.    I had an emergency one with my first due to medical problems.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	The vagina does go back to what it was before.  Sheesh, people are not walking around with vagina's that they can flap and fly away with here people.  Why would you choose a major abdominal surgery where they cut through your muscle, cut your uterus open, and then sew and staple you closed...yes..that sounds SO much better!      C-sections are to be when mother and/or infant are in distress.Unless your doctor recommends it, it's really doubtful that he/she would perform a c-section with no reason.|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..  i think yes, a woman can ask for a c-section if she doesn't wants a natural delivery i have some friends who asked for it and were given a c- section on their request..!!    i think vagina really goes back to what it was before birth if healed properly with a good span of time..!!    for more details you should always ask your doctor's that what they say & recommend to stay on the safe side...  well how many months/weeks are you along in pregnancy...& is this your 1st..???    would love to hear from you..    hope all this have helped you..!!|`|gTun7ZoHaa	I don't think they will let you have a c section if everything is fine, only if something happens during delivery that puts either you or baby at risk.    I had a emergency c section with my 1st due to complications. im now 35w+3d with 2 and ive got hospital on monday to find out how baby is growing and doing, and to see if they will let me try naturally or if it will be a planned c section.    I did ask the doctor what my chances of a normal delivery would be this time round and ive been told 80%.  I also asked what happened if i decided to have a c section again, was told they would not rule it out and they would listen to why i wanted the c section but would push for me to try VBAC    As ive never had a vagina delivery as yet i cant really answer that question but i had been told it goes back to what it was before delivery.|`|6jzxRHr4aa	Ditto to the last 2 answers.  I had an emergency c-section, under general anesthesia, 3 months ago because they lost my daughter's heart tones during labor (it took 9 minutes for the neonatal team to  recuscitate her when they pulled her out-she's absolutely fine now though.)      Think about it.  It is abdominal surgery.  Would you want to have your appendix out for the heck of it?  It hurts to cough, laugh, move, everything.  And you are still dealing with all the lochia (bleeding) afterward.  My husband was having to bathe me and help me to bed for a week, and after that, I was improved but still painful for a total of 2 weeks.  Then I got a fever a week later and felt like crap, and couldn't go see my daughter in NICU (it ended up that my incision was infected.)And don't get me started on constipation!!!  I told my doc after the fact, I couldn't understand why anyone would choose to do that for the simple reason of not wanting to go through the pain of labor.  Your hoo-ha hurts (or little to not at all if you get an epidural) for a short time and you can still function, versus having your gut sliced open and hurting for weeks.  Is there really that much to think about?  Of course, I can only give one perspective because I only labored for a little while before being rushed to OR, and this was my first baby.    I have a friend who had section, and she ended up back in ICU herself a week later with a DVT (blood clot.)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	most SMART doctors won't do it- why because it's not as healthy for mother OR baby. 1/2,500 c-sections results in death compared to 1/10,000 for vaginal births. also, many c-section babies need oxygen after because the fluid is not squeezed out of their lungs like a vaginal birth. major surgery carries a lot of risks. the recovery froma  c-section is horrible and yes your vagina does go back to normal     have you ever watched one on TV? they are litterally pulling you apart with force! it's scary. i refused to have one when tehey told me i was not dilating enough- i eventually did on my OWN time and i was up and walking around an hour later|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	A good doctor isn't going to do a c-section just because the mother is afraid of stretching out her vag.      Come on, are you serious? a c-section is major surgery, not a choice most people will take|`|kaqPSgTVaa	She can ask her doctor but most won't do it unless it's necessary because it is a major surgery. Sorry.     Hun. Our bodies were MADE to carry and give birth to babies. Your vagina is going to be the same size it was after your first birth no question. Nobody ever gets flopping in the wind vaginas. :) LOL Don't worry. Seriously.|`|L5IsUhacaa	Its all up to the woman. But I think the doctors will push towards a natural birth than towards a c-section. If the vagina is well beyond normal size, and won't return due to birthing a half dozen children, one can have hymenoplasy, which consists of suturing up the hymen and the vaginal wall. With this procedure, its like giving your virginity away, again. This procedure is normally done with rape victims whom marry, and want to give there virginity to there husbands.
dDVAUA9saa	Kindermusik  Swimming lessons  Gymnastics  Art classes  Skating  Playgroup or nursery school    I'm due in June and my daughter will be just over 2 then.  We are going to do kindermusik, swimming lessons and gymnastics (not all at the same time!).|`|hwIMJBVpaa	an art class for little kids. wont she be in preschool?|`|HyknHVV5aa	Dancing, gymnastics, swimming for tots, soccer, singing classes (mostly singing along, clapping)|`|Riw9SwIHaa	well music is always the best choice for little kids, play her/him music all types and try to get your kid involved with instruments young, it helps a lot with awareness, and brain activity.|`|AA10526033	see if your library has a story hour or something. my oldest went for 2 yrs and loved it. they read a story and did a little craft based on the story. it was really fun for both of us.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Definitely gymnastics!  Whether she sticks with it when she's older, or just does it for a couple years, there is no better activity for a preschooler than gymnastics!    Gymnastics is a natural activity for kids; every preschooler loves to run, jump, climb, swing and tumble.  Gymnastics gives them a chance to do what they love in a safe, supervised environment.  And there are so many benefits!  She'll gain strength, agility and coordination - things that will give her a huge advantage in any other sport or activity she does in the future.   She'll learn how to fall and land safely.  Kids with a background in gymnastics experience fewer injuries in play or other sports, because they've learned what their body can do, and what its limitations are.      She'll learn to feel comfortable with her body, and she'll gain courage and confidence.  Walking on a beam, pulling herself over a bar, mastering a cartwheel - all these things will give her a feeling of accomplishment and boost her self esteem. And gymnastics is a great preparation for preschool or kindergarten.  She'll learn to listen to her teacher, follow rules, take turns, etc... while doing something fun and active.    If I still haven't convinced you, let me tell you about my experience as a gymnastics coach. My main job was coaching the upper level teams, but I also taught a few preschool classes.  Compared to the advanced gymnasts, the preschoolers couldn't really "do" much, gymnastically.  But once a month, we'd have a "Bring a Friend" day, when the preschoolers could bring a buddy to try out the class.  That was always such an eye-opener!  It was AMAZING to see how far ahead our regular students were, even after just a few months in the class.  The "friends" were so far behind developmentally. They didn't know how to jump or skip; couldn't climb a small ladder or hang from a bar; were afraid to walk on a low beam, or jump off a small block.  We felt so bad for those kids, imagining some of them in a couple years: being the last ones picked for the team in gym class; being the only girl on the playground who can't do a cartwheel; or just feeling weak, gangly and uncoordinated.    So yeah - there are benefits to any activity you may choose for your daughter.  But expose her to gymnastics for sure!  It will help her in so many ways!
o9nSygbEaa	You don't say how early her babues were, which will make a bit of a difference. But, she would probably like a few "preemie" outfits. My preemies swam in newborn clothes. We dind't have a lot of preemie clothes but we got a few sleepers and it was nice having things they fit in and didn't end up pulling their arms and legs out of the sleeves. If you have a Childrens Place store near you, I LOVED their sleepers. Most baby cloethes are made for short, fat babies. Childrens Place sleepers tended to be a little longer, but made for thinner babies and fit my preemies (born at 28 weeks) really well when they came home.     Also, it was ncie when people were excited about the babies and wanted to see pictures, etc. Having a preemie is tough and it was sometimes made tougher by always having people act like I deserved pity. Be happy for your friend because although she is going though a tough time, she just had a baby and as long as the baby is doing well, it's a happy time. Of course, by a shoulder to cry on if that's what she needs but there are times she probably just wants to be able to feel excited about having a new baby and wants someone to be excited for her.     You can also ask her if there's anything she still needs for baby. When mine were born, since I was 12 weeks early, I was totally unprepared. In fact, to this day I have no idea where our first box of diapers came from LOL. Ask her if she needs you to do a shopping trip for essentials, or needs a stash of adult food in the house like chips or ice cream since she may have been very unprepared.     Basically anything helps and having people around who aren't afraid to ask about the preemie baby and who are willing to act like it's a happy event sometimes made it much easier to cope while mine were in the NICU.|`|AA10526033	preemie clothes and diapers. when my first was preemie you could barely buy preemie clothes any where and it was horrible trying to fit her in regular baby clothes. my 2nd preemie basically had a full preemie baby wardrobe..it was great!|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My son was a 31 weeker and I found that the best gift was preemie clothes. They are hard to find and really expensive if you buy them in the hospital gift shop. My MIL and my Grandmother found some at wal-mart but all they had was preemie sleepers. Didn't matter, they have a hard time regulating their body temp, so he lived in sleepers the 1st 2 months of his life.  (Make sure you get ones that button and not zip. Sometimes preemies come home with apnea/heart rate monitors and there are wires that can't come out through a zipper)    Also, just like another Mommy said, if she is going to formula feed get her a few cans of NeoSure. It's a bit more pricey than regular formula (anywhere between 16 and 19 dollars a can depending on the store), but they are a life saver.     Also, if this baby was a "surprise" preemie, you might want to help set up the nursery with daddy. I know my son coming so early was a surprise and we didn't even have his crib put together, let alone his room set up and ready.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	both my boys were born preemies.  and the best gifts we got from friends were the immediate neccessities, like preemie diapers and preemie formula like Nan and Neosure.    my husband and i were pretty tired when we came home from the hospital on both deliveries that we didn't immediately have time to shop for these. so these gifts were lifesavers!    but i would ask your friend, too. :)|`|AA11391968	Preemie diapers for when the baby comes home.  They are expensive.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	When do you think your going to shut the hell up and do something worth typing you retard? :)    Eat ME!|`|7CoVXfA1aa	Warm outfits, like little prem woollen ones. Like all newborn babies their bodies can't regulate temperature but more dangerous for prems. If they weren't expecting a premature or very small bub they may not have a lot of clothes in prem size (newborn will swim on them!).  Back when my friend and I were born (both prem) there weren't any prem outfits and you had to use dolls clothes! My friend was very small (only a few pound!) and 9wks early and her Mum used to cry because she couldn't find any clothes for her!  Also remember that they may not have all the bits and pieces for the baby yet - my parents still had the pram on layby! You could see if there was anything she'd meant to pick up  but hasn't yet and do some running around for her so she doesn't stress.  Otherwise something for her personally like a nice toiletry set or nightgown if she's going to have to stay in a long time, to help her feel better and more "normal".  Hope this helped a bit.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Totally agree on finding out if she needs anything fr the baby she didn't have time to buy...my eldest was 7 weeks early and I hadn't bought a thing lol.   Don't forget Mum though...how about a little pack you can make up for her with some lip balm and moisturiser (its so very hot and dry in special care and your skin really suffers)...also don't forget that the hospital can provide baby with premi clothes while she is in hospital..but by the time she comes home baby may be in newborn or even 0-3 months size so ask mum first what size she thinks she'll need. As its winter a really cute snow suit would be a lovely gift to come home in after a hot hospital :)
UUysEV0yaa	Honestly, my son was the exact same aga when that happened to me. I left it too long and fed him too much from my right side (it was so much easier) and then I lost my milk on the left side. I fed him soley on the right side for probably 2 1/2  to 3 months (completely weaned at 11 months) on one side. No problem really, I still had enough milk but it was awkward looking in the mirror. In the end they were almost 2 sizes different. I had to wear 2 breast milk pads on the left side to make them match!  Now that Ive stopped feeding him (I havent  fed him for 6 months) they are basically back to normal. I mean they are the same size but if im looking in the mirror my right nippke is slightly lower than the left.   If I had my chance again I wouldnt have let that happen. I wish I hadnt. Please dont make the same mistake as I did. On saying that, you can successfully feed from one breast- I did it!|`|af79b286b208d9345788435fdeb00b17aa	express off the one he doesn't like x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Call up your doctor and ask him. Honestly that's my answer. Have him check you out.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	is it possible to pump out of the one he doesnt feed on?  My daughter was the same way... (*both now that I think of it...*)  My 4year old only liked the Right, my 2 year old only liked the left.. When I was feeding them I would pump the other and let daddy get a chance to do a feeding.  It is also good for them to bond also!!  :-)|`|4kfljeIGaa	If you have a breast pump, try pumping from the left as you feed him, then freeze the pumped milk for later.      Lots of babies seem to prefer the right one...not sure why.|`|L5IsUhacaa	Your right breast has been used more that the left one. It seems that you may have to ask a GYNO to be for sure if you may have breast cancer, or you just may have to have plastic surgery to get lateral breast symetry. Ask the doctor they may know better.
2irmTjQ3aa	What is in the picture is definately not a penis. I have seen many ultrasounds of my baby boy and I know that is not a penis. But u could still be having a boy, but my guess is a girl because usually when they cross their legs it turns out to be a baby girl. Good luck :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I think I see a penis...|`|bSZK2tVtaa	It looks like a boy to me adorable if that.   Hope your pregnancy goes well darling.    Good luck  Sara-|`|jC1Mdsefaa	I really cant tell... But to me it looks like a GIRL because what would look like a pp, is definently the belly cord....  it is TOO high up for its penis|`|36IsVhu5aa	im not sure how to look at the pic since it not super clear but i think i get it.. the small thing pointing upwards is a bit high to be boys parts..its somewhat getting out from the baby's tummy rather than down there.. my baby's boy parts were much clearer in my u/s at 15 and 19 weeks.. i would say its the cord cz it looks like getting out from the tummy not low down there :) GL!|`|f2d89272f3e228493a1f7ea002fea3efaa	Looks like a girl to me.

DuLhv7Ajaa	Standing won't hurt you, but it can cause mild varicose veins in the legs due to increased circulation during pregnancy.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's ok as long as she is comfortable and her doctor says it's fine. Plenty of women stand all day during pregnancy due to their job requirments.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	I've read that woman who stand while pregnant usually give birth to preemies but I for sure don't know...|`|dPmK83UYaa	No it's bad for your feet. They need to be elevated to avoid swelling. REST YOURSELF.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	it never hurt me....i had a full time job when i was pregnant.....stood all day long|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    well its always said every where that pregnant women should get good rest so if you have a job which has to be done by all day standing you should take breaks in between to make your legs rest a bit...  as your body weight is increasing you should always get good amounts of breaks & rest whenever you find time out...if you get 1 to 2 hours of break for lunch go for a small nap & let your busy body rest...    but if you are not feeling comfortable by such small breaks you should let your boss know that you are pregnant & need some extra rest...he/she will understand and let you go on breaks or sit (whatever you wish to do..) just let them know..!!    but its very important to keep in mind that every women is different so is every pregnancy you should always let your doctor's know that what are you going through if you are having any problem while standing for a long time or whatever the matter is...as its always better to stay on the safe side...to be sure about yourself & about your growing baby..!!    hope this helps you..
PX4u59tkaa	hi hales!    its common for children to become fearful of the bath as they get older and start to put things together in ways they hadn't before.     In this case, she may understand that water goes down the drain. she may see her toys or washcloths floating to the drain and she may be fearful that she too can somehow get sucked down the drain.    Thats a similar issue to why some kids resist potty training as they are afraid that letting 'go' means they are letting part of their bodies go.     Maybe you can see if she has any aversions when there is no water in there, or even line the tub with a towel (stay with her of course as you always do) and see if she feels better about that.     It may be that she needs to take a coupel baths in the kitchen sink again. Just be easy on her and validate her feelings. "You're scared? Its is scary? the water is scary? ok. i understand, youre scared. lets watch the water together and see if anything scary happens..." etc.     best wishes!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	My daughter randomly did this. I got her a new bath toy and she didn't care again. Try bubble bath or a new toy. See if that helps her.|`|oIFMohfUaa	Yes.    I'm not sure if this is the reason, but my daughter at that age was sure she was going to go down the drain!      At that age they just don't know the difference in sizes.  Maybe help her giggle at the water going down, or don't drain it with her in the tub!    Good luck!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Has she gotten soap in her eye the last time? Check the water temp?|`|145RUNQHaa	Yes this same thing happened to me and i could not fathom why!my son went from loving his baths to hating them in one day!the only thing i could think of was that the water had been the wrong temprature at some point or he had got soap in his eye or something trivial but which had put him off his baths to where he would scream everytime.i spent the next couple of weeks giving him showers so as to get it over with as quickly as possible and lessen his distress i got him some new bath toys and eventually he regained confidence and started getting in the bath again no bother he s been fine ever since!|`|OgzHcNMsaa	My daughter is 4 weeks old and terrified of baths. I was hoping she would outgrow it but it looks like I might have to deal with it for much longer. I hope you figure out what's wrong with her...maybe she saw a scary movie or something about bathing that makes her nervous. Try to talk to her and make it a  fun experience again. At least she's at the age that she can understand.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Have you not asked her WHY?  Maybe she saw something on tv that scared her.     Did something happen the last time she bathed?  Did anyone else bathe her other than you?  Maybe something happened there.  (Water too hot, too deep, she slipped under for a moment, etc. etc.)  Does she go to swim lessons?  Maybe something happened there.    IT could even have been something like a bad dream, but you must find out what.    I agree too that a family of new toys in the bathtub, non slip mat, peelable wall stickers, etc. might make her feel more secure.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	maybe the water was warmer or had soap in her eyes.Why don't you have a bath with her...holding her so that she feels secure?I'm sure that will help her.Good luck|`|yOaGKfP2aa	My daughter has always been afraid of bath time. Maybe try adding bubbles with Baby Magic. Throw in a few toys she can grab too. It seems to help my daughter.|`|dPmK83UYaa	She may be scared of the sound of the rushing water. My baby was, but as soon as he got in the nice warm water w/ toys he was happy!    I wouldn't recommend bubbles as it can cause urinary tract infections.|`|d4c5cdb971ce849bcbb373e0b3182410aa	are you the one who baths her always? if not find out if she was put in a very hot bath recently, usually a common cause, if not its a phase that will pass
krQiDGCHaa	No there is no law stating that.  Your law about schools is also incorrect.  In 6th grade, we had a rotation and there was only 1 history teacher.  There was a girl in my class who was the teacher's daughter.  It was unavoidable because she was the only teacher qualified to teach 6th grade history, so she had to stay in that class.    If you want to work in a daycare and have your baby with you, go ahead.  However, most daycares will not hire you with no education (high school doesn't count) or experience.  Also, when your baby has to move up to the toddler room at 1 year of age, they will not allow you to move with him/her, so you'll be in a different room than your child.  Also, a lot of day cares do frown upon this because you will most likely (and nothing wrong with it) be paying more attention to your own child.    If you want to be with your child all day but also earn money, do what I do. I operate a small day care right out of my home.  I just take in a few kids, and I make about $500 a week.  That way, I can be home with my own children but still have an income, because my husband and I can't afford to live off just his income.    Good luck. :)|`|dDVAUA9saa	There's no LAW, but the daycare may have a policy against it.  Some do but some allow it.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i worked at a daycare with no experience and my son went there but he could not be in the same room as me|`|1CryEnb3aa	Shouldn't be a problem unless the director or owner discourages this.

BeNazR8Jaa	my fertile day was the 23rd also! And we're also ttc. I am almost positive that i am pregnant...i have the same symtom as you, sore nipples. Breasts feel fuller and heavier also... other than that i had strange feelings that felt like it was coming from my uterus. good luck!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Could be...it's hard to say though. I'll cross my fingers for you.|`|lBrCM0TWaa	my nipples always get sore around ovulation time
kaqPSgTVaa	If your test lowered that much in such a short period of time that usually means miscarriage. I think you should prepare yourself honey cause levels lowering like that 99% of the time means miscarriage. I'm so sorry. This has been my experience with my sister and two friends.    Stress doesn't effect HCG levels. That is the pregnancy hormone and has nothing to do with anything but the baby. It won't be effected by anything but the baby growing.|`|lBrCM0TWaa	i am sorry but i agree with due august. this might be a sign of a miscarriage.  hcg is a hormone in the blood, nothing you can do about it.  stress does not affect it.  the hcg doubles as the baby grows.  if its not doubling the fetus may not be growing....please prepare yourself for the worst but hope for the best! good luck to you.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	etopic pregnancy could produce low hcg levels|`|I08pH9Byaa	I am very sorry.  I believe Due August is correct in that this is likely a miscarriage.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	No baby - stress won't affect your hcg level. Im very sorry but it isnt a very good sign and the scan results probably won't be good either. Don't get too attached to this pregnancy yet. ugh! I hate that miscarriages are even an option for pregnant women and something we must worry about!! But they are and they happen to the best of us. Everything will be okay regardless of how things go for you. Ill put you in my prayers. Good Luck.|`|ZuzSUymFaa	I didn't know that you could test your hcg levels outside of a doctor's office.  When I was pregnant with my 2 kids, that wasn't something that people could do.  I do know however, that a lower hcg level could be a sign that your body may not be producing enough pregnancy hormone to keep your pregnancy going.  I know this from personal experience because with my 2nd pregnancy (I have 2 kids but was pregnant 3 times), I began to have symptoms of a miscarriage and after my miscarriage (which I had to be hospitalized for because I needed a D&C procedure), the doctor told me that I didn't have enough pregnancy hormone to keep the pregnancy going.  I was 10-1/2 weeks pregnant at the time, but the sonogram showed my baby to be developed only to 5 weeks.  Had I known my baby was in trouble earlier, I could have had hormone therapy to help maintain my pregnancy. It might not have changed anything because the baby might not have survived anyway, but at least there would have been a chance.    So without trying to scare you, I would definitely get some tests done asap just to make sure everything is going along fine.  That way, in the event that things are not going along okay, you may be able to fix the problem and save your baby.  Then again, this may be a normal thing - I don't know.  All I can tell you is that any time during your pregnancy that things don't go as expected or don't seem right, always call your doctor & give a clear description of your concerns.    I wish you and your baby all the best.|`|Et5ffAMGaa	stress cant alter ur HCG.  if it drops it usually means the pregnancy isnt viable.    good luck|`|1CryEnb3aa	I am so sorry.  I agree with Due August too.  Stress will not effect your hcg level.  As the baby grows, your hcg level doubles just about every day the first trimester.  Now, once you get into your second and third trimester they drop.  That is normal.  It is not normal for a viable pregnancy to drop like yours in the first trimester.  Again, I am very sorry and hope we are all wrong!
eXsR8Gx5aa	How odd,  my LO is also 6 months and has a cold & now only has one breastfeed in the night (usually at 6am - does that even count as night?) I hope it lasts! The cold has him waking a bit more but not for food, its just the snuffles and he needs to be settled back down - doesn't take long at all though.    (I should add, I still cannot sleep through, I wake at the slightest noise he makes - these are frequent as he is a fidget who likes to scratch his sheets!)|`|hieQHR0daa	By this stage in his growth he should not require feeding through the night. Certainly colds make some babies sleep more but also make some more wakeful. Hopefully when he is fully recovered he will no longer wake at night as he is more used to sleeping through.|`|e5cznYPeaa	My daughter dropped her last night feed at about 5 1/2 months, so it could just be a coincidence that your son has dropped his night feeds and has a cold at the same time.  My daughter sleeps quite badly when she has a cold as her blocked nose can wake her up, so I would think it is more likely just coincidence, and to enjoy it!    I do still wake up at least 3 times a night though (she sleeps in our room as we only have the one-bedroom) listen for her breathing then go back to sleep. My friend on the other hand is a heavy sleeper and her daughter has her own room, and she manages to sleep through as long as her daughter doesn't wake her!|`|pDRAciBnaa	i think he will probably go back to feeding the way he was,its just the cold draining him,when you have a cold you tend to want to sleep more!! i hope however for your sake he keeps this sleepig pattern up.|`|723QHuicaa	The cold is probably draining his energy, so he is sleeping more - its common for children and adults. After a week or so you will probably get used to it.
IQq0wNqQaa	You are most definitely NOT being unfair. WOW! That is really a jerk move for him to expect YOU to rub HIS back even though you are the one who is carrying his child, and caring for his other child all day long. You should have a talk with him. Tell him that while you recognize that he has a physically demanding job, your job is also physically demanding. Make him realize that being pregnant and caring for a small child is extremely wearing on your body, and it makes you very sore and tired, and even though you would like to rub his back - it's not always going to be possible for you to stay awake because of your hectic day.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	he sounds lazy and a wanker to me,i do a 10 hour job 5 days a week boning at a abattoir and its extremely hard work and it hurts like hell and i come home and do the house work or mow the lawn and i dont start on my misses over petty crap like that.  sorry but that's my opinion of him.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Well, that depends.     My husband works outside the home. I do all the things that you do in a day, plus I work from home writing. What was the agreement you both came to when it came to division of household duties?     Also, if you marry a man and you allow him to snap at you and treat you in a way that you feel is inappropriate and do not tell him to knock it off, there is nothing you can complain about. So sit down and tell him his behavior is unacceptable. What will being cranky get you? COMMUNICATION.|`|YyX0EJDRaa	Its really a tough situation because inasmuch as he is worn out from his labour, you are equally tired, more so that you are pregnant! I suppose the only way out is to safeguard your health and that of your baby as well. Ensure that you get enough rest, best time being when your baby takes a nap. House  chores will always be there so if you fail to finish them, no harm!!! Rest when you need to. And most of all make your other half understand your condition and the importance of rest during pregnancy. You are supporting your mate by being there for him, cooking for him and so forth. Whay can't he reciprocate this by understanding your condition and giving you enough rest? You are not being unfair at all. All the best.|`|551d897f0abf6a9c090f9e8bea28b76daa	Maybe for valentines day you should get him a massage chair or at least one that you can set in a chair and then plug it in.. :) That would save you from the arguments...or you could see if a friend would come in to help you out with some of the housework so your not as tired when he comes home from work to give him a little TLC...I do think he is stretching his limits a little far but just try to save yourself from an argument and find a way to help the both of you :) Hope it all works out!!! Good Luck!|`|XbsDGhmNaa	I think it's that men honestly don't understand how much work it is to be a stay at home mom. My husband seems to be under the impression that I sit home and watch t.v. and sleep all the time, that I'm always relaxing just because I don't have an outside job. We have four kids (7, 6, 2, and 9 months) that I take care of and keep entertained and a pretty decent sized house I try my best to keep clean, but he still doesn't think I have any reason to be tired at the end of the day (though it is 5 a.m. right now and I'm up with the baby once again). Don't be too hard on him, he's working hard. I never thought being a stay at home mom was as exhausting as it is either til I started doing it.|`|yklgeWm7aa	he is being unfair, and you shouldnt have opened your legs again, plain and simple.    think next time.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	It sounds like he's being a bit selfish on this one. It's not like you DIDN'T try to stay up and rub his back. My man gets like this sometimes. He's almost like a kid when he gets really tired, or sore (whiny, moody ect ). God help me when he's REALLY hungry. He's worse than our two year old sometimes. lol    You know, sometimes I swear men get PMS. Seriously, it's like a period without the bleeding. :)|`|dCMi5rjdaa	I think your husband needs to take a step back and look at how selfish he is being.    Does he not remember your first pregnancy--when you were about 4 months along, how tired you were, etc?    I know, I know, new job,..............SO WHAT......he isn't carrying around any extra weight is he? Does he have a 10 month old child hanging off his knee while he's working.???    Come on Daddy--give it up...Mommy needs a back rub.!!|`|1CryEnb3aa	Men for get what women do at home during the day and so on.  I think for Valentines day you should go buy him a massage package!  That way he gets what he wants and you don't have to do it. Or, run him a hot bath and tell him to soak in the tub, that will help him relax. Besides, he should be rubbing your back and running a bath for you!  Sorry, I guess I am a little one sided on this as I am a woman. LOL  Good luck|`|nzgZR6onaa	I was a stay at home mom and had five children. My oldest was not quite 7 when number five came along.Lot of hard work! My hubby made demands too and that was after a full course homemade meal and all the nightly chores I had to do.His excuse for not helping was I worked all day and he did have a very physical occupation.I let him know if he wanted us to have some quality time at night he could help out when he got home a little more and then we could spend some us time. That worked and he was able to share in story time and bath time while I finished up some laundry and dinner dishes.Espically since you are pregnant you need help.WOW he isn't just tired from work and sore he is also selfish and demanding or maybe you are not expressing to him how you feel.Ask him to give you a hand so yall can spend some time massaging each other and you will find out where he is coming from and handle it accordingly.
18PnBZaEaa	yeah the dreaded sniffy nose drives me crazy feels like you are about to get the cold any time horrible bunged up feeling at night is the worst. they say it is because of the increased blood flow. sorry to hear about your miscarriage i miscarried 2 times before this pregnancy now im almost full tern so don't give up hope. xx|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i always get a cold at the start, my doctor said its because ur immune system is being pushed harder but not everyone seems to get it   x|`|CUYuAGF5aa	I had a sniffly nose and was loaded with the cold the day we went to see the doctor.  It's actually really common for these symptoms in pregnancy and is due to the hormones in your body changing.    Good luck.|`|jIM5Nn39aa	im 28weeks pregnant! ididn't have this but idid get headaches early on which is common due to hormones! good luck! x
CUYuAGF5aa	The only thing my doctor recommended taking was folic acid which helps to prevent birth defects.  If you are lacking in anything the doctor / midwife will let you know and either tell you what to get or prescribe it to you.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	Your should take Folic acid as it prevents spinal bifida..    Very important   Good luck  Baby dust xx|`|Hu9yquP4aa	any prenatal with folic acid.     You should begin taking them up to 3 months pryor to TTC. Folic acid helps prevent birthdefects.     Very important!|`|yRihCgxaaa	TAKE ELEVIT|`|8uiH6iRbaa	hey there     i used pregnacare you can get them for all different stages    *pregnacare conception (for when you are trying)  *pregnacare original & pregnacare plus omega 3 (for when you are pregnant)  *pregnacare breast feeding (for extra vitamins when breast feeding)    these all contain folic acid and iron     you can get them from boots     www.pregnacare.com    if you want to look it up for more info|`|xjRCdRnxaa	Ant pre-natal Multi Vitamin is good, it helps boost your natural intake but also helps prevent Birth-defects, especially Spina-Bifda (as advised by my fertility specialist).  Good luck!
VYMOwgc3aa	Yes, it is absolutely normal. Anyone would doubt whether to tell someone or not. It can be very hard on you mentally. But the right thing to do is to tell someone. Your counselor is there to help you & is there for you to talk to about anything. What happened to you is wrong & the person who did it needs to pay for their actions.    So be strong & tell your counselor what happened. It will be hard, trust me, but you will feel so much better when you get it all off your chest.    Good Luck |`|xZvzLztZaa	It's fine to not want to talk to your counselor but you still need to talk to someone.     Talking about it will relieve pressure on yourself as well.   Just talk to someone responsible who you are comfortable with.    I wish you the best luck,   Micah|`|GUswFG2Raa	That is Normal. I Dislike telling counselors things because they blow everything out of proportion. they'll probably call ACS|`|H2IqzG12aa	Normal, but it's necessary to tell or the counseling is a waste of time.|`|jPlUycx0aa	OMG TELL SOMEONE!!!!! Tell someone you can trust to help you.|`|1qTNn8qnaa	You should def tell...its normal to be abused but its not acceptable...and its normal to tell counselors...they will help u!
BaXruEcqaa	You would have some pain on one side of your abdomen where your tubes are.  also would have a positive pregnancy test and a fever.  Those are the 3 most common types of symptoms.  If you have all of these you must go get an ultrasound done Right away....if the fetus develops to much in the tube than it can burst and you can suffer from internal bleeding.|`|7IwR7nDTaa	Well I know with my ectopic I had no bleeding just cramps that I have never experience before. Mine was an ectopic which would of been abdominal. The bleeding may or may not be normal. And yes you would still have a positive test. Go get checked by your doctor!
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Make it possible to keep the baby without putting emotional or financial stress on my parents. I'd change schools to be able to get a full time job and a do online learning to graduate. ??|`|RoTLnFGZaa	i'd take responsibility for my own actions.  and keep the baby, get a job, and support it.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Put the baby up for adoption.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Abortion.. It isn't something you think of lightly but that is what I would do. Obviously, I wouldn't be getting pregnant because I know I am not capable to handle a baby at the moment hence the fact that I am a virgin.     This was my answer to a similar question asking whether or not I would have an abortion:  Yes, I know you can get pregnant using any form of contraception but I would take all precautions to make sure I don't get pregnant. I would still have an abortion. Not JUST for my sake but also what kind of life would I provide for the baby? In my position, not a very good one. I would rather have finished my education and be prepared for this. Abortions happen for many reasons and alot of Pro-Life people don't even take them into consideration. Of course I would consider the baby's father because it makes 2 people to get pregnant. In saying that, I would believe that I would have the final say in it because it is my body and he could easily leave and I could still be there with a baby.|`|x9REbxP1aa	Why did people thumbs down the first answer?  What, now adoption is the new abortion?    I agree with Rainbow Shoelaces.    I don't understand why everyone is so against it...|`|ySKK7lCyaa	what i did, keep my baby and step up.|`|yuJHyr5Haa	i'll try my best to look after it it cant be that bad|`|MrNkNnhyaa	1st off if i would've gotten pregnant with my first bf and told him,then i know i wouldn't have had a bf.but to answer your question i would keep the baby,i know times would get tough and it would be a challenge,but i would make it.  but if i got pregnant with my bf now(for 3 years) i would be happy!  :]]  :]]|`|zrBzRYI8aa	Look into adpotion. Maybe look into getting part time job myself. Or even consider asking his family and/or my extended family as well as his for help.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	I would first off consider abortion. Then adoption. My brother and his fiancee had a baby aged 17+19. I've seen how hard it is.    I use condoms!    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|5F224cRzaa	im sorry i know this might sound bad but if im being honest i would get an abortion if its under 5 weeks old.... there are too many kids needing adoption and im in no place to look after a baby... besides its only a bunch of cells around that time....
DIXhpf5Haa	It's very unusual for a woman not produce enough milk if she is exclusively breastfeeding.  With this new baby, don't supplement at all - no formula, sugar water, etc.  Have the baby on the breast frequently, and don't pump and bottle feed.  To stimulate milk production the baby needs to be nursing on the breast.  If you find you do have to supplement in the beginning (ie. when you and the baby are figuring out how to latch in the first few days), pump/express some milk, and use a cup, syringe, finger feeding, anything but a bottle.  Get the baby on the breast as soon after birth as possible - within an hour is best.  Try to let the baby self latch (google 'breast crawl'), and try to have the baby skin-to-skin.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Healthy women nursing on demand do not have their milk just 'dry up.' It may SEEM that way because you are no longer engorged, but there is still all the milk your baby needs in there.    Using bottles = good way to dry up, too. Avoid bottles...    Useful: http://www.kellymom.com/newman/04enough_...|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Try fenugreek capsules, they're apparently very good for increasing milk supply.  I've heard of people using them even to relactate after they've almost completely dried up.|`|SlhEgGl2aa	dont think there is any way but its prob just your body way maybe its not able for it
nzgZR6onaa	Was the water to hot and were you perspiring a lot? I am not pregnant but the sweating in a hot tub messes up my electrolytes and blood sugar and makes me feel weak and I have to make sure I keep water and a piece of fruit or peanut butter crackers for protein by the tub so I don't feel bad.|`|yRihCgxaaa	Taking a bath while pregnant is great.    As long as it isnt too hot!    Try some oils and just relax, see if that will help with the sickness|`|6XR6ajTraa	have you tried using aromatherapy oils, and scented candles? They will help you feel more relaxed and making sure the water is not too hot, baby won't like it either if it's hot. I use to trickle water on my belly and get a reaction from bub it was beautiful. Baths are fantastic while pregnant don't give up hun.|`|Kl5kN2Qaaa	taking baths while pregnant is a great way to relax and there is no harm in doing that,if the water was too hot then that would make u feel kinda sick,i had the same probllem with my first pregnancy.then once i made the water cooler i neva felt sik again, just remember when ur in labour they encourage u to take bath cause it helps..goooood luk with the rest of ur pregnancy :)|`|XVVkrlnTaa	I would say it is fine. Just not too hot.|`|evnLjcnxaa	You can take a bath while pregnant just be sure it's lukewarm not hot and you have an anti slip bath mat. I agree with the OP if you got sick you could have stayed in too long. Just stay clear of tanning beds,hot tubs and saunas. HTH!! Congrats and best of luck|`|1CryEnb3aa	Don't take too hot of a bath.  That's probably making you feel a titlee faint.  Also, stop taking baths once you start dilating.  You can get an infection EASY once your cervix starts dilating.  Congrats!
af79b286b208d9345788435fdeb00b17aa	I knew on both mine that i was i just felt it, and i have just done a course in ivf and for the first 5 days after implantation i felt it but on the 6 day i didn't, so you can defiantly feel pregnant|`|PxjbCMl0aa	My best friend did.  I remember we went to Red Lobster 2 days before she took the test and she just kept telling me she felt "out of it" and she just felt weird...like anxious and mildly depressed even.  she told me she thought she was pregnant, and that she just knew something was different.|`|2jiNLOKHaa	my pms symptoms were way more pronounced. my boobs were so so so so sore! no af and i was 5 days late. im never late. even with clomid i have a very definitive leuteal phase. it is one day longer with clomid. my period never came and my boobs were so sore so i took a test when i was 4 days late and it turned positive right away. so that would be at 16 dpo for me.|`|yRihCgxaaa	I felt pregnant before i was sure, the reason i kinda knew is because of all the things i have herd and read.    I researched nd basically confirmed it for myself but still went to doctor and got blood test.|`|IfyjeV4Raa	I told my husband I was pregnant before I got a positive test. I felt different somehow but couldn't say how.|`|NXLjk0uvaa	yes. i felt inside me that something was different. i just, well, wasnt the same|`|LIVkGLa5aa	I certainly did.  4dpo I had cramping and very sore boobs.  10dpo I had brown spotting and completely went off curry (which I love)!  I did a test the day af was due but I already knew it was positive.

3qI1oyFaaa	I would choose which OB you want to start seeing, give them a call, and explain your situation. See if you can start your prenatal care without getting a referral. If not, then either get a referral from your current pcp before you switch to a new one, or switch to a new one and then get your referral. Either way, though, you will probably need your medical records from your pcp, so be sure to get those.    congrats and good luck!!|`|1CryEnb3aa	If you need a referral, get your PCP changed.  Shouldn't take but a phone call to your insurance co.  Then make an apt with them.  They may confirm your pregnancy and even do the ultra sound there bc of your history.  Congrats|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Honestly, it depends on your insurance's rules. If you have to see your PCP first, and you don't they will not pay for you to see your OBGYN.   If you need to switch PCPs you need to call the number on the back of your ins card, ask for a list of participating providers, switch, call your new provider, get an appt, see them for the blood work etc as proof that you are indeed pregnant (some insurance companies req this step) then get your referral. Most Obgyn's will not see you until your 8th to 10th week of pregnancy. If you are past that, they will try to fit you in as soon as they can depending on the business of their office.     If you just go to your present PCP you wont have such a long wait time. Why do you need to switch, you just need to go, get your test and get referred.|`|I08pH9Byaa	If I could get in right away to see the Maternal doctor I would do that, but that depends on the insurance.  If I had to have a referral I would see my PCP first, get in to see the Maternal doc, and then change my PCP.    That is just to expedite things.  I wouldn't risk things getting caught up in new patient/new consult appointments and such.
6lyvhRLsaa	You should feed on one side till the breast is empty as there is two kinds of milk, the fore milk and hind milk. The fore milk is the watery milk and the hind is the fatty milk that makes them full. After that one is empty you can offer the other breast. When its time for the next feed you use the breast you offered last and so on.|`|CdodhnP5aa	I do 15min at one and 15 min on the other but sometimes he only wants one then later when he feeds again I give the other. But like the other lady said every baby is different, but I don't think there is a wrong way as long as they are eating and gaining weight.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Depends on your baby, some babies don't need/want both sides each feeding, some do, also don't necessarily time yourself - wait until the baby stops feeding, offer the other side and see what happens.     My son took both sides, my friends baby didn't.     All babies feed differently, you'll have to see what works for you and your baby.|`|v7Xvow4Daa	You let them finsish one breast entirely and then offer then the other breast!!! If you don't let them finish then they will not get the good full fat milk which is what fills them up and keeps them satisfied!|`|iyb7YGXHaa	I fed my baby for 2 years - you feed from 1 breast at each feed, otherwise they will not get the rich "hind"milk.  Then on the next feed, go to the other breast.     They used to say (years ago) feed for 10 mins off each breast but they have changed this, that's probably why your mum thinks that.  Good luck!
YzUPmWTBaa	Hi there! I have pcos and miscarried with my first pregnancy. No one warned me that pcos has a very high miscarriage risk.

ABvw9Ocoaa	their friends. in my room in my dorm all of my room mate come back high and sometimes it will get pretty bad in there.    their friends get it from the older people.    if your kid has it please listen to my advice. go to www.crosscreekprograms.com    i went here because i was an @$$ to my parents and they were afraid of me. now i am the most king hearted person that you will ever meet. even if you send him to a drug rehab he may stop a while but he WILL relapse. send to this place he is a lot less likely. it is expensive but a lot of parents who send their kids here they care so much for their kids that they are willing to go into a lott of debt to save their kids. i knew two kids that were great kids. one said he was only going to smoke weed and a year later he died of a heroine overdose. onother was a great football player and he died of a black tar heroine over dose.|`|TqtGoPy3aa	They most likely get it from older friends.personally i have never done anything like that but i know people who you would least expect to do.  These days its pretty easy to get stuff like that if you have connections with certain people or whatever.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	There are always older kids in school who can get it.  They get it from older kids who are out of school.  They get it from older "adults" who take advantage of them.|`|YTYjzGAXaa	I pick up my stuff from my friend, who goes to get it from one of his friends in the city.

hi9SYnrraa	i lost 17 pounds. trust me, you'll put it on in the 3rd tri|`|01PcKKtiaa	Hey hun, I am 10 weeks and I have lost about 6lb, I can hardly eat either! A lot of people lose weight in the 1st 3 months. Just try to nibble on things every hour or so, but most importantly, stay hydrated.     All the best x|`|1CryEnb3aa	This can be normal for some women.  The nausea will calm down and you will start gaining weight.  Don't worry as this can stress you out and you don't need that either.  Congrats and best of luck!|`|nzgZR6onaa	I never lost weight when I was pregnant but my niece who just had her baby barley gained a lot of weight in fact in the beginning of her pregnancy she felt nauseous and lost weight.Her baby was healthy when born. Not a huge baby 6 pounds even but healthy.I have heard of other women loosing weight in the beginning of pregnancies too.Just make sure you keep your doctor or midwife informed.Its when you are not gaining in the end of your pregnancy that's cause for concern.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	It will level out. Morning sickness can be wicked! Just make sure what you are getting in is healthy choices for baby!|`|yRihCgxaaa	If you are throwing up and not eating right, you will definately loose weight also with hormonal changes,    I lost 10kg from throwing up and not being able to eat, then throughout my pregnancy i put it back on.    There is no worry.|`|YyX0EJDRaa	Its quite normal. You will pick up some weight in the second trimester|`|mxixfE3Raa	This is normal within the first 12 or 14 weeks. If you carry on loosing weight after 14 weeks you should see a doctor. But your hunger should pick up in a week or so.  Good Luck|`|79eRDIbXaa	That is quite alot. Maybe talk your mid-wife about this.  Just try eating some butter on toast every so often even if its one piece. I Know how hard it is but just think about your baby. It needs food. Good Luck xx|`|6XR6ajTraa	Don't stress just try to eat smaller and more frequent, make sure it is full of nutrition you and your baby need it. Some women gain or lose tonnes of weight, but not eating can deffinately make you lose weight.

Katherine meaning pure maiden  Rosetta meaning rose   Hallie meaning thinking of the sea   Aveline meaning bird  Evie meaning life   Carolina meaning small women born to command  Serena meaning peacefulness   Hope this helped you may join a unusual name with a traditional name as this provides a good mix of old and new.

3vAk2EWyaa	Its A Great Name!   It Not To Unusual And It Not Over-Used Good Choice!|`|VGij9p0Taa	Oliver is a very good strong name that flows with anything and ages well the name meaning olive tree is adorable and its female equivalent Olivia is also priceless. The name isn't over-used i feel, their are Oliver's about however i feel its best that a child shares its name with others so he (in this case) doesn't feel strange with a 'odd' name. Oliver is very classy to and i like the nickname Ollie is cute. A middle name suggest could be Jacob. Oliver Jacob is a very good strong traditional name.   Good luck and hope this helps!|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Its cute, but I don't really like it.|`|5uG358Xsaa	hey pregnant lady, i hope your doing well.

6d3f2222a43f9cdc795c3b3442576b5eaa	In the beginning of my pregnancy I was extremely nauseous all the time, at around 3 months the feelings went away, but came back around 8 months.  Sweating is usually caused by the extra weight, generally muscle aches happens towards the end too.  Be careful you may have preeclampsia, which is the elevation of blood pressure during pregnancy it is VERY dangerous|`|AA10046376	Mother hood sucked....they lie.Labour is worse than losing your brake pads...and they call it uncomfortable...there is no point of reference to it....doctors are callous about it..and unless you have a LOT of money...look forward to the worst event of your life......they lie about the drug thing and tell you that is why you took classes. Natural childbirth is for dogs. I have two children and they are grown....i do NOT wish any upon them....sorry.|`|AA11538143	first of all congratulation. with my first pregnancy i only made it to 35 weeks my son was perfectly healthy. i was nausea threw my whole prenacy. about a week before he was born my stomach kept on tigenting  up.    good luck and god bless|`|7c0e0156848320fc58bfa4db27bc11d6aa	I'm 36 weeks pregnant and have noticed increasing nausea in the last couple of weeks.  It's very annoying.  I was very sick in the beginning, but then it totally went away, so having it back is no fun, although it's not as bad now as it was then.  I haven't thrown up, but I feel uncomfortable a lot.    The bigger your baby gets, the more she/he is pressing on your stomach which I think has a lot to do with it.  If it's your first baby, the good news is that the baby will "drop" soon and go much lower toward your pelvis, which should relieve the stomach pains if they are being caused by the baby pressing.  On the other hand, the lower the baby, the more difficult it is to walk and move around with comfort.    Good luck with the rest of the pregnancy and your baby's birth!|`|AA10624502	Do not worry about it, I went through the same thing.  Its your hormones. you are ready to pop that baby out!!! Dont stress and congrats|`|4b2bbd06f0269b93cc934bed72028fabaa	well your last trimester can be the worst|`|AA12005703	i didn't ever experience that but i have heard that good luck motherhood is a wonderful thing|`|AA10733221	I didn't get nauseated after the fourth month, but everyone is different.  If you trust your doctor, then don't worry about anything.  I always knew when my labor was going to start; I got a sudden huge burst of energy.  Good luck!|`|AA10994178	It is probably the baby pushing up on the stomach when it drops you will feel much better.I know I did . All three times.   May God bless all of you that are reading this and are with child .It is the greatest gift you will ever receive .|`|AA11880454	Relax and trust your doc Hon - as long as all your levels are good and the heart beat is fine - so are you and the little one  Watch your diet - the nausea is normal - with me it was indigestion and nausea during both my pregnancies - and I brought two wonderful healthy babies into this ole world - You will be fine and the anxiety you are feeling is normal too with first pregnancy - try to relax - Good Luck and God Bless!

JjXFj2EBaa	I have a little booster seat and I strap that on to one of my kitchen seats and so my son (22 months) has been sitting at the table with me for about nine or ten months.  As for the bib, that all depends on his mood.  If he's having something not particularly messy like fish fingers or burgers he's pretty intent on wearing it.  If I've made a nice roast with gravy or nice but messy pasta I can't get it on him at all, can't figure out his reasoning but the way I look at it is I have a washing machine so rather than have a big row I let him get on with it, once he's eating is the most important thing|`|jIM5Nn39aa	i nanny and also expecting our first! id say to sit them at a table at meals times from 18months and don't use abib as soon as they don't need it, depends how messy ur child is haha! inanny for a3year year old and she still wears abib coz she is so messy! depends if u don't mind clothes getting messy! x|`|Jmd2N5qLaa	My son stopped the bib at about 16 months old.  Totally refused to wear one.  Rips it off in 5 seconds so I don't even try to put one one.  He started using a booster seat at 18 months old.|`|PWkWptVuaa	My neice stopped at about 2 - we had to sit her on lots of cushions as she was still a bit too small for the chairs.. but she wanted to sit on a proper chair :)    And it depends on how messy your toddler is!|`|6PSFH4eKaa	For my younger brother it is when we moved everything changed. He was about 18 months and started sitting at the table using a tot lock. He would only use a bib for thing that were super messy like pasta and sauce. At about 2 he graduated to a booster chair and used silverware to the best of his ability and no longer used a bib|`|gxlEqdclaa	My daughter was about 2 when we stopped using a bib. She was starting to pull it off herself so i didn't bother with one anymore.  My daughter stopped sitting in a high chair at about 18 months to 2 years. Shes tall for her age and was getting a bit big for it.|`|bc8a8d7595f1051b6a4ba4c3045875ddaa	my 4 all varied. my eldest son was a really good eater but very messy and so was in it until he reached 3ish, my 2nd son was in it until he reached 2.5 but my daughters were both out o their high chairs at 18 months and 2 years, as they seemed to control everything that bit better earlier. and were no where near as messy as my boys.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I operate a daycare from my home.  My children stop wearing bibs at 2, unless it is a particularly messy meal.  For instance, if they're just having finger foods, no need for a bib.  However, if we're eating a soup, pudding oatmeal, or something like that, we definitely do bibs.    As far as sitting in the adult chairs, we typically transition around 2 years old as well.  It depends on how tall the child is.  All of my 2 year olds can currently sit in my regular chairs, but my chairs are rather high I think so they fit comfortably.  If they didn't fit comfortable, I'd use a booster seat -- we don't use high chairs past 1.  The booster seat you can get used off Craigslist for about $10.  It just straps right onto your regular kitchen chair, and they eat off the table surface.|`|rISHTfK3aa	Most children still make a mess when they are eating so there is no hard or fast rule for this. Regarding the high chair I always say that if a child can climb out of it then they need to be sitting on a lower chair.|`|wUQ51VBdaa	my 4 yr old still wears his sometimes he is so messy haha!    he was about 2 and a half before he could sit on a chair properly :)|`|AA10954832	i was about 18 years old when i stopped wearing a bib!!!

zRmwEFAwaa	A good way to find out is to have a pregnancy test to be sure. Having your period does mean your not pregnant long or short. But go to the doctors to anyway, just to check out the heartburn.|`|lBrCM0TWaa	maybe u just have heartburn.
kc2Sa7ibaa	Here is an idea. Maybe not the best but this is what I thought of when I read it.    A girl grows up with a family with drug addicts and somehow learns to change her ways when she gets pregnant and starts a family hence changing the future in a positive way.    There are a lot of stories that you could think of. I am not very creative but that is what I thought of :-\ It may not be suitable for your class guidelines but I would use it if that was my assignment.    Btw. That quote has alot of power.. :) I like to think that I live by it.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Erm, maybe something like something has gone wrong and they change it as they get older? Say they've got a problem with drugs in their past they change it in their future?  Sorry, probably not a lot of help.|`|AA11024148	how about real life?  we cannot change the fact that martin (luther king) was murdered or why.  we changed the future by electing obama.    we cannot change the fact that we lied to mom last week; but we can change it by not doing it again and speaking the truth.
5axGfFofaa	Yes it is called a missed miscarriage.|`|8y0837nlaa	YES!!! It happen to me in November 2008.. I was going for a check up at 10 weeks and just to find out my babies heart beat had stopped.  I thought everything was fine.. no bleeding the only thing i noticed after was the that my symptoms were going away... I was heart broken couldnt believe it... So we decided to ttc again after my first normal period and i tested yesterday and i got a BFP!!! I am really really worried and i think i will be for the rest of my pregnancy... I just hope everything goes good... God will help me out trough this....  Hope i get sticky baby dust this time around...|`|Wv0dPejLaa	depending on how early on the pregnancy is (im talking days to maybe 2 weeks). any later than that and i hear it a painful process youd know about.
yUyx2nhmaa	go to 3 months teats. my son started on those. the newborn ones are awful! they also give loads of wind because they swallow too much air    edit - not sure i got a thumbs down when the other people agreed with me and said the same thing :-(|`|6AKKwrujaa	I had the same problem with my son when he was about the same age, we were really concerned because my daughter was the complete opposite and drank her bottles really quickly!    my health visitor advised us to get the 3m+ teats, i was a bit worried about this, however i did try and it made such a difference, the first bottle i think shocked him a bit but he was fine, as soon as he was used to it he was a lot happier and so was i!     my son is 8 weeks now takes all his feeds within about 20 minutes, and the whole feeding process is a lot more fun.    hope this helps.xx|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u can try a med flow nip and see if she can handle it; you willl know very quickly if she can't....that's too long to drink a bottle; it's only supposed to be used for an hour after baby takes the first drink....
DOcCmGf4aa	Does she really need one at 10 months?  I just put my little guy (since 8.5 months) in his baby bath in the big tub, he sits up, splashes and plays.....

I got mine from my sister, so it was a little outdated, but i did find a nice selection of newer ones on ebay. best wishes!
n6XYYyoLaa	possibly, since babies tend to imitate; laugh at her, around her and see if she picks up on it..|`|FwJLD1uDaa	you should laugh more - smile and be happy around her!! :)|`|PX4u59tkaa	that was goodo advice above... we used to practice laughing with our son when he was this age. we would sit in the LR and laugh and laugh. we still do exagerated laughs today and 'teach' him how to enjoy things with laughter. he is the silliest little boy anyhow, he loves to laugh and seems to know what is funny.     in other news... babies 3mos and up a bit - they will go thru phases of laughing and not - dont worry, soon enough she will laugh and laugh and laugh.     practice with her - it will be good for you, and the better she learsn to laugh the betetr for her health as she grows up too! laugh out loud right now - doesnt it feel good!!!

Always seems to happen to my favourite socks too.  Just a piece of advice.....check behind/down the side of your bed. I often wear socks to bed in winter and kick them off during the night and because my bed is against the wall they tend to go slippsies over the edge and then I find them a few weeks later.  Also look inside doona covers.......they're often in there too!    P.S - I do swear however, that there is sock fairy about.|`|jrVlzffeaa	We have that exact same problem, also my underwear goes AWOL.

2jiNLOKHaa	i would get a blood test done. sometimes it can even take up to a week or two after your missed period for a test to come back positive. that would be what would put my heart to ease. good luck i hope you get your bfp!

hoIH8dAlaa	YES...FAIR  There are so-o many parenting styles..It is obvious your parents care.  It does seem mean, cruel,  backward and 'not up with the play' to NOT give you alot of independence right now at 13. Especially if your friends are enjoying the priveledge!    As a Mum, I suggest getting your folks involved with the families of the boys you want to be with, the most. This is good for their confidence. As they can see how you all interact, and how sensible your friends are, (or what the mates strengths are.) The more you expose your parents to your friends, the more they will understand how they function.  Honestly, they probably trust YOU..it is the worst case scenarios that are the wall! It is the exposure to possible nasties, they are probably defensive about. 13 is a classic age for experimentation and expanding boundaries beyond home. Following the advice of peers or other male role models is normal at this age on. Sports or hobbies are a safer option for now. (I hear you groaning already)   If your peers are out, what are they up to? So many kids are exposed to alcohol, drugs of varying kinds, sex and even abusers. Would your mates know what to do in a crisis without a trusted adult about? You may have theories as to what you'd do, but have you honestly got back up plans or instincts which warn you of impending trouble? I've seen even 18-25 year olds make some pretty stupid moves..showing how naive they really are.   Street-wise kids are canny, usually because they grew up with hard knocks and life-experiences I wouldn't wish on anyone. Often living hard-out and burn out young, too. Your folks are protective, which is a painful stage that may last for a couple more years, sorry.   A curfew will only work, if your parents are assured of WHERE you will be and with WHOM, and exposed to what others. Also,in an emergency, they need to know EXACTLY where you are. The controlled situations are best, for now.  Build their trust and show them over time, you are aware they have your best interests at heart.|`|sLtZoSCmaa	well im nearly 13 my self.im aloud to stay out till 8.30 nom later.you should tell your parents that you are getting older and you need a bit of freedom.  and if they say no just say that could you trust me just once and if i am not responsible while im out i will let you punish me. and if then they say yes. say bak to them i promise and go do you thing.  once they fully trust you go can go do more things. it works for me sometimes.!!|`|zqDQz3K6aa	compromise with them. dont just make them give you what you want, listen to them. before high school i didnt have a cerfew- i basically came home around 9 or 10 and it depended were i went. now in high school in grade 9 my cerfew was 11, in grade 10 it's now 11:30 and it'll just go up half an hour every year. my parents are the type of parents where they teach me whats right and wrong, but they allow me to make decisions on my own.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? You're only 13...you're a kid. You shouldn't be anywhere without your parents at night. ??|`|KiGQV0MSaa	I think your parents want to just protect you.   if you ask for a curfew though, start very early like 8:00 or 8:30pm. you have to show your parents that you are responsible enough, so always stick to this curfew. also, only go out at night once/twice a week. when i was thirteen i used to only go out on thursdays and fridays as thursdays was late night shopping and fridays were just fridays. after a few months, and showing your parents how responsible you are, ask if you can raise it to 9:00 or 9:30pm. you can then keep raising it from here.    theres nothing wrong with having to tell your parents where you are going. just say where you are going, who with and what time you should be back. let them take you there or pick you up if you offer, its safer and your parents will be happier if they take you there and pick you up. but as you get older, you can start to make your own way yourself. hope this helps x|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Parents are like that.|`|x9REbxP1aa	You're young. Period.    Many of you 13 year olds think you're so mature and "adult".  BUT  YOU  ARE  NOT!      I'm glad they restrict you.|`|rR5nIklWaa	ok am 18  and when i was 14 i met my boyfreind  and my parents hated him i wasnt allowed to see him at all  but now they love him  but any ways  they just want to protect you from bad things and bad people  but they dont relize that ur goning to do it any way  you should tel ur parents where your going cuz heven 4 bid somthing happen to u  and u dont come home that night they no to go looking for u  when u do ak for a curfew you need to come home every night a lil bit early  this will show them that u are resposable enof  to  go out  and if ur going to be late  u need to call them and explain|`|FVFxE6owaa	You are 13.  You do not need to be out late at night.  If I were your parent, I'd expect you home every night (even weekends) by 8:00.    When you are a bit older (around 16 or so), you can ask for a curfew to stay out later (10:00 maybe) by being responsible.  Do extra chores without being asked, don't talk back, etc.|`|NznZENTqaa	Just say you want some more freedom. and try to make it reasonable like 10:30 or not too late start small and then increase later lol. I got to go to a concert when i was 13 and it lasted til like 11 but we didnt get home til about a quarter to 2 in the morning but that was a one time thing but our parents trusted us. So if your parents trust you i dont see any reason for them to say no to a curfew. good luck!|`|6JXrlnYsaa	Start by inviting some of your friends to your home for TV, homework, etc.  Your parents can get to know them.  Then ask if you can go to the friends' homes after school,  on weekends, etc.  Gradually work up to early evenings.  Promise to be home on time and KEEP YOUR PROMISE.    Ask your parents to try if for one month.  If they're not satisfied with your behavior, they can change the rules.    Be reliable. Be trustworthy.  Be honest.
TCpTlCTRaa	Postpartum hair loss is common. The effects can be much more severe if you are not taking care of yourself physically and emotionally. The body requires extra nutrition, rest and relaxation to recover from the signification changes that took place during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period. It is hard to gauge if your hair shedding is worse than normal. When the shedding ends (within 6-9 months) the new mother should be left with hair that is only slightly thinner than her pre-pregnancy hair. Please read the article on postpartum hair loss listed as a link in the resource box for more information.|`|m5aenb6qaa	you should seek the help of your OB Gyne. did you have normal pregnancy like without diabetis or insulin resistance? did you use any medicine during your pregnancy like metformin? or maybe this is something hormonal. seek medical help.|`|jrVlzffeaa	That sounds all too familiar to me!! lol. I remember that, finding my hair in baby's neck rolls was the worst for me. My auntie had it really bad, she had bald patches, but it's just your body's way of getting rid of the extra hair that you get while you're pregnant. It's fine, don't worry about it Xx|`|1IDSGM71aa	Were you breastfeeding? If you were, then I'd say it's normal. But, stress can cause it, too. I'd say it's pretty normal, but you might want to try to take an hour or so every day alone to just relax for a while and destress. That might help. If you get worried about it, you should call your doctor and ask.|`|sYsfI856aa	During your pregnancy your body would have stopped loosing hair as we may normally see it and keeping it thicker, sort of like a dogs winter coat you could say.  What you are experiencing is just good old post partum shedding. So long as your hair isn't unhealthy, dry, breaking off, and it's just falling out you should be fine. Still consult your doctor if you are concerned, but unless there are bald spots it's most likely just normal. I had the same thing after having my son, it lasted months!|`|CftxrdFUaa	I have a 9 month old and found little tuffs growing all around my hair line when my baby was about 5 months old. Its completely normal and is apparently caused by the drop in hormone levels. My hair is still growing and is going to take a while to get back to normal. Sounds normal to me, I find my hair everywhere but you do sound very stressed as well. x
PBY9MNDFaa	I'm sure this happens to a lot of women.  Stop the pill immediately that you find out you are pregnant.  Let your doctor know what has happened and they will put your mind at rest.  You won't be the first woman this has happened to.|`|yRihCgxaaa	The best thign to do is ask your doc they are the only ones that would really know.|`|KlKomVgPaa	what kind of bill? most of the bill will harm the baby take only if the dr said so
HM0cxcahaa	I used clear blue and others and found them to be the earliest indicators and feel the most confidence in this brand, a faint line can mean a positive pregnancy test just early and there is only a little bit of HCG in the urine....Retest in a day or two the hormone level doubles every 2 days, or get her to go have a blood test at the GP.|`|1CryEnb3aa	I would retest.  Sounds like it may have been inconclusive.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Buy a different early pregnancy test and re test. It could be that that test was defective.

ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i had terrible back labour which i think they say is made worse by baby being back 2 back  i had mild cramping in my tummy but the worse was my back and thighs  it felt like a really annoying backache that u just couldnt do anything about with the added pains in the tops of my thighs    also when they put me on a monitor to see how regular i was contracting they were not showing up, so i was told i wasnt in labour  my own midwife came to check me and i was dilating and in fact in labour  so if in doubt make sure they check u down there as well x x|`|aLkCxq5aaa	My 2nd was born back to back although nobody knew until her face popped out looking up at me! ( I gave birth standing up holding onto hospital bed).  I always thought or heard that the labour takes a lot longer and is extremely painful with bad back labour, yet I felt all the pain in my lower belly with every contraction.  I can't remember having any backache to be honest.  I had my waters broken to speed up my labour, then when I was actually in established labour, the whole thing lasted around 6 hours, same as my 1st who wasn't back to back.  So I guess it's different for everyone.  Good Luck! x
B0VHifDtaa	for a boy cayden and a girl lyla|`|VGij9p0Taa	My favourite's are...   Boys:-  Cayden Kai - this is really cool i love the two unusual names together, Kai meaning ocean is wonderful and goes really well with Cayden love this spelling.   Joel Kyle - this is really good strong traditional name, that flows really well, however even though this order is good i feel Kyle Joel sounds better.  Girls:-  Lilian Grace - this is utterly priceless and so pretty i adore Lilian meaning a lily which is a symbol of purity it's a beautiful traditional name which goes so well with Grace.  Emilia Violet - this is again really pretty and i love the middle name Violet meaning modest flower. However what about Amelia Violet.  Hope i helped.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I like Cayden Kai or Deacon Kyle and Lilian Grace the best|`|HjiqMDI6aa	Clayton Kai and Lyla Grace|`|3vAk2EWyaa	I Like Joe Kyle and Lilian Grace But All Those Names Seen Good So You Cant Make A Bad Choice|`|okgr5aPCaa	Oh, you have exactly the same taste in names as Joanna and Louise.  Only not as long, yey!      Out of your boys choices I like Cayden Kai best.    Out of the girls: Amelie Violet.      P.S. if yew're having twin girls, why do you need boys names?  Or did you find out it's Quads?|`|n5u3rkV4aa	boy - deacon or clayden  girl - emilia or lilian  =D  nice unique names as oppose to the generic names like: emily and hannah|`|GpY2SF0oaa	Joel Kyle   Lilian Grace  but all so very cute!!!|`|Ca5n28eVaa	Deacon Kyle and Lyla Grace are great names|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	From the boys names, Joel Kyle is definitely my favourite.    I like Amelie and Lilian...so either Amelie Violet or Lilian Grace.  I prefer the second name Grace though so if i could mix and match I'd go for Amelie Grace.|`|VfkiZhufaa	cayden kai and lilian grace  (:|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Don't like the names you've paired, sorry :(    Joel Deacon is okay.    Emilia Grace   and  Amelie Grace    are cute, pretty, girlie etc|`|ot0TqzSvaa	i love Joel and i love Kai. but the combinations you have together dont go together. what about Joel Deacon? Cayden Kai is cool too!    for girls, Lilian is one of my favourite names, but Grace doesnt do it justice. what about Lilian Mae? Lyla Grace is cute.. but i cant imagine a mature lady named Lyla. the other girl names i dont like.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Joel Kyle and Lilian Grace. x|`|F7tyzrMzaa	Boys:  Clayton Kai- I'm not a huge fan of Clayton. There's just something that sounds odd to me about it. I like Kai. 6/10  Cayden Kai- Love it! Although I do prefer Cayden spelt Caden, it doesn't really matter. Great name. 9.5/10 (would be 10 if it was spelt Caden, lol)  Joel Kyle- Love Kyle, hate Joel. Sorry. 4/10  Deacon Kyle- Deacon's one of those name's that's slowly growing on me. It might take a while, but it's getting there. And like I said, I love Kyle. 7/10        Girls:  Emilia Violet- Prefer it spelt Amelia (or even better as Amelie) bu it's a nice name Violet's quite cute as well. 7/10  Amelie Violet- Oh... never mind haha. Only just seen this one. Ignore that bit up there lol. Love it! 9/10  Lilian Grace- Adore Grace so much, and Lilian's ok. 8/10  Lyla Grace- Amazing. Although, I personally prefer it spelt Lilah. But it's an adorable name anyway, if you pronounce it the same way I do "Lie-luh"... And Grace just puts the cherry on top. 10/10    Favorites:    Boy- Cayden (Caden) Kai  Girl- Lyla (Lilah) Grace or Amelie Violet.|`|nidCgr73aa	Cayden and Clayton Kai (pronounced "Kay" I take it?) has far too many "ay" sounds.    If I was to pair up different middle names I would say Cayden Kyle. It's very nice.    If I wasn't to pair any middle names I couldn't choose as I hate all names in the current combinations.    For girls I love Lillian Grace, I've always loved that name and so is Lyla Grace.    I adore Lola Grace but it's not on your list I'm afraid.    Amelie is gorgeous but not with Violet. Amelie Grace is completely stunning.    So my favourites from the whole list are Cayden Kyle, Lillian Grace and Amelie Grace.    Amelia Grace is so pretty too but pronounced Ah-Mel-Lee-Ah not the usual Ah-Meal-Ya.    Hope I helped!

Erv7wCrQaa	Hi, you've got to think about yourself and your health, and if you've been ill you need time to get better for you and for your baby.  Don't worry, it's not too early.  I'm finishing work at 34 weeks (only 3 more weeks to go!) as I have a long drive and it's getting too much for me.  My boss who is a doctor suggests taking maternity leave at 34 weeks if you can.    Your maternity pay should be paid to you weekly or monthly by your employer so check with them asap as it should start as soon as you've finished. All the best for the rest of your pregnancy, not long now!!|`|xp0BnsD0aa	It is very early to start your leave, especially if this is your first child.  Your baby may be a week or two late and you will be sooooo bored!  However, if money is no issue and you still have renovating to do I am sure you will be busy at home.      Usually any annual leave you have taken is paid first, followed by any paid maternity leave, then any unpaid maternity leave.      In Australia, your leave can be up to one year from the day you walk out the door irrespective of the leave types involved.    Hope this helps!|`|36IsVhu5aa	personally, i would rather wait 2 or 3 more weeks to go on leave just for the sake of spending more time when my baby is born..however, if u feel like u need to start ur leave now, do it. u need the rest and sleep now to make ur body gain energy to keep up with the baby when it arrives. check with ur company about the maternity pay and similar things. GL and hope u have an easy delivery and a healthy baby :)|`|HM0cxcahaa	I started my maternity leave at 28 weeks for a few reasons...    1) because my previous pregnancy i delivered at 36.5 weeks and have 1 week off work and felt exhausted  2) We can afford to not have me in work   3) I wanted to spend one on one time with my first child before number 2 comes in to take over  4) I dont cope with the third trimester very well, moody, tired, forgetful it was better for my employer and my sanity  5) My employer allows 2 yrs maternity leave (yes in australia)    I think it depends on your individual circumstances but i dont think it is too early...you need you time before the big event|`|fzPFAB2Maa	I dont think its early. If you feel you need to start it then do. I started mine at 29 weeks due to the nature of my work (being on my feet for 12 hours a day, stress etc.) and I felt I wanted the time before baby arrives to wind down and prepare everything.I also had a chest infection and the winter vomiting virus just before so felt it was just time to stop and look after myself and baby! Everyones different but start it when you feel you need it.  I had to hand in my MATB1 certificate which i got from the doctors by 25 weeks pregnant and a form stating when i intended to start my leave. Then my pay was automatically started. Maybe each employer does it slightly differently?  good luck and take some time to relax and look after yourself :)|`|m0DgqEcjaa	I'm going on maternity leave on the 16th March, i have one weeks holiday prior to that so leave on 6th March, i also have a weeks holiday to have before that but need to be in work the first week of March so looking at doing 4 day weeks until then!    It's completely up to you went you leave! and what you are comfortable with.|`|wxImZRssaa	I was actually told by a health care professional to start my maternity leave as late on as possible. Then if need be sign off sick until the maternity leave starts.    Maybe you should do that. I started my maternity leave on my due date. Luckily I had 3 weeks worth of holidays left to book. So took them in the lead up to maternity leave.    I was lucky and work with sympathetic people, who never expected too much from me in my late pregnancy. So I was comfortably able to work full time till 37 weeks.|`|jwboSl1Qaa	Wow you get maternity pay? I think only you know whats best for you.  If you are sick then by all means it would be good to let your body rest and not push it to the limit.  Your health is important and you're definitely going to need to be healthy to have your baby.  Congrats.|`|CUYuAGF5aa	I started my maternity leave as of yesterday and I am 34 weeks pregnant today.  It's not too early to leave work as it's a personal choice as to when you feel your ready to take time to yourself.  This is my first baby and since christmas i've been feeling really tired so i'm really glad of the time off.  If you havn't been feeling all that brilliant from the infections you have had then definitely is time to sit with your feet up and relax and get your strength back up which you wouldn't be able to do if you were working.  If you say to your employer your going off on maternity leave they will pay you for that as of that day.  If you are off sick at the moment and don't go back they include these days as your maternity leave and pay starting.    Good luck and keep in touch if you like since we're both due about the same time.|`|KPuDlWFiaa	it entirely up to you when you want to take maternity leave, i'm not taking mine until 28 April which means ill be just over 39 weeks, im working so far into it because i have an office job which isnt very stressful, plus id rather spend the time with the baby rather than on my own...but if your feeling so worn down its prob best for you and your baby to take it early.|`|d5dab38054b602ea4b8d35786d344227aa	I wanted to leave at 32 weeks but due to pressure from work have agreed to work until 35 weeks so I don't think 33 weeks is too early. It depends on whether you want to take your full maternity and then return to work in which case you will have a few less weeks with the baby after it's born. If you intend to give up work for a few years then I guess it doesn't matter. I would love to be a stay at home mum, but it's just not financially viable for me and my husband so I have to go back part time at the end of my leave. I am wondering the same about maternity pay too...
wBFpG141aa	Do NOT give your baby honey! The bacteria in it can be fatal to children under a year of age. Is your baby not eating at all or just very little. Sometimes their appetites can vary. If your baby isn't feeling well, he may not eat as much either. Is he eating baby food yet? If so, try a variety of foods to see what your baby prefers. Once they start eating solids, their need for milk/formula decreases slightly. If this has been going on for more than a day, please call your  baby's doctor. It is not worth risking your baby's life. Babies can become dehydrated quickly, which can be very dangerous.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	duhduhduh  go to the freakin' doc or the er if it is night time|`|ppKQEhEMaa	Take the baby to the doctor if its not eating.|`|DVmDWDC4aa	not taking what? food? milk? breast/bottle?

1CryEnb3aa	Some women don't show a positive with a urine test til 6-8 weeks pregnant.  All depends on when the egg was fertilized and then started producing the hsg from then. Go to the dr and get a blood test done.  This can detect as early as the first day of conception.  Good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It could also be your period wanting to start...

Expressed milk can be kept in a sterilized bottle in the fridge or frozen to be given later. If it is at all possible it would be good idea to meet your wife at one of her breaks and have the baby feed as normal as this would encourage the production of milk better than expressing will.|`|CdodhnP5aa	You can rent a breast pump and your wife can pump during the day.
MuALb7lxaa	There is no specific amount of violated or reported answers that gets your suspended. If you are reported numerous times, your suspension gets more likely. If you give serious violations like threats, hate messages, then it's a lot more likely to get suspended. Again, there is no specific number of violations known that get someone suspended. It determines how many and how bad they are.     Also, I've been violated many times. Haha.  To see why you lost 10 points is most likely the result of Yahoo deleting a question or answer of yours. If you would like to see a report, you usually can see in your email a "Violation Notice" subject email that is from yahoo. It tells you why it was deleted. It says    Question: How are you?  Reason: Chatting    You can appeal these where it says "appeal" in the message. However sometimes appeals do not always work. If your appeal fails, you get 10 points deducted from your account. If you get an appeal approved, the answer/question gets reposted.     Suspensions last forever, but it may last a period of time However, you can appeal to get it reversed.    All the best. I hope this cleared it up. Email me if you have further questions.

AA11763588	If I were you I'd call my DR.    Contractions usually last about a minute and they hurt.    I don't think Braxton Hicks would wake you up like that.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Too early to be contractions.  I would definitely call your dr.  At least let them tell you whats normal or not.

Good luck.|`|yQVcIfa8aa	call the doctor first thing, anything that causes you so much pain, enough that it wakes you should be discussed with your doctor, they won't think your silly at all, they are used to these kind of questions, good luck!|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	Hi.  This sounds similar to what I have suffered from/am still suffering from at 28 weeks.  I would get sharp pains and also dull aches all around my bump, which my doc/midwife has put down to growing pains.  It started around 20 weeks when I had a growth spurt, and has become bad again recently due to another growth spurt!  Everyone has told me not to worry, that it's normal, and that some women have a tougher time than others.  If it gets really bad it is OK to take a couple of paracetamol.  Also, I sleep on my left side with a pillow under me to support my bump, this helps me get a better sleep.  Of course, you should check with your doc, nothing is silly in pregnancy as everyone is different.  Give him a buzz but don't stress, sounds fairly normal to me.  Good luck x|`|hi9SYnrraa	u just described exactly what i went/am still going through. i went to the er though.lol. they pretty much laughed at me and told me to calm down.its my first so there is no calm.but that's how it was/is for me

szVvf7Nkaa	Yes honesty is the best policy. But I can  also understand that you are afraid to tell your mom that you're pregnant. You know your mom better then we do so you must have a feeling how she is going to react. I think the sooner you tell her the better it's going to be for you. It must be stressing you out right now that you have to tell her. And you need to remember that your mom loves you. She will be upset once she hears the news but she will get over it. She loves you enough to want to be there for you. And right now I think it would be good if you had your mom to confide in. This is probably stressing you out and that is not good for you or your baby. So talk to your mom as soon as possible. I promise you once your mom finds out about your pregnancy and once she cools off everything is going to be ok.|`|cLGVSuFqaa	you should tell her  the longer you leave it, the worse it will become|`|FO0XWRDeaa	Without a doubt it is. And she may react negatively, but she'll found out sooner or later even if you don't tell her.|`|dCMi5rjdaa	there's a reason for that saying...........    YES, honesty is the best policy.    one lie turns into another, turns into another, turns into another, and then you forget the first lie, and so get caught.    Good Luck with your mother. If you have a good relationship with her, it should all go well.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	You really do need to tell her. It's better that she founds out now rather than later on in the pregnancy because really, she WILL notice once it looks like you've swallowed a watermelon whole. And this will give you & your family more time to weigh your options & prepare for a new baby.    Good Luck Sweetie |`|Jg9NOc8Zaa	In my point of view I think you should really tell your mum because if you prolong your problem it might be too late... besides youre mother would know what to do coz she went through that stage already....

Is your Mum prone to violence? Or mentally unstable?   If so: it may be best to confide in another close adult relative or carer.  BUT if not: As soon as you can.

SlhEgGl2aa	i did a childcare course and they say just to give small amounts so give him wat you are having but just small amounts for his little belly|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I wouldn't give a 7 month old ice cream.  It's very sugary.  As for yoghurt, you can give petit filous from a young age, and they're in really small pots, so should be enough for a 7 month old.|`|HVWAq4u9aa	You can let him taste it...a teaspoon or two maybe.  But much more than that, and the cow's milk is likely to upset his tummy.  His system isn't really ready to process that yet.  As far as what kind...just anything you're eating should be fine...as long as it's nothing he needs to chew and doesn't have anything he may be allergic to.  (I'd avoid any icecream with peanut butter in it...things like that.)|`|heoBp6Taaa	Don't see why not my health nurse said it's fine to let bubs taste every thing (not feed them a huge helping). I gave my son natural yogurt at about 6 months mixed with his brekky (doesn't taste real great on it's own) be careful with the flavoured ones as they may upset his belly start with small amounts and see how he goes. As for ice cream my niece was eating it at 8 months with no probs my son is 2 and still doesn't like ice cream would just rather the cone..    If your unsure ask your health nurse or doctor for more professional advise..|`|I9LTTno2aa	yes you can what ever kind you get is fine
uhj76Fkpaa	You could put his crib right next to your bed to make him feel like sleeping with you.Put near him one of your clothes so that he can smell you and be secure.You should insist a little harder on this though..he will try to force you to take him back...stay by his crib holding his hand and try singing something to him until he finally sleeps.Good luck|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if he has been sleeping in there until recently, you may have to figure out if he's teething etc...if it is new, let him sit in there and look around, maybe with a toy or something, so he feels it is a safe place...then move on to naps...if u must, swaddle him, he's not too old, and maybe before long he will lrealize where he is supposed to sleep; we are in the same process and she's been napping in there and she sleeps a lot better in there, so she will probably go in for the night soon..|`|dXVA1wHDaa	You need to persevere with it.  Like someone else said, start with daytime naps.  Continue this for a week or so, then start with bedtime.    He'll get used to it.|`|SlhEgGl2aa	my son was the same you just have to get him used to being in it even during his naps during the day     i did this and he hates sleeping anywhere else he loves the cot now|`|HVWAq4u9aa	Try the cry it out method.  I know it seems mean, but it'll most likely only take a couple of tries and he'll be over it.  The trick is...get him sleepy *but not asleep yet.  Then put him down in the crib and pat him for a minute talking softly.  Then leave the room.  If he cries, the first time, go back in and shush him and pat again.  The second time he cries, wait about 5 minutes before going in.  Shush and pat again.  The third time, wait about 10 minutes.  Then go in and calm him again.  Most important rule though is not to pick him up...just comfort him.  Don't wait any more than 10 minutes at a time without going in.  It may help (depends on your baby) if you have some white noise and a dark room.  Eventually though, he will get tired and fall asleep.  The second time he goes down this way, it'll be a lot easier.  When I did it, it worked the first time (meaning I didn't have to repeat everything the next day).  He will learn to self soothe though, if you are consistent with it, and you will be very glad for this now and when he's a little older.  This "tool" of his will carry on into childhood...and you'll be very glad for it (especially toddler age!)|`|reO9Dgmsaa	You can't force it; that's cruel.  If you will not co-sleep, you can try a sidecar arrangement (his crib right up next to your bed, so you can reach out to comfort him).  If you won't do that, try the No-Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley.  It's a non-CIO, gentle way to go.    Remember, he is a tiny baby, and used to being with you!  For nearly 10 months he was inside you being comforted and rocked; it's ridiculous how our society demands that babies are self-sufficient instantly.  If I'm crying I would hope my husband hugs me, not leaves me alone to it!  And I'm 26!  LOL|`|eVmQGDHQaa	I know that is really difficult but I found that having the patience to just keep putting my daughter down every time she sat up helped she eventually got tired and gave up it also helps to put him down when he is really tired.
ofOVjNJRaa	Physical symptoms don't exactly tell you whether you're pregnant. What you are feeling right now are not a dependable gauge of whether a life is already conceived in your womb.

I do not know how long you were on birth control....but depending on that it might take a little over 4-5 months to actually be regular again off of birth control. Ovulation should only be between 3-4 days, so I am not sure why your temperature would be elevated for 12 days.   I also have hypothyroid, and if you are not on the right medications, it could effect your ovulation cycle.   Once you have everything taken care off as in medications, and you wait a few more months for the birth control to pass....you should be able to start REALLY trying.     Good luck!

Cold croissant sandwiches, fruit on skewers in a vase is beautiful on a table-top, and the popular sherbet and 7-up punch to drink is the best! As for fun games, google  baby shower games and pick a few of your favs.  One funny one is the fun-sized candy bars in the diapers, or you can make your guests race to eat baby food!

AA11236050	Pregnancy can happen when ejaculate or pre-ejaculate gets in the vagina or on the vulva. Physically, a woman is ready to become pregnant when she ovulates for the first time. Since ovulation usually happens before the first time a girl menstruates, it is possible for a girl to get pregnant before her first period ever comes.    It's hard to know when this ovulation is happening because you can't see it, although most women experience a change in their vaginal discharge during ovulation. If the egg is not fertilized by sperm, the lining of your uterus will shed and come out of your vagina and menstruation begins.    Puberty is when your body changes from a girl's body to a woman's body. It can take several years and usually happens between the ages of nine and 17.    Usually, menstruation begins about two years after your breasts begin to develop and a year after your pubic hair begins to grow. But every girl is different. It also depends on your health and on when the women in your family started their periods. If you're really concerned about not having your period yet, you can talk to your clinician about it.    Hope this information helps!|`|dea2df81b5fcf71dc19ae7ef421df15eaa	once you start your period though, be careful, you can get pregnant even when you are on your period without protection!|`|AA11620244	If you got sexually involved with a man (unless u are one) days before ur period started, then yes, it could happen, but its extremely unlikely|`|AA12227258	no you cant your body isnt ready for  a baby to grow inside of it  and having a peroid means that your a woman  and since you havent had your's yet you dont have to worry about being  pregnant. but once your peroid come then worry about it  and if your going to have sex use a condom|`|AA11429639	sigh...these people are wrong.

AA12060738	Well you could be just experiencing a hormonal imbalance. I went through the same thing - my LMP was April 4th, and I was expecting a period by May 9th but it didn't come. My hubby and I tried that month so we thought we were pregnant. I took pregnancy tests on 3 different days, with a week interval between each tests, and they were all negative. I went to see my OB-GYN, took another test, and it was negative. My doctor said that I probably did not ovulate during that cycle, and missing an ovulation can give you pregnancy symptoms as well as a missed period. He also said that it usually corrects itself on its own and to just wait for the next cycle to see if a period comes at all. Believe me, we thought we were really pregnant because I had all of the pregnancy symptoms (and I've been pregnant before so I knew what it was like). But on June 2nd, I had some bleeding, which could be my period. So I wasn't pregnant, just having a hormonal imbalance.    In your case, since you already had a negative blood test result, have your doctor do a physical examination to determine what's the cause of your amenorrhea.

The tests you take will depend on your age and your pregnancy history. A number of these test can also help you determine the gender of your baby.    An ultrasound will probably be one of the first performed to confirm your pregnancy. But after that, how do you know which ones you should have?    pregnancy tests There are some tests that all mothers will be offered, like glucose screening and alpha-fetoprotein. Tests for things like cystic fibrosis  are only performed if you have a family history of the disease. Other tests, like chorionic villus screening  and amniocentesis are more commonly offered to pregnant women over the age of 35. Women can confirm the true father of their baby by opting for paternity testing. This can be done as early as the tenth week of pregnancy.    Combined first-trimester screening is a new test that has only started being offered to pregnant women. Performed in the first trimester, this test is safer and more accurate than many other prenatal screening tests.    Your medical practitioner and/or genetic counselor will advise you on which tests would be most beneficial. Because all of these tests have positive and negative aspects, it is important to be informed about them. Be sure to read about all of them so you can decide what you want to be tested for.|`|c93ef90e755108592ccf18c4d72bc896aa	i didn't have any symptoms of pregnancy, but still got a positive test. It may have been too early for your pregnancy to show up. Wait another week or two and take the test again.

Most women ovulate between days 7-14, everybody is different, counting the day you start your period as day one, go from there.

Your chances are between 50/50 if you can recognize when you are ovulating it would help.  for example breast become tender.  you have about 48 hours since the eggs dies in 2 days but the sperm stays inside about 3 days.. good luck|`|AA11210405	this is my standard answer, but it's true.  go to the store or library and get a book called " taking charge of your fertility" by Toni Weschler.  It will help you chart your month and figure out EXACTLY when you are fertile or not and no more myths or guessing.  It's not just about getting pregnant.  It's about taking control and knowing your body.
AA10939055	Is it safe to go on a cruise during pregnancy?  If you have a normal, healthy pregnancy, cruising can make for a safe, relaxing, romantic vacation. With bracing ocean air and countless ship and shore activities to try, your biggest problem may be how to avoid getting worn out by all the excitement.    But before booking a ticket, talk to your healthcare provider about whether or not a cruise is a good idea for you. If your pregnancy is complicated by a medical condition, a prior preterm delivery, or twins or higher multiples, your doctor or midwife may recommend against it.    When you call cruise lines, ask about their restrictions for pregnant travelers (see below) and whether or not a doctor, nurse, or both will be on board. Keep in mind that many smaller ships (under 100 passengers) do not have medical personnel on staff. And don't count on a shipboard pharmacy to stock your medications. Bring a supply to cover the entire trip.    Also check your health insurance policy to make sure you'll be covered if you have any complications on board or at any of the ports of call. You can buy additional travel medical coverage from most cruise lines or directly from insurance companies.     What restrictions do cruise lines place on pregnant travelers?  Most cruise lines have restrictions against pregnant women sailing during their third trimester. To sail with Carnival or Royal Caribbean, for example, a mom-to-be must be no more than 26 weeks along at any time during the cruise. Specific policies vary, however, so check with the cruise line before booking.    Whether or not the cruise line requires it, it's a good idea to carry a letter from your healthcare provider stating your due date, medical condition, travel fitness, and any medications you're taking. That way you can avoid unpleasant surprises at the boarding dock.|`|AA11585432	My sister went on a cruise when she was almost 7 months pregnant. She was ok. Her doctor gave her some sea sick pills to use which were safe for her baby. She told us the first 2 nights she needed them other than that she was fine and she really found it very relaxing.|`|AA11935630	i would be ill if i went on a cruise try using travel bands just in case they help with motion sickness|`|AA10476009	I believe it's considered safe to travel until 3rd trimester.  Consult doctor.  espically if shots are required (for hep b, etc.)|`|7f9b7fed0ba75cfaac870b535d3a0879aa	Well, depending on the cruise's contract- you have to let them know she's pregnant, how far along she is, etc. Some cruises have restrictions on how far along the woman can be. Plus, some of the on shore activities do not allow pregnant women to participate. I was 3 months pregnant when I was on a cruise and I wish I had waited. I was very tired  the whole time. And I don't get sea sick but there were a couple of times I thought I'd puke- don't know which was the cause of that- preg or boat. Plus, she'll need to be careful about any odd foods that she may want to eat!|`|AA10321198	Right now before the third trimester is the best.  She needs this vacation!!!|`|AA12097048	No, I have never been on a cruise pregnant. But I did fly at four months pregnant. Get advice from your OB/GYN before going, but I'm sure it will be fine! She might get a liitle sick maybe, but that's about it. See if it safe for her to take Dramamine. Or bring some mint tea, mint helps soothe the belly!
AA12199251	It's not bad at all. They put you under, so you don't feel a thing. You wake up in the recovery room with a little soreness. But really it's no big deal. I had mine and then went to work that night.|`|AA11018340	Cervical Clerage  I personally have never had it done, but my doc said they may chose to do that to me. She said they give you anesthesia. However, after some on-line research, there is a debate over whether this is an effective way to keep the cervix "closed" until your ready for delivery. Some docs. have said that bedrest is just as/more effective and there have been some instances where women dialated before their stitches came out.     Not to worry you, though.     The doc. did say the actual procedure and after the procedure only causes a little soreness. You will be fine.|`|d3fadef1303b0e3f7c056d62797c862baa	I didn't know you could do that...|`|AA12033834	no i never did but it does  sound painfull maybe they put you to sleep|`|AA11347605	i had it with my 1st kid that 3 months into my pregnecy they had to put half off my body to sleepy then they  open me up like if they where going to do a reg check up they just up that thing in that was it it dint hurt  then they took it out when i was about 38 weeks but it's ok i guess but with my other 3 i dint want it becuase i dint want them to  put my body to sleep well  just half but still that;s was the only part that i dint like
AA11780805	If your doctor says you are 27 wks, then that is what you are.  They count ovulation as part of it, too.  That's the two extra weeks.  Don't worry.  The kid will come when it's ready, just hopefully not at this stage!!!!!|`|AA11102769	They go by 27 weeks.    This method never made much sense to me, you are 2 weeks pregnant at conception.|`|8b714b6befd467f1d0b0dd8e696d426daa	They would go by 27 weeks.|`|74477ae1aecfc27ae3e0e1595321681caa	Go by what your Doctor says.|`|5d6d1353e9a5813353c264fc0644017faa	The reason there are two ages, is even with todays technology the ultrasound can be off by two Weeks that is why on at ultra sound if you look closely you should see plus or minus x number of days. Now when the baby is born they look for certain physical and developmental stages that happen at certain weeks. This is how they would determine the "age" of the baby.|`|5ca2c2b595ea31c5e6143b75ad14f279aa	Good question! This confuses me too! They would go by 27 weeks, and so should you.
638063325d40e53a8afbdfac133b161faa	i've heard that if you're preggers you shouldn't even get near the stuff. so be careful!|`|13d45e6d2c15945c41c9fd496fea5fe1aa	If you need Rogain maybe you are a little old for a baby?

That will make a difference on what you can use.The best thing to do is call your OB and ask what you can use. I am pretty sure you can use Hydrocortisone Cream. Also try Aveno baths and plain lotion. Maybe they will help until you can ask your OB. Congrats on your new baby.

Did you ever think that maybe your older daughter may be a loner because she know that you two are different? She may feel left out because she likes different things than you and your son. And now another girl is going to be there. She's scared I bet. But at 14 she'd rather die than tell you. Sit down and talk with her. Reach out to her and try to be involved with what she likes. Good Luck!|`|AA11573246	Wow you have just said so much...First of all you have divorced her dad....don't forget girls are naturally closer to their dads at this time....Then you have dated....then you remarried.... and of course decided you needed to extend your family....Wow....that is a lot of things that you have done for you.   I agree with the person that suggested doing what your daughter likes....try it...watch her face...listen to her...get interested in what motivates her...4 years and she is able to move completely out of your life....As for the babysitting thing....She is not your babies mother or the person that decided to bring another life into this world....She should never be made to feel responsible for her sister....That being said....My youngest was born loving her older sister...It was the most phenomenal thing I have ever witnessed...the younger one just naturally drew the older one in... They chose to be together most of the time although they definitely need their own space.... Mine rarely disagree because they are so different in age and every other way....My Lil one is definitely more mine and the older is all dad's but I suspect this will all change as life progresses....I know that I had children to be in the middle of their lives and that means jumping into their world.

Good luck|`|AA11109728	Ask her about something she is interested in, even though it may differ from your tastes, and get involved.  Maybe she feels like a loner because she knows she has nothing in common with you and your son.  It sounds like if you don't already, you may want to try to spend some time with her doing what she likes to do.  Show some interest, and it will mean a lot to her knowing that it's not something you would normally do, but that you are doing it because you care about her and want to be closer.|`|0d456a697e8cf1af93a909e2581ec024aa	That is just a stage your daughter is going through. It could also mean she is a little jealous too. I would allow her to work her way into this. If she does not want to babysit that is fine but once she sees the baby then she will probably change her mind. Boys are usually mom's boys anyways so that should not surprise you at all about your son being there for you.|`|0e09d345040889775bdfcbf5314bc648aa	Maybe you are treating your daughter differently because you don't feel as close -and she realizes it.

Pedile a alguien que sea de tu confianza que te acompa?e a recoger el resultado. Es la mejor forma de saberlo, adems no te sirve de nada seguir con la duda, porque el tiempo sigue pasando, mejor con la prueba si estas, tenes mas tiempo para pensar que vas a hacer y si no estas que te sirva de una buena leccion que usar condon no es dificil y te evita todo este problemon, ademas si tu pareja te quiere, aunque sea de mala gana, aceptara usarlo.    No busques mas informacion en internet, porque eso lo unico que hace es que te pongas mas predispuesta a sentir todo lo que dice que podes sentir, mareos, nauseas, etc, el poder de la mente es muy grande...te lo digo por experiencia propia...hacete la prueba...no es muy dificil y salis de dudas de una vez por todas.    Si te haces una casera, y no queres dejar evidencia en tu casa o en la casa de una amiga, anda a un centro comercial, al fin y al cabo tienen botes de basura en donde podes dejar el empauque y a pruebaj despues de saber que pasa...lo mas que pasa es que las demas que quieren usar el servicio, pensaran que adentro hay alguien que esta mal del estomago.

Mine would always have a red tint to it no matter what color I dyed it. I would recommend going to a salon instead of doing it yourself|`|AA11962313	It's usually safe to color your hair while you're pregnant, but some doctors would ask you not to during your first trimester.    The problem is, your body chemistry is all out of whack right now and the chemicals in the hair dye might react to your hair differently than they normally would.  So, it may not turn out the same even if you use the same dye you did before you got pregnant.|`|AA12346412	don't do it!

Use your common sense. The more you expose your fetus or child to questionable risk factors, the more likely things will not go well. It's a matter of statistics. Sure, it might do no harm, but eventually, choosing risky choices will bear out bad consequences. Do you really want to gamble with your child's health? The fact that you have to ask at all should tell you don't try it. Wait for them to grow up and wreck their own lives with their own poor choices. Don't wreck their lives for them. By continually making good choices they will model that and make good choices for themselves. We are all a product of the sum of all the choices we and others who have cared for us have ever made our whole lives. Start listening to your maternal instincts, they are spot on.

A good way to tell is if he has any other children, a lot of men only have one gender, my father made all girls and my man's father made only boys, 4 of them.

57a5ea906c4ad284452458272e911c0aaa	Yo empesaria por definir a lo que te refieres como orgasmo. Tal ves tu pregunta surge porque los hombres tendemos a eyacular cuando estamos demasiado exitados y es lo que comunmente asociamos como orgasmo. Por el contrario, en las mujeres no se observa (o al menos no es tan visible) algun tipo de secrecion. Entonces lo que te quiero decir es que el orgasmo masculino no esta necesariamente asociado con la eyaculacion. Has el intento de tener un orgasmo sin eyacular y creo  que talves eso sea lo mas parecido a un orgasmo femenino, aunque claro tendrias que estimular algunas otras partes de tu cuerpo al mismo tiempo, ya que mientras las mujeres son un manojo de terminales nerviosas suceptibles de ser estimuladas, nosotros los hombrecitos nos ocupanos tanto de nuestro "amiguito" que creemos que es la unica zona erogena que tenemos.    En conclusion creo que un hombre puede llegar a tener un orgasmo igual al de las mujeres y visceversa.     Gracias.|`|17508f2fd40b95bf02ba6096b6763a35aa	Bueno cada organismo cuerpo y persona tiene sensaciones diferentes.  Los orgasmos incluso cuando los siente la mujer son de intensidad y tiempos distintos, en un hombre igual, segun el nivel de excitacion del momento o de la continuidad del acto en ese dia.

If a woman goes to a christian clinic, she should know what she's going to hear.  I'm constantly bombarded with people saying that a baby is not a baby in early pregnancy, and that abortion isn't the "killing" of a human being.  Now, I would never tell a woman that she doesn't have the right to choose, but aborting a pregnancy is ending a life.  I went in for my first ultrasound last week.  I was 6 weeks pregnant.

SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE?!  thats ridicious ! Our nation was built on christian principles. The basis of our laws taken from the 10 commandments.    What your saying is totally filled with lies in itself.

Non of you have any idea what you are talking about|`|66ad94a5160780320e4522a1ca28f019aa	I think that it is said that they prey on teenagers that are unable to make up there mind for themselves and also a lot of teenagers our uneducated on abortions so they believe what these people tell them. My friend and I both went to a christian pregnancy center. My appointment was at 9am and hers at 10am. I knew my friend was going to hate it by the things they said to me. Im 21 and I told the father of my soon to be baby that I would have been extremely upset if I was 16 and went in there...they really said some things that I felt were not as you would say nice. They told me I was a sinner for having sex before marriage and I needed to make it up to god, lucky for me I already knew that I didnt want an abortion before I got there because I can only imagen what they would have said. I know what its wrong to some people to have sex before marriage but I have only been with one guy and he is who Im pregnant by and I didnt ever have sex in my parents house I wanted until I had my own place and was able to make the choice and not fall into some lies that I may have when I was younger, so when they told me that I was a sinner and how bad it was it really did hurt. My friend was keeping this baby but she had an abortion when she was 17 because she didnt feel that she had a choice. And when she had her appointment she told then she has had an abortion (not knowing how they were going to act) and they told her she was terrible person and she killed her baby. I mean it was already something she didnt feel good about doing, so imagine being a 15-18 year old girl hearing things like that......Anyway me nor my friend ever went back. The worst thing about it was in the ad they said they were not there to judge and they were there to help...but it didnt seem that way.|`|AA10738882	I'm alittle upset but not much b/c i don't believe in abortion, except for under certain circumstances. i believe that if you are ready to have sex, you should be responsible enough to handle what might happen. it shouldn't be used as a form of birth control and that's what most girls use it for. maybe if some of you read how their done it might change what you think about abortion.|`|074cf24574f09e8812a4a212c35f0c43aa	I think the Government should fine them or shut them down.

6cb1ebf4a757d9e8b4224b5eaeb8b90eaa	Pornography seems like it shouldn't be that bad, seeing as though you're curious about sex.  Curiosity is normal when you're in your teens.  Your body is changing, and your attractions are taking over.  You have alot of pressure on you, too, more than ever before to be knowledgable about sex and about becoming a man.  Just know that pornography might make you feel like you're the man when you're looking at it, but alot of what you see is not reality.  These women are air-brushed, they've had all sorts of surguries to give them help, and a woman that you will love someday will not be able to compete.  You don't want to have trouble in your sex life someday beacause you have these pornographic images in your heart and mind.  I am a christian, but in highschool I watched a little bit of a porn movie and I thought it was pretty disgusting, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.  Soon after, I started experimenting a little bit sexually.  If I could take back all that, I would.  I wish I could give my whole heart to my husband, and never have given little pieces of my heart away.  Remember, pornography is addicting.  It stays in your mind and in your heart.  Just know you're not a bad person, but pornography is definately not natural.  Save your heart and body for the love of your life.

Enjoy Kiddo.|`|afbadb6cbe6119422ca314ee837c3b96aa	Well it is expected and understandable, but we should try to keep it to a minimum. It's definitely better than sneaking around at night spying on girls in shower/whatever. If your parents get on to you about it, make sure you tell them that. :)|`|ca0c3b8c5d7911f5cb55df30cd173741aa	YES it is very normal for a teenage boy yo look at pron trust me even when you are older you will still look at it and there will be nothing wrong with you it is very healthy!!! so dont freak out your ok just go on with your life and keep looking if you want and just stay in school!!!!|`|d2e77c578f698627b127ee201939d487aa	It's perfectly fine. It's normal. I mean if it's a continuous thing that journeys through into adulthood when you're married and have kids, thats not good. But you're a teenager. It's natural. It's in the male hormones =D And it's good that you're not addicted to it. Don't worry about it.|`|AA10644017	no|`|AA10769523	Darlin you are 100% completely normal!

AA11663226	Let me tell you i have been on every birth control imaginable. Some pills make you bleed all the time. I have had that experience.  I think it was a very responsible thing for you to get on birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies and as long as your partner and you are the only ones each other are with that is also good. But for the birth control issue...you might have to do the trial and error method, to find the best one for you. Good Luck!|`|AA10959632	if you keep having problems, call you doctor and see if there is another brand you can take. being on birth control is not safe sex. don't trust anyone when it comes to your body. did you know that 70% of people with herpes don't even know they have it? how safe do you feel now? use condoms!|`|AA11841705	if this doesnt clear up in a day or two, or any of it gets worse then call your doctor....  he might need to change your prescription....   and no fooling around until you know the pill is working!!!|`|AA10503633	Most of what you said sounds normal. Birth control pills are a powerful medicine, and it will take your body a little to adjust. If the problems persist, you should consult your doctor. They may be too strong for you and will need to be changed.|`|AA11438537	You need to go back to the doctor,you could be on the wrong kind especially if it keeps up...and if you are mature for your age you need to have a talk with your mother...because you just share way to much info!!!!!|`|68cf96198e35530754abcefe73f3ef88aa	alright birthcontrol pills regardless of the type give some people side effects..the Doctor will tell u that the side effects may last 1-3 months...if they persist past this :trial period: ask for a different brand of birthcontrol..also if u read the drug facts..it will tell u what side effects to expect...headaches..cramping and even weight gain are common..oh and good job keeping urself safe!|`|a9c5a183883f9cb4c09806e4aae90c6caa	Well, I'm not going to preach about sex too young but at least think about that whole fiance thing... We are all very different than we were when we were 15, even me and I'm only 19... but anyway. You should reall see your doctor. That could be a reaction to the BC. BC is also something you should really let your mother in on. She knows alot more about these kinds of things than you think and she also can be more understanding than you think. And don't forget STDs can lie dormant in a man for a very long time but show up in the woman very early... you really should be careful. And birth control is not completely fool proof. Things happen.|`|AA11715471	you are 15, you may be injured from having intercourse at this young age.    you are not having sex and relying only on the pill, are you?  it takes 1 month for them to work, and the bleeding may be from the implantation of a pregnancy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11791565	It's probably the side affects of the pill. I remember the pill would always make me feel dizzy. You could get your pills changed or if your very concerned, ask your doctor.|`|AA11542926	Okay - girl.  One step at a time.  I, too, took the initiative to be safe - so I can relate - though it was many years ago for me....    First things first.  On the packages you will find every side effect you just named above.  The question is are the side effects tolerable.  Read your package and if none of the side effects you have are listed under the "stop taking" section then give your body a bit more time to adjust.    Just a reminder - 9 days is not long enough to be having unprotected sex just yet.  Keep the condom on for at least a month.      I know you said he is your fiance - and I wish you all the happiness in the world.    You can also call your GP's office & ask general questions.  A nurse there would be happy to talk to you without your disclosing your name...|`|c027f022e3df88bb6257f44097f17be2aa	everytime i start a pack of birth control pill, i also feel the same way that u do. maybe that's normal. but after about two weeks, those unwanted feelings disappear.     it's always the situation in any brand of pill i use. i don't continuously use bc pills. when my husband is on board the ship for 6 months i dont use bc of course. i only use it when he's on vacation.
AA11813754	You give up EVERYTHING.  Your life will be totally devoted to that child for the rest of your life.  You give up sleep, friends, going out, school (in most cases), freedom to come and go.  In short, everything you even think about doing will have to revolve around that child.|`|AA12096768	You basically give up everything for your child.  Any social life, any time to yourself at all.  You have to always put your child first no matter what - it doesnt matter if youre hungry, thirsty, need a shower, tired, need to pee, are sick....none of that matters - you still have to put the child first.  Its a lot of work.    The flip side is this - having a child is the greatest joy there ever is.  You have this human being come from you and your partner that you fall in love with as soon as you see him/her.  They depend on you for everything and you are their whole world for the first few years of their life.  Its a joy everyday watching them learn and grow and theres never a dull moment.    I dont think youre ready to be a Mother if youre just a teen - my opinion is that you need to finish school, concentrate on your own life first before you bring another life into the world.  Then someday - a few years from now (and it will come quick) you can have a child with your husband, after youre married and have a stable home, job, car, etc....|`|AA12118274	Your not ready. Your whole life becomes about the baby. Even if you think you are ready, your not.|`|AA11693511	You give up almost ALL of your free time, time with friends, time to yourself. You gain dirty diapers, waking up ALL hours of the night to change diapers, feed the baby, take the baby to the hospital when he/she gets really sick in the wee hours of the morning. Then as the baby gets older you get a little ball of energy that won't stay out of ANYTHING. You have to put EVERY little object out of it's reach, you have to buy clothes and shoes every 2-3 months or so, you get screaming, crying and NO PEACE!  I hope you are ready!
AA10873512	Mine were just sore period. You know how your body feels when you have the flu?  Plus, my nipples were REALLY sensitive.  They hurt when I took a shower-just from the water hitting them.  AND, it was that way for each of my pregnancies. Hope this helps.|`|5a8df9795882e79567692325c7d39b60aa	I'm three months pregnant and so far have had a few different pains in my breasts.  First of all it was like I had my period.  The got quite big and were just a bit tender to touch.  Then when I was about seven weeks I had to start wearing a sleep bra because if I lay on my back and then rolled over I would get this almost stabbing pain as my breasts moved.  Then there's the nipple sensitivity and the fact that my breasts have gone up two cup sizes and my nipples seem to have a life of their own.  Hope this helps but there's so much the books don't tell you.|`|a6d3a24157d0bcb92ae9612eda06c941aa	Hmmmm im not sure  i think you should take a picture  and then post a link  i think that would help a bunch  yeah  i say you do it  k?  k|`|AA12155825	Your breast will get tender at first and then your nipples will get so sore you will kill if sombody touch them.

If they're having sex at your home obviously they're sexually active with each other. I'd rather know my child was safe at home, rather than under a bush in a park, in the back of a car or in someones home that I didn't know. Obviously I'd ensure my child was well educated on birth control and protection. Regardless of if I approve or not, I'd rather my child be SAFE.  My mother took this stance with me as a teenager, she educated me on protection and prevention. It wasn't an open invitation to be promiscuous, I couldn't just bring home a random person and sleep with them, it had to be someone i'd been dating a while, that had spent time with my mother and family.  I didn't have my first child till I was 25, so I guess she educated me well.|`|AA10371835	HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL NO I WILL COME HOME AND WHOOP THEY A S S E S S 4 EM  ESPECCIALLY IF THEY DID IT ON MY MARRIGE BED HELL NO I WILL OOOOOOOOO HURT EM NA UH|`|AA11789674	im with the people who say yes even though im SO not for all that teen sex crap id rather them be at home and it could open the opportunity if i havent already talked aout it to make sure theyre protected and know how serious sexd is and what is up with that edna woman?!?! shes retardeed! she stayed up all night taking names to report!

Read The Joy of Sex or other books on the matter.

Some women (like a girlfriend of mine) clean the entire house.

dc48c8b77efefd18d703b2e5cd544c7caa	I don't have personal experience with this one, but I have friends who have done it.  Mom is Japanese and dad is American.  They spoke both languages right on schedule, spoke Japanese when they were talking to mom, and English when talking to dad.  Even if mom asked a question in English, they still answered her in Japanese, I don't know if they taught the kids to do that on purpose or not though.  Every once in a while, I'd hear a mixed sentence, like "sumimasen, I just came in to say oyasumi-nasai, I love you!"  or something like that, but otherwise, the kids seemed to have no trouble learning two different languages.  I understand that it's actually much much easier for kids to learn a second language if it's taught to them so early, and easier for them to learn additional languages later on, because they're already familiar with thinking in a different language instead of trying to translate it.|`|11481facd6122449c2bda502de16134daa	Learning two languages from the get-go will give your children advance learning capabilities in school.

I think people worry way to much about what "society" sais when we consider  who to date. People should stick to three rules when it comes to dating..    -Dont date the ex-boyfriend/girlfriend of a friend or family member.  -Dont date the family member/ friends of and ex boyfriend/girlfriend.  -Be VERY careful when dating a co-worker.    Other then that --- go all out.|`|AA11889942	its not a good idea
a214d03a5719f40d2d27c80705082b2caa	do it slowly and it will be less tramatic for baby and less chance of a breast infection for you.  replace one nursing a day with a bottle ( you may have to have someone besides you do it) every few days until baby is only on bottles.  take away the favorites last.  my son's was first thing in the morning, and bed time so those were the last two to go.  good luck and congrats on nursing your baby for 9 months.  You gave him the best start!|`|537b867276be6a2be9f4aceb55fa0c19aa	start introducin small amount of breast milk in a bottle then gradually start him on formula in a bottle and u should get him on there pretty soon gd luck|`|AA12392532	Start out with giving the bottle a couple times a day and more and more as the days and weeks go on. Soon enough he will be off the breast.|`|29e214435c26ef0d28f8cfa072f3bed7aa	Quit taking your boob out!|`|AA11880152	Try to only let him have the breast at night. During the day give him sippy cups. If he's attached, it won't be easy on him or you. But stick to your guns. Maybe for the first week or so try to do something different than the routine. For example, if he feeds at 11:00, take him for a walk at that time, and bring a cup of milk.      My daughter naturally gave it up but she was a about 16 months. I was sad, I liked the bond.     Good luck.

11176be8331d0dea78afd0e63e924e0faa	Well it's hard to say if your pregnant or not. But here is some things I have learned over the years maybe it will help maybe not. Birthcontrol is not always effective. And antibiotics kind of reverse the action of the birthcontrol. But it's always a possiblity that you are having an allergic reaction to the medication. I would call and talk to your doctor about it. They may have some more advice about it.  I put a website on here that will be able to give you some more answers on medication reactions and pregnancy.|`|eefcf3845e2382b498d999b532d07aa6aa	you better go to your doctor to check ...|`|AA11558099	If you are not pregnant, then that is VERY weird!

If you don't use one already for any reason then you're just fooling yourself because, yes you could be pregnant or have gotten some kind of STD from this person that you are only sleeping with but he might not be as faithful.  You should always be protected and practice safe sex or no sex.
AA12084255	I prefer the regular stuff.  The idea of organic is nice, and I have bought it before.  Not because it was organic, but because there was a larger variety.    I've posted a link below to an excellent article re: the pros and cons of buying organic.  Apparently organic farmers DO use pesticides.  Interesting...    At any rate, I don't buy organic foods for my sons unless it's something that just looks good and is different.  (Stonyfield Farms makes the BEST yogurt, and my two boys are nuts about it.)|`|8ef0f842c44f7c4faa964afe4d9b4ee2aa	I prefer the cheaper one. To me its all the same.

With my daughter (now 1) I did a combo of organic, jarred and homemade.  However the best organic baby food I came across was called SweetPea Baby Food.  It is frozen in little cubes so you just pop out what you need, no waste and the frozen fruit was great for when my daughter was teething.  Check out www.sweetpeababyfood.com for a retailer near you.    All you really need to do though is to ensure your child is getting a well balanced and healthy diet.

432084d51aaa525d585a419535f845d2aa	In early May, I was suffering from a severe sinus infection...my period was due...so the doc called me in for a blood test to see if i was prego (he didn't want to give me the sinus drugs and a cat scan if i was).  He called me back the next day and said i wasn't pregnant.  Needless to say, i took the medicine and got a Cat scan of my nasal cavity.  three weeks later i took an at home test and found out I was pregnant.  The Dr thinks that i may have been newly pregnant the day he gave me the blood test (and it was too early for blood to tell), or that I had a late ovulation and got pregnant a little later.  There is no way to tell.  Unfortunately, I miscarried in early june.  But I believe that I'm proof that the blood tests aren't ALWAYS accurate!  Don't be discouraged yet.|`|AA12112224	I am not sure that it could show up but it might!! keep your fingers crossed!!

My doctor said that most women would not have consumed enough alcohol during those short weeks before you know you're pregnant to make a difference. But, it looks like you are aware that you did take a whole lot more than normal. I would say talk to your doctor and let her know that it happened. You won't know the effects until later, but at least she will be able to look out for the signs of any problems coming from it. Good luck.|`|AA10053890	Yes it can affect the baby's neural development and can either cause brain developmental defects.  Just make sure you're not drinking anymore.  Good luck|`|c0155cccd2d01d1072d6b500d0dc7473aa	Its called fetal alcohol syndrome.  Look it up.|`|bac4b9774ba6728e15725c2f32f55fe7aa	It could alter the baby's brain and maybe the baby could be mentally retarded, or hopefully maybe, just maybe, it didn't falter anything!|`|6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	Don't stress yourself over it now.  Most likely everything will be ok.  When did you get the positive sign, was it around the time you missed your period?  The first 10 days (roughly) the baby is kind of just floating around and is not really recieving a lot of nutrients from your body (or other things you put into it) until it attaches, which is around your period time.  If you drank during this time, it still isn't good but it most likely didn't effect the baby.  Let your doctor know about the drinking, she/he will most likely relieve your mind.  Many people drink before they know they are pregnant and they are fine.  Just make sure that you aren't drinking at all now (which I'm sure you aren't since you are so concerned about.)  Good luck :)  I'm 11 weeks pregnant right now :)  I'm having a hard time giving up caffeine, I just have to sneak in a sip or two of Dr. Pepper every once in awhile.
AA10834586	i used to get those suckers!!  man, they were not fun, but i just pushed through it and at some point they went away, but i don't know when b/c i just tried to phase them out of my mind.  mind over matter, ya know??    my ob said i could use tylenol, but i didn't like that thought b/c it would have been every day and i wanted to have as little unnatural stuff ingested as possible.    so, that's what i did, mom.  hang in there and eventually they will go away...even if it's after the baby is born:)    take care.|`|6e085aaace7fc215932a73b11b4d7421aa	Talk to your Dr. right away!! Do NOT delay you could have serious problems!!!|`|AA11605655	I'm 15 weeks and still continute to get headaches (bad ones) on and off. If you cannot stand the headache anymore you are allowed to take regular Tylonal. Don't take Ibuprophen or anything else though. They other kinds make your liver and kidneys work much harder and they're already working overtime with the baby.    Good luck!|`|3699657d6d1470c269c270af2d781dc6aa	HELLO go to the ER NOW!!!  This could be a very serious medical issue.|`|03d687826c182ad431c31467c042070baa	Headache is a pain in the head, scalp or neck. Headaches can be  caused by minor problems like eyestrain, lack of coffee or more  serious reasons like head injury, brain tumors, encephalitis and  meningitis. Taking painkillers continuously can have harmful side   effects, so it is better to modify your lifestyle. More information  available at http://tinyurl.com/q8696|`|AA10910514	It sounds like you need to see a doctor to find out what might be causing the headaches. The doctor might be able to prescribe something for you that could help get rid of the headaches better for you.|`|d543708f5193cde6fc5fe5d6228a2145aa	When you feel your headache start drink something high in caffiene. That is one of the ingredients from migraine meds and it worked for me. Also if you talk to your OB they might prescribe something for the pain. Mine gave me loritabs in small doses so I could still function and Tylenol with codeine. Both are safe if you use them in moderation.|`|f21428517a7d804843166a654b7df23daa	I had my 14 appointment yesterday and asked my doctor this very question. he said that 1000's of women complain of just this. He said that (in my case) since all else is well that it is most likely caused by hormone changes and changes in caffeine intake. He said I am allowed to take up to 4 regular strength tylenol per day--- 2 per dose of course. I hope this helps --- but you should always ask your doctor questions like this. Call them, I call and ask silly questions all the time.    Good Luck to You|`|ab4d5e373c40425f0197d0d32e3f7207aa	Have you tried some tylenol? It works wonders for me! Take regular strength, the recommended dose.It is safe for pregnancy.Good luck!

If it comes fresh from the dairy farm, then you should ALWAYS boil it to be sure that it is sterilized. I lived in Pakistan for two years and I had fresh cow milk everyday (boiled and warm from the pot). It is best for you than any packaged or processed milk. Also if you don't like the part that thickens at the top of the boiled milk (curd), you can strain it out. Every morning when I was pregnant with my daughter, I would have a warm cup of fresh milk and stir in a little sugar for taste. There is nothing better than this and a slice of warm buttered toast.|`|e597f08399f9618cdda3a49c7654274eaa	i cant take milk too.. but cheese tastes great!!

9cfe699c71964f874e5be0e513bbe9a3aa	yes...you have intolerable pain right when you get pregnant..so i guess you must be....                silly people...if you dont want to get pregnant, dont have sex until your ready...or if you cant help it...condoms! birth control! its not that hard|`|AA10276729	I wouldn't know if you were pregnant, but my girlfriend has done the same thing. The doctor told her it was all part of her worrying. He said that stressing about it made her period late and that she probably just kind of though she had other symptoms due to the fact that she had convinced herself she was pregnant.  But I also didn't know you could get pregnant during your menstrual cycle. I thought that was a time of the month that you couldn't get pregnant. But what do I know I'm a male so I don't have to deal with that stuff.  If your not pregnant and don't want to be, you ought to get on birth control. My girlfriend doesn't have to pay very much for it.  Well good luck. I hope it turns out ok. Hopefully your not pregnant, especially if you aren't ready for a kid. That would suck. Well good luck to you. Oh and you could go get a pregnancy test and find out. They sell them about everywhere. Even convinience stores. You could make the guy go get it for you. Well again good luck.|`|AA10097485	it's a good possibility... but it's not like you can change the past. so quit worrying until you know for sure and live your life. it's the only way to move on
db4436d6ef59ff28f0e6b7f25a700224aa	That sounds like a good answer for childen of that age.We always told our son,that our love was so great it created a another love. When he asked how the baby was getting out,we showed him pictures.But he was 7.I would let the 4 year old go till absolutly neccesary to say otherwise.You may overwhelm her with information.When she does ask,be as truthful as possible.She will appreciate this later down the road.Good luck.Sorry my spell check is not working|`|317c511fa6bd3a29e9f5fb9177042a56aa	Hmmm, actually...the answer your seven year old gave is a pretty good start, at least for a four year old. How much more you decide to tell her now should be based on you four year old (does she tend to talk a lot-will she be blabbing stuff to people?  Is she old for her age or young?)  Honestly, I would probably leave that answer at what it is and remember it so that when she gets older you can correct it better. I think kids do need to know something, but I also think that too much information in inappropriate.|`|28f2998cac5e9ad00f4ceeac5b81abfcaa	I have a good one,    my 3 1/2 yr. old ask me when I was pregnant for my second son, how did the baby get in there? So I told him that Mommy had a egg in her tummy and it grew into a baby. He seems satisfied and didn't ask any more questions. Well about a year later, our elderly neighbor was visiting one day, and out of the blue he told her that "Mommy swallowed a egg and that's how we got Brent" I thought I was gonna die at that moment but now, many years later I think it was so cute!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	That answer was a very smart thing for your 7 yr old to come up with. Just answer it honestly, but don't be too graphic until they are older. My kids are 5 and 7 and they both will occasionally ask. I tell them that when a mom and dad love each other they make babies and the babies grow inside the mommies tummy until they are ready to be born and then mommy goes to the hospital and get the baby taken out and she brings it home for mommy and daddy to love and raise. My 7 yr old is asking for more detail now. I tell her mommies have eggs and daddy's have sperm and the egg and sperm have to meet in order to make a baby. She hasn't asked how it get there yet, but I plan on telling her the truth, that daddy's have to put their penises in mommies vagina to get the sperm to the egg. That's why boys have penises and girls don't. But I'm not going to give that part of the detail until she asks me. I want her to know she (and my son too) can ask me anything and I will answer them as honestly as I can.  But I've always heard to just answer the question they ask, not the whole spiel about sex, just how babies are made technically.|`|11aa8135c3596e59ef58444c24f61d62aa	My daughter is 2 and I'm pregnant. I told her God makes a baby out of a little bit of Mama and a little bit of Papa and puts it in the Mama's tummy to grow. I think that's a good 2-year-old answer. No way on earth would I tell her about sex yet.|`|fbff750e0e4a429040b95d0cff77cb16aa	When a man and woman love each other   so much they get married and then God puts a seed in the woman's belly and then it grows in to a baby. The woman gives birth and there you go.  My older daughter gets the once you are married the man and woman have sex and details details, you're pregnant.  My kids know you have to be married to have sex and have babies!|`|AA12344931	my mother in law answered by saying ' GOd sends them in tummy to grow for a while and then come out as babies" well in few yrs from now they will kno so just try what ever u can.LOl all the best|`|725329e326edb6f8d37f6bf43e234797aa	tell the truth! kids start off at square one. u don't have to worry about them conecting any dots. tell them mommys have eggs in them kind of like chickens doo! but they need a sperm, which is a little dna code to make them into babies. when  was little i thought sperm came from the mommy too. so just say the truth really gradually, the peices will fit togetehr later u dotn want to have to explan what a sperm is when they are 13!|`|eeaa43378b60b2fa621f9a9a97f6973aaa	I personally feel like when they're old enough to ask, they're old enough to know. If you don't tell them, misinformed friends will. Only give what they ask for thought. Maybe a bit on "There are things called sperm (tadpoles, whatever word you're comfortable with) and they swim to the egg.... and on. Most kids are satisfied with that. Sometimes the inquisitive ones go farther. My mother was explaining it to my brother when he was 6 and he wasn't satisfied and did go to the, "how did it get in the egg?" Well, after slowly explaining anatomically, he said, "Oh mom! I am so sorry you had to do that 4 times! You must really like kids!" Just a funny story....|`|523dadd7461860746b36bf2692590ea4aa	my four year old came up with an answer all her own. she thinks the babies dig a hole in the belly climb in and stay there until they are ready to come out. when they are ready they dig another hole and then fill it back up with the dirt.!! other than that never had to answer anything about it yet.|`|AA11287228	LOL. i DONT HAVE CHiLDREN YET. BUT i REMEMBER WHEN MY DAD TOLD ME MY MOM HAD A EGG AND HE HAD A SEED. LOL THATS ALL i UNDERTSTOOD.
d2c052385d72c555b3ebfccd40f8db68aa	Sperm can live in the body for about 5 days. So if you had sex any time between the 18th and the 23rd, it's higly likely that the date is right.    The only thing is, the Dr is going by the "Women ovulate 14days after their menstal period."  For many women this is not true and ovulation can and often does occur earlier or later than the 14 day mark.  With out ferility charting that says "you ovulated on such and such day," you never really know.|`|377579cbee1b76acf7afdd89fb66e7a8aa	YES~|`|AA11605655	Of course theres a chance it could be wrong. Uless you're sure of the date the doctor doesn't know when you concieved.|`|1180a731227ded0958989a5db1fc4b32aa	your bf sperm was probably already in there that means he didnt have to be there when you conceieved|`|987f4b809b5ceb4d48aa56fadd92dfc3aa	You may have ovulated sooner, or sperm can live inside of you up to 3 days.  So if you did it before he left on the 21st it is possible that the sperm was still there for the egg on the 23rd.|`|1ef1d1a052b919dff5186b60922ad245aa	You conceived your baby when you had unprotected sex. Not everyone ovulates at the same time.|`|b28f0006ce590ff714b4526a7a31a811aa	50/50 chance but it's okay|`|db321b3217a7d73203c5bde6f689dc3baa	You could have gotten pregnant any time in those two weeks after your last period. It's just an estimation. Being a few days off won't affect the birth any. I'm not sure why you're even worried about this.
fc2acfa39ff7fc3d068633122120ba18aa	i don't know|`|AA10722148	My sister had a baby less than a year ago and she said it's strange because when they say to push you just know what to do. I guess it comes naturally. Don't quote me on that... you might want to ask your phsysician.|`|20a00d03c3f1c9373caf10441bb802b2aa	push as if you are having a bowl movement. don't push with your  face because it will make the blood vessels in your eye burst-not an attractive look|`|03bca4aa93cc452ede2317c7b5667802aa	I thought pushing was the worst part - I went with no drugs.  You are forced to lay on your back, which is the worst position for a birthing woman.      To be completely honest it feels like a poop! I'm not trying to be vulger, but it is very close to where that comes out! The one thing I kept doing was grunting when I would push. At a certain point my doctor said I'm sending a lot of energy out of my mouth and I should stop grunting. The next push, the first one in which I didn't grunt, pushed my daughter out!    You'll know how to do it once that time comes and you'll have a doctor and nurses to help you through it.|`|80f2a4f17174c011c57bb255dd2b591faa	It feels like you have been constipated for a month...and now you have to push out the biggest poo you have ever had!  Sorry if that is too much info....but that really is the best way to describe it!  You need to focus all of your energy way down low into your bottom and just push!  In most cases, it comes naturally so don't freak out. Childbirth is a very natural instinct and most women have it.  And like someone else said....don't use your face muscles beacuse you can not only pop a blood vessel in your eye, but you can also develop vericose veins on your face.  Your nurse and your doctor will coach you through this. In fact, they usually put their finger  into your vagina and they push down and tell you to focus on pushing their finger out.   That helps alot.  Good luck and Congrats!|`|AA11614372	push as as if you having a bowl movement.  If you have an epidural, it may help to try to visualize since you aren't able to feel it.|`|AA11605655	If feels just like you are pushing a large bowel movement. Although, if you have had an epadural you are just pushing and cannot feel anything, no head, no body of the baby or anything. All's your doing is pushing when they tell you to push!
cae45c2758dcf6963fac45f25b075b0caa	you should take a test to see if you are pregnant, not every woman has morning sickness when pregnant|`|AA11605655	Take a test! You can get one at the dollar stor or locaal Walgreen's or CVS for less then $10.00 (you don't need the expensive ones, they all measure the same thing).    Not all women get nausious! The one's that don't are the lucky one's! I never got sick!    If the pregnancy test comes out negative go see your doctor! Well, go see your doctor if it comes out positive too!    Good luck!    PS ~ The odds of an STD causing your delayed period aren't very good.|`|AA10475121	Not all women are nauseous. I never had morining sickness. I threw up a couple of times throughout my pregnancy but it was because of what I ate. The only signs I had when I first found out I was pregnant was spotting and tender breasts and that was all. Every pregnancy is different. So if you are really scared about being pregnant take a test or better, go to the doctor. It is important to go to the doctors asap because the sooner the better. The most important months of the pregnancy is the first three months.|`|948ef77f3c7678cb302784b746c11e1daa	Have you tried a urine test??  At 2 months late, you will definitely be positive if you're pregnant.  If not pregnant, see your doc.    And just because you think you're in a monogamous relationship doesn't mean you are in one....|`|2cdccbd8df850872ab1c7f6b09e13ad5aa	Well Why Dont You Go Get A Home Pregnancy Test...The Ones From The Dollar Store Work Just As Good As EPT or Clear Blue From Walmart. I know From experience. I Am 39 Weeks And 4 Days Pregnant. So Im Due Any Day. If The Test Comes Up Negative Go To A Doctor. Or A Planned Parent hood Clinic. Or Even A Health Department. It Might Not Even be An Std Or Pregnancy....|`|5c96dfbf7eefc9c0f3043df8e043a32baa	You need to take a test now|`|d9bd2df660659b7ee4f13d64cce2110faa	first of all you need to go see a doctor... you could have a serious problem IF your not pregnant.|`|a5f094ffbd11febf7b97830a75f45211aa	nausea is random not every woman gets it when pregnant and not every pregnancy involves it.  Maybe you should get a test for either or!!!!  You're crazy to want a disgusting STD rather than a baby!  no matter how old you are.  You should find out what your issue is and educate yourself on sexual activities,  and the ways to protect yourself from these issues!!|`|a52b80ffbe5a3b5320c0a96dcfc2524faa	Take a pregnancy test, then make a doctor appointment regardless of the anser on your test.    get a pap, your routine tests...     Even though it might be a "monogomous" relationship, you can't always guarentee that on the other person.  Better safe than sorry, make sure you get a round of tests and make him too.
827993b38a683884568367c98043c28caa	Crazy, but not serious.    When my wife gave birth to my yongest, the nurse is between her legs giving the doctor an update, while he stood over her shoulder eating a huge BLT sandwiche.      Then when my youngest was giving birth to her first, she was going to do it natural.  After 22 hours of labor, she sounded like the devil himself and yelled "give me drugs".  She had a needle in her back within 5 minutes.    With her last pregnancy, she delivered Samantha, then everyone noticed her stomach was still very large.  Surprise, Nicole was hiding in the back.    And back to my wife, with our first, we were watching a funny show and she was laughng a lot.  Suddenly, her water broke.  While I loaded the car, she cleaned up and changed clothes.  In the process she realized she had simply peed her pants.  Not a word until years later.  We made the trip to the hospital on a "false" labor.  Oh, well.  Was a practice run.|`|AA11605655	My friend was hemmoraging bad! She actually was spraying blood across the room (yes, this story is when pregnancy became my biggest fear). The doctor of course had a face shield on, the dad did not. She was literally shooting blood against the opposing wall. There were some interns in there to witness the birth.    When she started spraying blood the Dr. looked at the interns and was explaing what happened, how to fix it, what to say to the patient, etc. Meanwhile she's still bleeding all over!    Since he's doing nothing to help her and just talking to the interns her husband finally screams at the doctor, "CAN YOU WORK AND TALK AT THE SAME TIME??? I'VE GOT TO USE THAT THING LATER!"    Needless to say the doctor quit talking fixed whatever was wrong with her and finished his explanation AFTER!|`|2c872fd65901370751f1c0027c4986a8aa	cord around the neck at birth happens a lot; if it looks too risky they will do a c-section but its something that can be caught and saved at birth. It's not a "stupid thing" it happens a lot, there are tons of things that can go wrong during birth.|`|e28afc3a2533a60ee5465b6b8d794962aa	It's not called stupid, it's called human. Even doctors don't know everything and at the time they do what they can I'm sure lack of sleep can play a part on a hasty decision, but remember your bro is alive right!|`|c91885312db06004ff5fb129cae371c0aa	I had a few pre term labor scares in my pregnancy with my son. Each one ended well. I ended up going full term to 38 weeks. I labored for 22 hours and during that time had been given Stadol. The Nurse let me fully dilate without breaking my water. She also failed to tell my OB that my water had not broke. My son had been so low down that when the water sack finally broke he aspirated a lot of it. He took his first breath, so the doctor handed him off to the Nurse to manage while he tried to deliver the placenta. In the meantime, I had to ask the nurse why my son wasn't moving and was grey. They called a code and had to suction him out and bag him. His heart rate had dropped all the way down to 40 bpm before they got him revived. The combination of the Stadol making my son sluggish and him aspirating amniotic fluid almost killed him. If I had not been paying attention and noticed something wasn't right with my son the Nurse would have let him die without noticing there was a problem. I know, my delivery is one of the few horror stories that there are...but, they do exist. Just try to stay alert, and if something doesn't seem right it probably isn't..speak up. I did, and that's the reason why my son is alive today.|`|8b5af7b8cdd96b82013df36ade45bf83aa	both of my sons had their cords around their neck at birth. I wasn't told until after with either, and both births progressed normally - one entirely drug free. It's a very common thing to have happen, and most doctors now are skilled in continuing the birth vaginally. The cord just needs to be lifted back over the head. It's better to not cut the cord prematurely, although if it came down to it, I would prefer that to being rushed off for a c/s.
