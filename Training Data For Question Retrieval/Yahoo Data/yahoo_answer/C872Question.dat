My dad has a large credit card debt (mostly from my mother's illness before her death... years ago) and has recently been forced to retire due to his small business failing. The business had no assets (no equipment no owned buildings, etc.) and basically no longer exists in any form. He does not own a home or have a mortgage. The only thing he does own is an old car, really. His bank account is at $300 right now.      He has recently moved in with me.

Next month, its up to a completely different amount than it should be, or that it was last month!        Not to mention we also had MAJOR problems with our ATT internet, basically when we tried to upgrade to the highest speed, they ended up creating a new account, while still upgrading our other, so we were paying double, on two different accounts!  We called them every month to have them fix this, and they said they did, it ended up, (obviouously) that we didn't pay the account that was wrong, they sent a debt collector on us, we had to talk/write to them, and it just now got resolved this week (this happened in August...)

20090219191450AA834gO	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	What's a good, decent salary job for me (an INFP)?	To start off I'm not an adult, I'm a high school student in grade 10 and I'm getting ready to do my grade 11 course selection. I don't know if you know about the MB personality types, but I'm really into them and I'm an INFP. Most of the jobs that suit my personality are low pay or impossible to get. I really, really don't want a job, but I'd feel bad if I didn't have the money to help other people out. I want activism to be a part of my life, but I'm finding it really impossible in my job search. So I need a job that would work for me...   - decent salary (at least 50-60k/year)   - fulfilling   - doesn't require very high grades (I have about an 85% average, which is about an A- here)   - isn't competitive   - minimal public speaking      The only thing that seems possible to me is teacher, which is my backup plan, but I don't want to be stuck in school for eternity. If there is any good job that EXISTS, please please tell me. Sorry about dragging this on and thanks :)

This morning, my husband woke me up saying that the bathroom downstairs has 'back-washed'. I went downstairs and looked, and the bathroom was overflowed with water (and debris) all over the floor, toilet, and spewing from the bathtub drain. We called a plumber to get it fixed. My question is, the inspection of the house was initially fine. Why is this happening?      It doesn't seem normal to me, we haven't even stayed here for a month yet! Now I'm scared that there will be something wrong with the house very often. Our homeowner's insurance has a $1,000 deductible, so only if it's under $1K then we pay for this. What should we do is this house is nothing but trouble? Who should we contact? I don't want to have to do major fixes to this 1994 house every month!

So far I've earned $7.75 which I think is around ￡4 (obviously I've not received any payments yet so I'm not sure how the ￡'s measuring up lately).    Is it worth the effort? It's not so much the small returns that worries me - I know you can't expect a lot of money for any kind of "work from home" setup - but in the past I'd always been wary of giving out my details on line. However now I'm trotting out my name, address, d.o.b, phone number, etc, every time I fill in a survey. I realise this information's out there anyway in one form or another - and I haven't entered into any financial agreements so I've not divulged stuff about bank accounts, etc (nor will I), but I'm still not sure it's worth it.   I know lots of people already make a bit of extra money in this way so I was hoping some of you here on Y/A might be able to share some personal experiences - and either put my mind at ease or give me fair warning about what I'm getting myself into.   Is it really a safe way of earning? Can you actually make reasonable money at it, and how many hours do you need to put in to make it worthwhile? Do the companies pay up? And - last but not least - how do you get through each of the surveys as quickly as possible (i.e; must you enter all attached competitions/sign up for every offer/etc or can you skip those)? - it seems to take me forever to negotiate my way through each survey and all its bolt-on extras - often for as little as 0.25$/12p!    Any advice from people who are either currently involved in on-line surveys work, or who have tried it in the past, would be very much appreciated.   Many thanks

I want to buy a 2 bedroom condo, and I was wondering how much the heating bill would be (mortgage calculators use heating cost into account when estimating how much mortgage you can qualify for)?      I know that it depends on the city in which you live, the type of insulation you have, type of windows, etc. But what I am looking for in terms of answers are personal experience...if you have ever lived in a condo/apartment about 1000 square feet in size, how much did you pay for heating (on average).      I also live in a city where we get pretty cold winters, so I know that the heating and/or electricity bill in the winter months will be higher.      Thanks for the help!

20090219164331AAveMFS	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Non-Competition Clause Question?	I work for a company and as part of the employment agreement that I signed, a non-competition clause was included:      "While acting as, and for (24) months after his/her termination, the Employee shall not and agrees that he/she will not, directly own an interest in, operate, join, control, or participate in or be connected as an officer, employee, agent, independent contractor, partner, shareholder, or proprietorship, firm, association, person, or other entity soliciting orders for, selling, distributing or otherwise marketing products, goods, equipment, and/or services which directly compete with the Company at existing Company's customers or customers where the Company's proposals are pending without the written consent of the Company."      Am opportunity has come my way (with a small start up company) that I am considering pursuing.  It is in the same state and the same industry, however they do not share any clientele.  However that could potentially be the case in the long term.      1) Does this clause apply in my situation? Does the situation change if I am offered stock with the new company?      2) If it does apply, how enforceable is this clause, especially since it is for 2 years? I've heard  that clauses are only enforceable if they are within reason.        My interpretation of the clause lies in the word "directly."  I suppose this word kind of limits the scope of the clause.  I don't think it will apply to me but I am unsure and wanted others' opinions.      Thanks.

Id like to know if my bank can consider child support that i receive as a source of income. This agreement has already been signed by me and him we are waiting on the court date for the judge to make it final. I am getting my house and I would only qualify if the bank counts it. I have been receiving the money already.    Why as this question? I was preapproved for x ammount with final inspection pending in 2 days, now my bank received the taxes for the house and they say they assumed the taxes were lower, so if I do not come up with another source of income for at least 300 (which is fine if they approve the child suuport I receive the way it is. right now.) then I wouldnt qualify for the house.

20090219104616AA4YDd5	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Mortgage Loan options for investment property?	My fiance and I were not approved for a mortgage due to my bad credit (thanks to ex-husband).  He was pre-approved for a mortgage on his credit and income, but only for 80K (he is 1099, therefore his AGI is much lower).  Since I could not be approved, my income cannot be considered for a loan.  So, my parents have offered to purchase the home we were looking at (their credit is impeccable) and rent to us on an rto basis until we are able to be approved.  The home is an REO and listed at $108K.  There is about $20K in repairs that need to be done before we could move in.  The county website appraises the home at $158K.  Are there loans available for a non first time homebuyer to finance the whole mortgage plus the repairs needed on an investment property?  My parents would prefer not to co-sign (they were burned in the past).

20090219113010AAuUlSd	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Apartment lease question?	My Husband and I have been renting an apartment for about 7 months. I'm going to have to quit my job to take care of my grandfather, when my husband talked to the landlord he pretty much told us we can leave with 60 days notice so we have to pay rent for March and April ($1880) plus an extra $940. Obviously too much to pay when all the income will be coming from one person and we could only make rent when we both worked.      But today I was looking at the rent papers and noticed for the lease term the landlord did not write the date for the end of the lease and there is nothing else saying we're renting for a year. Could we "get out" of the lease with out having to pay extra?
20090219115803AAoY0iM	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can my landlord turn my heat off?	Okay i hate my landlords. lets get that out of the way. We have a business Mon-Sun in a subdivided unit. The heat is controlled by a "box" or thermostat thing, in an ofice connected to us around the corner... We never have heat over the weekends. we come in and its 50 degrees in the middle of winter. We have no way to adjust our heat, and the landlord refuses to give us contact information so that we can reach them, to reach that office, so that the heat can be turned back on. (We believe that since the other office doesnt do business over the weekend, that they just turn it off)      The landlord hated the idea of me saying we need to be able to reach them if the heat does in fact get turned off by the other office and we need to reach them to have it turned back on.      Heat is included in our lease, so what are our rights. We've already sent them a formal complaint letter and dont want to run 4 space heaters throughout our place. Should we have access to this heat contrlling box too? Is it right that we have to depend on another business tenant to control what temp it is in our unit? ARRRGHHH       We are in ohio if that matters. Please Advise!

He moved in before i bought. they had a verbal agreement that he would paint and clean in lieu of a damage deposit. he never did this. after he started breaking stuff, i made him sign a lease and still believed him when he said he would do the previously mentioned maintenance...(live and learn...). He is also a "friend" of mine. His girlfriend is now pregnant and seems to have moved in. I ok'd him and one cat. he has gotten another cat and she has a pug dog.  so, instead of one guy and one cat, there seems to be 2 cats, a dog, 2 adults, and a baby on the way. i want to require a deposit for the dog and extra people. (has already told me the dog has been scratching the doors..)  I know he is going to freak out. as everyone, lately, money is almost non existent.  i have been very generous since he moved in with free usage to my washer and dryer. first was just him, then him and some of her stuff. No way am i paying the elect.and water for laundry of a newborn.  i do not like kids, but know the laws about expressing any of that.  I am,also, not really wanting him to move out, as there are way too many shady characters that looked when he was gonna move out late last summer. trust me. good people that need a place arent abundant here in the fox valley of wis.  he pays his rent on time, but has empty promises and acts entitled to a lot.  what would be a reasonable damage deposit to ask? they are really going to struggle with finances even before the kid is born! but i wanna cover my ***.    any insight and advice is greatly appreciated!!

I mean people in WFG actually need to work hard to grab clients. Notice I use the word grab. Instead of people going to see a “financial advisor” in a traditional financial company, WFG people actually go out and grab people. They host seminars with the motive of helping average Joe. I do not have a big problem with this as this is how every self-employed worker do.      As an investor, what worried me most is that their people are not even nearly well trained. Typically, it takes about just 6 month to train a new employee from scratch. It is certainly not enough time for anybody to get acquainted to the financial market. Moreover, as they spend so much time and effort to go out and get more clients, they will never have the chance to learn more about the financial market.   I would not get advise from people that just got the bare minimum requirement.       This is why WFG is a scam. It is not a scam to trick people that is joining WFG. It is making a fool of everyone who is their clients.

When U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (D-DE) said to his wife, "When you earn your doctorate, we can earn some real money," in a joking way, he was in fact stating the usual understanding that PhDs do not earn a lot of money. In fact, according to these believers, most people can earn more money in the private sector.       However, is that the case? Assistant Professors earn six figures annually. Most people starting in the private sector earn about $50,000 - if that.       So, Why Do People Ridicule The Income of Doctors of Philosophy (PhDs)?

20090203105454AAmFv7o	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Administrative and Office Support	What's the worst decision higher management has made?  Do you have a "what were they thinking" situation?	Here's an example of a horrible decision:      One of the lines, company "ABC", just came out with new pricing - effective January 1, 2009.  Since that date, ABC stamped all purchase orders with the wrong pricing as "honoring the old pricing" and to see us for a new price list.  Many dealers were upset by this since they didn't receive new price lists from us, or even know that ABC's pricing was changing in the first place.  To further the problem - we didn't receive new price lists, either.         ABC didn't send us the new master price list until January 30 - a confidential, "all price levels" list that we can't hand out.  ABC still hasn't sent us the new price lists to hand out to our dealers.        Needless to say, we have many irate phone calls every day about ABC's stupidity.  I agree wholeheartedly with the dealers, but I can't very well say that...  Pricing should be available before any change goes into effect.

20090203103248AADJFw6	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Accounting ethics case?	Here is the situation:   The Appliance Division has many plants. Carol and Thad are managers who both will earn the bonus if the division meets its profit targets. Thad says that they are going to be $62,500 short of the target. Look at the numbers from Carol’s plant alone. That $62,500 is only about 4% of her product conversion costs. Thad invites her to make a tiny change in the way she calculates the percentage completion of her appliance units.      Since we do not have any sales figures, we can assume that sales prices will not change. And the year is almost over, so they will not produce any more units. So, there is only one other way to reach the profit target. If Carol changes her percentage completion, how will that lead to a greater profit?       Does the percentage completion need to be increased or decreased in order to increase profit? Explain your answer. Can you figure out how much the percentage has to change?      Secondly, If Carol goes along with Thad, who would notice the change? How do you feel about this? How much do you depend on accurate accounting information? Who would benefit from making the change in the way your plant’s production is accounted for? Who would suffer? Does it make a difference that the change is so tiny?

I'm asking because I'm trying to decide between buying a $3000 used car and saving to buy a new one in one year or buying a new one with $5000 cash back ('08 suzuki xl 7: paying $23000 instead of $28000) and pay it off in 12 months.      2. what is the best way to get a reliable cheap used car of about $2500 to $3000 that will not need repairs for 3 years.      3. Also, can one buy/finance a home with only two years of credit history, 6 months of employment history with salary of $7000/month, a credit score of 750?      Summary: 'Should I rent an apartment and buy a $2500 used car now and get a new home and car in 3 years or should I just go ahead and get the new car now and home because (a) if I rent an apartment, after two to three years, I would have payed over $20000 in rent (that would have gone into paying for the home) (b) if I buy a $2500 car now, after two to three years, the trade in value will be close to zero, I might as well get a new one now and pay it off in 12 month.   I need suggestions.      THANK YOU.

20090203102321AAXalDM	Business & Finance;Credit	Have you been hurt by inaccurate credit bureau info?	Below is a copy of a letter sent to President Obama and each of my congressmen today.      If you have had your chances for a loan, mortgage, or job destroyed due to inaccurate credit bureau information, now is the time to speak up and ask for reform      Dear President Obama,        I am writing to ask you to focus attention on one significant aspect of the credit crunch that has not received much press - the effect of inaccurate credit bureau information on the ability of consumers to obtain credit.        Americans cannot obtain mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, or employment without a good credit score.        However, the credit bureaus have too much control over our destiny and too little control exerted over their inaccurate reporting.        Last week, I was delayed on my mortgage approval due to inaccurate credit report.        I have been working several hours each month over the last two years to clear up problems. The result - I currently have 3 bills that I know I need to pay off. These are leftovers from a period when I got divorced, lost my job in the tech downturn, had my house and everything in it destroyed by fire, and was out of work for 3 years when my son was undergoing a medical crisis. During this time, I managed to survive without going on public assistance of any kind.        My credit bureau currently shows 17 negative accounts - 14 inaccurate ones.        These may be reported past the 7 year limit for negative information.        One of the worst offenders is the US Department of Education. My loan has been rehabilitated for a year, with 20 payments made on time. However, they are still reporting me to TransUnion and to Equifax as being in collections.        I have had 8 phone numbers with Verizon, all of which have had all bills paid off. 3 of the accounts are showing different amounts for Verizon.        Comcast Cable has reported me to two different bureaus, for a total of 4 accounts, for an account which is also paid in full. Two of the collection accounts are for equipment returned at the time I moved from the house.        Progressive Insurance is reporting through a collection agency that I owe $273 on an old bill. I paid this off, and my last two checks were returned to me by the agency as overpayments, yet I cannot remove them from my credit report.        The FTC does not help.        I have sent proof to the credit bureaus of payments; however, they will not accept the proof unless it comes from collection agencies that filed the report. The agencies are extorting additional payments from Americans in order to remove bills that have already been paid.        American consumers need you to act quickly to offer them protection.        I would be taking one house off of the market now, and trading in my car, if the government took action to protect my credit rating. Multiply this by the many thousands of citizens in similar circumstances, and you could stimulate the economy with very little money spent.

Because I was a good worker and my family was going through a lot of problems they made me sign a form saying I would pay them back in full and that they would not inform the authorities and no one would know except for me and the company. I have been applying at other retail stores and no one has been calling back would they have put something on record open to the public? Even though I admitted to my mistake and will pay them back.

20090203105057AAamWrd	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Trouble making neighbor, what do I do?	I have been living in my apt for almost a year. I am a college student, I work full time and have received an Associate's degree while being a single parent. I am 21. I had new neighbors move in about a month ago. She keeps calling the apt complex and the police and saying that she smells marijuana coming out of my apt. The police have come out twice in less than two weeks. The first time my bf who is not on the lease answered the door. Upon seeing that it was the police, he came and got me.. they obviously didnt smell anything or else they could have come in... But they kept asking questions as to who he was etc. I adv them he was not the renter and was a visitor. They advised me of the complaint and left. The second time the police came out, he was a very nice guy. He stated he didnt smell marijuana but still had to come out  b/c of the complaint. I asked him if they could document there was no smell.. Well b/c so far, the police haven't done anything I guess she keeps calling the apt complex. I went in to pay my rent today, and was informed of her numerous complaints. They said she calls almost daily!!       My question is what can I do, when she is filing false complaints on me? And for no reason( we haven't had any alteractions...)      She has also told the apt complex that my company comes over and knocks on her window to be let in!! (which is also untrue, my bf has a key.. and anybody else who comes over..has my # so they call me to be let in!)      Im just really upset.. as I said, I have a child, and I do not want it on my renters record that I am a troublesome tenant. I do not want to be evicted!! I am planning to move b/c my lease is up in three months.. but until then.. what can i do.. she is filing complaints almost daily.      ( Oh as a side note, I have had ZERO complaints on me previously.. no noise, no marijuana or other complaints)

20090219203301AAzucIl	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	How do I deal with bad customer service?	Today I went to Zellers to shop for deals and found that they had items that ranged between $1 to $3 for 50 cents (they were mostly school supplies and locker accessories) so I choose a couple of items and purchased them. On my way out I noticed that I was charged 75 cents for each item instead of 50 cents. So I went back to the same cashier to get the amount adjusted with the sign showing the sale. When she saw the sign she stuck her tongue out at me and refused to adjust the price saying that these items were not the ones on sale, and a guy behind me swore at me and said he'd me more than willing to throw the difference in cash at me, so that I don't delay the line up (the customer service section was closed) and she sided with him. I didn't say anything. Another cashier came and said that these items were in fact part of this sale and she did the adjustment, but no one apologized. Its not about the money (the difference was a dollar), its about honoring the sale. If I had bought 10 items, that would've been a difference of $2.50. A dollar to someone who's on low income is a lot of money. So what should I do? Thank you.
