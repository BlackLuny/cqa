20090220032709AArcWDf	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Physical dreams, help?	A few weeks ago, when I was quite ill, I had an extremely bad sleeping pattern and was disorientated and tired and anxious all throughout the day. I rememeber feeling the mattress shake near my legs when I was lying awake one night. Was this a dream or effect of my stress and illness? I disregarded it and it didn't effect me again until last week. Also, I had it another night when I was drifting in and out of sleep. This time, for some reason, it's bothered me and whenever I lay down or try to sleep, I get incredibly shaky legs.       When your tired you can easily confuse something between reality and dreaming, and now because I keep obsessing over it and getting scared about it, I'm thinking something that it isn't?      At the time I was tired and drifting in and out of sleep. Is it possible I felt my legs shaking due to the stress and illness I'm undergoing at the moment and now as I keep thinking about it I'm building it up to be something it's not?

20090203124609AAfMFwA	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	I earned less than my ex - why does she pay less C$A?	When I was married to my hex, her previous partner had 'won' custody of their daughter. My hex has worked all her life and is in a quite well paid career.      I am an unskilled laborer, and because of immigration, couldnt' even work the vast majority of the time I was in USA.      We were talking about stuff the other day. She gave mention about her C$A obligation - it's $60 p/w.      Now, remembering I earn considerably less than her - and couldn't work the majority of the time in USA - I was obliged to pay her C$A of well over $300 p/m... she earns way more than me (and the father of the other daughter) - yet pays him only $240 p/m.      How come I have to pay more despite her outearning me (by quite a large sum)?      If it isn't a sexist policy within the C$A (ex support agency) - then what else may explain this massive discrepancy?
20090203124650AA2iP5l	Social Science;Psychology	Father talks about how he used to light cats' tails on fire as if it were normal, I diagnosed him with?	Antisocial Personality Disorder right at the Christmas Table Dinner.   He went on about how he used to shoot them with BB guns as well.  When I called him out on this abnormal behavior, he said did it as a kid, that doesn't count.         I said in the DSM the criteria is based on those behaviors as a child and how they get worse when the person gets older - as he is clearly getting worse with his psychotic behavior.      So case in point - he got worse as he got older, he really had no response to this.      Was that the appropriate diagnosis/response to his outrageous comments at the dinner table?      What would you do if someone talked like that as if it were normal behavior?      I have administered the SCID diagnosis for ASPD for years, so I know that is a factor.

I have this feeling that the economy was showing a false growth (as shown by the fact that people were living beyond their means)    The idea of bringing back the economy to the level it used to be (house values, salary, prices of goods and services) seems to me unreal, instead we all should be expected to live with less income and prices of goods and services should go lower accordingly so companies can compete with companies abroad (as the prices become almost similar to foreign companies jobs will be retained here), no need to cut jobs but I see there should be a need cutting salaries but still every one working.

20090220022908AAGQRcl	Social Science;Psychology	I need advice from a qualified psychologist, please help.?	Two years ago my daughter made the toughest decision of her life. . .She was having problems with her two rebellious teens (14 & 15) who were constant runaways, hanging with the wrong crowds, the oldest starting to get into drugs and the other starting to follow . . . We did everything possible to help them but they would not listen. . . Both were on a first name basis with the local police who even tried to help us, to no avail. . . Their father was never in the picture.  She was forced to relinquish her rights to the children in order for them to get the help they so needed. It was like giving them up for adoption. . a severe blow to her heart !  The oldest was in several programs which turned her around completely ! She is 17 and in a foster home with one of the best women in the world who has done wonders with helping her.  The boy was in a nice home, when his father finally came up to bat and went to court and was awarded custody of him. . now one year later he hates his overly strict, "born again" father and wants to leave. . . He has weekly family sessions in the home with a psychologist and brought these feelings up to her.  She asked him if he was really mad at his father, or really mad at his mother for giving him up because she didn't care about him !  He staunchly defended his mother saying he might be dead now if she had not done what she did at that time. . . . This hurt my daughter so much for that woman to say that to her son. . .that she didn't care about him !!!  My daughter is ready to go find that psychologist and beat her head into the ground !!  Can she report her for this to a supervisor or what? ?  She is not invited to these sessions where she can defend her self. .but doesn't want the girl taken off the case because the boy will open up to her and tell her his feelings. which is the important issue.  My daughter can't sleep because or this !  Those words hurt her so bad, saying she did not care about her children and gave them away. . . Which is totally wrong.  What do you advise her to do about this ?

20090220065229AALnUpW	Social Science;Psychology	Question about psychotherapy?	What exactly does it include? Because I'm a little concerned about it. Apart from suffering from major chronic depression I also can't get motivated to do anything, cannot concentrate, focus, get motivated and just want to sleep all the time, as well as a very pessimistic view that nothing could possibly get better (probably as a result of the depression, I know). I don't want to do anything, just stay in all the time in my bed and watch TV. very bad I know, but thats depression for you.      From what I gather, psychotherapy involves alot of mental effort from the individual. So how exactly will I be able to undergo psychotherapy and how will it work for me? I wish there was some form of magical anti-depressant that would at least improve these symptoms by about 50%. I'm taking cymbalta and its rubbish, so I will ask my therapist to maybe put me on some other anti-depressant.      Also a few tips on what exactly psychotherapy is and how it works would be helpful thanks.

20090220044744AAhNpZF	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What do you all thank about this dream?	In 2006 my grandpa passed away...      Will a few about Dec. of 2008 I dreamed that I want into a build (like a walmart) and walked to the back of the building and when I got to the back I went out onto like a screened in porch (with about 50 unknown people seating around) and to my surprise my grandpa was seating in there. I run throw the people and when over and hugged him then my cousin (Jeanna) spook up and said "Do you know how stupid you just looked. Hi is still dead. And we are the only once that can see him." (I bused into trying) and turned around and my cousin (Amanda) as I was turning around (crying) Jeanna said if your going to hug him (my grandpa) you have to do it like this so you don't look stupid. Then after just a min I turned back around and Jeanna was hugging & kissing where my grandpa was seating but he was not there she was just hugging & kissing the air. I said "I can't see him now and I did not even get to say bye" Then I woke up.

20090220064956AApvwb6	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Feminists, when you talk of oppression you censor the truth, don't you?	Oppression is a top down system, a very small % of the population benefit from the efforts of the rest and there are various systems for keeping it that way...      but      feminists will paint a picture of average men controlling everything and women being the only oppressed class.      Its similar to the way feminists run the abuse industry, half the story is erased to give us a false reality.      No wonder there is so much resentment and bad feeling towards men, as x impressionable people are tricked into thinking that these false realities are truth every year and only a small % of people seem to be able or willing to think around these lies.      At what point did leninist/marxist propaganda and class warfare techniques become part of our everyday lives?

I made 'friends' with a lady at work once (where I temped) and she said she was the above type of Christian (I'm a Pentecostal Christian BTW). Since I left the booking, we exchanged email addressess and have kept in touch via this. She keeps sending me these emails saying that Valentine's Day is a Satanic event and we need to find its origins, that Christmas is a pagan festival and she and other Christians should never celebrate it and when I told her that I was going to Primark for the weekend shopping, she said that fashion was from the Devil.   I feel she is taking life too seriously and is judging me on the quiet, even though I don't know her well nor her know me.  I have never once told her or anyone how to think, believe, act or feel.

20090220075159AAKnTBc	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Loss of men's social life?	Beer was priced out of reach, so bar/social club users were reducing fast. Absolute ban on smoking, as opposed to accomodating us in a way that is acceptible, put the final nail on the coffin for bar type socializing. That can never come back, generations made up the numbers in the bar, everyone knew everyone, there wasn't trouble, arguments sometimes, but pecking orders had been created long before.      From this you knew if the man down the road needed a bit of help, or if Mrs SoAndSo was struggling to get a bit of shopping in because her legs were bad.       In our youth generations of parents and their mates were there to teach us socializing, how to pace drinking, teach you the shame of bad behaviour etc. Teach you to communicate, teach you the boundaries.      All of it now gone. I don't know the names of anyone round here except the woman next door. The people down the street or on this estate I do not know at all.      Now the young have no mentors in the bars, no wonder they are not getting a good press, they are not learning the life and social skills that would see them through to adulthood. They are instead learning not to care, why should they, we don't give them much to build on.      But it affects us older men too. No interest in TV, sick of the few videos we have, where do we go to socialize now?      I would say that other than at work the only conversation I have with other men other than family is a two minute chat when walking the dog.      So, how do you socialize? Is there anyone around you you call a mate outside of the family who you can chat to? Are we all expected to sign up dor some daft night course just to give us someone to chat to? What do you do to create a social world around you now that the old social world has been taken away from us?

20090220055817AAL41y6	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Can I get a womans point of view?	She is a family friend and I've known her for years. I was good friends with her brothers but lately I've re-connected with them, and gotten closer to her. When I saw her 2 years ago I sent her mail which she replied, and asked me to write back, which I didn't I was busy at the time.      Then 3 months ago I went to visit her again we went out a few times and she had a good time, picked flowers and gave them to me. She tells in the past she'd cry because she was so lonely and had no one and last in her family to get married. We went to her place so I can fix her computers and she put on soothing music and dimmed the lights but I didn't make my moves. I think I respect her brother too much. I live pretty far away for work. I decided to send her roses and mail to tell her why I didn't write back before cos I was busy, and that I want to keep seeing her but now she tell me she has a boyfriend who has been divorced and has kids so she can't tell her parents yet. She then tells me if there is anything she can do for me to ask, and ends mail in see you next time. Since she says she has a bf, and I have met him I'd like to forget about her but I've known her so long and I love her - why didn't she mention this when we went out? (to see my reaction?), I can't focus on work because I always think of her,

20090220043634AAa4iQo	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream mean?	I had a dream where me and some friends were going really fast in a nice car, viper I think...we turned a corner too sharp and flew off a cliff, going into a weird tunnel that kept going down. eventually we reach the bottom and a boulder fell and crushed half the car.       My friend got out and started mumbling, looking at this weird gate thing. All I remember was him pulling it apart block by block and finding two giant green women, that looked like something called "Asphyxia" off a silent hill game. They chanted and I figured out that it was the gate to hell.       Then it zoomed out, and I was laying in my bed, with scars on my body, open wounds hear and there with broken stitches surrounding them. Pictures of him pulling the gate apart plagued my mind, and I finally woke up. When I went back to sleep, it took a different turn, and ended up being a joke made by some of my friends.       Then I got this eerie sensation where I was walking through a park or something, and I walked up and put my arms around two girls and was trying to score a date. We were laughing and talking and the like, when a third girl comes up, and her face has been in so many of my other dreams...she sat down and we started to talk, she introduced herself as Michelle.      this is all I remember. how come I learn her name just now? and why was I having that nightmare before? interpretation is welcome

20090220063716AA8sXzw	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Who is more to blame in sexist laws?	In England we're seeing more & more hysterical & sexist anti-males laws being petitioned for, drawn up and proposed.      For example, Jacqui Smith wants men who seek female company in the form of a prostitute to be charged with the crime of rape... We know Harriet Harman wants women to be given favourable odds in job applications... We also know she wants fathers out of the picture at a woman's drop of the hate... I mean, 'hat' sorry.      During a radio interview, a high ranking prostitute (yes, really) entirely dismissed Jacqui Smith's claims that most prostitutes are 'forced' into the profession - she said that the vast majority are there by their own choice.       Harriet Harman continually 'forgets' to mention that the 'wage gap' is perpetuated largely through women's own choices rather than discrimination.            So, when these laws are put through to hinder men - should the blame lay mostly with the feminists who misrepresent reality to the law makers - or, are the law makers at fault for not doing their own home work and just taking the feminists word for everything?

So yesterday a lot of people in the media were freaking out because the dow reached a 6 year low. They say this is a sign of some kind of economic apocalypse or something. One thing i am wondering though, could another explanation for why the markets are falling like they be that they were just unrealistically high for years?       If you look at the dow, for example, between 1940-1990, most decades, it would gain maybe 20%-25% or so in value. However, between 1990-2000, the dow gained about 400%.       Do you think one major reason why the markets are falling like they are is because they needed a readjustment because they were unrealistically inflated for a long time?

20090220050324AA50xc7	Social Science;Sociology	Still worried a year later and effecting my daily life.?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me, even though eveything was deleted from the drive, i know things can still be recovered ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET.
20090220062155AAcG1c6	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is this the true colours of anti-feminism?	Lol, I didn't think I could be more outraged by some of the anti-feminist comments on here, but apparently I can...      "I think men and women are equal and don't see why women shouldn't rule. Or at least I didn't until I opened my eyes to what is happening with feminism i.e. if feminism is representing women - as it claims to be - it is totally undermining the notion that women should be put in charge of anything other than making sandwiches for men."      Is this yet more anti-feminism justifications of female inferiority and male superiority over women?  :-)
20090220063903AAfnTjQ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do anti-feminists believe that women should be punished for the 'failings' of feminism?	Feminism is a social movement, like any other.      If the failings of feminism can be used to argue that women shouldn't have rights, then why aren't the failings of Marxism used to argue that the working class shouldn't have rights?      And how can anti-feminists ever justify the removal of women's rights, when they claim to support equality?  :-)
20090220055948AAGtaHw	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Since no-one has been able to name a single country where men were oppressed by women...?	Since no-one has been able to name a single country where women denied men the right to vote, stand for election, own property, etc, why do anti-feminists try to compare the modern day 'oppression' of men with the oppression of women?        And since no-one has been able to name even a modern feminist state where men are denied these rights, why do anti-feminists try and justify women's oppression in the name of opposing feminism?  This is a recent quote from an anti-feminist..      "The more I learn about what feminism is doing these days the more I sympathise with the idea of men being in charge."      So how do you feel about male supremacy being justified in the name of anti-feminism?  :-)

20090220064228AAw862U	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Why do I keep having these dreams?	I have been divorced for about 6 years now and been remarried for 3. I am very happy with my husband now. But for the past week, every night, I have had a dream that something has happened between me and my current husband and I end up back with my ex. In my dream, I am very unhappy but know I can not go back to my current husband. Every time I have the dream, we always break up for different reasons. One night he had even died and that's why we weren't together. I hate the feeling that I have during these dreams. It is always the same. I am miserable with him and want to be back with my current husband. I miss him so much in my dream. It is getting to where I miss him when I'm awake too even though I see him everyday. I have checked all the dream websites I can find and I'm willing to accept that  this has something else to do with another aspect of my life, but I can not figure out what aspect that is and I can not stop having these dreams. I just want them to stop. If someone can shed some light on why I'm having these dreams, I would greatly appreciate it.

Basically, I was a male Martha Stewart for one fortnight and boy was I exhausted. However...my grades went up, my stress level went down, I saved more money, and got loads done.      For another two weeks, I seized the day. Carpé Diem was my motto. I planned nothing. I took everything on a whim and had fun. Lived life as if each day was my last.    However, by three days I had no money. I failed two tests. My room was a mess. My skin got bad (a few spots) and life was pretty hectic.         I thought it was interesting. I would of thinking the second would have been WAY more fun and uplifting. It wasn't.       So, which do you live your life by?

20090220062126AAygLnk	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Where Women Ever Oppressed, OR Were They On a Pedestal?	Seems to me that back in the day, women were carried over puddles, shielded from extreme weather, and placed on a pedestal.      Remember if a ship sank, it was always, "women and children first."       Women were fed, clothed, and had houses built around them. They were protected by a strong patriarchy, that stood guard ready to sacrifice their lives for the ladies.       It was a misdemeanor to curse in front of a lady, a man would go to prison for the cimes of his wife. My how times have changed, women now try to out drink the men, some dress like hookers, and curse like sailors.       It seems as though the State has taken our old job, and then they take our money and give it to women, in the form of welfare, child support, alimony and other woman firster programs.       Do you not think it would be better if we kept our money, and just spend it on the women, instead of having the State as a middle man?       It seems to me, the only thing oppressing women is feminsim, in their quest to turn our lovely ladies, into over worked, die young, aging quickly, men. What gives?

That means no friends, no family, no girlfriend, no anybody.      I think that I've always had an issue initiating relationships. What I mean is that I make acquittances but never get past that.      Right now I'm really lonely and need to know how to be more confident and less insecure. The reasons I'm like this no longer matter - I need to take action but have no idea where to begin. I feel like I'm in some kind of trap - no friends = no social life = uninteresting person with nothing to offer.      Serious answers only.

I do not quite certain how to describe it but this is the scenario: my uncle has been asking my aunt the same question for way too many time that it gets into her nerves. It's like interrogating her to telling something that he thought might have taken place and it looks to me like he keeps pushing and push hard so that my aunt spit out something that actually never taken place. What do I call this type of mind-set? Is there a word to describe his manner?

20090220071005AASdXW0	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is chivalry dead? or is it in a coma?	Since women tend to like the "bad boy", has the way of the gentleman become extinct?  I'm not talking about simply holding doors open for people, or helping someone get that item down from a top shelf, I'm talking about some of the following:   - proper toasts at gatherings instead of just "Cheers"   - men getting up from the table when a lady gets up to leave   - men not wearing hats when their eating.    - allowing the lady the first choice of a seat   - allowing the lady to get into the car first and settled.   These are just a few examples.  I know that I don't call ladies Ma'am but I'll call them "Miss"   My grandpa told me "You can rarely go amiss by calling a lady a Miss."   I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of other examples.   What has caused this shift where the majority of men can get away with being jerks and big shots?    Ladies do you honestly go for all that bravado? or do you wish some guys would be more gentlemanly?
