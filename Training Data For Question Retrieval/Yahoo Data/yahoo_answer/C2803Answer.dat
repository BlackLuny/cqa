Make deep incisions on the chicken flesh - deep enough for spices to get absorbed but making them too deep could render the pieces smaller. Mix turmeric, chilli powder, salt, garlic paste, yogurt, and half-lemon's juice. Thoroughly apply this paste onto the meat flesh and let marinate for an hour.<br>     2. Heat about 100 ml of oil. Roast cumin, cloves, cinnamon, depodded cardamom, bay leaves, ? spoon cumin, 1 spoon coriander powder, and finally add onions(2). Wait a couple of minutes to add mint leaves. When onions turn slight brown, add marinated chicken and cook for about 20-30 min. It should NOT be fully cooked at this stage; add garam masala and coconut powder and turn off flame when about ? cooked. Gravy should not be much, chicken pieces should look roasted.<br>     3. Meanwhile, while the chicken is still cooking, prepare the biryani rice. Slightly rinse 3 cups of basmati, and add water little less than the volume of the rice itself so that its only half cooked preferably in an electric cooker. Amount of water actually depends on kind of rice at hand and your experience helps to judge it. Also add 1-2 teaspoons of salt to it. Take a few semi-cooked grains of rice and colour them with diluted saffron for garnishing.<br>     4. You will need a utensil of about 12" (300 mm) base. Place about half of semi-cooked rice in it. Next, layer half of chicken on it again topped by a layer of rice (half of the remaining). One more layer of remaining chicken, finally with layer of rest of the rice on top ends the rice-chicken layering stage.<br>     5. Heat oil and deep fry half the sliced onions to golden brown. Similarly fry cashew. Garnish the top layer with these two along with 100 ml ghee, coconut milk, saffron rice grains and coriander. Lid the vessel and try making it airtight (but no pressure should build up). Put on high flame for 5 min before reducing it to low flame. The flame should NOT be at the vessel's centre, but on one side of it. Wait for 2-3 min and turn the vessel to heat other next part on its circumference. This way, keep rotating the vessel every 2-3 min for about 20 min. Every time you turn it, carefully disturb the contents by a shake/jerk so as to avoid settling of ghee at the bottom.<br>     6. Put off the flame and wait for about 10 min before opening. Before serving, mix the medley from the bottom. Serve with boiled egg halves. Enjoy. Rightly and carefully made, its an epicure's paradise.|`|8OYcyvOwaa	Ingredients:<br>  450g Indian cooked chicken<br>  2 tbsp vegetable oil<br>  1 tbsp cashew nuts, roughly chopped<br>  1 tbsp sultanas<br>  800g pilau rice<br>  1l cooked curry sauce<br>  1 tsp garam masala<br>  1 tsp hot chilli powder (or to taste)<br>  1/2 tsp salt <br>  <br>  Method:<br>  Halve each chicken piece then set aside. Meanwhile heat the oil in a wok, add the nuts and cook until lightly golden, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the sultanas to the wok and remove within a second or two (as soon as they've plumped up) and set aside. <br>  <br>  Add the chicken pieces to the wok. Stir to coat and instantly turn down the heat to low. Warm the rice either in a pan or a microwave and add to the chicken. Heat for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring very gently so you don't break the grains (if you can it's better to toss the mixture than stirring as this will preserve the rice). Transfer the rice and meat mixture to a serving dish and keep warm in the oven. <br>  <br>  Add the curry sauce to a separate pan, bring to a simmer then add the garam masala, the chilli powder and the salt. Pour the sauce into serving dishes then sprinkle the biryani with the nuts and sultanas and serve.|`|13gT9DVYaa	Have from hotel and keep in kitchen this is few mins biryani

lzEuuseJaa	Have you worked in a restaurant? That would be the first step. One really shouldn't open a restaurant if they haven't spent time working in all aspects of the business. A restaurant are very difficult, expensive business -- that it's hard to make any money at! Restaurants run differently than other businesses, far more complicated than people think.<br>  <br>  There are Restaurant Consultants that can help you open a restaurant. You can Google: Restaurant Consultant Your City, State  to find one near you. They cost quite a bit, but a good one is worth it if you can afford it. But you'd still really need to know about restaurants from the inside, working at several similar to what you'd like to open.<br>  <br>  Here is some info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/dining/27fail.html?ref=dining" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/dining...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/11/11/restaurant-entrepreneurship-business-forbeslife-food07-cx_pl_1113resto.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/2007/11/11/restaur...</a><br>  <a href="http://restaurants.about.com/od/federalirstaxes/a/Intro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://restaurants.about.com/od/federali...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!
