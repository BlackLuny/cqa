G6t2O9Kmaa	I don't like the 2008 TV Licence ad that makes you feel like you are a criminal even if you pay it. But I do think the road saftey crossing advert is pretty cool and it protects some people from their own stupidity so they can continue do the jobs we don't want to like supermarket checkout, cleaners [evil laugh].<br>  <br>  I think its good that people are reminded to pay because if they pay their licence the money goes to the broadcasters to make programmes with, whilst if people pay the fine it goes to the government where it will be used to bail out a bank that went under because it gave its employees exorbitant bonuses.|`|8tcaTrIvaa	It is to prevent public panicky.<br>  <br>  When government has got its database, that means your data are save.

ApJOZLBgaa	Indian Judiciary is unique and believes in 'Justice delayed but never denied' even to a enemy of the nation. Last time the blasts happened in Bombay 1993 the judgement was given after hearing of almost 15 years and even the accused will accept that no injustice was done. The case was different all those involved than were Indian nationals. Under the present circumstances I doubt if Dawood's hunch-men and ISI will allow him to live that long.<br>  <br>  I have full faith in the Indian Judiciary and will go with their decision.|`|56f857adccfe97c5b5197529fd3759b6aa	Hi Rose, I see from your profile that you had put three questions about Kasab recently.. with intent to create public sympathy for him.. which may not decide the court verdict.. but as some here have opined, the UPA rulers could restrain the prosecution and play the minority card to save / prolong his life.., but definitely not on the basis of great philosophies you had taken pains to describe..!!<br>  <br>  IF you had generally talked about the capital punishment, one can take your words at face value, but you use the arguments of mercy in the case of Kasab in particular, under a generic label of sympathy for a "human's" life..!!?<br>  <br>  Even the most merciful Jesus and the great author of Quron (Peace be upon him) had not hesitated to do away with lives of dastardly villians.. Jesus said that a man can die to save a family, a family to save a village, a village to save a nation.. etc.! <br>  <br>  But you want a person who had wiped out all trace of human sensitivities from his mind and carries a mere carnivore's thirst for the blood of innocents in his thought and designs, to live and repent..!? <br>  <br>  The like of you with paranoid views on crimes and justice parade as humanists.. least voicing your wise sentiments for the civilian families abducted / tortured / maimed or orphaned by terrorirsts..!! <br>  <br>  At best you guys would dig out freak instances of a police / military excess somewhere to justify a terrorist backlash rather than display any finer feeling for the plight of the unfortunate victims..!  <br>  <br>  Carry on perverts, your "holy and human" services.. There is a govt to see things at your own level, albeit on different motive..!! The govts have precious little time and resources even to provide a decent life to peace loving commoners and you want govt to care about rehabilitating hardened criminals or playing host in jails..!<br>  <br>  I see a far greater danger in the pseudo humanists of your kind, to the society, than the terrorists themselves.. For you move freely in society canvassing for the deviants of worst kind.. rather than fighting for peace and security for the common people!|`|vCvsXbOCaa	Isupport Poondi's view above.|`|WH3MfnW2aa	You are right for the portion of write up of the question that says that hanging og Ajmal would not stop terrorism. <br>  <br>  Terrorism would end only if Ajmal with all his sympathisers, financers, pseudo secularists and abettors are hanged, including you.|`|Ieq0zzdeaa	Ajmad shall be tried and if evidence found, only then there shall be verdict and nobody can say at this stage that he shall get death sentence.|`|swiOhDo2aa	If you are in all cases opposed to capital punishment, the question does not arise: whether we gain or not will be immaterial.<br>  <br>  If you take a utilitarian view - the greatest good of the greatest number - then it becomes a useful and meaningful question.<br>  <br>  Experience shows that while there will always be some murders, hanging has a deterrent effect in some cases. Naturally, this effect is greater when the offence is premeditated, and does not seem to be diminished by the existence of religious or political fanaticism. The Coventry bombs planted by the IRA many, many years ago stopped abruptly when one of the murderers was hanged.<br>  <br>  It is possible, and the history of insurrections seems to support this view, that fighters who are not deterred by an honourable death in combat might be put off by the humiliating and undignified business of being hanged out of reach of the public, of applause, or of moral support. For the utilitarian, the important question is whether enough good comes of a hanging to justify the ending of a man's life in this way.<br>  <br>  I honestly do not know. Comments, anyone?|`|0kzww3lgaa	By hanging Ajmal we hope to make itclear that if one does something to destroy     cities,people  &make humanities suffer,he willnot be spared,also that his family will suffer    due to his fault.|`|faqjES8vaa	surely,he will get death penalty|`|gkThLcf2aa	I dunno, i'm from ireland where we sit down and eat potatoes and laugh at the rest of the world.|`|51o7cmJ9aa	In some cases you are absolutely right and I completely agree with you. <br>  Terror outfits of any kind can always replace the people they lose, and just one guy (who they probably don't even remember anymore) is nothing. Kal wahaan uski jagah 1000 aur khade ho jaayenge. <br>  <br>  So obviously hanging Kasab has no meaning, right? Wrong<br>  <br>  Hanging Kasab is not going to lessen the numbers of the army, but they are going to give a message----the young 18 year old boys who are sneaking into India next time will have a mental image of Kasab on the noose in public. They will know the fate waiting them in India if they are caught. <br>  Obviously, that catching part is a big 'if'. But this is also part of the whole exercise---cut the security gaps and make sure you punish anyone you get your hands on. Its all about sending a message. <br>  <br>  And of course, the long term measures. Again, completely agree with you man. You have to strike at extremism-and there is only one way: develop economically and condition the people socially. <br>  <br>  Do you know why there are never instances of extremism in Japan? Because every person is truly patriotic there. It is part of their schooling. Every student has free education and compulsory moral studies where they are taught that Japan is the best country in the world.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that India is the best, but no one living in India should be allowed to think that it is okay to attack India if they don't like the country. There may not be pride, but there should gratitude to a nation that allowed to live in it. That gratitude will come the day the government provides everything the citizen wants whenever he/she wants it. That is the day no one will attack India from within.|`|e5F9zjtcaa	My dear true indian,It seems you have more human qualities than <br>  needed, If your mother beats you, can you hurt her? But Ajmal did it?<br>  In my openion he should punish with stringent laws. He wounded the <br>  hearts of many indians,If you ask me personally i will not forgive him.|`|rpDvbBkAaa	be assured that he will not be, as in the case of afsal, hanged; till elections, the UPA will play the rhetoric and during IPL matches, it will allow hindus to be slain to appease muslims and to show to them that they are sorry for having to shoot and capture muslim terrorists. After elections, afsal and kasab will fly back to their camp for staging more attacks.|`|xOVYHbuiaa	you are right on some of the issues but do you know that India is earning high expenditure for security of that devil.<br>  <br>  so do u wish developing country like India to take responsibility of all devils that do terrorist activities. this will set morally wrong example to the world and to especially a group people involved or going to be involved in terrorist activities against India.and so it is better to clear the problem instead of nurturing it.and if we will not give harsh punishment against ajmal we will remain a soft nation to terrorist.<br>  and also i think we do not have right to speak for punishment on him it is the right of our government and judicial members to do justice.<br>  <br>  but at last you are right that anyone can become the criminal for given circumstances but it is the human nature in everyman to stop him this criminal activity and which makes a man a human. i guess he have already killed his human in him because when he was killing person he did not remember that after this man or woman there is whole family dying with him and he was able to kill many of them.so i also think that he have done so inhuman act that devil like him cannot be human in his life.<br>  <br>  so yes he should be hanged and if there is harsher punishment then hanged till death then it must be executed to him.
GOifC7i3aa	absolutely pathetic<br>  <br>  and he may well be causing trouble<br>  <br>  muslims are eager to be seen as victims even though they are the usual aggressors when it comes to terrorist attacks<br>  <br>  maybe the job was too difficult and he has seen other shirkers getting paid off for making discrimination claims and expects to win<br>  <br>  * recently there has been the catering manager who did not want to handle sausages and bacon<br>  <br>  * a warehouse worker who did not want to move alcohol using his fork lift truck<br>  <br>  * a hairdresser who would not reveal her hair and when she found it difficult to find a salon to employ her sued one and won for hurt feelings<br>  <br>  * the top policeman who claimed discrimination when he did not get the job he wanted<br>  <br>  it seems that along with ''racist'' as one of the first words they learn it is now ''sue ''<br>  <br>  if they don't like it here .........|`|AA11015890	He looks like just another Asian out to sue for all he can get.

How do we know that they are not involved in terrorist activity and facilitating it?<br>  <br>  I also think there is a concerted effort by muslim police officers to cause problems for the force. We've seen at least two high-ranking officers taking the police force to a tribunal with some perceived grievance about racism. It should not be tolerated.|`|PGFmTbUOaa	It would depend on how the beard was described - if it is used as a focus of his race, then yes its racist. While some would argue that the source of the jibes could be removed if the guy shaved...this is not really an option if it is part of his religious creed.|`|b1XStRqtaa	Just another sue happy person.

Even if he did look odd, then he should be doing his JOB, not worrying so much about his religion! Boohoo to him!<br>  <br>  And no, he did NOT need to sue.|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	I didn't see it myself but it sounds like you're absolutely right.  My husband is a police officer (6'2" white English!) and he takes soooo much crap fom his colleagues.  They all take it from each other.  I've often said to him that I'd be really upset if I took half the crap that they do ,but he assures me it's all in jest and everybody gets their fair share.  So yes you're right, they do need to be made of stronger stuff.  I'm not saying that I condone what appears to be such nastiness at times, but that's just what goes on I think.  I'm Irish, and one of my husbands colleagues asked him "how's your pikey wife?", right infront  of me, so I guess you've got to be pretty thick skinned to marry a copper as well!!!<br>  <br>  btw deighton, if I said it was ONLY my husband taking the mick out of others then yes he would definitely be a bully, but like I said, they all do it to each other. Black, white. Muslim, Seikh, Irish, English.  It doesn't matter who or what you are... no one can escape getting the piss taken for something!!!|`|RzaP9bQmaa	He got upset because someone laughed at his beard? <br>  <br>  right.....ok <br>  <br>  Whats he going to do when has to help stop a riot? cry in the back of the van.? <br>  <br>  Please..if i sued everyone said that I had red hair I would be so rich by now. Some people need to grow up.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  <br>  Seb I thought your little joke was funny, thumbs up|`|51o7cmJ9aa	It is paranoia pure and simple.

Which all those with no experience or knowledge of, are all too happy to criticise based on the anti establishment views of over rated journalists in the Daily Mail. It has to be considered that alot of the time you will find things you deal with could be considered minor and of no great interest.  The amazing thing i find is that when the customers of the police force are subjecting the officers to the sort of language i know would make people like Deighton2002 crawl in to a corner and cry about. Im talking about suggestions of what they will sexually do to your family, Any imperfection on you WILL be picked up by the street urchins in order to rial you and get a reaction. If you react, they win and you have a complaint and possibly lose your job. This is all thanks to people like this officer. I call nicknames and the like character building and if you cant take it you are well and truly in the wrong job. And to play the race card is pathetic.<br>  <br>     joann M. In todays world of positive discrimination i can see why you make the point you do. Because your husband is 6'2" White. "Mr average copper". He cant play such a card. I understand your point although others may not.<br>  <br>    All in all the police have a valuable roll to fulfill and if we were without them Daily Mail readers like Deighton would be one of the first to find himself at the wrong end of a gang of hooded youths with no-one to phone but his mummy..<br>  <br>  Finally if it were a white officer complaining, would we hear about it?? No because without the race card he would be the same as matey with the beard. Rubbish at his job and back in the dole queue. It is a very funny beard though.|`|AA10283080	Well both parties are to blame.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not only does he need to lighten up but the ones who ridiculed him for his appearance need to learn some manners and respect.|`|LIpCGz4oaa	thats the funniest beard ive ever seen. any normal person would laugh at it.<br>  edit. i wonder whos giving all the thumbs down? a muslim with a weird beard?

bA0sLHnlaa	Its shocking, but on the other hand this is a cultural issue with people Afghanistan.  Its nothing troops can solve.   To put it in perspective, if in 1859, China had decided that they had "had enough with the shocking slavery in the south"  And had the military strength to invade and occupy the US to liberate the slaves.  Would we have seen them as "liberators?'  Would we have welcomed them with open arms and gladly kept them in our country for nearly 8 years as an occupying force?   Would we have adopted the Chinese form of government and customs at the time?  of course not.  <br>  <br>  The point is.  No matter how many troops you send there you are not going to change behavior like this.  The British tried it, the Soviets tried it, what makes us think we will be any more successful.|`|3B1g8cVBaa	Why wouldn't they run it?

yJmjg9sEaa	Chinese investors are investing in oil from the Sudan despite the genocide in Darfur because they need oil and the West has a lock on most of the sources in the Arab world... and the majority of the world's oil that's still in the ground is in Arab lands. This has nothing directly to do with the Chinese government, aside from their failure to enforce the international boycott, but China has a lot of problems of their own and rarely if ever get involved in other countries' disputes unless they're a party to that dispute. You're confusing individual Chinese people and companies with the Chinese government and/or the Chinese people as a whole.<br>  <br>  Individual Chinese citizens do in fact participate in the illegal trade in tiger parts, as well as body parts from other animals endangered and otherwise, at all stages of the trade, from the poachers who kill the animals, to the middlemen who smuggle them, the stores that serve as clearinghouses and the end-users who purchase and use the illicit parts. But China is signatory to all the major international treaties protecting endangered species, in addition to having its own laws against killing or trading in the remains of tigers and other threatened species, and every year investigates, captures, prosecutes and sentences people who have violated Chinese and international laws by participating in the tiger trade. Some Chinese, meanwhile, both in government and private citizens, have advocated for and invested in trying to develop tiger farms to reduce the demand for poached tigers -- this effort seems to be failing, but it at least had the good intention of trying to reduce poaching. You have again conflated individual Chinese people and companies with the Chinese government and/or the Chinese people as a whole.<br>  <br>  By your logic the United States would shoulder the principal blame for the world trade in heroin and cocaine.<br>  <br>  Speaking of the U.S., it, not China, is the world's worst polluter, as someone else already pointed out.<br>  <br>  I can't disagree with you about Tibet. China has no business there; Tibet is a sovereign nation whose people are brutalized, deported from their ancestral homes, and have their own language and culture forbidden them under Chinese occupation. China didn't "liberate" anyone by invading Tibet.<br>  <br>  As for what a "superpower" is... historically, that has never been determined by whose morals were superior. It's always been a matter of who was most powerful and most able to force lesser powers to submit to them or at least stay out of their way. England was a superpower once... when they invaded and subdued the peoples of North America, Africa, the Middle East, India and elsewhere, taking other peoples' sovereign land as colonies. Spain, similarly, was a superpower when it made colonies of most of South and Central America, as well as the Philippines and much of North America. The Soviet Union became a superpower by adding to its already-large (but largely useless) territory with the annexation of countries from the Baltic to Central Asia, and by expanding its influence even beyond its swollen borders with combined economic and military might to keep countries from Poland to Afghanistan within its "Iron Curtain." Even the United States, even after fighting a long war for its own independence, was not innocent of this sort of imperialist expansion; the Philippines were "liberated" by U.S. forces but then kept as a "territory" under the same "Manifest Destiny" doctrine that was used to justify the grabbing of many other peoples' lands, some of which remain under U.S. control today. So as far as the historical standard of what makes a superpower, China has earned that title pretty well.<br>  <br>  Please stop polluting Yahoo!

That was the reason for Chinese Army to move in Tibet 50 years ago.<br>  <br>  The monarchy of Tibetian religion, i.e. Lamas, placed all farmers as their slaves. Chinese army was sent to free all slaves in Tibets.<br>  <br>  You may learn comments from Tibets but they were in fear by Lamas. They feared anything would go wrong in their insurrection.<br>  <br>  Peerhaps, you may learn the truth by visiting Tibet some time later. Most government leaders in that region were tibetian and their families were slaves of the former Tibetian Monarchy.

He isn't going fix our problems in my opinion, I do believe that things will get worse before getting better.  I don't agree with taking from one to give to another, I want to keep my guns for protection, I don't think abortion should be a form of birth control and I don't think using the stem cells from the fetus is right!

It was also unlikely during the Bush era.

NpIWGtPkaa	Unfortunately again there are some comments by people who don't know anything about Iran. If you want to understand this matter better from the perspective of an Iranian you must be patient to read my comment thoroughly.<br>  <br>  There are always two kinds of responses from inside Iran to any outside matter : 1. the reponse of regime (the extreme right wing minority who controls the country through leader) 2. reponse of people<br>  <br>  most of the times these two differ. For example Iran's foreign policy and attitude towards US-Iran relations or Palestine and Israel issues is only under leader's control while most people disagree with it.<br>  <br>  But there are also certain issues to which all iranians respond unitedly.<br>  These are specially matters of national pride.<br>  <br>  The reponse to film 300 was one of those that came from Iranians not just from iran's regime. In fact the regime probably didn't care as much since it was about Iran before Islam and generally the regime of Iran only cares about Islamic culture. But people of Iran care about Iranian/persian culture and identity very greatly. <br>  <br>  I wanted to say this so you know this sort of "getting offended" is different from other issues such as when you read in the news Iran gets offended by Israel /US actions or Nuclear row or human rights report etc etc <br>  <br>  What's wrong with this movie from Iranians' point of view? It's the way Iran and Iranians are depicted in this movie.<br>  This movie tries to appear historical. About real people, real nations, and a real historical incident. The interpretation of how this incident really happened is one matter. The offensive thing is the movie shows a real nation and real historic figures far from reality in a barbaric and rude manner.  <br>  <br>  The director didn't realize the difference between making a movie about a real war between two countries and making "lord of the rings" or "starwars" .  yeah in those movies you can depict the enemy side as much ugly and dirty as you want. <br>  <br>  But can it be the same in a historic movie about real nations that still exist today?!  <br>  Indeed all movies about wars are sort of baised in favor of the country producing the movie but in this movie there's more than just being biased. The movie tried to attack and insult Iranians as a nation by depicting them in such a harsh manner which is far from reality. Without any reference to history.<br>  <br>   It was as if the writers sat around the table and said ok we have Greeks on one side who must be like this and that. and as for Persians umm i don't know well let's just have some random barbaric wild tribe! Wouldn't you take offense if that was made about your country!?!|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	It shows Persians, set on world conquest, getting trashed by a handful of westerners.<br>  <br>  What is odd though is the way modern Iranians choose to identify with ancient Persia - who were pagans. Not very Islamic, I would have thought!<br>  <br>  BTW, it's not 300BC, just 300, refering to the number of Spartans!|`|NMpbLtuTaa	'The film "300," portrays the battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C., in which a force of 300 Spartans held off a massive Persian army at a mountain pass in Greece for three days. It angered many Iranians for the way Persians are depicted as decadent, sexually flamboyant and evil in contrast to the noble Greeks.'<br>  <a href="http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/03/01/iran_angered_over_films_the_wrestler_and_1" rel="nofollow">http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/...</a>|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	The film is called 300, and is loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae when the Persian army of King Xerxes was held at the Pass of Thermopylae<br>  <br>  A rearguard of 300 spartans with a few mixed other greek soldiers, held the pass after the greek army where outflanked by the Persians who where shown a secret passage tthrough the mountains by a greek traitor.<br>  <br>  The bulk of the Greek army where forced to retreat but the 300 Spartans Under the Spartan King Leonidas guarded the Pass to give the rest of the army time to get away. The Battle is the perfect example of a disciplined fighting force causing massive casualties to a vastly superior army, a force of little under 1,000 killing at least 20,000 attackers including wiping out Xerxes personal body guard.<br>  <br>  300 is a comic book depiction of the battle, similar to the film sin city which depicts the spartans as homoerotic warriors, and Xerxes as a drug addicted wastrel.<br>  <br>  Pitty really, the story is astonishing in itself without the offensive comic book portrail|`|AA10527991	The executive producer of the film is a right-wing nut job who backed Bush in the 2004 election, and used this vehicle to warm up the US population for Bush's impending war against Iran, which, fortunately never occurred.  The hidden agenda was not that well hidden and the Iranians were--rightly, I think--incensed by it for that reason.|`|xDPQ700baa	Iran wants to wave fists at the west. This just seemed like another bandwagon for them to get on.

Thank you Arya, you really cooled me down.<br>  <br>  from wikipedia<br>  Khashayarshah (Xerxes) is overall portrayed as a just and praiseworthy king in the Bible. Part of this may be due not only to the Jews' belief in the story of Esther, but also to the fact that his destruction of the Babylonians' golden idol may have struck a positive chord in the eyes of Hebrew monotheists who had been slaves of Babylon a few generations earlier.<br>  <br>  update : Achaemenid/Persians were not pagans....  they were unitarian and had a prophet with a book named "Avesta" they believed in Ahura Mazda or the same Ormazd. the prophet name is Zoroaster/Zartosht and followers are known as Zoroastrian (Magi in bible).<br>  <br>  Date<br>  Until the late 1600s, Zoroaster was generally dated to about the sixth century BCE, which coincided with both the “Traditional date” (see details below) and historiographic accounts (Ammianus Marcellinus xxiii.6.32, fourth c. CE). However, already at the time (late nineteenth century), the issue was far from settled, with James Darmesteter pleading for a later date (c. 100 BCE) and others pleading for dates as early as 6000 BCE.[e]<br>  <br>  complete article at wikipedia :<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster</a>|`|adznfYe3aa	Is it?

Inquilab’s previous look was like that followed by all Urdu newspapers as standard. Most Urdu publications still follow the same style and format.<br>  <br>  It is characterized by an absence of masthead, the title appearing in the right top corner. The news section beginning right at the top of the page, Urdu papers that have colour pages are still a rarity.<br>  <br>  So the new look that Inquilab incorporated has been similar to the English newspapers. On the frontpage it has a masthead, an ad-space bottom left (instead of bottom right in English papers). The introduction of colour pages and a greater ad-edit ratio are a few characteristics of the latest edition.<br>  <br>  Shahid has been a part of Inquilab for more than a decade now. He took over from Mr. Fuzail Jafferey, who was the editor of Inquilab from 1st Feb 1990 to 31st May 1995 and again from 27 May 2000 to 31st march 2004.|`|Vs8oNT0oaa	Aamer Mansoor

We also want America's gas and oil dependency from the Middle East to end, so that we will not have to endure any more $4-$6 per gallon prices.<br>  <br>  We also want to know why "President" Obama wants to keep troops in Iraq and Afghanistan longer than needed, when George W. Bush wanted to let them come home? <br>  <br>  Bobby Jindal is much more of a concerned citizen than the last Governor of Louisiana, and I would not count him out for a run to the White House in four years.  Look what he did to avoid another  disasterous Louisiana tragedy during last year's hurricane season.

Some people called Holocaust-deniers try to say that hardly any were killed, but there is just too much evidence.  The Nazis also killed homosexuals, people who were disabled, communists, Gypsies and others considered "undesirable).|`|emJ79qagaa	The Holocaust did go around WWII<br>  <br>  It was part of his "final solution" to exterminate the Jews, Poles, and Gypsies as he blamed them, marxists, and communists for the horrible sh*t that happened to Germany after WWI and ruining the idea of a master race, which was all propaganda. He was the master of propaganda, he basically brainwahsed the vulnerable german population to believe that they were the master race and he really spoken to them. <br>  <br>  The reason people followed him so much because the Americans, British, and French imposed a unfair treaty, known As the Versailles Treaty, blaming Germany for the War, imposing unfair war debts upon German Weimar Republic as well as making their army smaller and making them more vulnerable to attack (as the french did in the Rhur region and took over their only descent form of reediming its economy)<br>  The Versailles Treaty was for WWI not 2<br>  And the ironic thing is that it was basically the fault of the Americans, British, and French for letting the German population become so deprived that they invited a mad man (in our 21st century standards, not back then though) to rule them. <br>   . I don't think it was all Germany's fault! I mean George VI of Britain was equally Guilty (Ferdinand II's cousin, the emporer of Austria) was just as guilty as they both were having a cousin rivalry!

ksOW8Y4Aaa	At the moment a lot of them do seem intent on marginalizing their party. It's real clear at this point that Obama's promised "change" wasn't anything of the kind, his policies are almost indistinguishable from Bush's. So when the Republicans get all upset about Obama doing the same thing as Bush, they sound, well, I won't say it. And yes, the economic crisis is the worst test this country has faced in decades, by continuing to play obvious politics with it, again, they make themselves look bad. Lastly a lot of Repubs have completely failed to understand that Obama is genuinely popular with a lot of people, by attacking him right not of the gate so to speak, they are both insulting millions of Americans, and setting themselves up for blame if things go badly. <br>  <br>  If the Repubs were smart they'd be a lot more conciliatory and willing to compromise, then if things do go badly under Obama they can claim they were right all along, and if things go well, they can share in the credit. <br>  <br>  I don't know about political suicide, but I think they're making a huge political mistake, that's for sure.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	If the stimulus package fails, then the Republicans are gonna say that they were saying it was gonna fail, and they were right, but if the stimulus package works, and gets the economy back to normal, then yes, it would be republican political suicide, kidna.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	I hope so. It would be wonderful if every American would see it for what it is.

By the way when did the Democrats ever agree with anything the Republicans ever did, tit for tat.|`|WLCpLU0jaa	I certainly hope so. No group of people have done more harm to so many than that party. 20 of the last 28 years have been under republican rule with 12 years of Reagan and daddy Bush, with an all too brief respite with Clinton, and the last 8 years of the worst most disastrous misleadership the nation has seen since Hoover. If any political group and philosophy needs to be avoided, it's the republicans!|`|AcgDcQG0aa	It's possible that both parties are committing political suicide.  Because Obama and his administration are continuing to give billions and billions of dollars to the banks that squandered their money on bonuses and perks for their executives.  And in the end, angry voters might not see much difference between the Democrats and the Republicans.|`|InW0bIkwaa	If you think this stimulus bill is a step in the right direction...then you should consider re-registering as a democrat.  No conservative in his/her right mind would ever push this stimulus package that even the president knows will not work.<br>  <br>  Obama promised bipartisanship, but has done nothing to support those claims in his campaign or in his cabinet selections.|`|i4QYyUsRaa	Your'e a conservative republican HA HA HA HA HA HA Yeah, like I'm a whig tory bullmoose green party libertarian|`|AA10294901	Sure you're a Republican, and I'm a liberal socialist that thinks opposite of you.

Their identity today is indeed comprised of Arab heritage, but the name 'Palestine' has been in use since the time of Ancient Rome, including the people that lived there.<br>  <br>  The Ancient Palestinians spoke Aramaic and Greek and were a pagan culture.<br>  <br>  Palestinians today are a mix of Muslims and Christians. In fact, the oldest Christian community in the world is a group of Palestinians living in Bethlehem.<br>  <br>  Prior to 1948, the nation of Palestine was composed of Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Arabs living together in relative harmony. That was until the West, notably Britain  and the USA, encouraged and supported the ideology known as 'Zionism', which led to the creation of Israel, the razing of 500 villages and ethnic cleansing of 700,000+ native Palestinians, and the conflict as we see today.

That woman is irrational, egocentric and a burden to both the media and <br>  taxpayers.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	They can't possibly release the babies now. they are too small and need constant attention.

nUTJYYhTaa	I agree. All former presidents have gone by their last name in the media however much of the media has used President Obama's first name only.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the only logical reason for this is because there is little risk of making the "Osama" mistake as several newscasters have in the past. <br>  <br>  I still don't think it's right. The man deserves the respect afforded to all those who served before him.|`|9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	I only call people I actually like by their first name hence Obama will only be Obama.<br>  I also never called former President Bush anything but President Bush but that was a sign of respect.  Now that he is home here in Dallas I would call him George.|`|EVFbElUYaa	Because all the presidents had common names.  How many people do you know called obama?

Devotedly, passionately, proudly ignorant. Culturally possessed of a witless superstition that rises - or descends- to  less than the level of simien thought. These are arrogant cowards. They insult God himself with their base, cruel inhumanity using  him and their warped, backward mythology as an excuse to brutalize. These barbarians of the lowest form now contrive to whip an old woman for taking bread from two men. In the last weeks they have also ordered the stoning of a young woman for surviving a brutal gang rape. Their controlling religious zealots are the very embodiment of bleak stupidity. They haunt the streets of a seemingly modern, but in fact neolithic society like mindless demons.. Any thinking human can only be sickened by the bizarre, prehistoric sadism that this culture of monied animals allows and supports. <br>  What "type" of country is Saudi Arabia? The very worst type. A wet, oily wind from hell, the civilized world cannot continue to allow them to pollute humanity.  These barbarians must be called to account, isolated and rejected by a unified, thinking, humane world. As with the inhumanity of Aparthied, the Nazi's, Stalinists - the sad, occasional  parade of feral animals who have been consigned to the trash pits of history - so too must these and any like them be contained and marginalized  until evolution provides them with the missing genes that separate the rest of us from the beasts.

262RePZFaa	We had those threats in our school all the time. The easiest thing is to find out whether there is a major test/paper due that day, that is usually the cause. If your school is not taking it seriously, odds are you shouldn't worry either.<br>  <br>  I, however, being a devious student, took advantage of these days and stayed home just to get out of school. I never once believed it would actually be bombed. If you're worried, just contact your teachers, get the homework ahead of time, and take the day off.|`|G9TOMU7Waa	I believe that the school as a whole should close because a threat is a threat and just for safety every child should feel they and when the school thinks about it is it really worth to lose all of those children's life when it could have easily have been prevented but I do think that you should talk to your parents and tell them you would feel much more comfortable staying home for the day|`|htcfyWblaa	This happened at my school a few years back when i was a freshman.

Take it with a grain of salt, however, don't worry to badly over it. A lot of parents will probably keep their kids home, so your school might not do much that day. It might be okay for you to stay home that day, if you so choose.|`|E047GSKdaa	99.9% of bomb threats are fake.  But there is always a psycho out there.

It is a bunch of traders, who by the way make our world what it is, good or bad. Pirates are a bunch of criminals, who ransom companies, and I am sure you would not want to spend one day with them, never mind the weeks it takes. <br>  Every American who has a 401K or IRA, is involved with Wall Street to some degree. If they gamble their money, they sometimes lose. However, they usually win more times then they lose. This particular phase we are in is a very radical recession, unlike many we have gone through, this one is a global recession. <br>  You cannot even come close to comparing the two issues!|`|4eLzY2hfaa	i disagree.  if you don't feel there is a difference between somali pirates and wall street you're living in a vacuum somewhere between mars and uranus!|`|lSJWdkT6aa	HAHA!!!|`|cIttXzrwaa	Totally agree!|`|GOifC7i3aa	i disagree with it of course|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	you are trying to compare apples to oranges..although i agree to a point...but there is a diff between pirates (terrorists) and back stabbing politicians and CEO's..the latter do it for themselves...the pirates do it to buy war weapons and such

They'll go up a little, then down a little, then probably up again, then...etc.  Long term, they will continue to rise because the price of everything goes up, it's called inflation.

Maybe a different style of reporting.|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	I believe that mass media and large government has completely lost credibility. Sometimes you can discern the truth using a skeptical eye. However, you can often get burned by pretending the news is honest and that reporters have the integrity to challenge press releases.<br>  <br>  For example, if you were in NYC after 9/11, you heard from the EPA that it was safe to go to ground zero to help with the rescue. If you did, you are probably suffering from lung disease and you may be unable to secure proper medical care. <br>  <br>  The FDA is another propaganda mouth for industry. There are real health issues caused by the rich, fat-laden, diets of most Americans, but the dietary recommendations were all made with concerns for the financial health of corporations rather than the health of humans.

I was watching The Daily Show the other day and Jon Stewart was talking about how certain news personalities are blaming the stock market falling on Obama. He then pointed out that the stock market went up when the Titanic sank and when WWII began. In other words, it's a bunch of BS.

Do you realize how hated our country has been for the past 8 years? Bush's attitude seemed to be "this is the what we're going to do, and the rest of you can go f*** yourselves!" It's no wonder anti-American sentiment grew. I lived in Ireland for 2 years during that time and people would always ask me if I agreed with Bush's policies. When I said "no," people were very happy with me.<br>  <br>  Obama seems to be trying to be the anti-Bush as far as foreign policy is concerned. We may be one of the most powerful countries in the world right now--if not THE most powerful--but we don't need to be arrogant about it. To me, Bush always seemed to carry around a "we know best" attitude, which was, of course, BS.

Apart from the BushJr era, most American presidencies have recognised this, regardless of political party affiliations - BushSr and Nixon were known for their diplomacy as much as FDR. Given that there are a number of world issues critical to American security and prosperity that cannot be resolved without international cooperation (e.g. the economy, countering violent/extremist movements in some countries), diplomacy is particularly important right now.<br>  <br>  There are many possible bases of diplomacy - showing that we are interested in good diplomatic relations is one step (which is why he's sending Clinton all over the world to do that). He has not yet spoken much about America's past, although frank discussion of some things the US has done might help heal some of the more difficult wounds. Regardless of Reverend Wright (who I don't know a lot about nor do I care), America has done a lot of things to other countries that we should be ashamed of - this is not a unique guilt, as other countries have mistreated each other too, but being able to admit the guilt and promise to change can be helpful.
GDwMdfqjaa	"Israeli style"? <br>  <br>  For the past month, ever since a new ceasefire was signed, Israeli towns have been shot at with over 120 rockets. What have you heard so far about what Israel has done in return? Squat. That's "Israeli style" for you. If anything, Israel has a lot to learn from Britain. If Britain was hit with 120 rockets or better yet - 10,000 rockets in 8 years, I can assure you Ireland would be dead-flat. Israel took friggin 8 years of almost daily rocket shooting on its civilians before it finally took a strong step to stop it. Trust me - That's certainly not the style you want Britain to adopt.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that Hamas is the ruling entity in Gaza. For example, when there were 3 suicide bombings in Jerusalem last year, Israel didn't do practically anything.<br>  <br>  And to the guy who mentioned carpet bombing - Get your facts straight.

They focus on the tiny group of women who bed hop.<br>  <br>  2. News media puts on commercials using women winking, flirting or flaunting their body (those women crooning over rubbing the burgers was disgusting) to get men to buy what they want...portraying every woman as easy.<br>  <br>  3. Skinny size 0 women are shown as models, female leads in the top grossing movies, love interests while plump, average, fat women are stuck as the butt of jokes in comedies, somebody's mother, etc.<br>  <br>  4. The media shows the image of women being shallow shopaholics.<br>  <br>  5. Women gossiping about men or about one another on the phone or behind the person's back is the norm.<br>  <br>  6. Women sleeping with 5 guys who aren't their baby's father or supporting guys who just want them for their money is shown often on Maury or on court shows.<br>  <br>  7. Women are shown scantily clad and bringing men down as the "other woman."  Ex:  The "escort" in the Eliot Spitzer case and the women who had affairs with Kobe / John Edwards, the woman in the Duke Lacrosse rape case and Divine Brown's soliciting Hugh Grant.<br>  <br>  I think the media and the news stations have a lot to answer for concerning the condition of America's youth and the older generation who are also trying to do these things to "remain young."

94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	Wall street. What I've been reading aside from the news lately has me wondering about the fall of wall street.<br>  It seems to me that the "elite" of the world are in control and as far as they are concerned the wall street debacle is good for them. Once it's over the elite who are currently controlling the strings will be able to go over and sift through the rubble and ashes for the precious silver and gold they want so much. <br>  With a global economic collapse these men and a few women will have the funds and the ability to engage in a huge power shift from nations to global government.<br>  It sounds fantastic and paranoid but God knows it scares the bejeebies out of me! Mainly because the sources of all my information comes from legitimate sites on the internet and I'm not one to be taken so easily. I'm hoping this crash and burn of the global economy is not part of the elite's plan. I'm hoping this is paranoia but frankly? <br>  I don't see that at all. What I see are the strings of the nations being pulled by a select few who stand to gain enormously by the failure of the stock markets and Wall street is the main one they have attacked. <br>  What's happening now is the culmination of decades of hard work and subterranean planning by some very evil creatures that live amongst us.<br>  Anyways ...
