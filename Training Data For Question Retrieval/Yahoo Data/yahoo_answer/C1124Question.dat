20090223075124AAHOKmD	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Is my nose to hard to get pierced?	So here is the situation. I'm 17 now and when I was about 7 years old my nose was bitten by a dog and was literally hanging from my face. A plastic surgeon was called in to reattach my nose. The scar isn't visable and nose nose is perfectly normal looking but my concern is that I really want to get my nose pierced but my nose is very rough even so long after the surgery.    It's only the nostril of the one side of the one side of my nose I want pierced that's harder then the other side. I have a monroe piercing so I wanted to get my nose pierced on the opposite side not the same side.. Would this cause complications at all? or does it really matter how thick or rough one side is?

20090223081005AA3k993	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Why are people so skeptical of tattoos?	I know most people argue that 'you'll regret it when you're old and wrinkly!"    But I think I'd regret it more if I went my whole life stifling my style so that I'll be more granny-ish in my golden years.    And, ya know, I have not met one tattooed senior that really regretted it.    I mean, face it, when you're old and wrinkly, it's not like you're going to go around flashing your flesh as much as you do in your younger years.    Also, tattoos aren't /completely/ permanent.       I don't believe you should get a tattoo of just anything, and I don't think you should put them just about everywhere if you are planning on having a job that might be affected by them. But otherwise... why not?

20090223080635AAzgeha	Beauty & Style;Hair	What do these actresses do with their hair?	I am half black, half white. My hair is currently relaxed. After I wash it, I blow dry it and flat iron it. I tried also having some color a few years ago but it left my hair way too damaged. The following actresses are  of mixed race, I want to know how they get their hair to look so healthy and nice.      Rashida Jones:  http://www.exposay.com/celebrity-photos/...       Does she have a relaxer or just flat iron it? I can't even get my hair to look that nice with a relaxer.      Nicole Ritchie:  http://www.staralicious.com/wp-content/u...       Her hair is dyed, so I'm curious as to whether or not she has a relaxer as well. I can't imagine how her hair looks that great with both. Mine would look like straw.      Jessica Szohr:  http://i227.photobucket.com/albums/dd276...       I'm pretty sure she just blow dries and flat irons, because the roots don't look relaxed. But of the three, her hair looks the least nice.

20090223082329AAIUQ6a	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Is there any way to stop a belly button piercing from rejecting?	3 and a half months old and it was doing fine I wash it with Dial soap everyday and do sea salt soaks every other day, sometimes just a few times a week if im lazy that week lol, but now I noticed there is less skin that the piercing actually goes through, but its not red, doesn't hurt, and just a little bit of lymph, which is normal for up to 6 months and crusties but thats normal too.      So I either think it's rejecting or migrating, i know if it migrates you can stop that but what about if it's rejecting?      How do I know weather it's rejecting or migrating?      If it is rejecting/migrating do you think that in a couple weeks when it's four months old if I switched to a bioplastic ring that might help?

Hey guys,   You can probably guess from the heading of my question that im a bit annoyed by my hair :@ lol,   So heres the thing; naturally, my hair is quite curly - but not extremely curly. Also, the side bits at the front go puffy. I straighten my hair and I straighten them with GHD's and I use Tresemme heat protection spray. After straightening my hair, it stays straight. But the moment I go outside, the side bits go really puffy and wont lie flat and my hair goes go 'unti-flat'. Its so annoying because every one else at school has really nice flat hair that stays straight, and then theres me - the girl with the puffy hair (lol). But the weird thing is that the back stays straight, its just the side bits =/   I don't use any other products on my hair, but i do use shampoo, conditioner and i deep condition my hair to.   So my question is, is there a way to keep my hair straight? Any tips will be well appreciated and any suggestions on products would be great :) (I like in the UK)   Thank you so much, you don'tknow how much I mean this because im sick off looking like a poodle (lol)   & I promise to give away 10 points :)

I need to shopping this afternoon, because I forgot until yesterday that I was told to get a slip with my wedding dress      My wedding dress is princess satin, empire waist, A-line skirt, princess seams (armhole princess seams). I was doing some research, and apparently it doesn't work to wear a form-fitting slip with a looser skirt. Would I want a tight slip or a loose one? Am I ok if I just pick one that has a similar line as the skirt?      Sorry for the cross post, but I needed an answer quickly.

20090223084148AACh6Nz	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What should I wear to a NYC nightclub in winter?	I'm planning on going to Webster Hall in NYC this weekend and I'm not sure what to wear. I'm 20 years old, 5'11" average weight (not skinny, but def not fat either. Normal I guess lol) with long brown hair. I'm not sure what to wear just because it's february and still cold out, if it were summer I'm sure I'd be fine. I've just never gone to a club in the wintertime (I went to a few in Mexico, but that's kind of different lol). I'd rather not wear heels because they're uncomfortable to dance in, and I'm already really tall. Any suggestions? I want to wear my black flats but not sure what to wear them with. I want to look good, definately not skanky, but cute/sexy. Also, does anyone know if Webster Hall has a coat check? Pictures would be helpful, but I'd be more than happy with just written advice. Thank you!!

Preferably I want one that you can use on wet hair. The straight iron that I have now doesn't work well. Please tell me a brand and where to get one. Thanks!

20090223084645AAf5mEf	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair breaking off from overbleaching and dying!?	I dyed my hair black, and to get it back to my natural blonde I had to go to the salon and have it stripped/bleached a total of 6 times and toned three different times in the course of a month. I have very stubborn hair! Anyway, now it is breaking off a lot. I had the damaged ends trimmed away at the salon, but I still notice hair breakage. My hair is just above the shoulders. I use matrix biolage conditioner and leave it in my hair overnight, and I use the repair spray. I even use a proteing treatment on my hair, but i still get breakage (especially when it is wet.) It is porous and gummy when it is wet as well. Should I just cut it real short in a pixie and start over? My hair is wavy. Also, if it is cut in a short pixie and I want to grow it back out, would i have to get regular trims? The salon said it's damaged, but not bad enought to need to hack it all off. But I'm still frustrated with it. If I trim it regularly, how is it going to grow past my shoulders? I'm thinking about an audrey hepburn type of pixi or a kiera knightley type. (I know ... it's short) Will this get rid of all the damage? My bangs get quiet wavy/curly, so I don't know if it will suit me or not. My face is sort of ovalish/round and my build is petite/small framed.       I don't have any recent photos of my shoulder length light blonde hair, but here is a photo of me taken about 12 months ago when it was long. (it was orangey because I had bleached it back than and it was brassy, but wasn't as damaged because I had only bleached it once) I also posted a pic of me with long, dark brown hair and with black hair. I'm never touching it with chemicals, again by the way! (i learned the hard way). Do you think a pixie cut would fit me?       http://i263.photobucket.com/albums/ii151...        http://i263.photobucket.com/albums/ii151...        http://i263.photobucket.com/albums/ii151...        http://i263.photobucket.com/albums/ii151...

20090223065003AA5VDcH	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Nose piercing infection?	Well, I got my nose pierced a while ago and I've gotten these bumps on and off. I just got rid of one and now I have another. I think it's the stud in my nose and I think I should change it back to the original one, the one that I got it pierced with because I had no problems with that one.    What I need to know is if I can change it while it's infected. It took me forever to get rid of the last one and it barely went away before I got another one. I'm worried it'll scare and get that dark circle that I've read about.    So what I need to know is if I can take out the stud and put in the other ring safely. I know it'll hurt because I stupidly put in a stud and not one of those L bend ones. So, can I change it now or do I need to wait until the swelling goes down?

I'm thinking of getting it in between my shoulder blades, unless anyone can suggest anything better? I don't want a "tramp stamp" or anything on my arms at this point in time.

20090223110927AAB60lO	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Should I go to New York? Chorale Trip?	Ok we (the chorale) are going on a trip to New York City. I'm really debating on whether or not I should go... We will go to the statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Central Park, etc. The main reason I DON'T wanna go is because of 5th avenue... Like the whole school chorale is rich kids & I'm not :/ I'll probably get $150 and that's it.... I'm sure all of the rich kids will be lugging all of these bags around with their fancy stuff in them & I'll be lucky if I could get a T-Shirt in New York for $150 lol overexaggeration, but you get me. Should I go & feel really humiliated about myself or stay at home & fake sick?      I mean I'll probably never get another chance to go to New York, but I'd rather stay at home & avoid everyone asking me "why aren't you buying anything? This is New York?" & then laughing.... This same thing happened to a friend of mine on a French trip, & she was devistated she advises me not to go...
