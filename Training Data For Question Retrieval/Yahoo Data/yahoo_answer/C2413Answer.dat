FrnK6Vxwaa	you should probably try New world  its a art college in miami and it has an excellent dance program. My dance teacher actually studied modern there and she's the best teacher i've ever had, check it out.|`|b8IA5ly7aa	seriously majoring in dance is a waste of money......if you can dance you can dance you shouldnt have to shell out thousands in tuition money to get a dance degree. When you audition they dont care if you went to college or not, as long as your good.  I suggest majoring in something that you can use in life and dance on the side or invest your time and effort into auditioning.

pQGUPITeaa	No - I'd say there are no laws now except ones you make yourself.    And actually it's legal to have sex with girls under 18 in many places in the world right now.|`|KcHhLsCAaa	For me, it would depend on "how much under 18."  If you are talking like a 6 yaer old, then certainly not.  If you are talking about a 16 year old, then perhaps.   You could always wait several years until she was more mature.        But my question would be, what does it all matter if you were the last two people on earth?|`|AA11079786	No. Just wait a few years; it's not like any once else is going to take her first.|`|Kl56NSmLaa	Heterosexual age of consent in the UK is 16. What's your point? It doesn't matter if you or I 'consider' something is illegal, the law is the law.|`|9keaUCDdaa	Well seeing as we would be the last people on earth, there would be no law.    So it would be a moral issue for the two people involved *shrug*    If the girl gave consent then sure, why not?|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	In I Am Legend, the Will Smith character isn't really the last man on earth -- he is actually the monster who butchers the other people who he thinks are vampires.  To them, he is the monster, or the legend.  That's why it is called I Am Legend.  Since vampires are now people and Will Smith is the monster, then for Will Smith to hook up with anyone it would be a kind of bestiality, so that would probably be illegal under new humanity's law.|`|l2IYzaWPaa	what if she's really ugly too? or morbidly obese? or retarded? or a one legged lesbian midget? you're kinda outta options here.plus you don't have any friends left to make fun of you for doing her!|`|AA11635601	This is a profound question that could well take up a week in any college classroom.    First, it denudes the law into its essence which is - it is what we say it is.  So you and she would be the law makers.  That said, morality is NOT a decision of man, it is a real, separate thing, even though it exists IN man.  So you two could legalize dope, say, or speeding, but you could not legalize rape or murder.  It would still cave in your guts if you did it and ever tried to think of yourself as a decent guy.  But underage, sex - questionable.  Certainly nature meant for females to become sexually capable when their bodies change and they begin to menstruate, which is way younger than "legal" age, so the "natural legal age" would probably be when they begin to menstruate, or about what, 12 or 13.    Then there's yet another deep embedded issue, which is, her permission.  Is she a child, subject to your will as an adult?  If so, then sex is probably not ok.  Do you treat her as an equal, whose permission is needed?  Then ok.    And finally, I think all such couples would hook up, regardless, so we'd have to acknowledge that too.    Good question.|`|zxhppf3Caa	Asking "is this illegal" is entirely different from asking "is this moral" or "is this ethical"    Would this be illegal? Are the laws still on the books?      As the last two people on Earth, are the two of you choosing to live by the laws left over from society?  What is important to remember is that just because there is no one to enforce a law doesn't mean it isn't a law.    Would this be immoral? Would this be unethical?     Did you adhere to the law before the doomsday event? Are both willing to procreate?  Is it now your duty to procreate?  Do you have the means to care for you offspring?|`|FVDhYH6Baa	No  we're the last people on earth  therefore its anarchy- no laws no rules  that is just illegal according to american society  especially if you need to procreate, no it is not illegal at all.|`|hG9e4nNLaa	If you were the last two on the planet, then there would be no one to enforce the law upon you, so no.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Who would stop you?

You Will need to do them everyday, at least 4 or 5 different stretches, some of the easier ones are:    cross one leg in front of your body then stretch the other leg behind you  hold for 8 seconds then switch legs    Stretch one leg out as far as you can on your side, i.e. right leg would have the right foot pointing away from the body. put the left leg directly in front of you then reach for you right foot.    Put your feet together in front of you in a mock cross then hold your toes and push your knees toward the ground with your elbows (i am doing this one right now as a type its so easy, can touch the chair with my knees without my elbows Lil    Stand stright up and get on your tiptoes, reach for the roof then lean all the way day, letting each vertebrae loosen as you go one by one. Once you are as far down as comfortable, slightly bop up and down, this loosens your calfs and thighs and makes it easier for you to reach lower each time.    Do not attempt the splits unless youve been doing all of these and maybe some other stretches for at least 8 seconds on each leg or 16 sedonds for the stretches that do not require alternation for a fortnight.    GOOD LUCK = ) I HOPE THIS HELPS|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	Until it hurts. Keep doing it until you can increase the length of time you can tolerate the pain.

uJBnZWtcaa	Buy Wacom.  There are other brands but Wacom is the standard.    What you buy depends on what you plan to do with it.  If you've been painting for years and plan to use the tablet with Painter, then go for Intuos.  It supports pen angle and will give you more of the feel of a real brush.    If you're photo editing or just want to try out some digital painting, save yourself a bunch of $$$ and buy the Bamboo.  The Bamboo Fun is the same tablet and pen but it comes with a mouse and with Photoshop Elements and Painter Essentials.  These are good, fun programs but the versions that usually come with the tablet are a little old - Elements 5 and Painter Essentials 3.  If you find a Bamboo Fun with Elements 6 (7 is the current version) and Painter Essentiasls 4, then buy it.    Size: Don't get one that's two big.  I have a 6X8 Intuos and an old 4X5 Graphire.  I usually use the Graphire.  You have to move your hand around the area of the tablet.  If you get one that's too big, you'll feel like you're leading an orchestra, like you're waving your hand all over the place;-)  Since this is your first one, keep it kind of small.    It'll take a week to get used to the tablet.  Play some solitaire.  Draw squiggly lines.  You have to remember to look at the monitor and not at the tablet.  Once you're used to using it, you'll never go back to a mouse.
LsLTIER5aa	Aw that's cute that you want to impress her! My first boyfriend did the same as you! But turned out to make a fool of himself but you know what I didn't care because a girl is supp used to like you for who you are no matter how geeky, cheesy, clumsy ETC, I'll try to give you the best advice possible!                                                              Slow Dance   Find someone to dance with. You can't slow dance alone, at least not without looking, well, slow. If you brought a date, you'll probably want to ask him or her to dance. If not, find a partner. Set the mood by looking that person in the eyes when you ask him or her to dance.   Get your partner on the dance floor. Escort your partner to the dance floor slowly and smoothly. If you're already on the dance floor, the key here may be to keep yourself and your partner on the dance floor--no easy task if one or both of you is nervous about slow dances. If your partner is nervous, tell him or her that there's nothing to worry about, and be understanding if he or she doesn't want to dance. If you're nervous, don't show it.   Assume the position. Face your partner, standing so that your head is about a foot or two away from his or hers. Standing toe-to-toe may not be the optimal position. Some couples stand offset, with each person's right foot inside the other persons pair; some partners may have the woman's feet to the inside of the man's. If you are a teen you can always place both hands on the girl's hip (if you're a man.) and if you are a girl place both arms around his neck.   Assess your relationship with your partner. Akk! You need to know where to put your hands and how close to dance. This doesn't need to be awkward. Keep in mind that the right-hand-left-hand directions here can be reversed if you are both more comfortable that way.      To be safe the man should put his right hand on his partner's left hip (the side of the hip, Romeo) and his left hand should gently grasp his partner's right hand and hold it up at about shoulder-level (of the taller partner) so that both partners' arms are bent upward from the elbow. The woman's left arm will generally be placed on her partner's shoulder. This is a traditional ballroom dancing position (as well as a safe junior high dancing position), and you should still be standing about a foot from your partner.   If you're closer with your partner, very much in love or something like that, the man should gently pull the woman close to him and either put his right hand on her hip as above, or place it on the small of her back. The left hand may hold her hand as above or, for a very close dance, may be placed on her upper back. If at any time the woman pulls away or seems uncomfortable with how the man is holding her, he should step back and revert to the safe position. The woman may also initiate the closer dance position with the same caveat that if her partner feels uncomfortable she should revert to the position above. Either partner may also bring the other closer by clasping their hands - ladies behind his neck, men behind her waist.   Begin to move. Traditionally, the man leads the dance and the woman follows his movement. This is still generally true, but not always. If you are leading, simply guide your partner by subtly pushing or pulling her right hand (assuming you are holding it in your left hand) in the direction you want to go. Movements should be slow and smooth, and you need not move very much. You can follow a set dance form, such as a waltz or foxtrot, or you can simply transfer your weight back and forth from right foot to left foot without moving much at all. To vary, move or rotate, slightly lift the foot your weight is not on and slide that foot a little forward, back, or sideways. If you are moving your foot, your partner will need to compliment your action: as the leader moves his right foot backward, for example, his partner should mover her left foot forward. forwards.)   Follow the music. Your steps should move roughly in time to the beat of the music so that you make a step every beat or so. This is not as hard as it might sound since the music will most likely be slow during a slow dance.   Interact with your partner. For most of us, a slow dance is more about being close to your partner and getting to know each other than it is about moving. Feel free to talk to your partner, to look into his or her eyes and, if the situation is appropriate, to steal a kiss or two. If you're both in a romantic mood, you may draw each other closer as the dance progresses.   Thank your partner for the dance. Whether you're dancing with your wife of 60 years or someone you've never met before, thank your partner. You won't lead someone on with a simple "Thanks for the dance."   Continue to the next dance or retreat gracefully. Once you're comfortable with slow dances, you might not want to flee the floor as quickly as possible--one dance is just the beginning. If, however, you've had enough|`|M1OceGNLaa	Awwww...that's so cute.  Since you're only in junior high, it's likely that not very many people will know how to dance. Just move with the music, and when all else fails, do what everybody else is doing.

7VpDEkC6aa	If you have the ability to play the guitar, then learning either type of guitar won't be too hard.  It does take time to learn how to do it right, however.  Actually, since all guitars use the same notes and chords and techniques, the electric is actually a bit kinder to your fingers than an acoustic. Acoustics can be very stiff and hard to play, whereas the electric guitar has strings that are a bit more flexible and can be adjusted to get as close to the fretboard as they can without getting "fret buzz"  The other person is right about the tips of you fingers, they will get sore when you first start to play.     That guitar should be a good one to start with, it's not a bad guitar at all.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	First of all, Emily the Strange is amazing.    Second: They say that you should learn acoustic first.  I think it's because you have to press down harder on acoustic strings and you'll form callouses faster and all that jazz.      If you're absolutely sure, I mean 100% positive that you will not give up/break the guitar, then I suppose you could the the Emily the Strange one.  I would, still, suggest that you get a beginner acoustic guitar and then buy the other one if you're sure you're going to stick with it.    Also, things you may want to purchase: picks (they're wicked cheap), a tuner (so you don't have to play out of tune), a case...I can't think of anything else, but I might later.  Good luck!|`|RKOzbNLdaa	No, it just like learning the acoustic. The only thing is that at first it hurts your fingers allot because they have to get us to pushing so hard on the strings.

Ballet is good for learning things like pointed toes, strength in arms and legs, and how to control your body when you are dancing. But if you are aiming to go for hip hop, i recommend you start a disco class. This would include disco freestyle, street, hip-hop, slow and rock 'n' roll. This would able you to compete in street and hip hop in competitions along with other  styles of dancing  Hope this helped!,,x  (:|`|FrnK6Vxwaa	Yes, ballet is the basis of dancing you will learn a LOT in ballet. once you have taken ballet classes every other type of dance will come to you very easily|`|5wvQEohpaa	Ballet is the basis for all dancing-- except hip hop.    For jazz and tap, ballet with give you balance. It will teach you to turn out and point your feet. You will be able to turn without getting dizzy. You will get strength and flexibility.    Jazz is the basis for hip hop.    But, ballet is the true basic. So I suggest trying that. Then do hip hop with jazz.     Hope I helped!!|`|ha5mEbBTaa	I do hip hop lyrical and breakdance  and although my breakdance teacher is against  all sorts of ballet stuff    my lyrical and hip hop teachers  use "ballet french" every class    it depends what kind of dance you want to do  You need to know basic lingo such as postions  like first, second, fifth, and so one  and releve and pose     But you don't need to nessasarily start with ballet  because depending on what kind of dance you wanna do  you might just need a basic understanding
qXAvXHdYaa	Backgrounds go by a few different names, based on the material they are made from.    They are:    MUSLIN - a softer, cotton like material that can be solid colors, designs or painted on.  CANVAS - same as muslin except the fabric is courser, much like denim.  Sometimes the same thickness or less thick than denim.  CHROMAKEY - a solid color backdrop, normally blue or green.  When it is evenly illuminated, it allows for easy extraction of the subject from the frame and a digital background to be put in its place via Photoshop or some other image editing software.

zRFvk96Eaa	I would consider you above average and encourage you to do some research into perspective and anatomy. From the work you have there it shows a good sense of proportion and shape. You also show a creative flair when it comes to color particularly in image 6.      What you need to improve on are the structural parts. Your images are flat. Practice exersizes that encourage depth of field. like drawing fields of basic shapes, cubes, spheres, cones, and practice shading them simply. Look into proper shading techniques, core shadows, reflected light - things of that nature.      Here is my genaric 'how to improve your drawing' answer I think it will be helpful    1. Get a sketch book and some pens (various types to see what you like) Go somewhere, (anywhere, park, mall, subway, soccer field) Sketch from LIFE!!! This is the best exercise you can do by far. Do quick sketches of what people are doing, Don't worry about details or outlines, heck, use a crayon. Draw lots of gestures, are they sitting, standing, leaning. What leg are they resting their weight on, what way are their shoulders tilted, are they tall and thin, are they short and fat.  you want to work quickly, while trying to incorporate as many things you know as you can. This will help with showing movement, proportions, mood, and general drawing.  Don't worry if everything looks terrible at first, gotta start somewhere right!.  2. Practice Proportions  just spending time practicing proportions is a good way to put them in your mind and eventually your sub-conscious.  Find as much info as you can about proportions, there are 2 main systems, the head-system (a person is 8 heads high) and the 5 eye box system {(the one I prefer), the head is 5 eyes wide, from the top of the head to the pit of the neck is 2, 5 eye boxes) Find these and practice drawing from them. Memorize important land marks, the half way point of the body , how long are the arms, legs etc... There's lots of stuff out there to look up.    3. Learn perspective, 1,2,3 point, curvilinear and atmospheric. Start with 1 and work your way up. Perspective is essential to drawing anything. It helps create depth and realism in any image. Start out by drawing cubes cylinders and various other simple forms, and then start breaking more complex objects down, a bike is just a series of cylinders. A hand is a box with cylinders for fingers.    4. Anatomy. this one's kind of advanced but is essential. Practice drawing skeletons, this will help with your posing, and proportions. Then move onto drawing the muscles. If you know your bones and muscles you can draw a person doing absolutely anything.|`|pbqsiqt2aa	I really like your dragon and lighthouse ones|`|ygimTNzoaa	You're OK. No where near good enough to make money, keep practicing and maybe you'll get somewhere. I'm 23 but I pretty much hit the peak of my drawing abilities when I was about 16, so if you don't notice yourself getting any better maybe that's all you can do. Here's my art if you were interested. Maybe just MAYBE I could get better if I had more patience, I don't have the patience to spend much more then 3 hours on a drawing, and I hate coming back to it, so most of my unfinished work will probably stay unfinished. I didn't have any art classes per se. I say take a drafting class, though it may not interest you it teaches you much in the way of scale and perfection, you have tools to work with which proves to be useful and teaches you things that I'm sure they wouldn't teach you in art. So, just a suggestion, try out a drafting class.

jRWYVZ5vaa	After winning at Hastings, William waited for a formal surrender of the English throne, but the Witenagemot proclaimed the quite young Edgar ?theling King instead, though without coronation. Thus, William's next target was London, approaching through the important territories of Kent, via Dover and Canterbury, inspiring fear in the English. However, at London, William's advance was beaten back at London Bridge, and he decided to march westward and to storm London from the northwest. After receiving continental reinforcements, William crossed the Thames at Wallingford, and there he forced the surrender of Archbishop Stigand (one of Edgar's lead supporters), in early December. William reached Berkhamsted a few days later where ?theling relinquished the English crown personally and the exhausted Saxon noblemen of England surrendered definitively. Although William was acclaimed then as English King, he requested a coronation in London. As William I, he was formally crowned on Christmas day 1066, in Westminster Abbey, by Archbishop Aldred.

AA11635601	Bravo for asking!  Most younger ppl have no idea of the resources walking quietly all around them.    My advice would overwhelmingly be this one thing:  as it turns out, love is CENTRAL to us, to our happiness, to everything.  Devote yourself to the finding, and care of, love.  It is more important than everything else put together.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Your not that old.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Use the "life+decryption+key" as soon, and as much as you can.

It really does fly by as you get older.    2. Never take for granted that you can move every part of your body without stiffness and pain.  Run and jump and bend those knees!    3. When you're young, feel blessed that you can look forward to things that will happen in 20 or 30 years.  When you're older, celebrate all that you've done with your life.  And, for Heaven's sake, don't skip over all the little things that are so easy to ignore.  They're what fill up most of our time and give spice to our lives.    4. Say "Hi" and smile when you can.  Give a kind word to the people you see all the time, like the folks at the grocery.  These little things are what the others in your life will remember about you and love you for.    5. Appreciate your life every minute of every year, at every age.  When you can no longer do what you did at 30, do something else.  Being alive is a trip on the opportunity bus.  Age tells you when to change gears;-)      6. Don't get bogged down in the things that don't matter.  If you must ask "Why was I born?", then answer "Because....."  and realize that "because" is the only answer anyone can give.  Each of our lives is important in ways that we'll never know.  It's part of the mystery of life.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	I am 16 years old but I am not the typical type of teenager so that doesn't stop me from giving you advice on life. My advice would be for you to abstain from hedonistic pleasures and find something pure and natural to satisfy you. Maybe have faith in God and you will know what your true purpose of being in existence is. I am sorry that you didn't have any parents while growing up. The others have posted good advices for you so I don't have to say anymore. But just don't get influenced by the pleasures in today's society. Hang around with nature for it's purity.|`|2UnjeOQUaa	I wish I could advise people. I wish I could tell them how to be happy, successful, caring, forgiving, and content. But with all my knowledge, a blessed and charmed life, I have learned one thing. We would like others to learn from our mistakes, but we forget that the only way we learned was through our own. So my only advice; fear nothing and anything you want can be yours.
r9s0VyJgaa	It looks like a fine beginner guitar for a young child. However, he's only 2, and it might be too big for him to hold comfortably right now.    Keep in mind that he won't have the attention span or the fine motor coordination to actually learn to play guitar for another few years.  If he loves music, that's great -- but realize that right now his interest in the guitar will be mostly just holding it and playing "with" it.  So I certainly wouldn't get anything better or more expensive.    FWIW, my nephew also loves music. I play guitar and banjo and every time I go visit him and his parents, I have to bring either my guitar or banjo (or both) and play for him :-)  When he was 2 1/2, I bought him an inexpensive soprano ukulele with nylon strings (a Rogue, purchased from Musicians Friend).  In his hands, it was the right size to be a guitar, and that's how he thought of it -- it was his "guitar".  He didn't notice or care that it only had 4 strings instead of 6.  He would take it everywhere with him, and when I came to visit, he would "play" along with me while I played my banjo or guitar.  He loved it!  He's now 4, and has outgrown the uke, but friends of my brother and sister-in-law gave him a half-size guitar.  He still doesn't have the attention span to sit still for music lessons for more than about 5 minutes at a time, though, so I think my brother and sister-in-law will probably wait another 2 or 3 years until they actually start him off on lessons.  Meantime, he has fun playing **with** his guitar.    So you might want to consider getting your 2 year old an inexpensive uke to play with for right now, and keep the half-size 6-string guitar for when he's 5 or 6 or so and his hands are bigger.|`|Stwj8CRmaa	If he is just starting out yes it would be and he could advance up and up by guitars and he'll get better and better by the guitars he has to play or use .    as he grows up he can move up to a student guitar and play it and learn off of it but that is good starter one tho .|`|cJQtcpDjaa	Son u look like u 18 or 19 But ill say if he like rock ibanez or fender squire  if he like metal or hardcore rock ill say epiphone Les Paul you don't want to spend a lot of money because it kinda hard to play but for younger kids ill say buy a acoustic guitar with the softer strings because the strings hurt your finger when you fret|`|aw2xkdSbaa	What flabbergasts me is that no one so far thinks this is a bad idea. A 2 year old with a guitar? It is not age appropriate.  A guitar is not a toy and a 2 year old lacks the mental capacity to comprehend what it is to  play the guitar. This does not even take into consideration the sharp, taut or delicate parts. Not a dig by any means, but just pointing out the obvious.|`|13ef8a5ce4c06ca56c3e52bc29e23610aa	I have to agree with Slave to the Grind.

You should get him a nylon stringed guitar. the strings are much softer and easier for young fingers to play. Steel strings (especially on cheap guitars) can be VERY hard to play. I bought a $200 Fender Steel stringed guitar once , and even though I'm a professional guitarist who been playing for like 30 yrs at the time, it hurt my fingers to play it.  I started playing guitar at 8 and learned on a 3/4 sized nylon stringed guitar. So since he's much smaller, he'll need the 1/2 size. ( I think they even make 1/4 size guitars)    one guitar on Amazon that would work is this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Hohner-Folk-Guitar...    click on the Tags on the bottom of  the page for "childs's guitar (2)"    There are a bunch of other nylon stringed "classical" guitars for kids. I wouldn't get a "toy" guitar, though. Some of them don't really "tune" that  well.    Hohner is an OK company. Of course these are all cheap guitars, so the quality isn't the best, but the Hohner (if it survives a few years) would be good for him until he's 7 or 8.  there's one really nice child guitar but it's like 80 bucks, so I don't think that'd be appropriate at this time.    Starting him out early is a great idea. My parents got me into stage acting and music when I was 8 back in the 60's and I loved it and have been involved with both my entire life.

HJaVcUGwaa	The seed of this conflict was planted in 1882 when the Zionist movement started with a group of secular European Jews to establish a homeland for the Jews in Palestine. Up to the 1930's, Jews lived in peace with Muslims and Christians in Palestine for about 1300 years (except when the European Crusaders killed all the Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem 900 years ago). Most of the Jews who lived in Palestine till then were Arabs.    When Britain occupied Palestine during WWI, they gave a declaration (Balfour Declaration 1917) to the Jews that they will give them a homeland in Palestine. There was one big problem however: the land already was populated by indigenous Arabs (Mostly Muslim, but with significant Christian 6% and Jewish minorities 10%).    Britain opened the door to Jewish immigration from Europe, which escalated during WWII and after because of the Holocaust. In 1948 the Jews made up 33% of the population of Palestine, but owned only 5% of the land. The UN voted to split Palestine 55% for the Jews and 45% for the Palestinians to establish a Jewish and Arab States in Palestine, and to make Jerusalem an internationally controlled area. War broke out between the Arabs and Jews in 1948 and the Jews occupied nearly 80% of Palestine and established Israel on it. In the process Israel ethnically cleansed 80% of the Palestinians from the land they occupied and destroyed and depopulated more than 400 Palestinian villages, massacred thousands of Palestinians and made 3/4 million Palestinians refugees.    The UN voted in 1948 (Security Council Res. 93 and General Assembly Res. 194) to tell Israel to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, but until today Israel never complied. In 1967 Israel militarily occupied the remainder of Palestine (The West Bank and the Gaza Strip). The Security Council again voted in 1967 and 1973 that Israel return to the 1967 borders and allow the refugees to return, but Israel never complied (Security Council Res. 237, 242, 338).    This gives you a brief history of the roots of the problem. The Palestinians now negotiate to get only the lands occupied in 1967 back to establish their own state on it, and for Israel to allow the deposed people in 1948 and 1967 to return to their original homes.    Israel is only accepting to return only parts of the lands occupied in 1967. The land they accept to return has no borders with the outside world (making it an effective jail guarded by the Israelis). They also refuse to allow the refugees to return. They also have built many illegal settlements in the West Bank and planted nearly 350,000 Israeli extremists in them. Israel has taken control of nearly 5/6 of the water resources in the West Bank, and has built an apartheid wall that dwarfs the Berlin wall around and through Palestinian cities and villages in the West Bank ( http://chromovision.com/films/Wall.wmv ). They also refuse to return East Jerusalem, which is part of the West Bank, to the Palestinians.    Again this is a very brief background. It in no way describes the daily suffering, abuse, humiliation, terror and deprivation of basic human rights the Israelis inflict on the Palestinians.    You can get more information from Wikipedia in the link below:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_pale...|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	During World War II, Hitler did his best to wipe out the Jews. He killed 6 million while the rest of the world said "Gosh, that's too bad".    After the war, Jewish people took over what was then Palestine and is now Israel, by force of arms. The Jews used to live there. Cherokees used to live in Georgia. If     1) The USA was 50 independent countries,     2) A dictator in Texas wiped out as many Cherokees as he could    3) All the Cherokees in Oklahoma, California, Texas, etc. took Georgia back from the white and black people who are there now, by force of arms,     That would be a reasonably parallel situation. not exact, but the best I can do.    Many of the Arabs fled. Others were pushed out. Some still live there.     The Jews are not going to give back the land they re-took, any more than the USA is going to give Texas back to the Mexicans. (The USA took Texas, California and those little desert states between them from Mexico by force of arms in 1848.)    What Israel is going to do is have the best army in the world, man for man, and give anyone who tries to wipe them out again the sensation of being thrown naked into a room full of rabid wolverines.    So, there are two groups with strong claims to one land. Whose claim is stronger depends on who you ask. they have been fighting over it since 1948.  Israel has atomic bombs. The Arab states are working on them. Sooner or later one is going to be used.  If it is used by Arabs against Jews, see above, "thrown naked into a room full of rabid wolverines."     There have been wars in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973. There have been low-level conflicts since 1945.|`|EfGtYg4eaa	One is muslim and one isn't.

The Jews and Arabs would fight and whatnot, but the real problem came with the Israeli Independence. Arabs didn't much like it, so an Arab coalition Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt (probably missing one) attacked. The Israelis won out and the area was partitioned into two territories, Israel and two Arab blocks (Gaza and West Bank). Over three more subsequent wars (all initiated by the Arabs, with the exception of the Six Day War of '67, whereby Israel attacked troops massing on their borders first) the Arab states lost land to Israel, and Israel wound up giving most of it back in exchange for peace. That's the short of it, you'd need a good book to go into more detail.|`|0kjWE73qaa	In the Bible, God gave the Israeli Jews the Holy Land, which is mainly Israel and Jerusalem. A few hundred years later, Muslim invaders called Palestinians conquered Israel and drove the Jews out. In the 1940's, however, the UN created the state of Israel and let the Jews come back in. The Palestinians were placed in two small parts of Israel called te West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Now, the Palestinians argue that the Israel is their land and want it back.     A controversial solution to the problem was put forth by President Dubya Bush called the Road Map to Peace. It states that Israel has to move some settlements out of Palestinian areas such as the West Bank, and the Palestinians have to stop terrorism. Then they would divide Jerusalem in half and give the Palestinians one half and the Jews the other. This plan was never put into effect and the conflict still resides today.

K60FfiIfaa	You already have some good answers here, so I'll just add a little bit.  Prior to Augustus, Rome was in chaos from civil war and a republican government that was so prone to infighting, greed and class warfare that it simply could no longer deal with the problems of the day.  Augustus ended the Republic and replaced it with the Empire, concentrating supreme power in the emperor, thereby ending all sources of infighting.  He then when on to institute a series of reforms to deal with the other problems.  His rule was long and successful, and it started the Pax Romana which, which brought almost two centuries of peace and prosperity to Rome.|`|AA10729675	There is a saying that goes: "Augustus found a city made of bricks and left it made out of marble."  So, he embellished the city of Rome, and his empire.    But mostly he created what he called the Pax Romana, or Roman peace.  It was a program made of tolerance and of security for people within the empire.  It encouraged commerce on safe roads by land as well as by sea; it encouraged arts and intellectual activities (poetry, theater).  He managed to feed the people in his empire, and to make Rome clean.    He reinforced the frontiers of his empire.  He went back to good morals or at least tried to have people go back to good morals, like in Ancient Rome.    That he did, and he is known to have done.    But he was helped by good and valuable men like Agrippa.  He was lucky enough that there was no plague in his time. And his generosity toward the people came from all the plunders from other countries.|`|Oct9Pv9Jaa	Died|`|sjMIFH9Faa	Augustus actually had a list of all his accomplishments made.

n99NOgHJaa	A HA ! I have come up with a plan !!!   So this sounds kinda odd and maybe I am just being random here but this is what I would do !    first get a sponge ( like the sometimes when you first start out) and cut it to the size of her chin rest then get a small piece of cloth and a elastic band. Put the sponge on your chin rest and attach the cloth on top with the elastic band. ( Just make sure you aren't compromising how you hold you violin !)    So when your at your lesson make sure you DON'T have your sponge and stuff on it. Let him tune then say " oh I forgot the cloth" and put it on covering up his gross mess on the chin rest. This way you can practice knowing that there is a cloth and a sponge separating your chin from the ickyness.    I don't know how you should clean it , violins are very delicate.    And if all else fails just either talk to your teacher , or get a new one. If you are that distracted by it you can't be learning as fast as you would normally.|`|SsaT5VITaa	Here is a tried and true method:    Take a soft microfiber cloth and rub some hand sanitizer on the cloth. Use the cloth to wipe down the chinrest without touching the actual violin (it may damage the varnish of your violin). You can also do this with your pegs and fingerboard.|`|C5gv5bJ5aa	Oh, I'm so sorry! Here is what I recommend: For now, use a small wet cloth with a little bit of liquid hand soap on it. Since the chin rest is plastic, it shouldn't hurt it. Just try not to get it on the wood. Then, since the rest may seem a little dirty too, use a different cloth (dry or with warm water)  to clean the surrounding area.     I know it's hard, but in order to prevent this in the future, work on tuning your instrument. You could do exercises like using the fine tuner to make the string a little sharp(not much, you don't want it to pop), and listen to how it sounds. Then, make it a little flat and see how that sounds. You will get better at determining which way the tuner needs to be turned. Also, practice tuning your instrument at home with this website: http://www.get-tuned.com/online_tuners.p... It's a really good tuner that I use with my viola. It will still take time, though.    Good luck!    Edit: A microfiber cloth would work really well.
yoGWCH3gaa	I'm not sure about the free online lessons... so I'd suggest you look through videos on youtube, but I'm not sure what's there.     Any saxophone that is being sold for 40 dollars with no neck shouldn't even be considered. Every saxophone should come with a neck and you won't get anything worth while for under 1,000 dollars. Even then, that's low. But, you were saying you just wanted a used instrument... so the best I can say is stay away from Bundy brands as well as Cannonball. Yamaha will be your cheapest bet and they are generally pretty sturdy saxophones. Same goes for a Selmer (a brighter sound) and Yanagisawa. I, myself, own a professional Keilwerth. It's a beautiful saxophone with a dark sound. I'm not sure what the beginner/intermediate ones sound like, but the brand itself is associated with a darker and more rich sound.     Get the essential elements book for saxophone. It will take you slowly through all the fingers and some easy songs. It's really the best book to use when beginning.     As far as additional purchases...     1) Mouth piece: As a rule, the instrument will likely come with a plastic piece of crap mouth piece. I know you don't want to spend money, so you'll likely just play on it, but if you become more serious then go out and try some mouth pieces at your local music store. It will improve your sound greatly.     2) Reeds: Do NOT buy rico reeds! Also, don't start on anything less than a 2 1/2 to a 2 at the very least. You will get a weak and airy sound and also have difficulty with the full range of the instrument. The best choice of reed is definitely the Vandoren reeds. Good quality and not too expensive.     3) Cork grease: Just go to your local music store and pick a tube up. They look almost like a tube of lip chap.     4) A swab to pull through your saxophone and clean it out. Do not get one of those long fluffy cleaners that you put in the saxophone and leave after playing. This absorbs the condensation and presses it against the pads of the keys, causing damage over time.     Finally, have your saxophone checked out at your local music store to ensure it is not missing screws or has any leaks due to bent rods which would cause problems when playing.     Good luck! ^___^|`|AA11562326	A saxophone should come with a neck.  If it doesn't, don't buy it, it's not worth it.  If you mean where can you get a mouthpiece, then any music store, but possibly cheaper on the internet.  You'll also need some reeds.    Maybe what you want to do is find a friend that plays the sax, and have them go over with you, bringing their mouthpiece, to prospective craigslist deals.  Your friend can tell you how the instrument sounds, how the action is on the keys, and whether it needs new pads.  If it looks like a quality instrument, but needs work, then you might have to do some more spending.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	I don't play the saxophone, but I do play the clarinet.  But they're both reed instruments and I've got a lot of friends who play the sax.    Q. Free online lessons?  A. You could try Youtube.  Just search saxophone lessons, but you should talk to someone (a friend or band director) about embrasure and stuff.      Q. Where can you buy a neck?  A. I would bring it to your local music store and ask them.  Make sure you find someone that KNOWS what they're doing.  At my music store, there are people that can't tell oboe swabs from flute swabs (it says it right on the package) and that bothers me a lot.  They'd help you and probably let you put it on and test it out.    Note on used instruments: most used instruments are okay, but make sure that there are no huge things that need to be fixed.  You may want to check for dents and scratches too, but if you're not too picky, then I don't think that'll be a problem.  I can't really remember how dents affeft the tone/tune of the instrument, but I don't think it causes any major problems.  It could, though, so you might want to check that out.    Q. Other supplies you should buy?  A. Reeds and a swab.  And if it doesn't come with a case, I'd buy one of those too.  Reeds...eh...I'm not sure about the price of saxophone reeds, but you could just buy a pack of five for maybe ten dollars (depending on how good they are).      Q. Any good books?  A. Unless you live in some remote place in the middle of nowhere, your local music store should have books on learning how to play the sax.  Fingering charts are your friends...unless they're confusing.  You might want to check that out while you're looking through the books.    Good luck learning how to play!|`|ZZt66zMjaa	listen i started playing a couple years ago n i hated it so unless your gonna dedicate like 3 hours every morning and and every night don't start... but if you will be dedicated don't buy that sax it is bad nothing good is worth forty dollars.. i would go with something between 150 to 190 if you on a budget of under 200$... you need a neck holder thing i cannot remember what it is called and you need a cleaner for the inside and i suggest you get a lot of reeds because they break and chip like crazy! you also need cork oil so when you put it together it slide on and apart easily. get a case for easy transportation and a stand book this book >> ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS 2000 PLUS DVD  comprehensive band method>> written by Tim Lautzenheiser, John Higgins, Charles Menghini, Paul Lavender, Tom C Rhodes, and Don Bierschenk ... i hope this help you|`|zHwSyDNfaa	then go play|`|4JppzNYeaa	Ok, first thing, don't get that saxophone, the guy selling it has no clue.  Also, the second link in the addon details looks like its a tenor, not an Alto.    If you're up to paying about 30-40 dollars, buy books from the teacher on tap series.  They start from the start and will give you more help then any online resource.  Other things you will need are:    Reeds - Start with rico royal size 1 and a half  Pull through swabs for neck and bell  Polishing cloth  Cork Grease    If i were you, I would want to save up to have aat least$1000 to spend on the sax,  you want something decent.    Good Luck,  Matt

c4HQi0Uxaa	he was an Arabic merchant turned prophet who lived in the 600s. He claimed that Allah spoke to him and used him as His mouthpiece. Muhammad to Muslims is the Seal of the Prophets, which means he is the last prophet. Muhammad gathered a considerable amount of monotheistic followers, that authorities in Mecca forced him to flee to Medina, called the Hijra. Muhammad created a religious society governed by the umma. And later in like 630 he went back to Mecca and claimed it for Islam.     after his death, Islam spread dramatically.

These two items are what makes that wall go up in the day time. You won't need the walls and the tight box if you stop expecting to receive love in this world and start giving love.  It will take patience but the longer you do this, about 18 to 21 months, the less you will find a need for the walls and box. It sounds like courtesy respect and kindness were absent in this relationship. YOu must also believe in yourself enough to try what I am suggesting. You will have all the love and more when you start giving love. The love is eventually returned 1000 fold to you and you have your safety box through the power of love.|`|YuUNESK5aa	i think it's perfect    i don't know what others to describe it.

Part Three: Burning Bright    ?Beatty taunts Montag for a bit and Mildred runs out of the house,   a suitcase in her hand, to a taxi waiting at the curb. Montag realizes that she is the one who called the alarm.    ?Faber, through the earpiece, tries to figure out whats going on. Montag stands around dazed that this is happening to him.    ?Faber realizes whats up and advises Montag to run. Meanwhile Beatty has flicked his igniter and is admiring the beauty of the fire. Man is drawn to flame, he says, because it is perpetual motion; it is the one thing man always wanted to invent but never did. Fire will rid him of his burdens  like Montag.    ?Beatty insists that Guy burn his entire house himself, with a flame thrower.  More    FULL SUMMARY:  http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/r...    ======================================...    Symbols, Imagery, Allegory    Fire, Heat, Light    As you might expect from a novel about burning books, theres a whole lot of fire in Fahrenheit 451. Were not just talking about the burning houses, either. When people are angry, theyre burning with rage inside. When Montag senses Clarisses presence, its because he feels body heat. When Granger and Co. pick themselves up after the bombing, we get the image of a phoenix rising up from the ashes. This imagery is all over the place.    Fire seems to mean a lot of different things at different moments in Fahrenheit 451. Beatty and his fireman minions use it to destroy. But the woman whose house they burn interprets it another way: "Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out." For her, it represents strength. Montag himself discovers an alternative use for fire at the end of the novel, when he realizes that it can warm instead of destroy. Like that whole cycle of life thing, fire has a constructive and destructive half. And like the books that are burned, each character in the novel is forced to interpret for themselves and confront contradictory perspectives  just like Beatty said about the books.    Insects and Other Unpleasant Animals    There are several references throughout Fahrenheit 451 to essentially yucky animals an insects (thats the technical term). When Mildred gets her stomach pumped, the machine is like a snake. The earpiece she wears at night is like a praying mantis. The helicopters in the chase scene are described as insects. Even the Mechanical Hound has eight legs, like a spider. Notice a pattern here? These references all have to do with technology  destructive technology that the government uses to control its citizens. Its basically a perversion of nature and of the natural order, which fits into the larger themes of Fahrenheit 451 (because in this world of destruction without construction, the natural order is off).     Getting Naked in the River    We thought that would get your attention. When the chase draws to a close, Montag ditches his clothes, bathes in the river, and dons Fabers attire instead. For a man whos been through three or more identity crises, this is significant. Hes leaving the old Montag behind, cleansing himself of his old identity, and assimilating a new one for the time being (Fabers). The fact that another man is captured and killed in Montags place is a great ancillary to this moment.    http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/li...
AA12095483	i don't understand your question. Who or what is 'the ted'?
baf130a2a607da681a60051a131a8dfcaa	Somehow you're exactly correct. Here's a proposition for you. There are only truly 2 things to your question that simply is unavoidable. but it happens on daily basis. Bad reasoning is due to a person's ignorance and therefore have just made an honest mistake. Because you don't know. Second, bad reasoning because you do know what's going on, but pretend not be otherwise due to your own evil mind (dishonesty & thinking you are better than everyone else, or have more power, however, power is the seed of corruption, etc, etc, etc....).

Thats what you have to learn to understand. If you want to learn to control aggressive thoughts and release them, you have to follow a course in meditation. Try a vipassana retreat. Good ones are for free, you can just donate as much as you can miss.   Also, in your daily life, be aware of what you expose your mind to. For example, aggressive songs/music and violent movies/games enter the subconscious and stick around without you knowing. Just be aware of things like that. If you become a good meditator you will actually find that you have to release all this garbage again.  After that you will understand much more of who you are and where you are going.  Good luck!|`|8CL8o8K0aa	I go through a lot of struggle.  I do not know any one who don't.  I had never wanted to take it out on any one.  I'm not stupid.

eAGFE0G6aa	It is a quite enthralling book - - it is kind of a Rohrshach test as far as whether those who already have a delineated view of the afterlife want to see in the "inkblot" of the Heaven-place what they believe a Supreme Being might put there.    Whether there is communication from the dead to the living is also mysterious and the novel is quite provocative offering the victim a chance to see what happens as far as punishment for the killer.

That empire collapsed and as punishment for siding with the losers was divided and little remained outside of what is now modern Turkey. The league of Nations gave France and England a Mandate to rule the middle east region. Lebanon did not exist as a nation before WW1 but the territory was included with the the area now nown as Syria and fell under the French Mandate. These official Mandates basically collapsed after WII and the modern countries of Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Jordon were formed.     So the answer is France, although Lebanon was not a country that independently existed in history before this time.

If there is a problem with it, it might be that it makes light of an important cultural feature of Indian life (Henna decorations are used for important celebrations etc). Some Indians may feel that it is a bit culturally disrespectful (you would have to ask an Indian about that).    As an example of when disrespecting a culture in advertising can get you in to trouble. A couple of years back a Japanese ad was shown in China. The ad was for paint & it showed a dragon sculpture sliding off the paint.

The doctor Alderotti advised people to stretch their limbs, wash their face, clean their teeth, exercise etc.    Guy de Chauliac (the Pope's doctor) realised the importance of a good diet, and that a poor diet made people more vulnerable to the plague.    Monasteries developed comprehensive systems of public health, including fresh running water, 'lavers' (wash rooms), flush 'reredorters' (latrines) with running sewers, clean towels and a compulsory bath four times a year.    Nobles took regular baths (perhaps two a year).  Towns had bath houses (which were also restaurants and brothels).  People realised that a room next to a privy was unhealthy, and towns paid 'gongfermers' to clear out the cess pits.     Medieval kings passed laws requiring people to keep the streets clean.    Leaders in Venice realised that sexually transmitted diseases were infectious, and ordered checks on the city's prostitutes.    During the time of the plague many towns developed quarantine laws, and boarded up the houses of infected people. People with leprosy, likewise, were confined to lazar houses (a place for people with infectious diseases).    During the Middle Ages the first hospitals were built since Roman times (eg St Bart's in London|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	No lie they paid a dude to go round and take away all the human excrement from the streets on a cart.

N86vHKxtaa	All of them-- which is one reason the quote is still pertinent long after it was written and even when referring to people who were elected, not crowned.  Even the Pope can be said to lie uneasy in the sense Shakespeare meant when you consider his responsibilities to the Catholic Church, relations with other religions (and their leaders) and his own sense of what god is asking him to do.    For a crowned monarch, I recommend talking about Queen Elizabeth I who ruled during most of Shakespeare's life and had her share of problems with rebellious nobles, religious differences and foreign governments.

o16Z34u6aa	Reconstruction is the era in the U.S. history from 1863 to 1877, when the U.S. focused on abolishing slavery, destroying all traces of the Confederacy, establishing the rights of Freedmen, the name used for freed slaves, and through three new constitutional amendments strengthening the role of the federal governments and its courts. Reconstruction policies were debated in the North as soon as the war started, and began in earnest after the Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, and the federal occupation of major parts of southern states allowed the formation of new, loyal state governments. President Abraham Lincoln was the major policymaker until his death in April, 1865. Reconstruction began in each state as soon as federal troops controlled most of the state. It ended at different times in different states. The Compromise of 1877 saw the collapse of the last three Republican state governments in the South, so 1877 is the usual date given for the end of Reconstruction, although some historians extend the era to the 1890s. The bitterness and repercussions from the heated conflicts of the era lasted well into the 20th century. "Reconstruction" is also the term used in textbooks for the history of the entire U.S. 1865-1877.

So Dimarzio is a better choice. I have anold '69 Gibson Les Paul with Dimarzio Super Distorion installed back in the 1970 and overall, these pickups have ballz, fat sound, yet good for mellow jazz as well.    The plus side to these pickups, i get a clean sound with the volume at 7 or 8 ...and if pushed to 10, I get the Paul Gilbert sound and Frank Gambale. This is the music i play. i love a littls distortion when I crank but I love the clean sound when i lower the Volume. Perfect balance.

mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  I love this book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books and it was also recommended by the author of Twilight.     Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	Sarah Dessen books|`|jk6ayFUmaa	well Sarah Dessen books are good they arent to girly. also Fablehaven by Brandon Mull is good its harry potter ish. and underworld is good.|`|cYW1bWi7aa	i haven't read it's kind of a funny story, but i hope this helps!!

MlZay5VHaa	lol. No idea. What I'm confused about is how Bella can enjoy it. I mean...it's kind of like screwing a popsicle isn't it?|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	hmm i see your point. but my point is....its a book does it matter!!|`|daza5A4vaa	Haha. I've thought of this.  No, the blood doesn't move.  At least, it shouldn't.    Why don't we ask Stephenie?|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	That's exactly what I thought and vampires and humans can't have children!That's what Stephenie Meyer said, but she contradicts everything.She simply ran out of ideas and went with that.|`|TZTJRrM4aa	the vampire venom works as blood.|`|GK00Rz5caa	I actually wondered the exact same thing, but it's fantasy, it's not going to make complete sense.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	thats a plot hole      i like the story (though its very similar to the buffy/angel one)   but the books are very poorly written    i remember reading one bit where charlie is making toast  and then the next page he looks up from his cerial bowl|`|aeODdMATaa	wow. I actually thought the same question but not like that lol.|`|IppmajNVaa	If he drinks Animal blood then he has blood so he gets the blood to fill his.."it"|`|OaJ2bFl2aa	i asked this exact questions to my friend. i think its either that he does have blood and it does work in certain parts or its just a flaw in the writing .probably the second one.|`|Q0y9wG3Xaa	this isnt like a science fact, its a FICTIONAL STORY. yes stephanie may have overlooked a few parts of the story, but dont get too hung up about it... it isnt real.. obviously u out a lot of thought into this....|`|EY0wnkh3aa	OMG LMFAO I LOVE Edward and you just totally put this image in my head. but maybe he doesn't get hard maybe he just wants to have sex with bella because he'll do anything with her. maybe shes the one who gets horny, lol not her.|`|XI7JLX6gaa	lols im mad how u actually thought this through.  then again good question lols|`|rKsgGHKkaa	huh good question never thought of it that way lmao.|`|ZDjBMsVUaa	maybe he dosent?|`|Hbfc8TIpaa	becuase its a gay movie thats why|`|voaMM1GQaa	It fills up with Venom  Hence his Venomous **** =D|`|nodXUYC4aa	Just does|`|0eab0b6e32b135981c458e469f63de2eaa	why would you think of something like this|`|6ead7e745899491ccfd40dbc9c7d5ef6aa	Haha, true, but I don't really know, and I don't really care! The sex in the book is AMAZING!!! =D|`|Oohxa4dxaa	its fiction.  and meyer can do with her books what she wants with them.|`|pQ8ZcPYraa	lol!   thank god i've never read these books|`|tvav5UcUaa	his skin is as hard as stone|`|72oUAXWTaa	lol...funny  anywayz some of my more .... obsessed friends say that it's the venom  lolololololol...funny|`|zHZXYsjvaa	why do you care?|`|VtFIlYWJaa	he's supposed to be marble, lol email stephanie meyer and ask her! but yeah, i think that he's supposed to be "hard" 24 7|`|wkMncMobaa	He doesn't.  She straps one on.|`|z81JIycpaa	Well, I thought that the venom just replaced the blood.    The vampires were humans. I just thought the blood cooled and congealed when they 'changed' from vampire to human. So, for me, the venom still acts like blood.  The vampires hearts must beat very slowly, and dully for them to still be alive. Maybe once a day or something? Or are their hearts fully immobilised? The hearts must beat for them to be alive. So like I said, the venom takes on the role of blood. Vampires confuse me.    Well, I hope you get something out of my ramblings.    xxx GG|`|miNKdNauaa	He's already rock hard, silly. Plus, he's Edward Cullen.|`|9QhP6JpDaa	Wow this is interestinggg.  I don't read thoseee books but its a good point|`|boRsg0sxaa	I don't know. Also, it doesn't seem like it would be too pleasant either because he is supposed to be ice cold to the touch....|`|iy0OSRTFaa	they do still have blood... it's just not being pumped around... but i guess they can still get... happy... hahaha|`|iNPamc3Faa	Hahahaha. It's a movie... well and a book. Not real life. And vampires don't even exist so no one slept with anyone.    But still, yeah the book does lack logic there.|`|UWsyqLrwaa	may be he drank a lot of blood before he did it..lol|`|9ddprBrPaa	Because he's Edward Cullen and he can do anything...|`|VXlAfw3Eaa	hahaha I have no idea! Good question.. you could always e-mail Stephenie Meyer about it? Who knows... he's a vampire, so he does what he wants|`|zLUXqOY8aa	I always wondered the same thing, so i went to stephanie meyers website and she sort of explains it on there. I suggest you read it on there, its way to hard to explain.|`|m3rt9x8Caa	He went hunting before they had sex so there was blood inside him, thats how it went hard. My question though is isn't his sperm meant to be frozen?|`|SWxcuGlOaa	Very good point, that makes Twilight look silly
S5H0NmEWaa	It's incredibly crass and unsubtle to think a) that Germany was singularly responsible for war "twice" (presumably you are thinking of the two World Wars); or that b) each time, war was precipitated by some kind of easily-solved diplomatic struggle which got out of hand.    The First World War erupted after a patchwork of military alliances were triggered by the assassination of a member of the royal family of Austria-Hungary. Germany was a close and powerful ally of Austria-Hungary; it did not explicitly seek to launch the First World War instead of taking a diplomatic route, but was drawn in by the jigsaw of military alliances invoked one after the other when Austria-Hungary sought to hold Serbia responsible for the assassination.    The invasion of Poland which triggered the Second World War is a clearer case, but to suggest that Germany could have chosen diplomacy is to ignore the perceived merits of military action. Hitler's regime had sought to reconstruct Germany's sense of itself as a military power after thirty years of perceived humiliation after the harsh Treaty of Versailles. Hitler had used diplomatic channels to get his way in the Sudetenland; he could reasonably have expected Britain and France to accede to his demand for the Polish Corridor as well. So you could argue that it was the United Kingdom's choice to go to war, not Germany's.    History is always more subtle than right and wrong.|`|nWdh9Itaaa	War was seen as a valid diplomatic tool at that time. Men went to war for their country and as a rite of passage that turned boys into men. To make it short: War was still seen as a natural occurence like the comings and goings of the tide.|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	Hello, they are Germans.|`|N86vHKxtaa	I disagree with the way you framed the question but...    The First World War was not quite a "choice" on Germany's part.  The Kaiser chose to honor treaty obligations to the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the assassination of the heir to that throne.  Diplomatic channels failed to avert the crisis in any event.    Germany's entry into World War II began as a diplomatic channel agreement with Russia over the partitioning of Poland (which had been re-created after WW I).  The invasion of Poland provoked Britain and France to declare war against Germany.|`|aSjdL4heaa	My understanding is that WWI was simply a question of empire building.  The French and English were very imperialistic and had pretty much cut Germany off.  I'm not saying this was a good reason, but neither am I saying that empires are a good idea.  It's pretty clear that Germany was itching for this war and had spent the previous decade building up a huge army (as did France), although France did sometimes intentionally provoke them.    The root of WWII is the treaty that Germany was forced to sign at the end of WWI.  Germany did not surrender - they just agreed to stop fighting.  However, when it came time to sign the treaty the terms were pretty outrageous (e.g. giving up large parts of Germany including the parts with coal and metal ores; e.g. paying huge reparations that were so over the top that they were obviously meant to keep Germany a poor and weak country, etc).  Germany could not pay the reparations (remember they had lost their coal and metal ores) without destroying their economy - and so they were forced to destroy their economy.  Hitler came to power promising to 'right the wrongs' of the treaty, but then decided to go empire building.    After WWII the victors realized they had made a terrible mistake trying to crush the loosing countries - that's why they implemented the Marshall Plan to rebuild those countries and turn them into friends.
htI1vYHsaa	Dangerous Crossing by anthony Horowitz  it's really short too  and it is a story all about courage  so take your pick   choose your own quotes  and it's was a choice from a piece of coursework this year and i'm also a sophmore at high school so i'tll be good choice     hope i helped
pd4VLvoHaa	Yes, that is first person. Also, contrary to some of the advice, you do not actually have to be a character in the story to write in first person. You may tell a story and occasionally comment, "I think..." or "I doubt..." or something of that nature, and you are still in the first person. As long as you, the narrator, refer to yourself as 'I' or 'me', you are writing in first person even if you are not a character. If you refer to the reader as 'you', then the reader is the first person while you, the writer ('I' or 'me') is the second person. When you write in third person, you never refer to anybody as 'I', 'me' or 'you'. In fact, I think your concerns are somewhat unfounded as in order to 'accidentally' shift from first person to third person, you would have to forget to refer to yourself as 'I' or 'me', and I bet you never do that when you talk.    http://www.nokilleye.com/111000.htm|`|ErSbeRlzaa	Yeah it is. The writer refers to himself 'as I link arms with Rose-May'. You just have to remeber and writing for the character and continue to plot the story around you. First person stories do need some amount of concentration, other wise like you said you'll just end up reverting it to a third person story.|`|AA12065466	YES|`|RYVKYYnAaa	yeah that's written in first person, you can tell when the author says "I link arms with Rose-May".|`|SygvUa0Eaa	Yus!|`|8YVo2Wogaa	Yes this is first person.    It is also what is called the "historic present", that is writing about the past, but as though it is happening now. This is harder to stick to. It is easy to slip up and talk in the past tense.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	Yes it is.  However writing in the first person is quite hard, you have to make sure there are no inconsistencies such as for example: 'I walked down the road with a heavy heart.  The sun was shining but I felt so sad that I didn't even notice.'  If you were writing in the third person, 'She walked down the road ... she didn't even notice' it would be ok.|`|YyXw69Draa	Writings pieces in the first person always use terms such as I, me, my, mine, etc as the main subject (main character). Second person uses you, your, yours... Third will use: he, she, it.    Just as a note... some of your sentences need  a bit of editing... If you haven't looked at them, you may want to.|`|tsfbV5PPaa	Yeah. uhm. If you want to stay in first person, just remember that the main character is "I"...|`|VtOqduATaa	Yes. When you are writing in first person make sure before you write to describe them you are using me , I , they, or them.|`|PqNIUhrXaa	It's a fine story and it's not hard to stay in first person. Write it like you were telling a story. Only use I, or we. Never use they or he or she. It's very hard to go into 2nd person. this is what second person sounds like, And then you walked down the stairs and, do you remember, you fell head over heals...  It's like you're talking to another person, a "you"|`|a796jDdlaa	yep. First person is when you write something using "I"     You also used we, which meant you were practically one of the characters.     As we walk out of the lunch hall Chris and Luke, burst out laughing as I link arms with Rose-May. "So," I saw as we stroll behind them, "are you going to open it?"     The "we's" and the "I's" prove that its in 1st person(:    Good luck with the story. =]|`|748e95ba10407453b89eb439d5bf1d6eaa	yes its first person.....a good point to remember is in your plot there will be secrets/ things to be revealed. you need to decide which person is involved in these secrets as if its not you ( first person) then you have to write as if you do not know the secret and how the secret is revealed to you !!!  For example if your boyfriend in the story kissed your best friend you   ( the character) would only if your friend told you, but then what if the boyfriend says its her that kissed him. The first person view would not know the true story...... but this makes a good twist to the story to see how you find out the truth !!!
42DjF8Ckaa	hey  I think you sketch really well and yes your talented. I would suggest you start drawing and painting as well along with sketching. You also should start drawing other things using imagination because that is the key to the awakening of the talent in self and as practice always makes somebody better at something. Best of luck! You have got talent:) don't let it get ignored, ever....|`|cbIxKGZVaa	everyone thinks their an artist|`|AA11176856	wow that's so great :)|`|m3iPgBWFaa	Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... you r a really good artist|`|D4e9jv0iaa	no|`|UtYOwE4Laa	good for 12 but it anime doesn't take much skill at all to draw and make it look good. it's not original whatsoever.|`|uHcGn3Yaaa	I really like it!

Go for it!|`|yuF2K1rLaa	Honestly, It isnt that bad. However many people can mimic and draw a picture that they are looking at, all you need is good atention to detail in my opinion. To determine true talent, I think that you would have to be skilled in drawing things outside of your comfort range.    So my my answer to your talent question is maybe.|`|KNwGCRBcaa	OMFG tht is so awesome im 13 years old i should kno + ima naruto fan dude POST MORE DRAWINGS cool|`|UsTyc0oeaa	If you sketched this freehand, then it's very good.  I was never able to reproduce anything this good unless I traced it!      As you practice more, and learn more new techniques, you'll get better and better.  You're already off to a good start.    Keep it up!|`|a8c3721d218891d4a3fb70f51dc29b23aa	yes|`|9i29TWlQaa	a bit....but not too much!!!!     you could still make some money out of it!!!!!!hehe|`|Czpfs8RLaa	um you really should not mentoin your age... but ya its a nice pic :)|`|TfbR1IFIaa	All i can say is WOW that was really good man.

The face is great, just the hair needs a little tweeking to do. Maybe you should make it boulder 'cause it looks a bit hazy.  other wise, it's great!  Hope it helps!|`|FthNiQj8aa	you have talent. it is not the best drawing in the world but it is a good work of art                ps  im 13 - 1  tooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!   :}|`|5NwzTlf7aa	That'ss really good for a 12 year old!

(right?) Well, I'm assuming so...    Actually it is VERY good - especially considering your age.    The expression around the mouth is realistic and portrays the characters focus. The eyes are rather plain, but then, if you made them more detailed it would detract from the focus evident in his face.    What I would reccomend is that you 'liven' it up slightly, perhaps use some accessories 'google images' Hatsuharu Sohma... that general idea. This would create some more interest and add to the characters personality. For instance if he wore skulls we would know he was slightly goth/emo.    The hair - it is swept back (could this be because he is jumping?) anyway it needs a little work. I would suggest not making the spikes so accented and instead create fewer, and more of them. This would make his hair more 'unruly' and therefore more interesting.    Anyway the base sketch is really good - one that you can definitely work on!.xxx    Have fun|`|4WDmv3cGaa	thats really good!
iNXqiDIYaa	it depends which part of the apache nation you mean    The Western Apache hunted deer and pronghorns mostly in the ideal late fall season. After the meat was smoked into jerky around November, a migration from the farm sites along the stream banks in the mountains to winter camps in the Salt, Black, Gila river and even the Colorado River valleys.    The primary game of the Chiricahua was the deer followed by pronghorn. Lesser game included: cottontail rabbits (but not jack rabbits), opossums, squirrels, surplus horses, surplus mules, wapiti elk, wild cattle, wood rats.    The Mescalero primarily hunted deer. Other animals hunted include: bighorn sheep, buffalo (for those living closer to the plains), cottontail rabbits, elk, horses, mules, opossums, pronghorn, wild steers and wood rats. Beavers, minks, muskrats, and weasels were also hunted for their hides and body parts but were not eaten.    The principle game of the Jicarilla was bighorn sheep, buffalo, deer, elk and pronghorn. Other game animals include: Beaver, bighorn sheep, chief hares, chipmunks, doves, ground hogs, grouse, peccaries, porcupines, prairie dogs, quail, rabbits, skunks, snow birds, squirrels, turkeys and wood rats. Burros and horses were only eaten in emergencies. Minks, weasels, wildcats and wolves were not eaten but hunted for their body parts.    The main food of the Lipan was the buffalo with a 3-week hunt during the fall and smaller scale hunts continuing until the spring. The second most utilized animal was deer. Fresh deer blood was drunk for good health. Other animals included: beavers, bighorns, black bears, burros, ducks, elk, fish, horses, mountain lions, mourning doves, mules, prairie dogs, pronghorns, quail, rabbits, squirrels, turkeys, turtles and wood rats. Skunks were eaten only in emergencies.    Plains Apache hunters pursued primarily buffalo and deer. Other hunted animals were badgers, bears, beavers, fowls, geese, opossums, otters, rabbits and turtles.

AA10729675	We simply cannot answer this question.  It is not real history, it is hypothesis.  History cannot be so far gone into hypothesis.    Indeed if Rome had not been a power, you know, things would have been much different.  And certainly the Hellenistic Empire would have endured more and done well, very, very , very well.  Rome has been a huge setback to humanity, not only because of a false Pax Romana hiding in fact a lot of intolerance and a lot of haughtiness from the Romans, it also accepted Christianity which destroyed all the good progress made by scientists in Alexandria in Egypt, under the Macedonian Pharaohs, the Ptolemies.  Indeed Rome therefore would not have conquered Judaea, and there would not have been any cross or any thing of that sort.    So, there would not have been any Jesus to change the world, the Roman way (since Catholics are mostly "Roman catholics").    Until Rome, except in Judaea, there had not been any religious wars, or a very few in Babylonia, long long long ago, before Alexander and his Successors (with Assurbanipal).  Christianity would not exist as such.  It would have been polished and refined, and civilized.  It would not have taken all the features of the Romans (intolerant, haughty, severe, punishing).  And the world would have been a much better world.    Really.  But there would not have been any Islam either.  Or any protestantism, or any sects or any other things like that.  Because during the Hellenistic times, religion was at peace, except in Judaea.  Jews who had left Judaea lived at peace somewhere else.       It is my opinion.  Take it for what it is. Nevertheless, your question is mighty important and interesting.  I wish we could answer to it for sure.|`|ky3B42f6aa	Christianity doesn't exist now -- all the people who "brag" that they are Christians are fakes!  Anyone who REALLY followed in the footsteps of this Jesus character (and also did as he asked) would not last more than a week before also being "strung up".  The modern "Christian" mobs are just like the ones of yesteryear -- arrogant, selfish, greedy, violent and hopelessly ignorant.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Yes it would exist because Alexander the Great was a unifier not a destroyer.

MPbqO3e0aa	Abraham is called "Hebrew" because he was a descendant of ?ever; read genesis 11, verse 24 and on. there are people who would not accept anything of the Hebrew bible as historic truth, they want to rely on archaeological finding. and so they they try to make one of the ?abiru, mentioned in some old Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the Hebrew. there is no real historic or archaeological proof for that.  also note that the two names has some similarity when written in English, bat as Semitic names written in Semitic language, Hebrew for instance, they has no similarity, there is only one common consonant:   ?ivrim and  ?abiru. and they sound completely different.  as for the occupation of Avraham: he had came from a city, but, as described in Genesis, then he was owner of herd and as such he was semi nomad in Canaan - living in tents and moving after the forage

They're the ones that submit you and pitch you to the casting directors who are the ones who say you can go to the audition and are responsible for choosing you to go to the callbacks where the producers/clients ultimately make the decision if you get the job or not.    Agents are also the ones responsible for negotiating your contract and making sure that you get the best deal. They also have to build rapport and good relationships with Casting directors. When looking for an agent, you want to know how strong their relationship with CDs are.    LEGIT agents DON'T take upfront fees. They only make money when you make money! Generally, agents get at least 10% of commercial and acting work and 20% of commercial print. If they make you use their photographer and take certain classes or they don't sign you, then they're an agency to avoid. This is called a kickback scheme.    To get an agent, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.    You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:  -Attend a showcase and impress them  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in.    DON'T  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	you have to have an agent for almost all big auditions  most casting directors will contact only agents   if they are going to have an audition.  to get an agent you have to schedule an appointment  to meet with one. so you basically would call them  make an appointment and then go and meet with them  or just send them your resume   and if they see potential in you   you can sign with them  but they have quite a few clients so you pretty much have  to audition for anything they give to you   because there wont be all to many.  also you will know it is a scam if the "agent"  asks for any money up front  agents make their money off of commission  which means after you get a job   they will get a portion of the money that you make from that job  which is why you cant just get an agent  they have to see potential with you,  they aren't just going to sign with you   because if they don't think you will make it, they will loose money|`|ESrClLDgaa	This is a very good question..I hope you get the answers you are looking for..cuz really i dont have one hahahhah but the rabbit had to say hey !!|`|afhjdHZWaa	you're joking?

Si accese la solita lotta accanita e pittoresca, propria delle elezioni americane. Il comitato che sosteneva la rielezione del Van Buren, dovendosi scegliere un nome com duso, pens di adottare quello del paese nativo del candidato, Kinderhook, un villaggetto della valle dellHudson, nello stato di Nuova York; e si battezz infatti Old Kinderhook Club; nome presto abbreviato in O.K. Club, e abbreviato ancora, per comodit di propaganda, in O.K. semplicemente. La prima riunione del comitato, si tenne il 24 marzo 1840, e in quel giorno il cielo statunitense echeggi di O.K. dalluno allaltro oceano. Sigla facile, breve, martellante, divenne presto il simbolo e il grido di battaglia del comitato elettorale, e sonava, si capisce, come auspicio immancabile di vittoria. Divenuta insomma un felice motto augurale, questo significato ottimistico si mantenne perfino dopo la sconfitta del Van Buren, messo in minoranza come primo responsabile, almeno presso il popolo, di una grave crisi finanziaria che angustiava il paese.  la solita fortuna o sfortuna che si accompagna a certe parole: popolare come ormai era, questo O.K. dal linguaggio politico non tard un minuto a passare in quello comune come formula di approvazione, di consenso; e divulgatosi presto in tutti i paesi di lingua inglese, invase durante la seconda guerra mondiale lintera Europa, diffuso dalle truppe statunitensi, divenendo cos duso internazionale. Del resto, gi qualche anno prima, nel 1932, la conferenza delle telecomunicazioni di Madrid aveva adottato la sigla O.K. come segnale internazionale col significato di sta bene.?|`|a5e6c4a7ef85aa27003d2533e1f43d44aa	Buona quella di Andre@|`|8712bb618b723738cb002b0092cc1b72aa	Unica risposta giusta quella di Andre@!

Jackson and Harrison were of a later period.

For the first few elections the runner up in the electoral college vote was the Vice President.

AA11553969	I do not think that titles can be copyrighted.       The body of the work can but not the title.    That would mean you could use it as long as you don't represent the book as the poem.    And by all means give credit to the author of the poem in your book.|`|1179ac1ef69ec53031ff43e46bee7a38aa	I believe jjdicken is correct-- titles can't be copyrighted.     As for the poem, you don;t say what it is. If it;s well-known, it may be old enough to be in the public domain, which means it can be used by anyone. If someone does own the rights to it, they may choose to allow you to use it with or without a fee.     At any rate, I wouldn't worry too much about this right now. It will not become an issue until or unless your book is published. If your book is published, the publisher will be able to advise you on what is permissible or not.     Good luck!'|`|B5Fm455paa	No, as long as you don't say that your wrote it.|`|wMXsyQRwaa	no...never|`|YlLdIPRvaa	It's copyright infringment unless you get permission...which I'm guessing you're not going to get.|`|CBgDc1Auaa	why? to make people attribute your book to the poem and therefore think of you as a good writer???|`|vylNTi0faa	you should name it toilet bowl|`|G4XkXsbeaa	No. Think of a different name. When people see the title, you want them to think about what you wrote and not what somebody else wrote. Be original; make it stand out and people think, "This is a really good title." You don't want them thinking of somebody else's poem, really.|`|DEYvhPtpaa	You cannot even include the poem without permission, let alone title your book after it! That's copyright infringement and if you have any intention of publishing the book or distributing it you could wind up in a MAJOR lawsuit.
5VD9fVa1aa	The two past cultures were ancient Greece and ancient Rome.  The Renaissance took a lot of ideas about art, religion and literature from ancient Greece and Rome, ideas that had died out in Europe 1,000 years before.  Islamic countries had kept these ideas alive; Europeans learned mostly learned about Greek and Roman ideas from Muslims living in Spain.|`|eoDWzUNxaa	It was a rebirth because they had just gone through the Black plague or black death. After the plague they started going back to Roman and Greecian inspired pieces in art. It was also the dawn of the age of science and math, such as Isaac Newton.      That all I remember. Hope I helped. :)|`|zuqv3qR1aa	in art-music....it moved from sacred to secular|`|NYU37jfGaa	During the so-called 'Renaissance' people became obsessed by classical literature, art, architecture, etc, that is Greek and Roman civilization.  They decided that classical styles were the only ones worth copying, so for instance, the exquisite Gothic architecture of the medieval period was replaced by the heavy baroque style of the early mdoern period.    It is all nonsense really about there being a 'rebirth' of art and learning in the 'Renaissance'.  Art, music, and learning had been going on throuhgout the medieval era, it didn't just suddenly start again in 1500.

Very dark, but there were stars-points of light and reason..And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire;there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor ahd fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I coulfn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything." edward, new moon     "Do i dazzle you?" edward, twilight    "If I could dream at all, it would be about you. And Im not ashamed of it." edward ,twilight    "ill follow you anywhere woman."-garrett, breaking dawn   "now he tells me"-kate  (lol it makes me smile)     "momma youre special" Nessie, breaking dawn     "oh so you seduced your all too willing husbond..."edward, breaking dawn     "its about time someone scored around here"-emmett, breaking dawn    i could go on and on but i thought this was pleanty for now lol     i love the twilight saga  and i LOVE edward cullen|`|E9KYlG9kaa	That was mean.

I could not stop laughing. Actually the whole scene was hilarious. It took her long enough to get mad at him for something.
g8kIjpwSaa	The "vector tool" is actually the shape tool. It's in the toolbar as a rectangle by default. You can press the letter U on the keyboard to pull it up.    There are a lot of different shapes in the shape tool you can choose from.    Click and drag to make your shape (vector) then click on the black arrow tool in your tool bar. With the black arrow, RIGHT click on your shape. A menu will pop up the gives you options to Stroke Path, Fill Path, or Make Selection. You want to make selection option. This works with any shape you make.    Good Luck.

Por lo tanto, no te lo tomes como fracaso, sino como incgnita del propio saber y del propio ser humano. Mientras te sigas planteando estas cuestiones estars filosofando, y sers una persona reflexiva, que al menos tiene en cuenta estas cuestiones, hay quien ni siquiera se plantea ni lo ms mnimo del asunto.   Buena pregunta la tuya.

Lo que ocurre es que creo el intelecto humano jams sabr quines o qu somos, porque al hacerlo dejaramos de ser lo que somos. Has de ver la filosofia como una base para tu propio conocimiento y no olvidar que cada filsofo es hijo de su tiempo y que en cada poca el hombre ha tenido sus necesidades vitales o espirituales.   Yo creo, despus de haber estudiado filosofa un poquito y haber estudiado algo de religiones diversas, que el filsofo ms cercano a una realidad global de la exitencia humana es Platn, pese a que es muy superficial en comparacin, por supuesto, a los filsofos modernos y contemporneos. Es decir, a m Platn me sirve para empezar a preguntarme quin soy, por lo tanto no considero que la filosofa haya fracasado. Pero es una apreciacin personal y puede que ningn filsofo te haya "llenado".|`|499960e79c6e333c0c50016440201d12aa	gol del elche|`|8124b7158d2ccb0a23f7b5b69a3dfb99aa	la filosofia da respuestas a travez de un razonamiento valido, si tu no compartes alguna de las tantas visiones que analizan quienes y que somos deberas hacer tus razonamientos y encontrar lo que tu crees que es verdad y si no sabes como empezar te puedes ayudar en lo que los filosofos han encontrado previamente.  La filosofia no ha sido un fracaso y no podra serlo, la filosofia no busca unicamente es saber quien o que eres, la filosofia como ya te dije, es el arte de razonar logica y validamente.   Creo que no sabes de lo que hablas y que no te has puesto a leer a filosofos de verdad.  Si acaso una de las tres hermanas ha tenido un fracaso en la epoca actual es la religion (no la filosofia y no el arte). la religion en esta epoca ha demostrado una incopativilidad con el mundo real, el mantener la moral arcaica en choque con los usos y costumbres contemporaneos provoca grandes problemas sociales. La religion no ha servido para ninguno de sus fines: explicar el origen de nuestro mundo y poner normas morales adecuadas para una mejor convivencia.|`|a955226d66ab2890972813a40e692b33aa	es una pregunta o una afirmacin?  si es una afirmacin, respeto tu opinin aunque no la comparto  si es una pregunta, respondo: de los grandes interrogantes (de donde venimos, quienes somos, hacia donde vamos, etc.) se ocupa la metafsica, con esto quiero decir que uno puede optar por leer a los filosofos que hayan hablado sobre ello, y luego reflexionar, hacer catarsis, desechar, opinar lo contrario y fundamentar, etc., muchas cosas...o simplemente, quedarse con las ideas que ya traiamos anteriormente cuando  no teniamos respuestas, para continuar sin tener esas respuestas y sin inquietudes,   nada es censurable, cada quien a lo que le interese|`|c7e39a16de3e23f25b3158af6ce7b422aa	La filosofa se basa en el disfrute del conocimiento, en una insatisfaccin en la ignorancia. El fin de la filosofa no es externo a s mismo. Es una ciencia libre, entendida as por intil.   La aparicin de la filosofa surge a partir de un concepto de saber como algo intil, algo que no es productivo, as como por la humildad intelectual, el reconocerse ignorantes. Solo quien sabe que no sabe est en condiciones de buscar la verdad. Ya lo dijo Scrates: "Slo s que no se nada". Otra de las causas es la admiracin, el ser capaces de sorprendernos e interrogarnos incluso por aquellas cosas que consideramos sencillas.  Por eso creo que la filosofa nunca llegar a determinar la definicin de quines o qu somos, pues no es la respuesta su objetivo, sino su planteamiento, la pregunta.|`|ddafbbbb8ef9b8885636dc8bef25773caa	SI, LA FILOSOFIA HA SIDO UN FRACASO, YA QUE EL CONCEPTO DEL SER CAMBIO Y SIGUE CAMBIANDO A TRABEZ DE MILES DE FACTORES QUE MODIFICAN NUESTRA CONDICION HUMANA.

dkl61MSJaa	to be a writer you have to have read 12465894987234 books.     :)     Ha, sorry! Yeah I don't think that matters. No one ever says to an artist or a musician that they have to have studied x amount of artists, or listened to x amount of albums/songs/etc.     I would however, strongly recommend, that you read Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilker. It is the single most inspirational book I have ever read. I am studying design at university, and although the book is written from one writer to another, the words Rilker writes are so poignant it doesn't matter. I have read it at least 10 times (barely 80-100 pages, depending on which edition you buy) and each time it leaves me with such an overwhelming urge to create and stay true to myself and my work.     Read that book at least once before you start writing. It will change everything; I guarantee it.|`|Ai9VR41Waa	Reading does help to expand your vocabulary and your mind and it helps you to weed out what you like and don't like but don't base all that on your actual writing abilities.  You don't have to read a certain number of books to write one.  Your style is going to be your own and no one else's so don't base what you write on anyone else's.    My first novel was published in October and I am currently writing my second one -- so just begin, have fun and use your own timetable, in other words, write at your own pace.  Good luck to you!|`|AA10015648	You've gotta start somewhere :D Don't be scared, just go for it!    Easy for someone else to say, of course, but the biggest hurdle is making a plan and then sticking to it. You can't just start writing and keep writing and hope you'll get somewhere... that's like building a house without a blueprint and just hoping all the pieces will fit together. Know your story before you write it. But don't get TOO detailed in your plan... you've gotta have room for spontaneous ideas to grow as you write.     Another big step is to have to have someone to read for you, and give you good, honest reactions to the story. Often you need someone who's not obsessed with grammar... like, not an editor... you need a READER, who can tell you how they feel about the characters, how the action is moving along, whether or not they'd read more.    Reading books helps you see how writing can be effective, but it's not completely necessary in order to be a writer. There's no book quota on becoming a writer, so don't worry about it :D|`|n5NltZVGaa	I am a writer and I say to you, just start writing.  It doesn't matter whether you write well or not, just that you write and something will rise worth public praise.  Reading feeds you with the knowledge you need to hold interest and increase vocabulary, illustrate conflict and eventually hold down a great plot.  Don't discouraged, but don't make the mistake of ever stopping your reading.  You can't read too much and there is no set number to read before writing.  Read, read, read, and do as much writing, even if you throw everything away.  You're 17?  Write now, don't wait.  There might not be anything spectacular about your work, yet, but have patience and never give in to discouragement if writing is something you're serious about.

4hsc6mUuaa	Hmm...it's an interesting start, especially at the end of the passage because it keeps the reader wondering what's going to happen and why the Jets are protecting Eva.     However, I do think some improvements can be made.     I noticed immediately that you like to use some key words multiple times which makes reading a little too repetitive and distracting. The same goes for your phrasing, especially when you describe the Jets (e.g. hair color and eye color); it gets systematic for the reader and gives your characters very little depth.     Also, the beginning feels a little awkward because the sentences and what you're trying to convey seem too disjointed. A lot of them could be combined for more efficiency and variety of style.    There are some grammatical issues, but those aren't anything that take away from the overall piece.     I liked it a lot and with a little tweaking, it could make for a really fun story! Thanks for letting me critique your work and hope this helps!
HJaVcUGwaa	I am not very familiar with the Simon Wiesenthal Centre.  However, as a Jewish Human Rights Organization, they need to maintain their credibility by condemning extremism and terrorism committed by Jews too.  Otherwise people will consider them as one-sided and a propaganda machine for Israel.    Other Israeli human rights groups have been condemning extremism on both sides of the conflict (such as B'Tselem), and those people have much more credibility.|`|HXgeesBqaa	According to its mission statement, it is "an international Jewish human rights organization dedicated to repairing the world one step at a time. The Centers multifaceted mission generates changes through the Snider Social Action Institute and education by confronting antisemitism, hate and terrorism, promoting human rights and dignity, standing with Israel, defending the safety of Jews worldwide, and teaching the lessons of the Holocaust for future generations."    They don' t profess to identify and oppose all discrimination.

S2ja9luxaa	He believes that Ophelia is "in on" what  Claudius and Polonius are doing, trying to find out what's wrong with Hamlet.  Polonius and Claudius attribute Hamlet's odd behavior to love for Ophelia, so they use her to find out if that is actually the case.  He tells her to "get thee to a nunnery" -- a play on words, meaning either an actual nunnery or a brothel.  Both are mean-spirited, though, so it drives Ophelia away.  When she dies, Hamlet seems to realize his mistake and professes his love for her.    It is a highly debated topic all around--whether he loves her or not.  It's kind of a grey area.|`|YdoH6cKmaa	Hamlet says he is not interested in Ophelia (anymore) and wants her to go to a nunnery to protect her from harm which is about to come to Hamlet's family.

So for a philosopher to influence Greek thought, it means that he was also some kind of geographer, and biologist very knowledgeable like Aristotle, to such extent that Greeks would pick up his ideas.    So, first define what a philosopher was at the time.  Lover of wisdom is the true meaning in Greek, but it is vague.    Secondly, I went on Google for you and I was shipped from one site to another without real substantial answer.    All I found was what I am going to write as a source below.    But I think that the Pre-Socratic philosophers were infinitely superior to Socrates, Plato.  Not Aristotle.    So, there is to investigate here.  And Google gives sites for the Pre-socratic philo.    As for Plato, in fact, HE was influenced by Greek thought.  He was an aristocrat who disdained (despised) artisans, craftsmen, people living from their manual works.  I am not an admirator of Plato.    Good luck!
R02aazVdaa	I'm glad you're inspired to pursue a talent, but age is just a number.    It's not bad, and it paints a very vivid picture in my head, but there are barely complete sentences. The format is more like a diary or a journal log rather than a story. Also, it's a bit repetitive and I wasn't sure what you are trying to tell me. Yes, the character is experiencing insomnia, but what else?|`|MaxNGodIaa	That is really good..|`|5d69096a97f9015e41817b901338a7cbaa	anyone can be an author.  if you write something you're a author.    As far as being published it takes a lot of time, a lot of skill and a lot of luck.  So who knows.|`|VtFIlYWJaa	you're 11. this isn't good. wait until you are a little older. for 11, this is okay. just wait until your writing style and voice stands out more. honestly, this isn't very good at all. but hey, you wanted honesty.|`|OeKgopilaa	that's amazing! Yes it needs some work, but its wonderful so far! Keep going!|`|DW7J8huQaa	If you put in the time and effort and research the publishing process, I don't see why you can't get published.  Keep at it!  Learn all you can about writing and publishing.  It will help.|`|GUmQlcBuaa	Yes, you do have great talent. In order to be known as a "good author", you have to real your readers in. In that paragraph, if you were to finish it off with explaining what happened, the reader would then be uninterested and shut the book. Since you made it so mysterious, the reader would want to know what just happen, more in depth. I know that if this were a book, I would keep reading until I found out about that scene.     Good luck!|`|sMDYcLzDaa	Keep working at it like you said. I love writing and I have ADHD so when I went to get a prescription from this guy at the hospital (professional not some dealer lol) he told me to take an evaluation test. Months later when I went he brought it up again and told me to keep working at writing because I have a high score in language, but most people that do don't keep at it and it gets lower and lower. He said that there was a guy who was getting 90% ( A I guess u would call them) but he didn't keep at it and it dropped to a 60%. So ur writing is good but don't get bored of it like many people do and stop writing all together.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Age is not the issue.    I have read stories written by 10 year olds and they were excellent.    Yours need a lot of work.  First off, it's not a story.  They are just random thoughts.    You have spelling, grammar and sentence structure problems.    My advice:  Read a lot of books, both good and bad so that you'll know the difference.  Write everyday for practice.  Buy or borrow some books on the art of writing.  There are many excellent ones out there.|`|R0iHHPqEaa	OK this does need some work. But you're 11 years old! That's amazing. Sure you won't be published now but for an 11 year old you write very, very well! Keep it up!
b6a987550f582ba088fcd9ab0f50f52aaa	--You might consider reading some other books by Dick--he tends to be rather dark, although he also tends to be a bit theological (in a very twisted way).  I feel okay recommending A Maze of Death.  --Anything by Chuck Palahniuk will probably suit you.  Drug references vary, but trust me, his books are quite twisted.  Survivor is a good one to start with.  --For the ultimate tale of drugs and debauchery, read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, by Hunter S. Thompson.  It's a trip, believe me.  You'll find it in nonfiction--exact category varies.  Actually, most of his stuff is either sports related, or a massive trip.  Even the biographies (or perhaps especially the biographies).    --Just wanted to agree with the last guy on A Clockwork Orange.  How'd I forget that one?  The slang is a malenky bit tricky to get a hang of, but's definitely a must read.|`|X2zwBlgJaa	there isn't rly drugs, btu there is Poison, and killing, arrows, guns, fighting, and ur basic horror movie, IN A BOOK!  read the Cirque du Freak series!!!!    they are the best!!! its a vampire story  a kid goes to a freak show with his best friend. and the freak show is well, FREAKY! Darren (the main character) comes to the place where the show was and steals one of the acts, the spider. little did darren know is that his best friend would be bitten by the spider and come near death. Darren must chose between saving his friend, or becoming half vampire and assisting mr. crepsly. the original owner of the spider is a vampire, and is the only one known to Darren who has the anti-dote to this deadly venom. Darren chooses to save his friend, and becomes a half vampire. this is his story of his like as a half vampire.    ive had all the books since yesterday, (1/31/09) and am already on book 4 (2/1/09) i  THIS STORY IS NOT LIKE TWILIGHT IN MOST WAYS.    *edit* this series has twelve books in it.  the first is Cirque Du Freak, ask for that, and any library or book store will know what your talking about|`|8THbk2PCaa	A Scanner Darkly is an excellent work. See the movie if you haven't already. I'd recommend picking up either Brave New World or 1984, both deal with some of the same concepts as A Scanner Darkly, but treat it as if everything that was happening in A Scanner Darkly was already fully realized. I like to think of A Scanner Darkly as a sort of prequel to 1984/Brave New World and other dystopian novels.|`|a9Cb4NyXaa	anything by ellen hopkins!!! all her books are amazing.  i personally like crank and identical is mind blowing!!|`|b0441ed0081d3155a746d2d9a804662caa	I hear that books by Ellen Hopkins, are amazing. Just as the first person said, that answered the question.    I just checked out her book Impulse from the school library. It looks good, I hear that burned and crank are the best though, I think that they would be worth it to check out.    I hear that they are very emotion and tell true relate story's  Also, I don't know if you would like this book or not, but Go Ask Alice would be good to read if you want to read something about drugs. It's about a normal teenage girl who gets addicted. It's really mind blowing. I totally suggest it.|`|Z5xy4uHJaa	a child called it (totally what your looking for)  staying fat for sarah burns (sounds bad but it's not that bad)  the glass castle (really sad and twisted book)|`|tGDOZrUTaa	Not necessarily drugs per se, but try 'Gravity's Rainbow' by Pynchon. "A screaming comes across the sky..." It's one heck of a trip, though, and you may want to start with 'The Crying of Lot 49,' which is shorter.    Anthony Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange' is a twisted dystopia, as is the old classic, Orwell's '1984.' Both are good reads and, compared to 'Gravity's Rainbow,' shorter ones.    If you liked 'A Scanner Darkly' and want a Dick book with drugs, try 'Ubik.'|`|nNtSmkE1aa	you should read the preachers son soo good its about how this preachers son is dating this girl and the family never met the girl until the day of  there wedding and it turns out that the girl is the preachers daughter from another mother lol

IT306Kytaa	Academy of Art University|`|b18c4b881258353c695bcc4dcebd1353aa	there are tons. of schools to go to and depending on where your at or want to be. In New York City my personal favorite is School of Visual Arts. They only teach art majors. There are so many schools that cater to art it hard to pin on perfect school. It also depends on what you like the best. maybe a good liberal arts school like a state school would be good for you to get an undergraduate degree in studio art or graphic design. then be more selective in a grad school. I went to a private liberal arts college then went to Carnegie Mellon University for master of fine arts which you need for just about any art career, a bachelors don't cut it anymore. I'm a gallery directory and kind of an art historian and I want to go back for my doctorate. take it slow I just wanted to take a few art classes to get a tattoo apprenticeship look where it can take you. start small and get big it will help you shape your career in art.

Here's part of the summary as well as the Amazon.com link:    The ability to evoke both present-day and historical events, signaled in his praised Ferney, is evident in Long's new novel, again a mixture of contemporary and flashback scenes. Patrick Kane, aka notorious British rock star Paddy Kane, has retreated from his former celebrity life to repent the violent excesses on which his career was based, and the harm he did his late wife, Rachel. Having totally left the music world, he's now burying himself in archeology his first love in a dig-for-profit run by a corporation in the tiny village of Wytchlow.

Richard Nixon: The 37th President of the United States. After it came to light that he had been involved in illegal activities, including wiretapping and harassment of political opponents in the Watergate scandal, Nixon lied and tried to cover up the misdeeds.

It is about foods such as spam and vienna sasuage, potted meats. You have to remember that it was written many years ago and while today things are still nasty, they aren't anywhere near as bad as they were back then. One of the stories that inspired him to write the book was when a worker fell into the grinder, got mixed in with the meat, and the meat was still shipped out to stores. It details how they used rotten meat and everything that went on before health codes.

DEYvhPtpaa	Definatly read either Night by Elie Weisel or The Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank. You already know a lot about the holocaust, so you should be able to pick out all the aspects in the book about the time. They are also shorter books, but long enough to give you the details.     Night is better, because it is actually about his experience in the concentration camp, not about hiding.|`|WZlVAQWdaa	Wikipedia
nWdh9Itaaa	Austria started the war with declaring war on Serbia. This declaration triggered the various defence unions of that time and dragged all of the other major European powers into the ensuing conflict. So, if there is anybody to blame then it is Austria.    The treaty of Versailles was not about punishing the initally responsible country though. The war was astonishingly costly and the Allies wanted Germany to pay reparations simply because Germany had been their most powerful opponent in World War I. The reparations also had the positive side effect of weakening Germany's economical power for a long time. Especially France was very interested in weakening Germany as much as possible which was probably the most important reason why France insisted on the reparations.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	The war began on August 3rd 1914 when Germany declared war on France, saying that they had infringed upon Germany's territory.    Obviously there were issues before that time, but Germany was one of the main powers who advanced early into France.    That may be the reason why but its a bit of a grey area.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	The Allies were looking for somebody to pay reparations, and Germany had the capacity to pay some, where the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire weren't promising sources of income. Since the German army had already gone home, Germany was in no position to object.|`|5VD9fVa1aa	They lost the war, so the winners made them accept responsibility for starting it.  That's what you get for losing.|`|0xfVyxxIaa	Because they manipulated their Austro-Hungarian allies to pressure their Balkan neighbours, for the purpose of starting the war. Germany wanted a war because they were convinced they could defeat France with the Schleiffen plan and become the worlds foremost power. With a deciesive victory over France they could replace them with a puppet regime and even take some direct control of more French territory and most importantly get all of France's overseas colonies. Then they would replace Great Britain as the worlds foremost power and concentrate on subdueing Russia.    They also usurped the leadership of the Ottoman empire with their agents Enver Pasha and the other 'young turks' which pushed them towards a German alliance and a nationalist movement that resulted in oppression of non-Turkish Ottoman subjects and the Armenian genocide.    So while the Entente with their nationalism and immoral diplomacy aren't innocent, Germany were most certainly the catalyst for the war.    Oh yeah, and they also lost the war (despite victors France and Belgium being more damaged by German pillaging)...|`|PvE5ySCiaa	Germany started the war using the pretext of the assignation of the ArchDuke Ferdinand. The Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to accept responsibility for the war, thus allowing the treaty to require disarmament and forcing germany to make reparations(Payments for loss or damages)  to the winning sides.    So the answer is that this was a way to get Germany to disarm and pay for the war costs.

fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	If your goal is to support your family I would advise against going into the field of casting. It is a slow process to work your way up to being a top earning CD. First you will start out as an unpaid intern or a very low paid assistant. From there you may become an associate or a casting director but this usually takes quite awhile. If you start out independently you will have to spend years trying to establish yourself and you will be working project to project which means that you will likely have periods where you have no money coming in at all. If you get hired by a studio the process is as I mentioned above. But even the studios may have slow periods and your income will constantly being going up and down which is a scary way to live for someone who is supporting a family.      If you are young, do not have a family yet, have time and don't need to be earning much money for many years then you can give it a go. But if you are in an immediate need of a steady income I highly recommend looking into a different field.|`|9yMRbtK5aa	being a big-deal casting director takes a lot of time and hard work.   but the median expected salary in the united states is $55,337

N0A8mCuzaa	"Cinderella"  "Is that a disease?"     Bloody 'ell! (Hell in brit accent)    "Wow, I wonder what it'd be like to have a difficult life?"        -- Harry, sarcastically     "Oh, it's you, is it? I suppose you've been doing something dangerous again?"        -- Poppy Pomfrey to Harry Potter     "I don't go looking for trouble. Trouble usually finds me."       -- Harry Potter     "If we die for them, I'll kill you Harry"   -- Ron to harry    Ron: "Yeah, and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'There's no wood,' honestly."     "Hang on..." Harry muttered to Ron. "There's an empty chair at the staff table.... Where's Snape?"  "Maybe he's ill!" said Ron hopefully.  "Maybe he's left," said Harry, 'because he missed out on the Defence Against the Dark Arts job again!"  "Or he might have been sacked!" said Ron enthusiastically. "I mean, everyone hates him --"  "Or maybe," said a very cold voice right behind them, "he's waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train."  Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble.    Peeves: "Oh Potter, you rotter, oh what have you done, / You're killing off students, you think it's good fun--"   ROFL    Fred & George: "Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through." ROFL    Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red and muttered "hello" without looking at him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, "Harry. How nice to see you."   "Hello, Percy," said Harry, trying not to laugh.   "I hope you're well?" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.   "Very well, thanks--"   "Harry!" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. "Simply splendid to see you, old boy--"   "Marvelous,"' said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in turn. "Absolutely spiffing." (PA4)       "You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!" He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. "Too late now, Potter! They'll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well -- second -- Diggory was the f--"  It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down on the floor.  Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.  "Thought we'd see what those three were up to," said Fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.  "Interesting effect," said George, looking down at Crabbe. "Who used the Furnunculus Curse?"  "Me," said Harry.  "Odd," said George lightly, "I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two shouldn't be mixed."    "How long have you been 'Big D' then?" said Harry.  "Shut it," snarled Dudley, turning away again.  "Cool name," said Harry, grinning, "But you'll always be Ickle Diddykins to me."  "Shut your face."  "You don't tell her to shut her face. What about 'popkin' and 'Dinky Diddydums,' can I use them then?"     Fred: "You don't want to bottle your anger up like that, Harry, let it all out," said Fred, also beaming. "There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn't hear you."      'What's that? Said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar.  'Blimey,' said the other twin. 'Are you ?'  'He is,' said the first twin. 'Aren't' you?' he added to Harry.  'What?' said Harry.  'Harry Potter,' chorused the twins.  'Oh, him,' said Harry, 'I mean, yes, I am.'       'Now, you two  this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've  you've blown up a toilet or '  'Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.'  'Great idea though, thanks, Mum.'  'It's not funny. And look after Ron.'  'Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.'  'Shut up,' said Ron again.  ...  'Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.'  'We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.'  'George!'       'Oh, are you a Prefect, Percy?' said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. 'You should have said something, we had no idea.'  'Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,' said the other twin. 'Once '  'Or twice'  'A minute '  'All summer'  'Oh, shut up,' said Percy the Prefect.      'Merry Christmas!'  'Hey, look  Harry's got a Weasley jumper, too!'  Fred and George were wearing blue jumpers, one with a large yellow F on it, the other with a large yellow G.  'Harry's is better than ours, though,' said Fred, holding up Harry's jumper. 'She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.'  'Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?' George demanded. 'Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.'  'I hate maroon,' Ron moaned half-heartedly as he pulled it over his head.  |`|EYKnlm62aa	I have several:    'Now, you two  this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've  you've blown up a toilet or '  'Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.'  'Great idea though, thanks, Mum.'     then when Harry's in the hospital wing at the end talking to Dumbledore, and Dumbledore reveals that the twins tried to send Harry a toilet seat, but Madame Pomfrey wouldn't let it in as it was unsanitary.  (from PS/SS)  I love the running jokes.    When Malfoy (after being a ferret earlier) tries to insult Hermione in GoF when their talking about ball dates and Hermione replies, "Oh hi Professor Moody."  Malfoy jumps, and Hermione quips "Twitchy little ferret aren't you Malfoy?"    but the fact remains he (voldemort) can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to.  (during Potterwatch in DH)    In GoF when they're visiting Dobby in the kitchen:  Ron:  Percy wouldn't recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy.    Harry and Snape in DADA class in HBP:  Snape: Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?  Harry: Yes   Snape: Yes, sir.  Harry: There's no need to call me 'sir', Professor.    Give her hell from us, Peeves.  And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat and sprang into a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause (and then the fact that Peeves does so ending in running Umbridge out of the castle)      PoA  Percy held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, 'Harry. How nice to see you.'  'Hello, Percy,' said Harry, trying not to laugh.  'I hope you are well?' said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.  'Very well, thanks-'  'Harry!' said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. 'Simply *splendid* to see you, old boy-'  'Marvellous,' said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in turn. 'Absolutely spiffing.'  Percy scowled.  'That's enough, now,' said Mrs. Weasley.  'Mum!' said Fred, as though he'd only just spotted her, and seized her hand, too. 'How really corking to see you-'    And of course the best line in the entire series (in my opinion)  NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU *****! (Molly Weasley to Bellatrix)|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	When Harry's practising his summoning charm before the dragon task  A fly zoomed into Harry's hand.

Published in 1949, it is set in the eponymous year and focuses on a repressive, totalitarian regime. The story follows the life of one seemingly insignificant man, Winston Smith, a civil servant assigned the task of falsifying records and political literature, thus effectively perpetuating propaganda, who grows disillusioned with his meagre existence and so begins an ultimately futile rebellion against the system.    The novel has become famous for its portrayal of surveillance and government's increasing encroachment on the rights of the individual.

FaX8awk1aa	The Third Crusade (11891192), also known as the Kings' Crusade, was an attempt by European leaders to reconquer the Holy Land from Saladin (Salh al-Dn Ysuf ibn Ayyb).    After the failure of the Second Crusade, the Zengid dynasty controlled a unified Syria and engaged in a conflict with the Fatimid rulers of Egypt, which ultimately resulted in the unification of Egyptian and Syrian forces under the command of Saladin, who employed them to reduce the Christian states and to recapture Jerusalem in 1187. Spurred by religious zeal, Henry II of England and Philip II of France ended their conflict with each other to lead a new Crusade (although Henry's death in 1189 put the English contingent under the command of Richard I instead). The elderly Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa responded to the call to arms, and led a massive army across Anatolia, but died from drowning before reaching the Holy Land. Many of his discouraged troops left to go home.    After some military successes, the Christian powers argued over the spoils of war; frustrated with Richard, Frederick's successor, Leopold V of Austria and Philip left the Holy Land in August 1191. On September 2, 1192, Richard and Saladin finalized a treaty by which Jerusalem would remain under Muslim control, but which also allowed unarmed Christian pilgrims to visit the city. Richard departed the Holy Land on October 9. The failure of the Third Crusade would lead to the call for a Fourth Crusade six years later.

OjQxKGC0aa	The odds of getting any book published are one in 10,000. The odds of getting a vampire novel published are probably 50 times that, or one in 500,000. It is possible, but highly unlikely.     Still, you have to write what you want to write. Stephen King wanted to write horror novels at a time when no one was interested in publishing horror novels. He collected enough rejection letters to wallpaper his office with them. But he just kept writing and submitting, writing and submitting until he eventually sold Carrie, his first novel.     Of course, Stephen King had talent. He had a degree in English, and he had a critique partner in his wife, Tabitha.     The odds are bad, but there are things you can do to help swing them more to your favor. You need talent, feedback, a willingness to listen to feedback, perseverance, time to write and rewrite manuscripts, and you need to study the craft.      Or you can self-publish, but then the question becomes "Can a new writer get readers to buy a book about vampires?"|`|pQGUPITeaa	Yes, but it would have to be COMPLETELY different from "Twilight" and original and well-written.    No teenagers, no love story, no sparkling, no werewolves and no "vegetarians".|`|tGDOZrUTaa	It needs to be not just 'about vampires,' but have a take on them that's new and fresh.    "So this teenaged girl falls in love with this Heathcliff-like guy, except he's a vampire..." will get you straight into the slush pile, just like 'Goth vampires that swan around and wear pretty clothing' would have done in the days of Anne Rice and Poppy Z. Brite.    What's your new, original take on vampires? Presuming the book is well-written and the story is well-told, that will be the difference between sellable and slush pile.|`|efEsTQ9yaa	yea its fine you go for your dreams do your best if it get published i will deff, buy it       ps. put my name it it lol jk u dont have 2 (francecsa)|`|V6cTiFtYaa	i think that a vampire book will most likley be published if it's a good book|`|brEa9fFDaa	yes...you could get get your book published.It all depends on how well you've wriiten it!      And in my opion i think the twilight series is the best so far.  but you just have to write it and see how it goes|`|9WuqMoDqaa	I think it would definately be overlooked. Especially if its about vampires. No one wants some Stephenie Meyer wannabe clogging up their office with fanfiction. If you really think you wrote a good story that has your best effort it it, you should have an adult friend of yours, maybe your mom or someone in the family, to send it in for you.|`|HZubplhvaa	I don't think books get looked over merely by opinion or topic. It's about the writing and how society and its fans look at it.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	With all do respect I am sure the market is flooded vampire manuscripts  at publishing companies right now. Anytime something goes well seems many jump on the bandwagon. However after saying that if your book is outstanding it  will been seen. good luck.............|`|5ciDai7Paa	It all depends if it hooks the reader or not, if it does then yeah! Go for it!|`|0aEYjVzMaa	it really depends.  if it's REALLY good and the author spends a lot of time getting publicity for it then, yes, it can succeed.  but most vampire books will just be written off as a copy of twilight

It's more when I think of the book and the story that I remember.

Re-reading this always gives me a better view on a book and how I feel about it in general.|`|icIWjfPoaa	I have had similar experiences, with different books.|`|WZlVAQWdaa	Yer it happens to me.    Sometimes its just a random moment in the book but I get the feeling.|`|CGQ6w2KHaa	yes.  although.. most of my reading is done in either of 2 locations, either laying down in my bed reading, or in a bubblish chair in my room.     but regardless of always reading in the same places, sometimes, there are just certain parts of the novel, poem, or other piece of work that i read that just sticks out, and i remember reading it last time, or a thought i had about it last time..|`|HgRYP3cJaa	No, i get too absosrbed in the story all over again.|`|AA12065466	yes, i remember certain songs i was listening to or a smell|`|AA10015648	That happens to me all the time - especially with audiobooks.

I can salsa dance though =)|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	I can't dance, but i'll say tango. It just looks sexier lmao! =D|`|4G41Z3RJaa	There are different forms of Tango, either standard Ballroom Tango or Argentinean Tango. The Tango to be done properly will require contact with your partner at the hip, the Argentinean Tango has a lot of kicks and foot work between your partner's feet, or theirs between your feet. The Standard Tango is more of a smooth travelling dance. The Samba is a Latin Dance and generally is danced in a open or closed position, but not as much body contact, except for steps like the Samba Rolls. Samba is more of a fun, active dance than either the of the Tango's which are slower and the attitude is more sombre. I actually like all of them.

Sv9SQqyoaa	you have to be loud but not obnoxious  outgoing but not annoying   and happy but not freaky happy  you have to project  whenever you are asked to do a line  do it loud and  as well as you can  also be encouraging to other people   and show her that you will work hard  even if you don't get the part you want  still work really hard  and be the best of that character that you can be  learn the script quick and well   and then you will have a better shot  at getting the lead in the next play  it also partly has to do with your capabilities in acting  sometimes your look just doesn't fit the part  and that is ok, sometimes its ok to let someone else have the spotlight  though we do all want a little time for our own :)|`|sZGzUmLDaa	impress the teacher, try to get to know her better so she knows that you are like her/his friend and then they will know to choose you|`|sVFtRGBhaa	Be teacher's pet.

I dont know how your mom is or anything but when i sat my mom down and told her how i felt she now comes to my performances and shows.

MlZay5VHaa	*headpalm*  *headdesk*  *headwall*  *headfloor*  *headhammer*    Reposted for the millionth time:    I prefer Harry Potter. I dislike Twilight. The reason for my negative opinion of the Twilight books is mainly the underdeveloped characters. They're just too perfect and I can't relate to them. Edward of course is flawless so he doesn't need to develop at all. This irritates me because I enjoy reading about a character who grows and learns. Edward doesn't develop as a character. To me, he is just a blatant Gary-Stu. Bella is the same way. She is meant to have "flaws" when those flaws (clumsiness, modesty) can't be considered character flaws at all really. And, like Edward, she doesn't develop. And, forgive me for saying so, but she is just so dang annoying! She is a whinny damsel in distress who can't live without a man. In New Moon I was hoping to see a stronger Bella but I was greatly disappointed. One other thing that I dislike about the series is the lack of any moral or theme. After reading Eclipse I assumed that the books were about sacrificing for your loved ones, but Breaking Dawn proved me wrong; Bella sacrifices....nothing. Nothing at all. She gets everything, literally EVERYTHING that she wants. She turns into a beautiful vampire, she maintains a relationship with Jacob and her family, she has no weaknesses (weaknesses that someone in her situation would normally have) and she gets a great superpower *cough-marysue-cough*, and she even gets the perfect child to add to the giant heap of perfect characters. The only aspect of human life that she sacrifices is getting old, and she makes it obvious in the series that aging, to her, is extremely formidable. So you can't really consider it a sacrifice can you?    I hope I'm not offending any Twilight fans by saying this. It is just my opinion.|`|daza5A4vaa	Harry Potter, of course (:|`|bVIewZe9aa	twilight =]   Emma (:|`|L280cFeOaa	Harry Potter = Future Classic.    Twilight = The Hannah Montana of writing.

The difference between Harry Potter and Twilight is that Harry Potter has amazingly realistic characters (that actually have believable flaws), has an intricate plotlines that are all intertwined, is well-thought out and executed wonderfully, and is a future classic. Twilight is obscene, has no literary value, is a petty romance, has unrealistic characters that are really quite loathsome, and it will be used to fuel fires in sixty years.|`|zZNviNSEaa	As a reader of both, I think Twilight is a better story.

HXgeesBqaa	Most extermination camps were in Poland  Most work camps were in Germany, France, Romania and the Balkans.  It is estimated there were upwards of 15,000 concentration  camps in total.    Infamous Extermination camps:      * Auschwitz II (Auschwitz-Birkenau)      * Che?mno      * Be??ec      * Majdanek      * Sobibr      * Treblinka      * Maly Trostenets      * Jasenovac  They arrived at the camps mostly by rail as that was the most efficient way to move large groups of people|`|wnkoTEqVaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust|`|nxrEuJsRaa	Auschwitz-Birkenau in POland is the most notorious camp.People were cramped into trains for days without food/water before being met with the gas chambers.There were 3 main camps-I,II,III.   I was the main camp, II was Birkenau,III contained many sub camps.    this is a map of all the camps the Nazis used:    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...    there were a lot of ghettos,some camps were work camps,depending on who run the camp you may have survived. but if you went to Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen in Germany you had a high chance of dying. towards the end of the war Bergen-Belsen starved the people, cannibalism was frequent and so was typhoid and other diseases.    Leaves a bad taste in your mouth|`|Mb9K663Jaa	the camps were/r located mostly in germany,poland,romania and some other countries    auchswitz was the most deadly camp and    n they used trains to massively transport the people.    the link at the bottom has a LOT of info!!!|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	the camps were located outside of small villages  women and men's camps  Auschwitz   they got there by train|`|qVaaaT7Gaa	-where were the camps located?  They were located mostly around central and eastern Europe but also western Europe, everywhere really.    - what different category of camps are there?  There were 2 main types of camps The first were death camps. These served primarily for the purpose of carrying out the Final Solution the extermination of the Jews. Also other minorities such as homosexuals, resisstance members, gypsies, johavohs witnesses. The most famous one of these is Auschwitz/birkenau which is estimated to have killed 1.5 million people by the use of gas chambers. They were fitted with crematoriums to dispose of all the bodies.  2nd were labour camps used for slave labour. The prisoners here were more often non-jewish prisoners such as political prisoners. This is because the Jews had to be exterminated straight away. The most famous of these is Dachau which was the first camp that opened in 1933. It was seen as such a success that it was used as a model camp for the rest that followed. It was placed near a quarry where the prisoners would excavate a lot of stone, much of which was used to build/rebuild parts of germany.    -what are some infamous camps and why? Already mentioned above but some others worth looking into are sachsenhausen  and Terezin is also pretty interesting    - how did they get people there?   They were mainly moved by train. Rail became a valuable during the war as a method of transportation. The prisoner were moved in very poor conditions, shoved tightly into carriages. In winter this proved to be an effective way to  take some of the burden away from concentration camps. This is because up to 50% would die on the journey itself due to the freezing condtions.|`|Pvp1QnO4aa	I only know the last one,     and they got the people there by capturing them.|`|NaebenbXaa	theres like a camp of just people working and a killling camp where people just get killed|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	It'd be easier to Wiki this, but I'll take a stab at it.  The camps were located all over Germany and Poland. Berkanow and Auschwitz are two of the most famous ones. There were work camps, for the men and older boys only, where they would be put to work making a multitude of things. There was also concentration camps, or extermination camps to be more exact. These were strictly to eradicate the woman, the sick, the elderly, and the children. These were horrible places that were responsible for 80% of all the deaths during this terrible period. People were sent to these camps from the ghettos where the were separated. Cattle cars brought them to their deaths.  Hope this helps.|`|RXCbZlOAaa	- they were located all over Europe. A lot were in Poland. I know for a fact there were one or more in Warsaw, Poland  - the were work camps (where people were use to work, like making things for the nazi army), and then there were killing camps to... kill people..  - One infamous camp that a know of Is Auschwitz. It was infamous for its ironic sign above the gate into the camp :"Arbeit Macht Frei" which means work makes you free. Auschwitz was I killing camp I belive and it was also a work camp i'm pretty sure.   - Jews were usually rounded up into ghettos, or all Jewish communites that nazis patrolled. Some were killed right there in the ghettos, but others were rounde uop and told they were moving to a better area, etc.. and brough to concentration camps    hope this helps!|`|ky3B42f6aa	I am afraid you will have to do your own research as there were literarily thousands of camps scattered throughout Europe.  Some were local work camps, some were factory work camps such as used to built the V1 and V2, and many were simply extermination camps, either by meaningless hard work such as building a road that went nowhere (I have seen one north of Berlin) or simply shovin' in the oven.  And, need I repeat yet again -- just about as many homosexuals, socialists, communists, resistance fighters, partisans, and even POWs were killed as were Jews.  It was not only their private "Holocaust".  Of these many millions, very many were German citizens themselves.    As to how "they got there" -- Hitler decreed that all these people were "enemies of the state" (used then as the word "terrorist" is used now).  This was smart, because when the Gestapo came to get you, your neighbors said, "well, that is what such a fellow deserves".  Until it was their turn, of course.|`|rtsfPQqMaa	Camps were located all over Europe; Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Serbia, Norway, Belgium, Italy, Ukraine, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Austria, France, Chech Republic, etc.    Labour camps: concentration camps where interned inmates had to do hard physical labour under inhuman conditions and cruel treatment. Some of these camps were sub-camps of bigger camps, or "operational camps", established for a temporary need.     Transit and collection camps: camps where inmates were collected and routed to main camps, or temporarily held.   POW camps: concentration camps where prisoners of war were held after capture. These POW's endured torture and liquidation in a big scale.     Camps for rehabilitation and re-education of Poles: Camps where the intelligentsia of the ethnic Poles were held, and re-educated in light of German-Nazi values as slaves.     Hostage camps: camps where hostages were held and killed as reprisals.     Extermination camps: These camps differed from the rest, since not all of them were also concentration-camps. Although none of the categories is independent, and each camp could be classified as a mixture of several of the above, and all camps had some of the elements of an extermination camp, still systematic extermination of new-arrivals occurred in very specific camps. Of these, three were extermination camps, where all new-arrivals were simply killed -- The "Reinhardt Aktion" camps. Three others were concentration and extermination camps altogether. Others were at times classified as "minor extermination camps."     Displaced Persons Camp- after the war    I think you can find out the infamous camps and why- If you dont know any then you really need to do some reseach beyond Wikipedia and Google, because it is an event that can only be truely understood through ones personal resolve to lean about it.

8asG4WCwaa	Kari's right.  The first book is what counts, especially if you're an unknown author.      Agents and editors are interested in trilogies, but ONLY if the first book is good enough to make it on it's own.  There is no garauntee that sales will be good enough to make the nest book worthwhile, or that the next book will even be good enough to publish (it happens).    If the agent is interested in the manuscript, you can let them know then that you have sequels in mind.  If the first book is really, really good and the agent asks to look at your synopsis for the next book, you might lock into a three book contract - might being the important word. As an unknown, they still may not consider doing it.|`|DW7J8huQaa	One book only!!!! Most agents will not even give a look at the ms if you try to sell the trilogy.  You're pitching this book to them.  The trilogy doesn't happen unless this book sells.      Good luck!

He is mentally ill, and believes he is an 11-year-old boy called the "Avenger". When he really was eleven, he murdered a bully (Vaughn Masterson), and his grandfather, a former policeman. He was never caught because of his expert planning. Now, thirty years later, he is secretly in love with Jane and intends to hurt the boys who hurt her family. He creates the suspense in the novel and a potential threat to the main characters' lives.

bdnMQnVHaa	The Congress of Vienna was held in Vienna, the capital of Austria, at the time the Austrian Empire.  It was hosted by Francis I, the Emperor of Austria.    The chief negotiators were Klemons von Metternich of Austria, William von Humboldt for Prussia, Castlereagh and Wellington for Great Britain, Czar Alexander for Russia and Talleyrand for France.    It was held in 1815 after the downfall of Napoleon to try to restore Europe to what it was before the French Revolution.  On the service they almost achieve that with some minor differences.    Northern Italy (Milan and Venice) were added to Austria  Prussia received a large part of Saxony (an ally of Napoleon)  The Kingdom of the Netherlands was created from the old Dutch republic and Belgium was added to it.  The Germanic Confederation was created from the old Holy Roman Empire.  Poland was added to Russia    The Congress tried to restore the conservative monarchies of the previous century.  On  the surface it was successful.  The liberal elements of Europe were forced underground.  Liberal revolutions for the next two decades were suppressed, but eventually the conservative policies of Metternich would end in the Revolutions of 1848.|`|nZBVbVbkaa	Yeah the above answers are good as, and wikipedia is only good to get a rough idea as to what anything is about, as anyone can put anything on there, making it an unreliable source for rock hard evidence.

They were trying to figure out how to restabilise Europe after the napoleonic wars. They wanted to restructure the balance of power in Europe set up by the Peace of westphalia.    Prince Metternich tried to undermine nationalism, so as to prevent territorial losses by Austria.     The Congress of Vienna took place in 1814 to 1815.    But it was not held in Vienna.

[add] I forgot to address your posit on the cost of no right or wrong.  I don't believe there is any cost, because I believe that right and wrong only apply to facts, not opinions.  And that is how we function as a matter of course anyway.  So nothing really changes.    [2nd add]  Is a marble right or wrong?  Its right if you need one for a game of marbles, its wrong if its in your car engine.  But the marble itself is neither.|`|1rNVgEDIaa	The basic question is whether we can know the truth or what is the fact itself. The question of right and wrong comes after. Relativism teaches what is right for you might be irrelevant to other or might be simply wrong.|`|T4CZbRsSaa	sorry were with your partner we dont believe in right or wrong too its more like this way works, this way doesnt this way costs more, this way is faster shades of grey is all we see there is no black and white darker and lighter maybe but not black and white the cost of having this opinion is being ostracized  by our peers thinks most people want to believe in right and wrong because it makes things simpler|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	Can you give a specific example?      Who cares if there is no right or wrong in theory?  In practice there is almost always a winner.  "Might makes Right" as the saying goes.

Honestly, right and wrong are relative. Right and wrong do exist, at least in the mind, therefore since they exist in the mind they do exist. For example, a guy may think it is wrong for his girlfriend to hang out with our guys, and a girl may think it is right. Who is right "ultimately"? Who is wrong "ultimately"? Nobody. It is all personal feelings. In this kind of situation one person can give into the other or agree to disagree and move on. Ultimately I would say the situation I am referring to it is better to find someone who agrees with you on the subject of hanging around the opposite sex while in a relationship. This is just an example. Those style of right and wrongs are subjective not objective. Objective right and wrong as well as subjective right and wrong do exist. This can be displayed in the fact that she thinks you are wrong, therefore you argue. Whether or not there is right or wrong is highly reliant on the subject itself. I don't feel that there is a benefit on agreeing that there is no right or wrong in a relationship because then it is basically saying that it is alright to cheat. I highly doubt that subjectively either of you feel that it is ok for the other to cheat. It is really hard to decide for your question though because you leave out the variables in the arguments. Right and wrong are relative and without the variables it is hard to answer. What are the fights about? How does this theory that there is no right or wrong come up? What is the subject? What are the arguments presented from both sides? What are both of your feelings? What are both of your needs? What kind of environment did you both grow up in? There are so many things to consider when deciding.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	like that hor, then why so many good for nothing spies spy me over a decade nearly come 2 decades for what ah? haha haha haha  and Yes I can and Yes I am right but not wrong.

There is always scope for professional calligraphy as an art form and people also set themselves up as handwriting or calligraphy teachers.  I don't know about qualifications, but if you want to teach it might help to become a member of one of the professional bodies, they accept you if they think your work is of a high enough standard.  This is the website of The Society of Scribes and Illuminators which should be helpful, look at the links page as well.  Good luck.  Source(s):  http://www.calligraphyonline.org/|`|RJY6aRQ9aa	Never heard of a qualification for it, might be different if your in America.

You can learn a lot about calligraphy from books and from seeing others' work.  The new multi-colored italic calligraphic art is particularly nice.  You can even develop your personal style.|`|kXCgQoYLaa	To some extent, you need a natural aptitude for this highly- specific skill,then endless practice, in a similar way to Chinese calligraphers, for whom its almost a way of life. You might be able to find a course to follow as part of a Graphic Design qualification. Once you're qualified, you can show and sell your work online, or take it to craft fairs. Commissions for wedding invites, certificates, posters, etc may follow. You could hold workshops to pass on your skills. In the meantime, study great works of calligraphy, like the ancient Irish masterpiece, The Book of Kells, {I saw it in Dublin, amazing!] and The Lindisfarne Gospels
e4tvh1d2aa	yes to all of the above.  their is a difference because we see things much differently.  the best points to see this in epistemology and morality.  once any application of metaphysics is seen within a society  it is altered and skewed by different definitions of knowledge and  wright and wrong.

Horses' heads vary in their conformation, but I think the area between its forehead and nose is a bit too wide, and the jaws are a bit too square.  However, it shows a lot of talent and is very clear for a black-and-white drawing, not scrubbed-looking as so many amateurs' work can be.|`|70266aa4d3e1b7d987168b83ae1804aaaa	You have a real talent for horses, which obviously goes down well at farmers markets etc.  I would say stick to horses, as I wasn't keen on the woman in your fantasy pic.

You definitley have a bright future ahead of you.   The second one is also very good, the shading and detail is well done. However it is not as good as the first one. On this one you should try and focus more on what the shading, and finer details such as around the mouth are like and this will give you a much more realistic look.   Very well done.|`|yiidhHOXaa	amazing!|`|rAa8bfhwaa	Took my breath away|`|jaAolejUaa	WOW!!!!!!!|`|atmDaT61aa	Thats really good but you might want to soften the lines they're kind of harsh|`|vGH9ghiKaa	Excellent picture, great drawing!|`|oK9WhUkiaa	beautiful =] well done. love the shading on it. u should make a Deviant account and submit it onto there =] x|`|RJY6aRQ9aa	It's really good.    I'll point out some of the things I would change/work on.  It's all very linear, that's alright when it comes to the mane(which looking at it, the lines could be finer) but where it's most noticeable in the nose, it's making the horse look more square that it should be. A smoother graduation from dark to light should be there, you seem to have black, medium, light and white, on the nose.  Also for the same reason the neck looks somewhat square. Just at the black shadow.    One last thing, use better paper, I can see your finger on the other side of the sheet. It looks a lot like tracing paper.      The proportions in the second look very out, also it lacks a lot of the detail of the first.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	very very very very excellent!!!!!!|`|TKYC9gsiaa	wow i dont even think that needs touch ups! thats amazing! :)|`|3MRgEzoiaa	DAY-UM!!!

2TLXfQKDaa	K I wasn't going to answer but I have to.  The nikon is very powerful, its 6mp will take you a long way (i have the nikon d40 and love it), but the sony is an extremely capable camera as well.  I have some buddies that prefer their cameras over mine (not just because of the 10mp - though it's helpful for the work they do).      It is true that nikon has a bajillion lenses, but unless you want to own every one out there that's not really an argument for it.  As long as you can get the lens you need in sony go for sony or whatever brand you may be looking at.  You can get adapters, no camera is really limited to a single brand as far as lenses.    The human factor here is all you really need to take a look at.  Do you need the larger pixel size?  Do some lens pre shopping, see what is out there that you know you'll want and how easy it will be to get with one over the other.  See which lenses have good/bad reviews.  Ergonomically, which one do you prefer - camera body and lens.  Make a list of reasons you prefer one over the other, this will help you more than a few biased opinions.    *gasp*  The d40 a toy?  No.  It's a means to an end for people that don't need anything better, but do still want a dSLR.  It's competitively priced, and a very capable camera.  No need to bash the d40, it IS the camera for some people just like the various other cameras are the choice for other people.|`|k8AcVixTaa	Nikon D40.  The true difference in MP is not that much and Nikon makes a far better camera.  I have one.|`|bxlYleZkaa	There are thousands of lenses which will fit the Nikon body, every sort of lens you can think of and a lot of the older, pre-digital ones will be very cheap too. If you are worried about the megapixel aspect of the D40 why not try the next  model up in the range, if you can afford it.|`|7ef302c48a8c059ad77a112fbc39af38aa	"The Nikon is only 6mp and the Sony is 10, would this matter? Would it be easier to get lenses to fit the Nikon or the Sony?"    first mega pixel doesn't matter unless you are going to crop things or do big things.    Sony's specs are good right now but they said the picture quality isn't like the D40    for the lens they said there is more option for D40 but they said the Sony can use some old lens.    THEY always say this.    THE OUTCOME IS CONTROLLED BY THE USER.  if you are crap, then it's crap. im not saying you are crap....  but if you are good, then it's good. im not saying you are good.    it's quite hard to compare because most site is bias.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Nikon is better and easier to get lenses.|`|4e55bf2d7b472d9d927ddf7c3220c25caa	Well, considering that the d40 is a toy, and an insult to call it a camera, it has to be the Sony.    The d40 is not much more than a toy, and people only buy it cos of the brand name, then realise they made a mistake.   If you can, why not go for the Sony 350?    The Sony having 10mp will mean a lot if you want to crop the image.  As for lenses, there is a list by following the link, and that is only just one store.  http://www.jessops.com/online.store/Prod...    If you are wanting macro, get some Omax Screw in close up lenses from ebay. They come in sizes of +1, +2, +4, and +10.  Very cheap.     Also, if you wanted to do HDR shots, the d40 DOESNT have auto bracketing.|`|tmdWJvuwaa	Get the NIKON, trust me the sony cameras aren't that good, I know because I have one and my friend has a Nikon and I love it. The Sony Camera is has|`|AsL8KhgLaa	Definitely go with Nikon. Lenses will be so much more easier to find for the Nikon.   In the long run, when you want to upgrade your camera, you'll have all your Nikon lenses and all you'll need is a new body. If you get the Sony, you're stuck in the tiny market. Nikon has many third-party lenses as well.|`|Nx0KZfoCaa	Ok...lenses first.  They are a wider range of Nikon Lenses than Sony ones...but you can generally speaking get any lens you need for whichever camera you buy so it's not really an issue.    MP isn't the only factor involved.  Size of the sensor also affects image quality...this is why a DSLR with 6MP will FAR out-perform a digital compact with 12MP.    My personal opinion would be to go with the Sony.  The Nikon is popular purely because of the brand...and owners think they have bought the worlds bestest camera ever because it's a Nikon.  In truth the D40 is a cut down version.  If I was going for a budget Nikon I'd look at a D80.    The Sony is a good body...I know a couple of people that use them and have not heard either say a bad word.  The sony has a number of features not included on the Nikon as well such as Auto-bracketing so my advice would be go for the Sony.

sjMIFH9Faa	The Spartans are an interesting group. I will post a few websites that I think will be useful. First, a few things that may be important:    The polis (city-state) known as Sparta was called Lacedaemon in antiquity, both terms mean the same thing, it is the same place. It took me a while to figure that one out.     Also, its difficult to get a good narative of Spartan history because of something Historians call the Spartan Mirage. The Spartan Mirage is a pro-Spartan bias that sometimes clouds reality. Much of what we "know" about Sparta comes from the writings of Xenophon, Plato, and Plutarch who idolized Sparta. Thus they spoke only of Sparta's good qualities and nothing about the bad. As a result, history is very kind to Sparta, but surely it has it losses, corruptions, and negative aspects like any other polis (city-state).     On to the links:  This has good primary documents:  http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/sparta.htm...    Good general history of Sparta:  http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Cities/Anc...      fordham stuff is always good:  http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/a...    More General Stuff:  http://www.sikyon.com/sparta/history_eg....    If you are into books, I like "Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History" by Sarah B. Pomeroy et al. I think Pomeroy also wrote a book just about Spartan Women, but I havent read it.    If you have questions, email me baseballkrba_10@yahoo.com|`|nWdh9Itaaa	There are yet other customs in Sparta which Lycurgus instituted in opposition to those of the rest of Hellas, and the following among them. We all know that in the generality of states every one devotes his full energy to the business of making money: one man as a tiller of the soil, another as a mariner, a third as a merchant, whilst others depend on various arts to earn a living. But at Sparta Lycurgus forbade his freeborn citizens to have anything whatsoever to do with the concerns of money-making. As freemen, he enjoined upon them to regard as their concern exclusively those activities upon which the foundations of civic liberty are based.    And indeed, one may well ask, for what reason should wealth be regarded as a matter for serious pursuit (1) in a community where, partly by a system of equal contributions to the necessaries of life, and partly by the maintenance of a common standard of living, the lawgiver placed so effectual a check upon the desire of riches for the sake of luxury? What inducement, for instance, would there be to make money, even for the sake of wearing apparel, in a state where personal adornment is held to lie not in the costliness of the clothes they wear, but in the healthy condition of the body to be clothed? Nor again could there be much inducement to amass wealth, in order to be able to expend it on the members of a common mess, where the legislator had made it seem far more glorious that a man should help his fellows by the labour of his body than by costly outlay. The latter being, as he finely phrased it, the function of wealth, the former an activity of the soul.     (1) See Plut. "Lycurg." 10 (Clough, i. 96).    He went a step further, and set up a strong barrier (even in a society such as I have described) against the pursuance of money-making by wrongful means. (2) In the first place, he established a coinage (3) of so extraordinary a sort, that even a single sum of ten minas (4) could not come into a house without attracting the notice, either of the master himself, or of some member of his household. In fact, it would occupy a considerable space, and need a waggon to carry it. Gold and silver themselves, moreover, are liable to search, (5) and in case of detection, the possessor subjected to a penalty. In fact, to repeat the question asked above, for what reason should money-making become an earnest pursuit in a community where the possession of wealth entails more pain than its employment brings satisfaction?     (2) Or, "against illegitimate commerce."     (3) See Plut. "Lycurg." 9 (Clough, i. 94).     (4) = 40 pounds, circa.     (5) See Grote, "H. G." ix. 320; Aristot. "Pol." ii. 9, 37.              [NOTE: This excerpt is only dealing with Spartan citizens. It does not deal with the perioeci who were free, but who were denied full citizenship. It does also not deal with the helots who were brutally subdued and exploited by the Spartans.]

g8kIjpwSaa	To really capture what your "eyes see"....that is, the full range of lights and darks and colors, look into HDR photography.

Just try to do both.  : )|`|QtCQtXDVaa	Well, that depends on the starting point. Some people in life have to learn to think more of others instead of themselves. Become more humble. But other people have to learn to think more and act more in favor of themselves instead of trying to make others happy and adjust. Become more selfish, as to not being eaten up by others. Its all about attaining the right balance. A balanced person will know exactly what is right in any situation and act according to his/her high inner morals.

WJLl0d3Jaa	Edwin gives very good advice, basically you'll want the wide angle portion for landscapes (18-49). All you need is a tripod, ability to be at a good location, and compose it well.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Hello Louis:    Your 18-55mm lens will be fine for landscapes.     For the very best results:    1) Have your camera on a tripod.    2) Set your camera for its maximum resolution and use the Aperture Priority Mode. Let the camera worry about the shutter speed.    3) Use ISO 100.    4) Use the short (18mm) end of your zoom for a wide, sweeping view of the scene. According to http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html if you use 18mm at f16 and focus to 4' your depth of field will be from 1' 10" to infinity.    5) Use the camera's self-timer to release the shutter.    If your lens has Nikon's Vibration Reduction be sure to turn if "OFF" when using the camera on a tripod.|`|a25d33c1f7915100af903f928df66e3caa	not really. however, if you have ample light for the landscapes they will be good enough. bring them into a software program to edit them, such as lightroom 2 by adobe.   i like fixed focal lengths for landscapes. try a 28mm. good lens.   also a good one would be the 50mm 1.4. REALLY  cheap online.   thats just me personally. with the kit lens. its not that great of glass. plus there are a lot of ghosts that pop up if your not careful. well good luck|`|UnVkjwNpaa	18-55 is fine. There is always a chance you will need a greater focal length but most landscape work is at the wider end of the range. A prime lens will give better quality but unless you have lots of spare cash and don't mind carrying loads of lenses around with you I'd suggest sticking to the zoom, at least for now. The money saved will be much better spent on a decent tripod which is generally very important for landscape work. Get yourself a 55-300 and the two should cover you for most things.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	There is no one in Yahoo Answers who could tell the difference between a picture taken with an 18-55mm kit lens and a prime lens when it comes to landscapes.  So those who tell you it will not work well are a bit out of their minds.

No one was alive at that time. Read your history books they are full of fiction.|`|j6li6xYBaa	Just as one of the others said, it depends...  Slaves were kidnapped from their homeland, shackled, and shipped to America.  Sometimes they were sold as families other times split apart from each other and sold separately.  There were house slaves who cooked, cleaned, laundry, served, laid out clothes, brushed hair, did everything a servant would do.  Then there were the slaves who worked outside living in shacks, working from daylight to night.  They would pick cotton which has sharp thorns on the bushes, with no gloves.    Some of the slave masters were generous to their slaves and taught them to read and wright, and clothed them properly.  Other were not as fortunate.  Some of the slave women were rapped by the owners and made to have their babies, but the fathers would never claim them.  They were beaten and often killed if they tried to escape.    During that time not everyone in the South were for slavery, that's how the Underground Railroad came about.  It was an underground system built under houses to help slaves escape to the north.  Research this it's some pretty deep history with disturbing and life saving endings.|`|99hfFssXaa	pretty ghetto|`|OwQsCR4Saa	I think you need a time machine.|`|IkXU06wpaa	boring & lifeless|`|TufsEE2baa	Of course it was horrible !!

Shame on him!|`|MWA3s32Uaa	It depends where the slave was stationed. If they were a 'house ngro', it probably wasn't much different than being a maid in a wealthy home. In fact, many of the slaves in this position preferred where they were, as it wasn't that oppressive.    As for those in the cotton fields, I suspect that it was comparatively worse. They would have to work for many hours without gloves, picking cottong, and sleep in shanty tenements. Quite poor, to say the least. But safer than any ghetto.

FMMWq3kaaa	Resolution is measured and expressed in dpi, or dots per inch. This is a ratio of the number of dots, pixels, etc to the length of one side of the image.    When you resize an image to a larger size, you are increasing the length of each side of the image. This changes the ratio to be a smaller number, or lower resolution.     The only way to enlarge the photo without changing the resolution is to add pixels while you are adding size. Unfortunately, this is generally impossible.    Some programs exist that allow you to resize images, but none of them....I repeat....NONE of them will allow you to enlarge an image while maintaining the same resolution.|`|1X3fvm16aa	You can open your file in Photoshop and click on Image>Image Size. There you are able to change the Resolution and / or size. 300 dpi or better is good for print quality.  From there select View>Actual Pixels. This will show you how the photo will look when printed. If it is of bad quality the only way to restore it is by placing a filter to make it look like it was supposed to look another way or you could take the clone stamp and try to smooth it pixel by pixel.     Unfortunately, Photoshop is not free.|`|1CABRATlaa	Screen Dash can also do it.  If it extremely bad resolution you should just use the photo editing tool sharpness and it will make it look significantly better.|`|VMVW3E7Aaa	Photoshop can do it within reason. Genuine Fractals does an even better job.  Neither are free and both need to have a VERY good photo to start off with.    So in a nutshell, the answer to your question should probably be: no, it can't be done.
GRmOTBdFaa	The best software by far has to be Adobe Flash, a free trail is available from the website:  www.adobe.com/products/flash  You will get 30 days from here for free, there is also a crack available I believe. Have a look on torrentz.com if you use them and it's there I've heard.  Flash works mainly by showing a timeline and numbered frames, there are also tools that allow you to create simple animations without puttin a new images on each frame using tweens. So, for example you could show a plane going accross the screen using a tween and it would take around a minute to do.    Also loads of tools on it for imaging and loads of tutorials etc available online.    www.cartoonsmart.com has tutorials you can buy and also some for free, I have only seen the free ones to be honest and they are very good. I will be buying some of them one day no doubt, just need the cash.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	I've been having some fun with this:    http://www.les-stooges.org/pascal/pencil...

The best in general (but hugely expensive and impossible to pirate) is Toonboom Digital pro.      If you can download a copy of Adobe flash it's the best one that is readily available. It is a bit tricky at first but there is a huge amount of online content. forums websites, tutorials etc..       If you want a legit copy of a program Anime studio is the most affordable but is still pretty good.

GVcO1dtnaa	Yeah I was to when I first went to buy strings. There are a lot of different sizes and brands. But I would suggest a 9 set. It will say 009. The number refers to the thickness of the 6th string. A 9 set is Skinner than average but easier to play. The higher the number like 010. would mean all the strings are thicker. So good luck    I like this brand but you should experiment and find ones you like.    http://www.guitarcenter.com/Ernie-Ball-2...|`|7VpDEkC6aa	Hi there,  First of all, forget the dude who is giving you a hard time. He's just jealous that you probably have a better guitar that he does.    However, after a 1 1/2 years, it is a good idea to change your string set completely.  (usually the high E is the one that goes first, you must have been whacking out a heavy power chord set there. I think I've only broken one low E, maybe two at the most in my whole life, and I play classic heavy metal like Deep Purple and Black Sabbath)   But I digress.....  You probably were using the factory set of strings which are commonly "light" gauge or .010 gauge.  That means your High E is .010 and if I'm not mistaken the Low E is .046    Personally, I recommend Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky strings. The higher strings are extra light gauge .009's  and the wound low strings are light gauge .010's    That makes soloing easier for string bends and such, but you still get good low end for power chords.    I've played Ernie Ball strings since 1975, and have used the Hybrid Slinky strings now for about 15-20 years.  They are inexpensive and play just fine, and last a long time if you take care of your strings.    You don't have to change your strings every month unless you have OCD and are totally anal about your guitar. Or don't know how to take care of your guitar.  A good set of strings can easily last 6 months if you take care of them. Wipe your strings off with a clean dry cloth after every time you play. This takes off all the finger oils, acid and sweat that you deposit on them. Keep it in a bag or case.     If you use a string spray like "Finger Ease" that can also increase string life.    The most commonly used string gauges are .009 and .010  extra light and light.  Most lead guitarists will use those.    There are also Super light strings .008.  but those are pretty wimpy and not good for power chords and snap pretty easily.    Heavy rhythm guitarists will use medium gauge .011 or medium heavy .012  Those gauges are also good if you plan to drop tune  (please don't!!  That's the lazy way to play. If you want to play those deep death metal songs, buy a 7 string guitar)    So Go for the orange Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky  http://www.guitarcenter.com/Ernie-Ball-2...    They are the best (in my own humble opinion)    And change your strings when they go dull or blackish as long as they still have some shine on em, go ahead and keep using them. It doesn't hurt anything and you won't be wasting money on new strings like a retard.|`|FViagGVEaa	So wait, for a year and a half you have NEVER changed your strings?  You should change them ONCE A MONTH  If you don't even know that rule, why the **** do you have a Gibson SG.    Gauges usually go by the thinest string, so gauge 11 means the high E is a .11 size string.  I say Ernie Ball strings are the best.  What size depends on what you play  You let me know that, I can help more    Yea russell, because his faded SG is sssoooooo much better than my $6000 custom made ESP.    A 900 dollar guitar is a little much for someone who has been playing for such a short time    Hey, for some reason trying to reply to your eMail failed twice so here is what i wrote:  Like i said, once a month is how often you should change them  If you play metal i suggest gauge 11 strings.  If you tune low i suggest 12's if D is your usual, 13's if C is usual.  If you drop tune i suggest Ernie ball Beefy Slinky (11's on high strings, 12's on low strings) for Drop D  Ernie Ball Not Even Slinky (12's on high strings, 13's on low strings) for  Drop C    Also russell, Drop tuning is not only for lazy players who want power chords to be bar chords.    Dave Grohl from the foo fighters has an amazing part in Everlong, and he does not use a single bar (power) chord.  I love drop tunings because of the extra low end, not because im lazy|`|UtYOwE4Laa	woah. how does that kind of thing happen? is that normal?

hLxBXX6daa	That's a VERY wide question. I'm a teen teen writer too, and it's kind of hard to pick a topic. I think the key is to write what YOU want to read about. Like my two favorite quotes say: "I wrote my first novel because I wanted to read it." And  "If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, you must be the one to write it." both by Toni Morrison. If your worried about what your audience will think, then your going to criticize yourself to the point where you lose inspiration then end up writing a soul-less boring book. I know because I've done that.    If you want more than anything to target younger readers then I would say you check out the descriptions in the young adult section of your local bookstores.

VMVW3E7Aaa	It is called Selective (or partial) desaturation.     1. Duplicate your background layer.  2.  Desaturate that layer (i.e. make it b&w).   3. Apply a layer mask to the layer. Use the black brush to paint on the layer mask (make sure that is where you are, not on the image itself). That will bring the color back to those areas. If you make a mistake, change the brush to white and go over it.  4. When you're happy, flatten and save.    If you don't have any image editors, you can do it for free on www.picnik.com in their effects section.    Here is how to do it on picnik.com:    Upload a photo  Click on the "Create" tab  Click on "Black and white"  In the "Effect Painting" box, choose "Original"  Choose a brush size, then simply paint the color back in where you want it.  If you make a mistake, change it to "Effect" and go over the mistake.  Save the picture.    P.S. you can't get "a" Photoshop - there is only ONE, and that one is made by Adobe.

I don't see why...|`|YmtNel5haa	I am not entirely sure what you mean by this.  freedom    (frdm) KEY      NOUN:     The condition of being free of restraints.   Liberty of the person from slavery, detention, or oppression.     Political independence.   Exemption from the arbitrary exercise of authority in the performance of a specific action; civil liberty: freedom of assembly.   Exemption from an unpleasant or onerous condition: freedom from want.   The capacity to exercise choice; free will: We have the freedom to do as we please all afternoon.   Ease or facility of movement: loose sports clothing, giving the wearer freedom.   Frankness or boldness; lack of modesty or reserve: the new freedom in movies and novels.     The right to unrestricted use; full access: was given the freedom of their research facilities.   The right of enjoying all of the privileges of membership or citizenship: the freedom of the city.   A right or the power to engage in certain actions without control or interference: "the seductive freedoms and excesses of the picaresque form" (John W. Aldridge).     --------------------------------------...  ETYMOLOGY:   Middle English fredom, from Old English frodm : fro, free ; see free + -dm, -dom     SYNONYMS:   freedom , liberty , license    These nouns refer to the power to act, speak, or think without externally imposed restraints. Freedom is the most general term: "In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free" (Abraham Lincoln). Liberty stresses the power of free choice: "liberty, perfect liberty, to think, feel, do just as one pleases" (William Hazlitt). License sometimes denotes deliberate deviation from normally applicable rules or practices to achieve a desired effect: poetic license. Frequently, though, it denotes undue freedom: "the intolerable license with which the newspapers break . . . the rules of decorum" (Edmund Burke).   Yeah I think it's really this..  *edit- if you don't believe that we have freedom why don't you speak to a soldier.  They will be happy to tell you what they are told they fight for..|`|LWpUjTHmaa	Freedom is just an unrealistic ideal made up by people to convince other people to start revolutions. Ideally what people think freedom is is to do what they want to do without consequences. However no matter where you are, everything you do has consequences hence why its an unrealistic ideal.|`|T4CZbRsSaa	every thing only means what we think it does... freedom included... we think freedom is a lie we tell ourselves so we don't feel bad about skimping on our social responsibilities...|`|FmbwIbtzaa	If one man craves freedom--liberty--he must remember that all other men long for the same freedom. Groups of such liberty-loving mortals cannot live together in peace without becoming subservient to such laws, rules, and regulations as will grant each person the same degree of freedom while at the same time safeguarding an equal degree of freedom for all of his fellow mortals. If one man is to be absolutely free, then another must become an absolute slave. And the relative nature of freedom is true socially, economically, and politically. Freedom is the gift of civilization made possible by the enforcement of LAW. Page 1490-4|`|pd4VLvoHaa	The dictionary calls it something like 'exemption from oppression', which is clearly something very different than its current popular meaning. The dictionary says 'oppression' without qualification while contemporary westerners obviously 'exempt' private enterprise from inclusion in the concept of 'oppression' and believe it always only applies to government, especially any government action that might attempt to oppress private enterprise oppression of humanity. In the dictionary, it means what it obviously means. In popular contemporary western vernacular, 'freedom' means psychopathic anti-social self-centric irresponsibility. Hope that clears it up for you.

7VpDEkC6aa	Well, unfortunately, if you have a problem remembering things, then you are probably right to have stage fright!!    The only way to beat stage fright is to know what you are going say, how you are going to say it and where you are going to be and what you will be doing while you are saying it.   You achieve that by constant practice and repetition until you know it without thinking it. Like learning the lyrics to you favorite songs.   If you learn those easily, then you don't really have a problem remembering things, you have a problem remembering things you aren't interested in like a boring math class you can't ever remember how to solve the problem because you don't really care!    Now there will always be a little stage fright  even after you are good at acting or playing music. Unless you are a moron, there's always the very human fear of looking like an idiot or blowing a line.   I still get butterflies after 40 yrs of public performing in plays and as a professional musician.  After you get going up on stage the fear recedes and the nerves go away. (unless they are LAUGHING AT YOU, then you just want to die.LOL)    We once made the mistake of letting our lead singer's girlfriend come onstage to sing a song with us, when we were playing at a junior high school dance, back when I was just beginning to play paid gigs as a musician. She was freakin terrible. All the little kids were laughing at us.  That will humble you quickly, I can assure you.    But if you really like to act (or think you would)  give it a shot.  Like I said earlier, if you are interested in doing it, I'd bet you'd find that remembering would not be as hard as you think.  And it really is a wonderful feeling to do a play or play a gig and have everyone applauding you. Best feeling ever. Better than sex even !!    It's very uplifting.      I hope you find encouragement  from my words.|`|TceoMfrDaa	get into the show, pretend your really the person, and you will forget everyone in the audience.

The range of shutter speeds are only  4 sec. to 1/1000 sec, so shooting 30 second or longer shots photographers use to shoot star trials, light trials on highways and other long exposure techniques.

"we still have windmills"  give the environmentalist something to work with and they may work with it, but stationary nukes are not the answer, neuclear power is still dangerous, but it can be improved. improve it then it will be considered.    btw  research geothermal energy

Their names are so unique and so well-known that to re-use them would be implausible. The only way a character could  be called Frodo, would be if it was a nickname, or if there was a strong association with the Lord of the Rings story.    Edward, on the other hand, is not a "ruined" name. Neither is Harry. A story about Harry Houdini would quickly become a different character in your head, even if you're used to Harry Potter.    I love the book Sense and Sensibility, but the name Edward didn't stick out in Twilight as a similar person or character at all. Characters with common names are not defined by their names. So, the names can't be ruined :D|`|icIWjfPoaa	Yes, I think so.|`|AeVnK1igaa	Yes, I definitely think so.

0ve51pW9aa	That's a deceptively difficult poem. On its surface, it is about the fact that in simplicity lies complexity. In other words, the more simple something is, the more complex it is.     But if you pick the poem apart, and take it piece by piece, you see that there is a lot going on here. The trees and their night time activity on its surface represents darkness, but I think that "their wild storytelling" represents life itself. Just the act of being alive. In his dreams there is a "someone with eyes closed" in the upper rooms of the house. This, on its surface, represents death, but the fact that he's seeing it in his dreams with the trees implies that it's a part of life. The woman in the white room seems to suggest goodness or all seeing wisdom, but does she really? Could she in fact be the real darkness?     I think overall this poem is about opposites. Things seeming to be one thing, when in fact they are another. But as with any poem, it's open to interpretation and debate. No one answer as to what a poem is "about" is right. Sometimes a poem is about nothing at all.     I hope that this helps.

When the Soviets were storming through Germany, the SS didn't have time to kill all the people  and clear out the camps so they would just send all the people on a walk, if they fell or fell behind they get shot. But it wasn't a normal walk, they had basically minimal cloths and were walking sometimes snow, all types of bad weather while the Nazis had blankets and plenty of food. I am not sure if was just at the end of the war or when Germany was being invaded though, sorry.    Edit: I am pretty sure the name of the camp is Ravensbrook. I don't know if they did it at others too, but we went over this one.|`|al5G94i0aa	As it pertains specifically to the Holocaust, the "death march" was the trek made by incoming people from their transport (train car, truck) past the selection tables.  These tables were the area that the healthy looking ones were split off from the rest and sent into the general camp population as slave laborers to run the German war industries.  The rest (women with small children, the sick, infirm, injured, old, etc) were sent in another direction to "clean up" after their long journey.  Basically, if you went left, you lived, and right, you died.  The direction you went was irrelevant as different camps were set up according to what worked best for them.  The walk from the railway to the "showers"(gas chambers) was known as the death march by the ones who lived.  As a way to keep the crowds under control, music was frequently played as the poor condemned shuffled past in a line.  There was also a mass retreat from a death camp as the Allies approached, the SS guards took all the prisoners that could still walk and forced them to flee in a forced march lasting over 20 miles.  This has also been referred to as a death march.  Sorry, I cannot remember the name of the camp, or sub camp.  It is in one of my books though, and if I find it I would be happy to E mail you the name.  Hope this helps.
ceBTTCPwaa	The Book of Lost Tales was the first major work of imagination by J.R.R. Tolkien, begun in 1916-1917 when he was twenty-five years old and left incomplete several years later. It stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor, for the Lost Tales were the first form of the myths and legends that came to be called The Silmarillion. Embedded in English legend and English association, they are set in the narrative frame of a great westward voyage over the Ocean by a mariner named Eriel (or AElfwine) to Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle, where Elves dwelt; from them he learned their true history, the Lost Tales of Elfinesse. In the Tales are found the earliest accounts and original ideas of Gods and Elves, Dwarves, Balrogs, and Orcs; of the Silmarils and the Two Trees of Valinor; of Nargothrond and Gondolin; of the geography and cosmography of the invented world. The Book of Lost Tales will be published in two volumes; this first part contains the Tales of Valinor; and the second will include Beren and Luthien, Turin and the Dragon, and the only full narratives of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the Fall of Gondolin. Each tale is followed by a commentary in the form of a short essay; together with the texts of associated poems; and each volume contains extensive information on names and vocabulary in the earliest Elvish languages. Further books in this series are planned to extend the history of Middle-earth as it was refined and enlarged in later years, and will include the Long Lays of Beleriand, the Ambarkanta or Shape of the World, the Lhammas or Account of Tongues, annals, maps, and many other unpublished writings of J.R.R. Tolkien.
qVaaaT7Gaa	c.    here is an answer i posted recently about it     The Versailles treaty placed a number of restrictions on Germany and put them in financial ruin and put them in a state of hyper-inflation. Such as they could have no more than 100 000 soldiers, x number of tons of ships and other military restrictions. It also made them responsible for all damage in WW1 so in turn they had to repay all the damage. This caused inflation to sky rocket to the point that the average German could not live.  It was the Versailles treaty which really put gave Hitler power. The German people have a strong sense of national pride and now they were being humiliated, they were in ruin. They seeked a saviour and they got Hitler. He promised to bring back Germany on the world stage, to create jobs, wealth, infrastructure. He did all this but this was because he ignored the treaty by starting to rebuild the military and not paying war reparations thus reducing inflation and creating more jobs.  You could say that WW2 was an extension of WW1|`|zuqv3qR1aa	c|`|SeKR3zncaa	C. it left Germany humiliated and resentful.|`|yT6Mezweaa	C,    It more or less caused World War II to occur...|`|Mb9K663Jaa	first of all do ur own homework!  but the answer is=  C but also they had to pay all of the countries for the damages and their $ was practically worthless and then a lot of things leading up to WW II started a while after that

rDwqvUpmaa	you can turn anything into a monologue. it doesn't necessarily have to be a monologue. for example i take great poems and turn them into monologues.  one of my favorite poets who happens to be black is langston hughes. i turned the poem Mother to Son into a monologue. i added a few words and turned it into something that it wasn't. got an A on the monologue.  if you can't find a monologue then use a poem that is or was written by a black person.  you can also turn a womans' monologue into a male monologue. you have to make it your own. due tomorrow? and i thought i was a procrastinator. good luck.

draNVjbkaa	You didn't give us enough details about yourself so what I'm going to say pertains more towards the LA/NY markets. However, a lot of what I'm saying is still applicable in lesser known markets as well. In L.A. a good price range is $250-500 (for the session only, this doesn't include touch ups or reproductions). Anything over that is usually by some quack who does no better than a photographer who charges $250.    If you're in LA or NY go to www.reproductions.com and look through their books. Find photographers that photograph people like you well ie. Skin tone, hair color, eye color, ethnicity, age range, physical structure, etc. Choose your top 5 and meet with ALL of them! You want to get their philosophies and their personalities. You certainly don't want to work with someone whose personality sucks for you.    Usually you DON'T get your headshots until you've taken some classes that help you determine the type of roles that you can play. Your best way to determine your type is to ask agents or casting directors. Casting directors especially! They're the ones that are paid to imagine you playing multiple roles based on ONE GENERAL headshot.    With regards to looks, you DON'T want character shots ie. literally dressing like a cop, doctor, etc. NO PROPS EITHER! This is an insult to the casting directors and will get you laughed out of this business. You want 3-4 GENERAL LOOKS! For example, a business suit look can suggest FBI, detective, secretary, business person,etc. A casual look (jeans and t-shirt) can suggest high school, college, blue collar. An upscale j-crew/Banana Republic look can suggest young parent, preppy, white collar, etc.    Also, when you meet with your photographer make it clear that you don't want the following in your headshots:    -Landscape cropping. When a landscape photo is posted online on LA Casting or Actors access, it's appears very tiny compared to a photo that was cropped portrait. CDs get submissions as really tiny thumbnails. They might miss your photo if it's smaller than the majority of photos that are cropped portrait.    -Chopping off the top of the head. When too much of your head is chopped off, it makes it a little difficult as to what your really look like. Cropping off a small part of the top of your head is forgivable, but not to the extent where you look like Hannibal Lecter or Sylar from Heroes' victims.    -Too close. Don't get it cropped too close to where people can't see your body. At least your upper torso should be visible in your shots so CDs/Agents have a fair idea of what you look like physically.    -Silly poses. Headshots are supposed to be as natural as rain. Making stupid poses will just make you look stupider. Such common poses include, but not limited to:  1. Sitting on the toilet. This is where you're sitting down but leaning a little forward.  2. My head is too heavy. Don't do a headshot where your hand is under your chin or even touching your head.  3. Look at me, I have a sexy back! I've seen some headshots where people are in contorted poses, looking over his or her shoulder. It's not natural.  4. I'm a mermaid! This is where you're laying on your stomach with your feet up.  5. Leading with my shoulder

A flowering shrub or vining flowers would work.  A pretty model never hurts either.  The softening effect of the rain will almost create an impressionist type of feel to the pic.  You could then photoshop the pic to make it look like a painting.    Try some abstract photos with a macro lens...  Images of flowers reflected in water with a macro lens creates some very pleasing abstract types of images.    Good Luck|`|tmdWJvuwaa	When It comes to showing off photography I would recommend taking landscape photos and photos of land marks whether it be the Eiffel tower or the CN Tower or whatever. This is a more traditional and classical approach.      There is always modern photography where you can take pictures of people or objects in different angles and format them to look cool. Like a picture of mine, I took a picture of the Notre Dame wedding chapel alter and changed it into black and white.

Con el Entendimiento tu mismo valorars si mereces premio o castigo    En tu Juicio Particular, con tu Voluntad y tu momento de lucidez, decidirs si aceptas o rechazas a Jess, quien es Dios Jesucristo, nuestro nico y absoluto Juez Supremo    Para que un acto malo sea considerado pecado mortal, tiene que tener Materia Grave, Plena Advertencia y Cometerlo. El pecado tiene Culpa y Pena. La culpa la perdona el sacerdote catlico y la Pena solo Dios Jesucristo la puede perdonar    Si aceptas a Jess y L con su infinita y divina misericordia te perdona, tu Alma podr pasar al Purgatorio a purificar la Pena de tus pecados o bien tu Alma podra pasar directamente al Cielo.    Cuando Jess venga por segunda vez a esta vida terrenal, llamada la Parusa, realizar el Juicio Final con las personas vivas y con las Almas ya integradas con sus cuerpos muertos resucitados, entonces decidir quien vivir eternamente en el Cielo, por haberse portado bien y decidir quien vivir eternamente en el Infierno por haberse portado mal.

El trmino hebreo nefesh en el Antiguo Testamento, y el trmino griego psych en el Nuevo Testamento, a menudo son traducidos como alma, pero ambos significan vida, persona. Los diferentes usos de estas dos palabras nos ayudarn a obtener un mejor entendimiento de la visin bblica con respecto a la naturaleza humana. La confusin que enfrentamos concerniente a la naturaleza del alma se debe a la introduccin de la idea griega de la inmortalidad del alma en la doctrina cristiana.        1. El significado hebreo de nefesh: En el Antiguo Testamento, el trmino nefesh se utiliza de una manera concreta para referirse a la garganta, por su relacin con la respiracin, y el comer (el esfago). En Isaas 5:14 la palabra nefesh se traduce como boca, pero en realidad significa garganta (vea tambin Salmos 107:9, versin Nueva Reina-Valera 2000, donde el sediento es literalmente el de garganta seca). La garganta tambin es el instrumento para respirar (Jer. 15:9). El uso de este vocablo para referirse a la garganta deriva del hecho de que nefesh expresa la idea de vida y deseo, en este caso de comida y agua. La otra acepcin de alma parece derivarse de este uso ms concreto.        2. La persona como un ser que desea: La necesidad del alma de agua, comida y aliento se extiende para incluir deseos y emociones en general. En la Biblia, el alma designa a toda la persona, como caracterizada por deseos, anhelos e incluso antojos. Esto subraya la idea de que el hombre es un ser emocional. Proverbios declara: El apetito del obrero lo impulsa a trabajar (nefesh, deseos, necesidad) (Prov. 16:26, NRV 2000), es decir, lo motiva a trabajar. El salmista ora: No me entregues a la voluntad [literalmente: No me entregues al nefesh (deseo, voluntad)] de mis enemigos (Sal. 27:12). Jess dijo: Mi alma est abrumada de tristeza, es decir, como un ser emocional, estoy posedo por la tristeza (Mar. 14:34, NRV 2000).        3. La persona como un ser viviente: La necesidad de aire o aliento permite utilizar el trmino alma en el sentido de vida. Encontramos algunas frases como arriesgu mi vida (nefesh) (Jue. 12:3; Fil. 2:30); los que buscan mi vida o intentan asesinarme (Salmos 35:4; Mat. 2:20); esta noche vienen a pedirte tu vida (psych ) (Luc. 12:20).         Alma no designa una parte de la naturaleza humana independiente del cuerpo, sino la totalidad de la persona como un ser viviente (Gn. 2:7). De hecho, alma es otra manera de decir persona o ser viviente. El Se?or dijo: El alma (nefesh, persona) que pecare, esa morir (Eze. 18:4). El alma, como un ser humano, es fundamentalmente un ser, un individuo que, de hecho, puede morir. Alma en el Antiguo Testamento se refiere no slo a una persona viviente (Gn. 2:7), sino tambin a una persona muerta (Nm. 5:2; Lev. 21:11).        4. El uso gramatical de alma: Dado que alma se utiliza para referirse a la persona como un ser, el trmino viene a ser usado como un pronombre para designar a una persona. Abram le pidi a Sara que dijera que ella era su hermana para que viva mi alma (Gn. 12:13). La manera hebrea de decir Te ruego que me dejes vivir (1 Rey. 20:32) es Te ruego que viva mi alma.        La palabra alma no es la mejor traduccin de los trminos griego y hebreo. En la Biblia, el alma no es inmortal y no puede existir independientemente del cuerpo fsico. Desde el punto de vista de la antropologa bblica (el estudio de la naturaleza humana), el trmino alma expresa dos grandes ideas. Primero, los seres humanos son por naturaleza criaturas con deseos y anhelos. Segundo, los humanos son seres vivientes que buscan fervientemente la vida, pero son incapaces de adquirir o preservar la vida por s mismos.        Alma se refiere a todo persona que necesita de Dios, quien es el nico que puede preservar al ser humano o extinguirlo para siempre (Mat. 10:28). Por lo tanto, nefesh/psych se refiere a la totalidad de la persona como centro de vida, emociones, sentimientos y anhelos que pueden realizarse totalmente slo en unin con Dios.|`|gwECY8GAaa	El alma es el espiritu del ser humano... dicen que s existe, porque al morir perdemos 21 gramos... que supuestamente es el peso del alma en nuestro cuerpo, la cual se va cuando fallecemos... y donde esta ubicada?, la verdad que no tengo idea.

fgbgPx0Taa	Terry Brooks - The Shannara series, which starts with The Sword of Shannara.  Als the Magic Kingdom series which starts with "Magic Kingdom for Sale."    David Eddings - The Belgrath series - more swords than mythical creatures    Mercedes Lackey - she has several series, so you need to check and see which you want.      The Valdemar Series has mostly psionics (mind-magic) fighting real magic in the first few books, then real magic and magical beings come in later in the series. (Her Gryphon Series of The Black Gryphon, The White Gryphon and The Silver Gryphon are a sub-series of the Valdemar Series and you may be more interested in them than the whole series.)    Her Bedlam Bard series has elves and magic and good vs. evil.    Her "Joust" series has dragons.    She has several books of elves in modern times, sometimes called the "Chrome" series because some of the elves like to race cars.    Most of her books have magic of some sort. Read the backs to see if you are interested, because they are set in various time periods.      Anne McCaffrey - Dragonriders of Pern (later her son Todd McCaffrey added to the series)  These are set on another planet to which man has migrated.  It's more Science Fiction than Fantasy, so there are no elves or other mythical creatures.  Her Acorna series has unicorn people, but again it is a Science Fiction series rather than Fantasy.     Some people may suggest the Enchanted Forest series, and while they have dragons in them, it's a different style of stories.  You may want to try them as well. The author is Patricia C. Wrede and the first book in the series is Dealing with Dragons.    Good luck, and enjoy!|`|YKyjtVuOaa	Robert Jordan. Read The Wheel of Time series. Great books

Great ending to the Twilight series everything was resolved  Twilight..... The one that started it all  New Moon................ Edward's gone! Boo-Hoo, I didn't really like New Moon that much!|`|7TSfBuVUaa	Midnight Sun definetley, Edwards POV is so much better,  But from the current series, Twilight because its the very begining of it all!|`|SFGNnKfWaa	eclipse!!  twilight-too much mopey unsure edward  new moon-edward leaves!!! :(  breaking dawn-good but not as good|`|x0E7XzZMaa	I would have to say Eclipse also.. Although, I was kinda disappointed with Breaking Dawn it got a little to sci-fi for me. I just love the romantic aspect of the story.|`|2NtxFGX7aa	New Moon for me I think Bella hurt Jacob so bad i made me literaly throw my book across the room!!    Eward and Bella's relationship is based on curiosity of each other, when Jacob and Bella go deeper into a real relationship.|`|hc3GqrXjaa	My favorite was New Moon, actually.  I am totally on Team Jacob, ha.    I thought he was such an amazing person to help Bella through her heartbreak like that.     I do love how in Eclipse, Bella finds she loves Jacob too. I was so disappointed that she couldn't leave Edward for him though.    I'm finishing Breaking Dawn right now, I can't wait for Midnight Sun! :D|`|aeODdMATaa	I like the first one the best.|`|n7hezV5aaa	Definitely Eclipse.|`|Wuj40SuYaa	The first one :P its just plain original

Has a real great way of seeing things, and explaining the way sees them as well.      And Stephen King. He's got so many amazing ideas in his head. It just baffles me how one man can write so many books, that are all so different, in a relatively short amount of time. He's very talented and successful.|`|RKOzbNLdaa	Ted Dekker by far!

There is really no need for a word as obscure   as "pleasuring"; "pleasing" would suffice.   And not a lot of potential readers would be able  to relate to "I feel like a pacman." If I were you,  I'd use two words there: "lost man."|`|2c494d9be1d5b360cd0461053dcc8a57aa	It is an awesome poem! it gives you like specific details to show exactly what you feel and what you mean!

AA10015648	I ADORE reading in the bath, but it's not where I usually read.    I usually "read" in the car - listening to audiobooks. If I've got an actual book, I'll read in bed or curled up on the couch. I can read just fine if there's music or TV in the background, but NOT reality TV... for some reason, I can't block my hatred for reality TV from surfacing while it's on in the house. Reality TV and The View....|`|Koa7k86qaa	I am the same way. It has to be silent. I usually read in the bath as well, and also right before bed, if my husband isn't watching tv.|`|CQUuCpTQaa	I read on the train, on a couch in our living room by the window or in my room. My fave place would be in my bed at the witching hour with a booklight.|`|hVHuLwHraa	I read pretty much any where.  But love to read in my bed.    If its too loud i drown out the noise with my ipod.  I know that sounds crazy nbut it works|`|jDFVWRLDaa	I love reading in the leather chair in my living room after everyone has gone to sleep.  Sometimes my doggy comes and snuggles with me.  I don't think I could read in the bathtub...I'd probably end up dropping my book in it!|`|8aLgZDgmaa	deffinatley in bedd! :) its comfy and silentt! :D so i can concentratee!|`|SBVVFCKTaa	well.. I usually close all the doors in my house, and then go to my bed. Then i pull out my book and start reading.|`|sHHjQhRgaa	i am such a bad multitasker i just read in Bed, 10.00pm.|`|KbffpAxTaa	i do that too! i thought i was the only one....  i also read in my bed. i have a day bed so i have these wonderful corners...|`|mv3HD9rGaa	This might seem wierd but I sit in this oak tree next to a river, its really relaxing and quiet its a great place to read if you want to be alonge coz no one else goes there. I just really need to remember not to fall asleep up there again, lol, I broke my armthe last time I did that.  But seriousally I love to read there.|`|gCwXJR1Daa	I will read anywhere.     I once read a book in Geometry class while I was suppose to take notes.    The book was just so damn good!|`|DZ5CYlr3aa	I read under the covers in bed. So I stay nice and warm, especially now that it's winter and freezing cold.|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	i can read in the living room with the tv on. i can read while my dad is driving and with the radio on. or i can read on my bed with silence|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I'm a mum. I either multitask or I don't get to read :) Not even TV in the background? I wouldn't have read anything in the past 12 years!|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	First, let me tell you that I read a book a day.  I read mainly on my bed ... sitting in 'half lotus.'  I occasionally read in other places (the computer is in the office, and of course I am reading it when I'm here), and in the bathroom (we actually keep a book in the bathroom so we can read if we get 'stuck' there for awhile).  I can't read in the bath these days ... I have a kitten who believes that I can't take a bath without her 'guarding' me and she would get very distressed if I 'sat reading' too long, and she'd 'splash the water' onto the pages to get me out.  I also read on the bus if I'm alone, in restaurants if I'm alone, standing at bus stops if I'm alone ... my husband says I'm a professional reader even though I don't get 'paid' to read ... but I don't read 'in bed' ... I can read only when I'm sitting up in half lotus.  I used to be able to sit in full lotus (both feet fully on top of the opposite thigh) but I tore the ligament in one knee, so now all I can mange is half lotus ... but I can still sit in that 'tied up' position for hours, as long as I have a book to read!|`|I1tnVvVGaa	its weird, i always sit on the same side of the couch lol, or in bed|`|Gnhgfx4naa	I read most in bed, or traveling or on a nice day on the porch in the sun. Ahhhhhh so relaxing.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	I read in my bed right before I go to sleep, or when I'm bored. If I'm at school, I'll read between classes or after I've finished a test. I can usually tune out background noise and focus on the book.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	I read almost anywhere, but my favourite places are - in the bath, in bed, on my porch, and lying on the beach. I also keep a book in the car so if I stop for something to eat or whatever I've always got a book.|`|AJviOb6saa	I can read while talking on the phone or while watching TV and such, I'm a good multitasker.|`|nbavqswSaa	same- even if im tired i love reading before bed. It just cant be too good a good- or else i dont sleep thinking about the book|`|BpcAVgEeaa	I read on my bed at night when it's quiet, or on my chair during the day when my room is sunny and warm :)|`|YKyjtVuOaa	I have a Euro reading couch that I like reading on
e3YYWHeqaa	personalmente como historiadora, en mi opinin t dire q el fallo de la 2a Republica espa?ola, fue debido a q los espa?oles, aun anclados en un sistema de vida muy cerrado y primitivo, no estaban preparados para el cambio q supusieron las reformas liberales de la Republica, produciendo entre las clases mas conservadoras el desagrado, q se vio incrementado c la kema de Iglesias y d colegios catolicos.|`|AA11003158	Despus de la revolucin de octubre de 1934 y la destitucin de Lerroux, el presidente de la Repblica constituy un gobierno de tendencia central, y en enero de 1936 se disolvieron las Cortes y se convoc a nuevas elecciones para el 16 de febrero.  Manuel Aza?a volvi a ocupar la presidencia del gobierno.    Los planes para derribar a la Repblica, dirigidos por los militares, se iniciaron en el momento mismo de conocerse los resultados de las elecciones y fueron cobrando fuerza hasta que, en el mes de julio, los nimos se exaltaron con el asesinato del lder derechista Calvo Sotelo, realizado por unos socialistas como represalia por el homicidio de un compa?ero, el teniente Castillo, a manos de fuerzas de extrema derecha.|`|dr3Wppf1aa	No fallo.    Duro del 14 de abril de 1931 al 18 de julio de 1939 (despus hasta el 1 de abril de 1939, fue poca de guerra), apenas tuvo tiempo para desarrollar polticas que le permitirn mejorar las condiciones de vida de los espa?oles. Es ms o menos, como legislatura y media de la actual democracia.     Se hicieron muchas cosas, se avanzo en educacin y en derechos sociales. Pero no se le dio tregua, y hubo varios intentos de derrocarla (Sanjurjo y la Revolucin de Asturias). fueron implacables.    ?Por qu la II Repblica hubo de tener fallos?. Los fallos fueron de los que atentaron contra un gobierno legalmente constituido. Eso es como demonizar a la vctima|`|Yi4CnDEeaa	En querer quitar a los judos.Son los due?os del mundo.|`|NvXxGY5Kaa	Muy buena pregunta.  No fue una sola causa,sino que fueron varias.  Una de las primeras y mas importante empezo antes que la propia guerra:el gobierno republicano era declaradamente anticatolico y siempre mantuvo una actitud desafiante para con las autoridades eclesiasticas.Espa?a fue un pais tradicionalmente catolico,pero en menos de medio siglo gran parte de la poblacion dejo de serlo por la influencia del socialismo y del comunismo,sin olvidar al anarquismo en los ambientes sindicalistas.Todos ellos se enfrentaban a los circulos catolicos en cuanto tenian ocasion(monarquicos,conservadores y ciertos sectores empresariales).Esto en un principio no alarmo a la republica(a pesar de que muchos senadores,ministros y parlamentarios eran derechistas),pues este tipo de nivelamiento izquierdista ya se habia producido en otros paises europeos al acabar la I guerra mundial y en ninguno de ellos se provoco una guerra civil como la revolucion bolchevique,excusa de todo tipo de fascistas desde Hitler hasta Franco pasando por Mussolini.Pero en Espa?a era diferente:la republica perdio el control y el orden publico desaparecio,en las calles se masacraban sin reparo alguno izquierdistas contra derechistas,y fueron estas causas las que argumento Franco en su famoso "levantamiento".  En un primer momento todos los gobiernos democratas europeos reconocieron la legitimidad de la republica y declararon ilegal el que los "nacionalistas" establecian en las zonas que iban ocupando.Pero la republica cada vez mantenia relaciones mas estrechas con otro aliado del que las potencias democratas(Francia y Gran Breta?a) no querian ni oir hablar:Stalin.Este hecho fue cada vez mas difundido y exagerado por Franco,quien acusaba al gobierno sovietico de estar detras de los disturbios y vandalismos previos a la guerra.  En un momento dado llegaron a Espa?a comisarios politicos y oficiales militares(sobre todo de aviacion) enviados por Stalin,y a partir de este hecho ninguna de las potencias democratas movieron un solo dedo por la republica,para gran satisfaccion de Franco y sus aliados fascistas del resto de Europa(Hitler y Mussolini) quienes por su parte le habian administrado el armamento para inciar y proseguir la guerra.  Por cierto,que hubo divisiones enteras de italianos y escuadrones de pilotos nazis(la famosa"legion condor") combatieron del lado de Franco sin que este hecho alarmara a las potencias democratas,solo el gobierno de Washington denuncio este hecho.   En definitiva,lo que provoco la guerra civil espa?ola fue que la republica perdio el control de las calles y lo perdio mas aun al aliarse con Stalin.Y tambien el fanatismo de ciertos sectores catolicos y ultraderechistas.|`|8693d8f23bae8624f5a62af350e9f48caa	porque era una merienda de "******"|`|ZeEQYCKraa	En querer solucionar algo con violencia.He ahi el fallo.

As pus ninguna potencia extrangera (excepto la URSS) hizo nada por evitar un golpe de estado. Es mas ante la situacin mundial, se declar de no ayudar a ninguna de las potencias (en un principio Francia si que estaba ayudando a la Repblica) Hitler y Musolini se la saltaron, pero los EEUU tambin ya que la provisin de carburante de los nacionales vena principalmente de EEUU.

Ic3hceIOaa	I can't be too descriptive because the point is for you to be creative but you could choose a specific book like Alice and Wonderland or Hamlet and speak only using phrases from the book and act like the characters from the book, hope that gave you a little inspiration|`|DCJldRRXaa	Just as an FYI - the word is actually "inanimate", which means without animation or without life.  I think a doll would be too close to being "animate" simply because it looks like a human.  Let your imagination run wild as far as what object to pick, and then perhaps think of how it moves.  For instance: a keyboard.  How would that move in conjunction with a mouse and a terminal?  Pretty difficult, but if done well, it might get you an "A"!

Somewhere!!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_c...    Right lets try again then!!http://www.genealogytoday.com/columns/ev...|`|TZ4MQHDcaa	As the Middle ages progressed, scholars pointed out that the calendar year was increasingly divergent from the solar year. The reckoning of the solar year at 365.25 days was a slight over-estimate, and by the 16th century this annual error had built up a discrepancy of 10 days.  But it wasnt until 24 February 1582 that Pope Gregory XIII ordered the use of a reformed calendar. This met immediate trouble by cutting 10 days (be patient) out of the year 1582, so that 4 October was immediately followed by 15 October. A leap year was to be introduced, and the year would begin on 1 January (not 25 March as had been the case). This happened generally throughout Catholic Europe.  But England (or Britain, if you prefer) was not Catholic, so it ignored the popes instruction. As the years went on, there was, as you can imagine, a problem of dating between Britain and its continental neighbours. Finally, Britain had to bite the bullet and consider reformation of its calendar. An act of parliament was passed in 1751 that decreed that throughout the dominions of the British crown the following 1 January should be the first day of 1752 (rather than waiting until 25 March), and that 2 September 1752 should immediately be followed by 14 September (so you see the discrepancy had built up even further by now). Crowds demonstrated and demanded, give us back our eleven days! But the calendar was reformed.  I trust this clarifies the matter.|`|PZZkjST7aa	No, they just lost eleven days, but a lot of people were none too pleased over it.  It was the changeover from the Julian to the Gregorian calender.

Slo tienes que conseguir manejar tu mente con bastante ms poder del que la manejamos comunmente, que a penas si usamos un diez por ciento de su poder. Otra forma sera que aprendieras a vivir en tiempo presente y , anclado totalmente en el presente donde se puede producir lo que se llama una "conjuncin cuntica": pasado ,futuro y presente estn en un mismo punto y puedes escuchar tu vida y sentirla como en una radio del tiempo, al unsono. Es una experiencia que ya han tenido bastantes personas. Los tres estados(pasado, presente y futuro) se unifican para formar la conjuncin y la persona se ve a s misma en la unidad del tiempo, en una sla visin, sin desplazarse en el espacio ni en el tiempo.

1wOBfgZIaa	It's a straight-forward description of what he's seeing with little poetic expression. He does use "tombstone" as a metaphor. It's difficult for a poet NOT to write poetically, even with so-called writer's block.    ADDITION: I must admit I don't see the poetry in this one.

Nothing moves on a tombstone and none is moving on his typewriter either (and the tombstone is a "block" of stone) No life in either. Why only 3 birds? I guess he wrote this in pen as his "typewriter is tombstone still". If he wrote this using the typewriter it would not be that way. So when he cannot type because of the block he writes by hand to try to unblock the flow. The last word shows his frustration. Even usually lively nature can't inspire him today.  He can't be reduced to bird watching anymore because they have all flown away! What can he do now? All that's left is to.....write a poem about it and tell someone how he feels.|`|MYSfOkz1aa	maybe instead of writing what his mind saw, he just wrote with his eyes|`|8c8ca69ba60952337e6a67121fe756c9aa	Bukowski does this a lot, he puts you in a place he was. He's written a poem about what is was like to have writer's block--clue: the character in the poem, be it Bukowski or just a character, is on the bed, the poem is being written on the typer--but obviously that is now gone.    I think this may be why, in most of his prose anyway, he changed his name to Chinaski; he was acknowledging the fact that he was fictionalizing himself. Nowhere, in any of his novels, does it say autobiography, remember.    Love the line my "typewriter is tombstone still" though, classic Bukowski!      forgot to answer: emotion, pinged with tombstone and f*cker.|`|MZp3EU0eaa	This one is really good.

Comenzar con 10 veces para cada lado, ambos pies a la vez. y aumentar cada 3 dias.  Acostada,  doblar la rodilla lo mas que se pueda, estirar la pierna despus.

Acostada, levantando una pierna haciendo un angulo.  repetir con la otra pierna.  luego ambas piernas.  Ojala y te sirva de algo.  Tienes que ser constante.

AA11481777	La manzana dorada es un elemento que aparece en las leyendas o cuentos de hadas de algunos pases. Normalmente, un hroe (como Hrcules o el prncipe azul en las leyendas occidentales) tiene que hacerse con las manzanas doradas escondidas o robadas por un personaje malvado como un zmeu, un dragn o un monstruo.    Atalanta    Cuando una cazadora llamada Atalanta hubiese participado en la cacera del jabal de Calidn y recibido la piel como trofeo, su padre la reclam y quiso que se casase. Aunque era una doncella muy hermosa, Atalanta no tena especial inters en el matrimonio despus de que un orculo predijese que tendra mala suerte si se casaba. Para encontrarle marido, su padre hizo un trato con ella en virtud del cual se casara con quien pudiese vencerle en una carrera a pie. Atalanta acept de buen grado, pues era capaz de correr muy rpidamente.    Derrot a muchos pretendientes, hasta que uno logr convertirse en su marido gracias a la inteligencia y no a la velocidad. Hipmenes (tambin llamado Melanin) saba no podra vencer en una carrera limpia contra Atalante, por lo que or a Afrodita pidindole ayuda. La diosa le dio tres manzanas doradas (algunas versiones dicen que fueron membrillos) y le dijo que las dejase caer de una en una para distraer a Atalanta, pues seguro que sta se detendra para recogerlas. Aunque le cost usar las tres manzanas y recurrir a todas su velocidad, Hipmenes logr la victoria, ganando la carrera y la mano de Atalanta. Desgraciadamente, Hipmenes olvid agradecrselo a la diosa y sta los transform en leones.    El Jardn de las Hesprides    Heracles roba las manzanas de las HespridesEl Jardn de las Hesprides era el huerto de Hera en occidente, donde (segn la fuente) crecan en un solo rbol o una arboleda manzanas doradas que otorgaban la inmortalidad. Hera ubic en este jardn un dragn de cien cabezas que nunca dorma llamado Ladn, como medida de proteccin adicional. El undcimo trabajo de Heracles fue robar las manzanas de este jardn.    El Juicio de Paris    Artculos principales: Juicio de Paris y Manzana de la discordia  Zeus organiz un banquete para celebrar las bodas de Peleo y Tetis, pero dej fuera de la lista de invitados a Eris, la diosa de la discordia, quien tras acudir a pesar de todo dej caer una manzana dorada con la inscripcin ??, para la ms bella. Tres diosas reclamaron la manzana para s: Hera, Atenea y Afrodita. Zeus decidi que Paris de Troya decidiese quin deba ser la legtima propietaria de la manzana. Cada una de las diosas ofreci a Paris un regalo: Hera le dara poder sobre los hombre, Atenea le otorgara sabidura y Afrodita le prometi le amor de la mujer ms bella del mundo, Helena. Paris eligi a Afrodita y Helena abandon a su marido, Menelao, precipitando as la Guerra de Troya.    Mitologa nrdica      En la mitologa nrdica las manzanas doradas conceden la inmortalidad a los dioses. Dichas manzanas son cultivadas por la diosa Ieunn.    Cierto da Loki, Odn y Thor paseaban por el campo cuando un guila (en realidad un gigante disfrazado) rapt a Loki y le hizo prometer que le dara a Ieunn para poder casarse con ella y disfrutar as tambin de la eterna juventud. Loki accedi y le dio a Ieunn. Los dioses no echaron en falta las manzanas al principio, pero luego empezaron a buscar dnde haban ido a parar Ieunn y sus manzanas. Loki confes y se dispuso a traerla de vuelta, so pena de muerta. Lo consigui tras un arriesgado vuelo, y los dioses se regocijaron al haber recuperado las manzanas.    Las manzanas dorados son un elemento importante en la pera de Richard Wagner El oro del Rin (Das Rheingold), preludio de la tetraloga El anillo del nibelungo (Der Ring des Nibelungen). Tras construir el Valhalla para los dioses, los gigantes Fafner y Fasolt pidieron a Wotan que les diese a Freyja, la diosa que cultivaba las manzanas de oro, como ste les haba prometido. Cuando los gigantes se llevaron a Freyja los dioses se volvieron sbitamente viejos y dbiles, lo que convencin a Wotan para ir a Niflheim con Loge para robar el anillo de Alberich y obtener as un sustituto de Freyja que complaciese a los gigantes.    Las manzanas doradas estn relacionadas con un leitmotif, cantado primero por Fafner cuando explica a su hermano Fasolt por qu deben alejar a Freyja de los dioses.|`|zqZ9bKlkaa	La manzana dorada es un elemento que aparece en las leyendas o cuentos de hadas de algunos pases.

Al principio del Libro XI, Zeus la enva para provocar a los aqueos.    La leyenda ms famosa protagonizada por Eris cuenta cmo inici la Guerra de Troya. Tanto los dioses y diosas como diversos mortales fueron invitados a la boda de Peleo y Thetis (que luego seran padres de Aquiles). Slo la diosa Eris no fue invitada debido a su naturaleza problemtica. As que Eris (en un fragmento de la Cipria, como parte de un plan urdido por Zeus y Temis) apareci en la fiesta con la MANZANA DE LA DISCORDIA , una MANZANA DORADA con la palabra kallisti (?para la ms hermosa? o ?para la ms guapa?) inscrita, que arroj entre las diosas provocando que Afrodita, Hera y Atenea la reclamasen para s, inicindose una ri?a. Zeus, para no tener que elegir entre las diosas, puesto que una era su esposa y otra su hija, encarg ser juez a Paris. Entonces Hermes le transmiti al desventurado Paris, prncipe de Troya, que tendra que elegir a la ms hermosa. Siendo como era la moralidad mitolgica griega, cada una de las tres diosas intent sobornarle para que la eligiera: Hera le ofreci poder poltico, Atenea le prometi destreza militar y Afrodita le tent con la mujer ms hermosa de la tierra, Helena, esposa de Menelao de Esparta.

ZSlXrXsCaa	We talk about it because it is a topic of discussion that we are interested in. Why shouldn't we talk about it? We have just as much rights as you do all we are is voicing our opinions but as proved by you neither Stephenie Meyer nor her crazy fans can take any criticism. If twilight fans can make websites to discuss how pretty edward is and how they hate everyone who has any other opinions of the book than them, we should have websites that lets us talk about how bad the books are.|`|YorMkZYAaa	Twilight is not great. To those of you who haven't read anything of real literary or intellectual merit then yes, they are. For those of us who have and are intelligent, it's rubbish. Meyer can't write...period.|`|BpcAVgEeaa	I do not talk about Twilight all the time. And if you're asking why we bother answering the Twilighter's questions, it's because they are infesting the B&A section. And no, Twilight is not great. Clearly you haven't read many books.|`|35JIECGRaa	I've noticed that too ... especially this one girl Rafal H! I think they talk about it because they just want attention. Twilight haters get more attention than Twilight fans (that's just an observation).    I think Twilight haters AND fans need to tone it down ... we get it, you really like it/really hate it, now can we talk about something else? I mean there's more to this life than Twilight ...|`|UmMxmmRMaa	I'm not really someone who hates, period. But I really dislike Twilight; I think it's too popular and not original enough to capture my attention - it's very easy to get sick of because so many people have become "obsessed" with it, and the storyline is a little cliche IMO. Yes, there are unusual aspects of it because the guy is a vampire and everything, but come on...I could have thought of that. I just like things that are different, and, you know, a little more "outside the box."    But if you like it, great. That's what works for you, and I have no reason to be bothered by it. Btw I actually don't really ever talk about it, because it's just not a huge issue to me.|`|fc4baf02ff9f98a7a775f05738a7b5c2aa	Well I hate Twilight (and you're wrong, it's not a great book in any way shape or form) and I don't really talk about it at all. I just think it's comedic how many brainless teeny boppers get off on creepy stalker vampire who is old enough to be their grandfathers. Well their SUPER OLD grandfathers.    The only thing "Great" about twilight is that it actually somehow managed to get so many kids who've never read an actual novel in their lives to read something. Sure it's total crap, but I guess you teenies are reading now?|`|4F8b4D6Laa	If you hate twilight so much wy do you talk about it all the time???    Because I CAN. Lulz, seriously, I don't talk about it all the time, once in a while maybe, but not all the time.     And really, you're contradicting yourself, you don't like that we talk about it, why then are you talking about something you don't like? ("if you don't like something you shouldn't talk about it").    "you have no right to judge me just because I like a book"    You're judging us.    It is interesting for me at least to talk about it because of its almost infinite absurdities that people take ONLY because it's a socially acceptable cliche.

That really bothers me because there are really great books out there, and I feel like people are genuinely wasting their time with Twilight. And missing out on so many great books. Books with the potential to change their life. And, when they are told that, they go off into a big rant about how everyone who hates Twilight is dumb... and they have nothing credible to say at all.     But, all that being said, it is all opinion. I probably like a lot of books that other people hate, too. I just wish Twilight and it's whole craze would go away already, though.

But I don't think it's the best book ever to be made. There's other great book out there. Meyer has created great characters (or shall I say Vampires) but her writing isn't really good.    I think Twilight haters hate Twilight due to the amount of Twilight Lovers (no offence) bragging about it. I get annoyed when someone mentions Twilight because it a subject that keeps on repeating. I still love Twilight but I'm not crazy about it now.|`|AA12181796	Really, a very small percentage of my time is dedicated to talking about Twilight.    And, um, we're not talking about how great Twilight is. It's not great. It's a load of crap.    "I just think if you don't like something you shouldn't talk about it. (or make websites about it)"  Why? This book glorifies emotional abuse and teaches that looks are everything and you're nothing without your boyfriend.

Only nimrods that think they hate it talk about it.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Because it's an interesting example for writers to discuss. It's far easier to consider why a particular writing style or plot _doesn't_ work than why a different one does. I think about, and talk about, Twilight because I find it useful to help me learn how not to write. I look at those urple descriptions of Edward sparkling in the sunshine, and I think "far too many adjectives, don't do that". That's easier to identify than "exactly the right number of adjectives, do that" in a better book.|`|5L5GQYFXaa	i LOVE twilight and i was asking myself why also people who hate twilight will go on and on and on for hours on how much they hate the saga. with the determination they have if it would be the other way around they would make great twihards!|`|R0iHHPqEaa	Because it's annonying that so many brainless people like it!|`|vrcxxRr8aa	All we do is respond to the rabid fan girls who refuse to use the search bar and annoy us all.

kfOpbbCyaa	Mr. Darcy isn't truly unhappy, except about Elizabeth rejecting his first proposal. He is not a shy man, but a reserved one. The distinction may seem slight, but it really is not. (Reserved is "marked by self-restraint and reticence" while shy is "lacking self-confidence." Darcy definitely had self-confidence in abundance.)    He is difficult because he is proud and self-important. He explains as much to Elizabeth during his second, and successful, proposal. Here's what he says of himself:    "I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.''    Therefore, he had gotten into the habit of thinking himself superior to others in wisdom and understanding. He looked down on those he considered inferior in some way. Does that help you to understand his character and how Elizabeth changed and humbled him? Was that the idea you had or was it something else?|`|AA10015648	He's just shy. His shyness is seen as unhappiness and as an "I'm better than you" sentiment, but he's actually a very happy, kind person. His relationship with his sister shows how he can be very intimate and openly happy with someone who he's close to, and proves how painfully shy he is in comparison to his relationship with everyone else.|`|eGI5s8R5aa	Darcy isn't really unhappy but his lifestyle has cultivated in him a definite air of superiority. I suppose from the outside looking in it would appear that he is unhappy because he doesn't smile and act silly or foppish in the same manner of his friend Bingley. I think--difficulty with Wickham and Georgiana aside--he is a fairly satisfied (if not, "happy") character|`|yL7RKxHFaa	He seems to hold himself above all the others. Like he thinks the Bennett family is extremely beneath him because of their odd behaviours, so he doesn't want to be associated with them. His nature is one that almost seems cold because of the situations that he has been through and the status that he needs to uphold when in view of the public eye. So, by acting out the part of a stern, rich man, he can get what he wants and he mainly just wants respect.|`|suxCcXkAaa	Darcy is just a shy, awkward sort of guy. He's got this super passionate side that he tries to mask w/ a gloomy exterior, so he just comes across as miserable.

3583d01c96008f0be07f6ab30e8798a0aa	Remember, discrimination works both ways.  Anytime one group is disallowed anything or allowed something because of race, or any other distinction (sex, sexual preference, hair color, religion, etc.) that is discrimination.    Your question is too broad to be answered here, even as long winded as people say I am.  Also you should note if you are including PAST discrimination, or present only; because things have gotten better for most groups.  And NEVER think that discrimination applies only to injustices done to Blacks, it goes WAY further and touches all of our families at one time or another.|`|cJQU6FJYaa	Don Imus got fired over what rappers routinely say in their music.|`|AA11999780	not hiring someone because of race, racial profiling, stereotypes and generalizations, denying a public service to someone because of race    and when it comes to jobs, it's not just hiring white people over other races. it's hiring anyone of a certain race just because of their race even though they aren't as qualified as someone of another race. it could be hiring an asian over a native american, a black person over an indian person,  etc.|`|14633823cbb912b6214dc275a51c258daa	Treating people differently based on race.

The white patrons can sit on the front when they are in the bus and "colored" patrons had to sit in the back row of the bus in the 20 centuries (about).

I don't practice it but know it when I see it. Let's see. Separate drinking fountains. Nope. Riding at the back of the bus. Nope. Rap music? Nope. Whites buy more rap than blacks. Being shut out of higher education? I don't think so. If you have a brain, you will succeed. Hold it, forgot! Rednecks! That's it! Bigots! Nazis! Sheesh. My mistake. Racial discrimination does exist with those who are ignorant and believe their race is superior when God has made us all equal! Darn. Blew it. My mistake. Think I'll put a question out on these pages. "Can you come up with another word for discrimination?" It doe's exhist, but it has taken on another meaning and feeling. By the way, I just posed the question back to the internet. Check it out. This should be interesting.. the question was more like "Give me a contemporary definition of discrimination." I launched it limbo, you follow if you are serious because I want to know also. Latest update Limbo, checking out my responses as of 10:19 CDST, nobody out there has a clue. I'll keep you posted if you want, but it's not worth it. Ignorance can be cured. Stupididity is forever.|`|a05a18d1a9fb32bf4d6b577ae90bca80aa	Hmmm... I seem to remember the "Whites Only" sign at the drinking fountains and bathrooms in our courthouse back when I was a kid.    I guess thats discrimination. But, I'm not sure anymore, since the "law" (Jesse and Al) says that the Black Caucus can hang a "Blacks Only" sign at the door.    Oh....I got one, recruitment of students and employees...EVERYONE is welcome...just not whites.

Es verdad que decidir tiene su riesgo, pero el que no arriesga, no gana. Precisamente en el riesgo est la ganancia, El que nunca arriesga, nunca pierde, pero tambin nunca gana.

AA11003158	Las diferentes longitudes de ondas las percibimos como "colores", que componen una peque?a parte del espectro electromagntico de la luz solar, estando dispuestos o distribuidos en lo que, en el mundo del Arte, se conoce como el crculo cromtico. Isaac Newton, fue uno de los primeros en estudiar el fenmeno de la luz y la teora del color.    Uno de sus experimentos ms famosos lo constituye la creacin de un crculo cromtico giratorio, llamado por algunos "Crculo de Newton", que consiste en uno sobre el cual se han coloreado sectores circulares iguales (como trozos de tarta). Cada uno de estos sectores circulares est pintado con uno de los colores del espectro solar, en orden correlativo: rojo, anaranjado, amarillo, verde, azul, a?il y violeta. Al hacer girar este crculo cromtico a gran velocidad, mediante un mecanismo de engranajes dispuestos para tal fin, la superficie del crculo se percibe de color blanco, desapareciendo momentneamente cada uno de los sectores circulares coloreados.

In Greece's dry climate, trees did not grow very well.  They grew olive trees, but since these trees take over twenty years to mature, olive wood is a scarce resource.  So, they had to rely on driftwood or imported timber; the timber would usually have come from the Black Sea region.
WVXVeN8Gaa	If anything, it's a hyperbole. I'm not sure who thumbed the person above me down, but I completely agree with her.    Plus, I'd consider choosing a different line, or possibly a different song. Choose a song with a little more depth and abstraction, especially if you are seeking a song that has literary device usage. Commercialized songs such as this won't do you any good.    To the person below me:    It's not a metaphor. The figurative action of "falling" is an exaggeration of her emotional state. A metaphor is a comparison, and the lyric is certainly not comparing a falling action to her emotional state.|`|wYF6U6qlaa	Yes, it's metaphor.  She's not actually 'falling' anywhere, she's using the image of a falling action to convey her emotional state.|`|XXc15qzzaa	no, it's poetic, unless she means it to be an overstatement (hyperbole of sorts)  but considering she singing teen angst I think she's serious.
amcqJkWhaa	Oh alright... jacyofearth.deviantart.com    Generally, it seems like good advice to say... draw what you feel.   And, although this doesn't seem to have any relevance to drawing, I think it's a good idea to check out some myths, the old ones... maybe check out Edith Hamilton's book, called Mythology, or so I remember...   And, personally I like to go to the library a lot, and there are so many books there. Check out your Reference section... there was a book on antique swords and daggers, and I think, once you get to see all the diversity and the realness of these things, I think you'll feel more free to experiment, because it was the maker's creativity and expression that led them to make artistic swords. Human's have a desire to personalize and be different, to be creative and such, so I think if you are going to be drawing, drawing maybe fantasy (anime has lot's of swords, right?), well, why try to conform to an image or icon of a sword, and, instead of that, wouldn't it be nice to just give your creativity reign supreme...? Because the very thing you're drawing, was made with the desire to be different.   Anyhow, just follow your inclinations, and well you'll have a rich memory and resource, seeing what history and nature has in store.     Haha. I hope that makes a bit of sense.

AjqO1aJgaa	Both are full of teens who think that they are unique and the world revolves around them.    The education system seems pretty similar.    The political system is too. It's set in "America" and the characters go to "Italy".    The books which Bella reads really exist.    And so on...they really are pretty much alike.|`|v70p2kgWaa	Twilight is urban fantasy not alt-world fantasy, thus much would be the same with the exception of the fantasy elements.|`|XXc15qzzaa	The problem most people have with Twilight is it's lack of reality.  The character's are flat and many are perfect (even Jacob with his flaws can be called a 'flat character' at times because his reactions do not fit his personality)    The most realistic personality is Rosalie. I know many people hated her but she was a redeeming factor in the books. She had motivation (beginning with the 3rd book) and her choices reflected her character. She wasn't completely evil, and she was far from being perfect.  Jasper had a little depth but unfortunately little part in the story. Emmet and Alice provided comic relief and a sense of humanity (weird to say about alice) so their small parts, though flat, are able to be called realistic because they have such small roles.    The whole falling in love is such a far cry from reality that it pained me to read it. But Bella's depression in the second book was very close to reality and I enjoyed reading it. (wow I sound sick and twisted)|`|z81JIycpaa	Be wary of your surroundings for there may be danger around every corner.    That and sparkly paedophiles who claim they can read minds.

They portray a relationship that is emotionally abusive as the most perfect true love, and a man who is a controlling stalker as the ideal guy. They portray all the so-called good people as attractive, and all the bad people as unattractive, or at least less attractive than the good people. They portray ordinary humans as nothing but mindless sheep; only super-special sparklepires can rise above that. Real life doesn't work that way.|`|xm0xo4cjaa	Unfortunatly the only reality in the book is the pedophilia. "Imprinting" on a child is pedophilia. We have a lot of sick people in this world who do those type of things in real life.

hQ95u9OLaa	Not confusing. Yes it would work best as a prologue. If you like you can do it several times during the  book. Sometimes an author will put that part in italics. And this will help move the action along and give the reader (and writer) a break from the narrator.     One more thing. Maybe don't let your readers know what's going on when it happens. The English Patient, while confusing, is a satisfying read because one doesn't always know whether s/he is in the past or the present or just what. It calls for careful attention to the story. Needless to say this would have been anathema to Harper Lee (I think), who wrote a seamless masterpiece that a child could understand but appealed to the most sophisticated reader.    I know I go on and on but film director Stanley Kubrick deliberately hid his themes so that movie goers would have to concentrate extra on the plot. His thinking was that if he didn't tell the audience everything that was going on straightforwardly, they would figure things out for themselves and have a better movie-going experience.|`|yaoQNMHYaa	You can switch between first and third person!|`|AA10015648	Make it in 3rd person instead - You can switch point of views very easily in 3rd person.    In 1st person, you CAN switch people, but they have to be, like, completely different chapters. Like:    Chapter 1: Allie    Chapter 4: Jason    And whoever is the chapter person, is the one whose point of view it's from. Of course, if you're only going to depart ONCE from the main character, then that's an awkward way to do it.

B8Eusu5iaa	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle doesn't really tell us what Dr Roylott is thinking, otherwise we would know exactly what was going to happen. He doesn't use a sense of dramatic irony unlike other authors, he just creates the characters in a way that we may only suspect a tiny thing. So no, I don't think we get to follow Dr Roylotts thoughts. Hope this helps.  :-)
KH3kbRjgaa	How 'bout trying to write a "scaffold poem". See if it helps ?    Write a copy of the poem (you like) with enough space between each line for you to write another line there, a line that you will create to fit with the sense of the scaffold lines. Beneath each line of the scaffold poem, write a line of your own that "fits," making sense in the context of the "scaffold" line above and the line below. Do this for each line of the scaffold poem. When this is complete, you delete the lines of the scaffold poem. This leaves only your own lines. You now have the first draft of your poem.

draNVjbkaa	Your actual name can be confused with Erika Christensen, hot actress and Scientologist.    How about Kristian Erics? You don't see too many people that have that name starting out with a K (usually spelt Christian). Then your first name stands out with regards to spelling and your last name is easy to spell and to remember.    I don't see that name or anything similar sounding on IMDB, so check with SAG and it's yours!    Also, if you had a middle name, it would give us more to work with.    UPDATE: Scott is too common of a name both as a first and last. There is an Eric Scott, a Christian Scott (Same sound as Kristian Scott), and a Scott Christian on IMDB.com    Kristian Erics is the best that I could derive from your current name. No one on IMDB has a name that's similar sounding to that so if you took it, you'd be the only one.|`|m6CIhrgqaa	Ricky Jansen, Chris Ericsson, Edward Kable... Just a few suggestions, but your real name is still pretty good for acting.|`|U0kMn5bmaa	I agree thatd be a cool first name, Kristian, but I dont really like Ericsen as the last name.

Kristian is pretty cool, yeah :)  what about Kris instead?    Kris Erika? oooh yeah i like that, that's got a ring to it!   ladies and gentlemen... presenting..     KRIS ERIKA!    orr. EK Ristiansen??  um...your name at the mo is pretty cool already..    whatever you pick, i bet it'll be cool :)|`|HOnU9AQlaa	Kristien Scott  shortened version of your last name, but instead of an A its an E (for eric) then scott for ur last name.    think about it lol girls can be like "omg, kristien scott is so hot. i love him" hahaha    my stage name is my first and middle name. like raven-symone. its Dominique Chantee` (pronounced shawn-tay)
mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  I love this book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.|`|zLUXqOY8aa	I don't know what your into but try The Vampire Diaries by L.J Smith.|`|nxAVIjb1aa	Gone by Michael Grant  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins

aeODdMATaa	They are pieces of your soul, in that case Voldermort. He can put them in anything he wants. They have to be destroyed before you can finish off the person.|`|daza5A4vaa	Voldemort split his soul into seven pieces.  Every time you kill somebody, your soul rips a little.  As a result, he took the torn pieces, and put them into objects.  The objects then became a horcrux.    So, until all the horcruxes have been destroyed, Voldemort can't die, because pieces of his soul still live.    It's an awful thing to do. Very taboo.|`|L280cFeOaa	Voldemort ripped his soul into seven parts by killing people. It is possible for him to pull himself back together as u find out in the next book which is the BEST one in the series.|`|zWdKGLzbaa	Horcruxes are like part of someone's soul. Like someone takes part of their soul and puts it in an object so that they can't die unless someone destroys all their horcruxes. I can't really explain it because it's confusing but that's the best I can do:)|`|N0A8mCuzaa	In an online diary entry, Rowling described a Horcrux as a "receptacle in which a Dark wizard has hidden a part of his soul for the purposes of attaining immortality." With part of a wizard's soul thus stored, the wizard becomes immortal so long as the Horcrux remains intact. For this reason, Horcruxes are typically hidden in a safe location. Even if the wizard's body is destroyed, a portion of his soul will remain preserved within the Horcrux. However, the destruction of the creator's body leaves the wizard or witch in a state of half-life, without corporeal form. The Dark magic involved in the creation of a Horcrux is considered most despicable and is therefore rarely published, even in books devoted to the Dark Arts.    A Horcrux can be made from any normal object, including living organisms. Destroying a Horcrux will destroy the fragment of soul contained within it, ending its protection and returning the creator to a state of mortality. If a wizard has created more than one Horcrux, he will remain immortal until all are destroyed. Once destroyed, the wizard will die normally if mortally wounded.    The portion of soul within a Horcrux also has the ability to take spiritual possession of other people. This possession is limited to those who become emotionally attached to the Horcrux. Once possessed, the soul within the Horcrux can take total control of the person's actions while the person remains completely unaware of the connection. Once a person has become possessed by a Horcrux, the Dark Wizard has the ability to take corporeal form by draining the life force of the possessed person. None of these spiritual connections extend to a wizard's other Horcruxes. The portions of soul also possess some level of sensory awareness, being able to sense when in danger and defend themselves.|`|iEsICA3Maa	A Horcrux is an object in which a Dark wizard or witch has hidden a fragment of his or her soul for the purpose of attaining immortality. Constructing a Horcrux is considered extremely Dark magic, as it violates laws of nature and morality, and requires a horrific act as well as murder to accomplish. The first Horcrux was created by Herpo the Foul Lord Voldemort is the only known wizard to have created more than one. The creation of a Horcrux can be reversed by its creator through truly feeling real remorse for murdering, apparently to the point of being fatal.    Horcruxes can also be destroyed by others, seeing as the piece of the soul depends upon its container to survive; the opposite of a human being. Destruction of a Horcrux is difficult, but not impossible, and requires that the object be damaged beyond magical repair. One of the most foolproof methods of destruction is Basilisk venom. Very few other methods work, such as through a magical smelting procedure, such as with Fiendfyre. The Killing Curse seems to be capable of destroying a Horcrux if it is animate  as the part of Voldemort's soul contained in Harry Potter was destroyed when he was struck with the Killing Curse in 1998.  SPOILER ALERT. TURN BACK NOW!!!!  Albus Dumbledore, Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom used Godric Gryffindor's Sword to destroy the Gaunt's Ring, Salazar Slytherin's Locket and Nagini respectively. This was only achievable as the sword was made by Goblins; Goblin-made artifacts can be imbued with certain qualities, so when it was impregnated with Basilisk venom when Harry Potter slayed the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, it became capable of destroying all the Horcruxes.    Harry Potter and Hermione Granger used Basilisk fangs to destroy Tom Riddle's Diary and Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, respectively.|`|yaoQNMHYaa	They split your soul making you immortal, your body can die but you can't because part your soul is trapped in an object|`|RXe4guclaa	when a person wants to split their soul in more than one piece, they use horcruxes. a horcurux is an object that has someone else's soul in it. someone would do this if they want to become immortal, so in order to kill the person, you have to kill the horcrux first, which you can only do a certain way. horcruxes look like an object that are usually very special to the person. so like, a really really expensive necklace that's a family heirloom could be a horcrux. you make one by murdering a person. it's really unusual to even make one horcrux, but to make seven, like voldemort did, was unheard of. horcruxes are probably the Darkest thing in the wizarding world.      sorry if that's confusing. lol|`|AA10339330	When a wizard kills someone the act tears the soul in half.  A horcruxe is used to store one of the pieces so if you should your body be killed or destroyed your soul is still intact.  I horcruxe can be any object that the wizard wants to use.      This is how Voldemort was able to return.|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	Horcruxes are parts of someone's soul that is place in a powerful object|`|dqvZmj22aa	you saw all 3 of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies?  Think of it like Davy Jones cutting out his heart and locking it away to become immortal.

My 14 year old is reading it. I think Stephenie Meyer makes it a good point to keep her book PG13 and it all depends on your daughters maturity level too.|`|SFGNnKfWaa	yes, but they dont describe it or anything. it is perfecly fine. no bad words or anything.  nothing bad.|`|XyKnvoypaa	In Breaking Dawn they do have a few sex scenes but it's not descriptive or anything. It's not like it tells about the parts and what they did. ^^;;|`|A0hxQ7e9aa	Hey I read all four Twilight books and I loved them so much! The fourth one Breaking Dawn, does have a few of those scenes but it is nothing bad. The author does not describe the scenes with very much detail. I am in middle school and Its probably not any worse then anyhting she has heard about. So I say let her read it because it is a really great book! I have read the book almost 3 times...in fact I am reading it now. The scenes range from chapters 5-7. Chapter 5 starts on page 75 and is called Isle Esme. These chapters are about what happened  on Bella and Edwards honeymoon. If you would like to read it for a second opinion to decide if it is appropriate for her than go for it!!! I really hope I helped!(Overall I think it would be okay for her to read it my whole school is full of people her age and basically everyone has read the fourth one.) I think she should be fine reading this book.|`|73e09dd591f8699b125662ff9256c8a4aa	they do, but its not descriptive.  she should be fine ;]|`|i5L49GFOaa	They do have sex a couple times but it is definitely not descriptive. The first time it actually has three stars and then they woke up in the morning. I think it is appropiate for a twelve year old to read. It is very good.|`|jz26NkTMaa	I Dont know what chapter but it is not descriptive sex. Its like they wake up and they notice he has tore of the bed because well, he is soooo strong and he hurt something besides her..     im 15 and i read it. it was fine.|`|3COLbmyGaa	yea there are some sex scenes but they aren't detailed and they really only hint not like...oh yea were having sex. and if shes 12 she probably has already been exposed to all of this and if not, she won't understand the hints.|`|Ak9YaBzTaa	Yes in the last book there is. It does not go into detail about it. It simply has them kissing, and then she wakes up the next morning with bruises and feathers all around her. In this book she also gets pregnant. I'm not exactly sure about the chapter its somewhere near the beginning though.|`|1XRAiA5eaa	Yes. There are sex scenes in Breaking Dawn (last book.) It does not go into detail, but the author hints at it. I am 13, and read them when I was 12. Nothing too bad happens at all, really. You know whats going to happen, so there is no need to say it straight. Isle Esme Is one of the chapters for sure. I think that's it but you'll be fine. Really, no detail at all.|`|x2XuPckzaa	Ya, they do have sex but it is not as bad as you think, she doesn't like describe it.  I personally think the birth scene is much worse
