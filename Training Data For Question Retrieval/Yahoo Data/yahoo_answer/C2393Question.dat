I have a friend who has taught kindergarden for almost 40 years..she is going back & forth about whether to retire or not...she recieved a kit that tells her all about the financial & practical stuff..but she knows she doesn't want to stop working completely....She lives about 45 min. from the school she will leave & is thinking of working some place nearby in our suburban area...she doesn't want to be sorry...do you know of anyone who has retired & found something to do that they are happy about..she doesn't even know if she should go back to school or start in a new line of work...she is looking at veteranian assistant jobs. So any insight or actually experiences about this might help her see the reality of this better will help as she is gathering this info.

20081014183419AAEv2W1	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	What do you think about these grades for junior year?	Okay, so I'm 16, and a junior in high school. In the past, I've never really studied, but always maintained straight A's. I always did all my homework. Now, though, I find myself just not caring as much. Don't get me wrong, I'm still doing fairly well--I've got an A- in English, A in history, A+ in my electives. It's just that I've always gotten all A+'s or all A+'s with just one A.      My main problem, I guess, is English. I'm not exactly comfortable with the A-. With all the things going on in my life, like a job, theatre, National Honor Society, Speech team, Interact club, and Destination Imagination, I just don't have time to read a twelve page packet and answer five questions for a homework grade of seven points. This is bringing my grade down, but because I do exceptionally well on writing assignments (I was the only one to get an A+ on our last paper), and tests, I still get a pretty decent grade. So what do you think about this? Is the sacrifice worth it, and will colleges still see this and like it?

"I love my puppy Fluffy. She's the greatest friend I'll ever have. I'll never forget the day I   found her. Two years ago my friends and I were walking home from school, suddenly we see a   puppy walking down the street as if it were lost. It had white curly hair and blue eyes, It was a   Maltese. It was the cutest puppy ever, it had a little red bow on her head, but didnt have a   collar. My friends and I walked toward her and started to pet it, she looked really hopeless   and sad. I wanted to take her home with me but my friends told me that was not the right   thing to do because that was called stealing and we were not sure if that poor puppy was lost.    So then we just headed home, while we were walking home we heard footsteps behind us,  I turned around and it was the puppy again it followed us all the way to my house. I was   surprised and happy at the same time, I didnt know what to do because it looked really  sad and hungry and had no were to go. So I went inside my house and took her in with me.              I gave her plenty of food, and cleaned her. I knew I was not allowed to have a pet in   our house so I asked my friends if they can take her home and keep her for a while, but they  were not allowed to have a pet in their house either. When my parents came home I quickly  hid the puppy because I was afraid they were going to get mad at me. The puppy kept on  barking so I finally told my parents and explained them why I brought it home. My dad told  me to make flyers of the puppy and post it outside that says lost puppy, and my mom was so   mad because the puppy was walking on the carpet and dirtied our house and she wanted her  out of the house immediately.   The next morning when I woke up, I got started on the flyers and posted them outside   my block. A week passed and no one has called in for the lost puppy. So my parents told me I  had to take it to the vet or give her for adoption, I was really sad because I was use to having   her live with us. I bought her new clothes, bed, toys, collar, and always gave her a bath   and fed her, I took real good care of her like she was my best friend. I started to cry and   beg my parents to let me keep her when they told me they were going to take her to the vet,   my dad seemed not to have a problem with it but he wanted me to ask my mom because she   doesnt like animals. When I asked my mom she kept on saying no, then she realized how much   I cared for her and took real good care of her so she told me I can keep her only if I clean after   her every day, and if I dont she would make me take it to the vet.              When they told me I can keep her I was so happy I was jumping up and down anxiously.  Finally I decided it was time to give her a name, I decided to name her Fluffy because she was  really tiny, fluffy, and chubby, and looked like a white soft pillow. I also built Fluffy a dog house   in our backyard and bought her a collar that had a name tag on it. Also every time I go out   I take Fluffy everywhere I go, she is so tiny that I just put her in my purse and no one can  ever notice her. I had Fluffy for about two years now, Im so glad I found her, she is like my best   friend and I wont know what to do without her.

20090225160804AAft2Ut	Education & Reference;Homework Help	How does this sound for a Thesis statement?	Well   im writing this paper and its due this friday   but its rather difficult   more so than i expected   my teacher was really vague on the whole prompt   for the sole purpose of having different essays   but im not sure my thesis statement is all that good   so any guidelines?   or what not   oh yea and its about   Hernest Hemingway's   3 stories   A very short story   Hills like white elephants   and   A Cat in the Rain   we have to find some sort of a    "universal theme" if you would   or find some way all the stories connect to each other/are similiar      My Thesis Statement:   Because of genetic factors and childhood experiences, the way Americans view a relationship has been corrupted, giving the Americans the need to be dominant in the relationship showing there Mental in-capabilities to be in a stable relationship.    My Body paragraphs are a bit tricky to   so anyone who can help   would be a lifesaver   thanks!!      The three American males in the stories are dominant over their partners in the relationship. Because of genetic factors and childhood experiences, the way Americans view a relationship has been corrupted, giving the Americans the need to be dominant in the relationship showing there Mental in-capabilities to be in a stable relationship. When the girl leaves the American, his life spirals down, he “contracted gonorrhea from a sales girl while riding through a taxi cab.” This would seem as something that only a “tramp” would do, however, since the American lost his dominance in the relationship, he couldn’t function normally. Taking into consideration the problems that arise from the American losing his dominance, portrays what sort of mental issues/ in-capabilities he has without dominance. When he contracts gonorrhea in a “taxi cab”, demonstrates how he let go of what morals, self respect, and dignity he had for himself. By losing his dominance his ability to function normally is then deteriorated. Above all the American needs to rule in the relationship.

20090116114318AALzkRt	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What are my chances to get into an American University, as an international student ? ?	Hi !  I am going to take my TOEFL tomorrow morning (Erg...), but I don't know if I will get the scores required to the universities (more than 70%!) where I have applied : UT Austin and the College of William & Mary... I am not stressed, but I haven't had so much time to prepare myself to this test. Anyway, I am not pessimist and I am feeling good and self-confident!   But I wanted to know what chances do I have to get into those universities (especially to reassure me...). What is the importance of the TOEFL & SAT scores in an application file ?    I think that I have submitted two good applications, but I am afraid that my TOEFL and SAT scores will not be so exceptional...I have some strong experiences (volunteer in Africa and for a world music festival), I have traveled a lot, my native language is French, but I speak Dutch too. I have learned Latin and Greek and I do a lot of extracurricular activities (sports and art)... That is the reason why I think that I have a "strong" application. Moreover, I come from Belgium and I have heard that the universities are looking for students from Europe because they want to diversify their student body... So that's a good point for me !    Excuse me to talk a lot about me, but I have spent a lot of time on my essays and to complete my files (like a lot of students I suppose)... I have received a few days ago my green card. But those universities are very selective and the system is totally different from the one in my country...  I think I will be very disappointed if I am not accepted because I have worked hard during several weeks...     What do you think ?    Thank you !    *Sorry for my grammar mistakes...

20090130193927AAM2iib	Education & Reference;Teaching	I want to be a high school teacher..have i chosen the wrong subjects!? = (?	I am currently a year 12 student at a NSW high school, and after having a really inspirational teacher since year 9 to the present I am passionate about becoming a teacher myself to help children in future generations and hopefully inspire them. I just love school and the school atmosphere and I can't wait to be a teacher.      I want to be a HSIE teacher (Geography and Society and Culture) beause I love those 2 subjects and they are the only 2 i do in the HSIE area of school.       Do you think I would need to be able to have experience in more than just those 2 areas of HSIE (such as history or business studies) and be able to teacher more than just those 2 subjects?   I'm really worried because i'm in the 2nd term of HSC year and I'm not sure if i should have taken more HSIE subjects.    Have I ruined my chances of becoming a teacher!?      My subjects are:    - Society and Culture    - Geography    - PDHPE    - english (advanced)    - extention english    - general maths      Please, please help!!    Thank you in advance!! XX
