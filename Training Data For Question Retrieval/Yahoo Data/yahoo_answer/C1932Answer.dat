If you have already lost your phone, then try the box in which your phone came. The IMEI no. will be written on the box, provided you have bothered to keep the box. If not, then contact your service provider, give your phone number and ask them to locate the phone with your IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identification) number which is a unique identifier stored on your SIM card. When this SIM card is used in any phone even if no call is being made, it is possible to locate the whereabouts of the SIM card depending on which base transceiver (BTS) is being contacted by the user.|`|AA11133415	Contqact your service provider asap.|`|08486a5379c69c9e54f4ffca9e2775c4aa	i'm sorry but if a random person off the street stole it... it can easily be unlocked for 10bux!!!  so it wouldn't make much of a difference!|`|AA11839204	Sorry to say>forget that phone my pal....|`|65c124fa96d54a366c12ebcc531328baaa	i don't think you get that back but you call your customer care service and asked him 4 lock your Sim card urgently otherwise he/she miss used your number for threaten someone or other illegal work n go to near police station n report there may b u got back (5% chance)
6f411ea96bb243ec423773a87c947ed8aa	The wireless industry came up with the idea of WAP. The point of this standard was to show internet contents on wireless clients, like mobile phones.     WAP stands for Wireless Application Protocol   WAP is an application communication protocol   WAP is used to access services and information   WAP is inherited from Internet standards   WAP is for handheld devices such as mobile phones   WAP is a protocol designed for micro browsers   WAP enables the creating of web applications for mobile devices.   WAP uses the mark-up language WML (not HTML)     The Wireless Application Protocol  The WAP protocol is the leading standard for information services on wireless terminals like digital mobile phones.    The WAP standard is based on Internet standards (HTML, XML and TCP/IP). It consists of a WML language specification, a WMLScript specification, and a Wireless Telephony Application Interface (WTAI) specification.    WAP is published by the WAP Forum, founded in 1997 by Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, and Unwired Planet. Forum members now represent over 90% of the global handset market, as well as leading infrastructure providers, software developers and other organizations. You can read more about the WAP forum at our WAP Forum page|`|AA10309280	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAP  "Wireless Application Protocol or WAP is an open international standard for applications that use wireless communication.

WAP is Wireless Application Protocol  A protocol is a set of rules and regulations.  WAP is a protocol stack specially designed for wireless devices such as mobile phones, PDA's,etc.   WAP, along with a communication medium (GPRS or GSM) enables the user to open websites in the device.  the websites are designed using special language called Wireless Markup Language.    Tip: The first mobile phone company to implement WAP in their mobile phones was ALCATEL.

dv84UtFmaa	well you can hook a ipod to a car sterio and take it everywhere you go. It also stores pics and etc. well he can bring it to the studio and play it on some huge speakers that have a boomin sound. Also @ the studio he can record his music on his ipod and then listen to it in the car. The ipod can get so many things on there and i really easy to take care of. I think it would be a good gift for your husband. He can even record the video of his band on it. Welll good luck and hope it works out for it!!!!!!!!

First, and most importantly, it does not have a micro SD card.  That means you are limited to the storage provided on the phone for pictures, songs and messages.  Second, the 1.3 MP camera is not up to par with many others I have seen lately.  Some phones offer up to 5 MP cameras (although they cost much more).  I guess it depends on which applications you want to use.  I find the MP3 player to be very good.  I purchased an aftermarket headset and get very good quality from the MP3s.  Oh, one other thing, I am not sure if other phones do this but the Katana stalls sometimes when playing MP3s.|`|AA11025423	I've got one and I like it.

Depending on your sound system if it has an AUX output you simply need to buy an Audio cable. This plugs right from the headphone input on the ipod to the AUX imput on the home system. If your system does not have an AUX imput youll need to plug the cable into the systems audio in imput.

I am simply going to point out facts.  If you do not have a high def TV which 70 % of americans don't yet.  whats the point of a high def system in which the game are 10 more expensive.  the wii is less than half the cost of ps3.   Zelda is the best wow well done.  there are a few games but its a good start. PS3 does not have any "classics" out for release.  ff12 is for PS2  so its not worth pay 600 for ff12.  the motion sensing on the PS3 was a last minute thing. so much they eliminated other functions to accomodate it(no vibrateing controler )  If you have the cash and a 62 in highdef TV then 600 is nothing go for the complete PS 3.  I personaly am more than happy with my wii if the only good game to ever come out is Zelda like many ps fans claim. it was worth it    Ohh and the virtual system.  (another last minute ps thing with like 3 games)   You will have access to all sega genesis  NES SNES N64 and turbo graphics  games at this point the library is limited to about 40 games but its growing

Il costo  assolutamente competitivo ma i formati riprodotti sono alquanto limitati (praticamente riproduce solo film in H264). Avessero fatto un accordo con DivX Inc. avrebbero spaccato, ma cos...sono perplesso...inoltre bisogna pensare che negli USA iTunes Store ha a catalogo anche moltissimi film, per cui gli americani possono tranquillamente acquistare un film via iTunes e vederselo tranquillamente sul plasmone da 42 pollici.

Essendo wifi con maggiore memoria far da disco esterno e si potranno scambiare i file tra cell e cell e tra cell e Mac/Pc, connettersi ad appleTv che li rigirer sul televisore... insomma tante applicazioni che consolideranno il prodotto, fino quasi a sostituire il portatile.|`|7389ac11f11a741594cd41863ec302bbaa	Come grafica e linee apple  imbattibile, se ci pensi in fondo di lettori mp3 ce ne sono tanti e anche molto buoni ma alla fine avere l'iPod  pi uno status quo che altro.

JmIMtpOpaa	Boa pergunta,   Mas eu te fa?o outra pergunta,  voc sabe qual  a tecnologia mais avan?ada do mundo?       o prprio Homem, pois  ele que cria as mquinas, sem ele a mquina n?o  nada!    Voc me pergunta quantos megapixeis tem o olho humano, e eu te respondo, infinito,  Vareia da vis?o de cada um, mas n?o existe medida para o homem!|`|4cd37511a307eec6ae46566ad5b9f1d2aa	O meu deve estar com 1.3 o da minha esposa 0.1 em um e 0.8 no melhor;|`|9df412d58bb80d89d8e80415e9c54b53aa	Para saber isso vc deveria digitalizar uma imagem como vc a v, da vc poderia calcular quais as dimens?es, em pixelXpixel, contm a imagem digitalizada.

fv3fvYyRaa	I have worked for Cingular and had some friends who worked for Sprint, and I can say from my experience, they are scandalous. I remember being on the phone with customers and our supervisors wouldn't budge to make the customer happy, and if the customer made them mad, they would just hang up on them. I have Verizon now, and so does just about everyone I know (except for the few who have Metro PCS b/c their credit is shot). Verizon  had a new promo going on too. You try the service for 30 days and if you dont like it, you can cancel and you dont have to pay for any of the calls that you made. I never have issues with dropped calls and with all the Verizon people I talk to, I never run out of min b/c I get unlimited to other Verizon customers.|`|hBkpYXZvaa	Thats like asking which lawyer is not a liar.

N3RTQXU0aa	You should definitely go Nikon Coolpix L5. It may not look like a sleek Kodak but Kodak has some major flaws in its cameras. Nikon has really perfected its cameras. GO FOR NIKON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|rNvXWMOMaa	My favorite camera in that price range is:    The best camera for under $200 is the Canon A550    * 7.1 Megapixel  *4X Optical Zoom  * Very good photo quality, noise levels low through ISO 400 (in good light)  * Well built for the price  * Very good performance  * LCD visible in low light  * Some manual controls  * AF-assist lamp, good low light focusing  * Good movie and continuous shooting modes  * Impressive software bundle  * Uses AA batteries; great battery life  * USB 2.0 High Speed support|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	There are many good cameras in this price range.  Kodak's tend to be pretty good deals, but if you are a sticker for the absolutely finest image quality- they fall a bit short.  However- they're easy to use, and for $180, the V803 isn't a bad choice.  It's certainly cute, you get the legendary Kodak color and a very easy to use camera.  It also has a larger ccd than most- which should perform a bit better at high ISO- although I haven't seen a review.    The Olympus FE-240 is very slim, it it gives you a 5x zoom lens and is only $215 at Newegg.    You can pick up a Panasonic FX01 which has a 28mm wide angle leica 3.6x lens and image stabilization for about that price.  it's pretty cute.    the sony W55 is sub $200 and it's cute and probably a good camera.  No special features- well, other than a little optical viewfinder FWIW|`|cdba03006999193f51f060be4864d7fdaa	well if you are looking for a camera with a lot of megapixels and some pretty kool features i think you should take a look at the Canon SD900. 10 Megapixels. its pretty tiight. i just bought it about two weeks ago and its really an awesome camera. lots of features. gives you all the comfort you need with cropping  and editing pictures. comes with the Digic III Processor. The newest one so far. on this camera you can do a black and white picture and only have one color showing.  i wouldnt go with the 7.1 megapixel cameras because that is the standard megapixels that cameras are coming out with now. It would take a while for a camera to have 10 MP standard on it. go for the 10 megapixels.   This camera comes with all the comfort of using it. Dont go for the new sony camera with the touchscreen because if you push the screen to hard you can have a white spot on it forever.

TIZEGVHdaa	Yes but it's a real pain for Nextel users to access text messages and reply. The typical Nextel user has to log onto the phones web service and text messages involve a process similar to accessing email. It isn't instant.|`|8aZQMPW2aa	yes u can if u have the person numba|`|7T7P5yaPaa	Yes - I'm in charge of my company's Nextel phones/radios, and a lot of phones receive "text messages" that are basically junk mail - and I'm asssuming that some or most of these are originating from other services (not Nextel/Sprint).    Get the person's number, and give it a shot!

ztvLRwl7aa	2) when your iPod is connected there should be a menu that shows stats of your iPod. There are three sections. two white with a gray sandwiched in between. onthe bottom white one there are four items. Check  "Manually Manage Music" and that should do it|`|DZ5b77Lfaa	When you hook up your Ipod, and you have Itunes open, Itunes should automatically open up the tab for your Ipod, or you can just go to it on the side menu. Then it shows a picture of your ipod and it has that bar that has how much space you've used on the Ipod on this particular tab. There should also be several boxes you can checkmark to toggle certain options. One of them should be to manage music manually. Then, it will show the library on your Ipod and you can drag what songs you want on to your ipod. Make sure you toggle the 'sync music' one off.    As for the other question, I don't think there is a way to do that, unless there is one that I am unaware of.|`|sB8Z5lDGaa	itunes should not import the same song  if they already on your library    either way  u can do another playlist  the songs of your choice  then u can sync it to your ipod
LA75vblUaa	The easiest ways to do it is... (there other ways too)    Go to Windows Media Player (version 11, recommended). Connect your device. Windows Media Player will detect it. Then you should be brought to the sync tab. If not, select the sync tab yourself (located on the top). Select the songs you want to add and drag to to the sync list. Hit start sync. Simple as that.     or    Connect your player. Go to My Computer > Sansa (or whatever your device is named) > MUSIC... In most cases this file is "hidden" for certain reasons. To unhide, go to Tools (Should be located on top of your broswer) > Folder Options > View Tab > Show hidden files and folders. Now that you got it to "unhide" you can open it up. On a seperate Window, locate the folder that you songs are in. Select the ones you would like to add. Drag them into your MUSIC folder for your Sansa.    For more details go here/ other methods: http://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.as... Addition how-to videos are also found there.|`|1fhP1oddaa	This will show you how to pt songs on it = http://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.as... / adding video/music to sansa|`|ztvLRwl7aa	you should be able to open the folder that has music in it, and copy it to the scan disk (when it is connected)
ztvLRwl7aa	you're fine. mine does that too. it must just be that you pushed the usb adapter back in.     just disconnect again.|`|9tpLHC7Saa	ipods are crap get a zune|`|Ir8IbQZJaa	To tell u the truth, it really doesnt matter all that much if u unplug it while it says not to. Apple just does that so that if something does happen (which it wont), they wont get sued and end up buying u a new ipod.
ztvLRwl7aa	you have to download a separate software to do that         http://digg.com/software/Copy_music_from...|`|ivv3NiXbaa	It should be there.   But, do you mean you want these songs to automatically play without the ipod in your computer?
ztvLRwl7aa	i think u have to play it in quicktime
ztvLRwl7aa	dont restore it. that will erase all the songs.    You might be able to just plug it in, and move songs to it

Cl8FwsI2aa	If you don't mind spending extra cash, then go for the Elite. If you do mind spending extra cash, then get the Premium/Pro. To be honest, there's no significant difference between the two variations of the console.

Good luck.|`|dWH6H2HVaa	Go elite if you plan to have xbox live for 12+1 months  and pro if anything before that

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	The cool thing about the Fusic is that it has a built in  FM transmitter ,the chocalte doesn't,so you can easily play your songs in your car or home stereo.    Otherwise there are pretty similar. The chocalte can do an hours worth of video while the Fusic can only do half an hour.
912889ffe6d1f7e7c946f67482ee58dcaa	Odds are the disk is the problem.  You may wanna try cleaning it.  Otherwise you might wanna find a replacement (which will be very hard now).  I remember having to get 3 copies of FFVIII because disk 2 kept on getting damaged (oh my luck).    As for your playsation being the problem, that's unlikely since you've already tested it on another console.    As for saving your game you can only do that at the save points.  And you can't skip cutscenes either.
w6lVjQigaa	All 3 of the TV's are great. Personally I would get the Toshiba as my first choice as it had pretty much everything you need. It also looks very nice. My second choice would be the LG.

80a452cb6d25c59f21e1c745c7b3ed58aa	Chiunque riceva del traffico in roaming, paga per tutta la durata la telefonata.. perch utilizza una rete che non  la propria.    E' indifferente se la telefonata proviene da un fisso o da un altro mobile...    Quando mi capita di andare all'estero e rimanerci per pi di qualche giorno, infatti, acquisto delle prepagate del posto. cos posso evitare i salatissimi costi degli operatori stranieri...|`|AA11643278	il fatto  che non esistono collegamenti diretti tra le reti di operatori mobili di differenti paesi, ma esistono tra operatori di rete fissa.  Mi spiego.  In Italia, tra Wind e Tim ad esempio esistono collegamenti diretti per permettere ai clienti dei due operatori di parlarsi a vicenda. Cos anche tra Vodafone e Telecom Italia ad esempio.  Ma metti il caso tu da 3 Italia chiami in Spagna Telefonica (fisso).  La chiamata passa da 3 a, faccio un esempio, Telecom Italia, che ha il collegamento diretto con Telefonica. Ovviamente Telecom Italia deve essere pagata. Ecco perch le chiamate da cellulari italiani verso l'estero sono pi care.  Ora metti che sempre da 3 Italia chiami un cliente Amena, sempre in Spagna, di rete mobile.  La chiamata passa attraverso Telecom Italia, che la instrada a Telefonica, che a sua volta la instrada ad Amena. Non sarebbe possibile creare collegamenti diretti tra tutti gli operatori mobili europei, che quindi devono usare i collegamenti internazionali della rete fissa.  Il costo della chiamata che deve quindi sopportare l'operatore 3  pi elevato.    Alcuni operatori di rete fissa, infatti, distinguono pure il prezzo delle chiamate se verso europa fisso, o se verso europa mobile.    Forse sto perdendo il filo della risposta.  Comunque, se uno chiama una rete fissa estera, nel prezzo della chiamata che lui sostiene  gi incluso il prezzo che verr dato all'operatire estero. Cos come se chiamo un mobile estero nella sua rete di casa.  Ma se chiamo un numero italiano che  all'estero, la chiamata ha costi pi elevati perch qualcuno deve pagare il servizio terminale dell'operatore mobile estero. In questo caso chi riceve, visto che chi chiama non pu sapere dove si trova il chiamato. Quindi tutte le chiamate ricevuto all'estero costano per chi riceve, indipendentemente dalla provenienza.|`|1fa7c9421807536c37e5eb4d05f5f183aa	credo che se tu chiami DA UN FISSO a UN CELLULARE all' estero paghi tu il costo della telefonata non quel che riceve la telefonata  se invece chiami tu DA UN CELLULARE  a un' altro CELLULARE pagano tutti e due    ti conviene se vuoi telefonare o farti telefonare farlo sempre da un fisso anche perch costa sempre di meno|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	si, putroppo  cos, infatti  una fregatura mai vista...magari ti fai chiamare x non spendere troppo intanto che sei via e invece di fottono cos!!!!|`|13a04173687c0664bf515023f80fd5fdaa	yes

qR4xcTfaaa	B"H    There is probably a problem with the card, you should format it on you PC and upload some pictures from your PC to the card and check if you can access them on your PC from the card, if you are able to do so then erase them from the card then Format the card again and slide in the camera, it should work.  If not, then try a new good quality card to make sure the problem is with the camera and not the card.  In order to prolong the life of the card, always reformat it on your PC after you download you pictures, even if there are only a few pics.
gSvuiq51aa	Its extremely rare to find this game on pc now your best bet would be to turn to ebay or amozon. this is a vintage game and is pretty hard to come across these days
EfejPjIMaa	Yes you can.  If your TV has an audio out, then hook the HDMI up to the TV and your audio out from the TV to the Audio Receiver.  HDMI gives you 5.1 audio (assuming you have 5.1 receiver and not using a stereo system).  You will then get the Digital audio, but still use your surround sound for the audio.     Of course if your TV doesn't have audio out, then never mind.  There are a bunch of other ways to hook up to get digital audio, but I would be here forever describing the different ways.|`|7gL9laqLaa	yes but why would you do that if the HDMI does audio and video???    Vote me best answer :)|`|7pzo0znAaa	Yes, it's possible...    I haven't gotten my new receiver yet, so that's how mine is currently set up.|`|owsQTW3oaa	Why would you need to do that?  Do you not have an Audio Out on your tv?  I'm sure the PS3 could only send 1 signal at a time with HDMI superceding analog out but I could be wrong.    I don't have an audio out on my new Philips.. but I did have a headphone out on the side of my tv.  I just ran my stereo plug that converts to audio (L) (R) IN bought at radio shack from my tv to my receiver and it works perfect!|`|HekFanRvaa	ABSOLUTELY.. IF YOU want to connect your audio to a sound system... that's the way to go... but better if you connect your TV's audio to a sound system.. it will be the same. At least you can also use the sound system even if your just watching TV programs.|`|YHu0s3JZaa	Yes, the PS3 allows you to do that.  The Digital Out port on the back should allow for you to do this.  Although, I haven't tried it myself. But my friend has and he said it can be done.  http://www.cnet.com.au/story_media/33927...  That is the picture of the back.    And just in case I am wrong, most TVs that are 720p and up should have a port for speakers.    -Wiiplay_ds|`|8SPM7jDkaa	hdmi does both audio and video.|`|saMSquNEaa	100% yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...
FDLeViM2aa	If you get the right model, it works pretty well. I'm pretty sure that there are versions that use tape and digital versions.

If u dont know wat ur doing, take it to ur local specialist and get it checked.    And for ur RAM problem.  Wat version of Vista are u running? Im guessing x86 (also known as 32-bit) whihc only supports slightly below 3GB of RAM.  U need to upgrade to 64-it vista if this is the case.  U can tell wat version ur vista is by going to Control Panel, going to "System and Maintenance" then "System"    There will be some specs on ur machine. The first section should be System, and the bottom one in there should be "System Type"    That will tell u if its the 32-bit system or the 64-bit.

According to Russell Arons, Vice President of Marketing at EA, "The June launch combined with the break-through game the team is building gives us the perfect runway to create awareness for The Sims 3. [It] will be the original IP summer blockbuster of 2009 as we build off the success of the best-selling PC franchise of all time to create awareness with both loyal Sims fans and new players."

Electronic Arts also mentioned in its official release that iPhone, iPod Touch, mobile, and Mac versions of the game would appear sometime in summer 2009.
YYZQl28zaa	Those have nothing to do with each other!.... Just take the coaxial connector from the Super Nintendo and plug it in the Cable/ANT in on the back of the TV..|`|iuY0sIL9aa	This site helps to explain connections.    http://www.geocities.com/columbiaisa/cab...    What output does the DVR box use?  What output does the super nintendo use (RF is my guess)    If the problem is that they both use the same output, and your TV has only one input, then either the super nintendo needs to have a pass through, or you need a switch box.    DVR----->super nintindo------->TV    or     DVR--------------->switch->TV  Super Nintindo->box|`|i5youcVxaa	You can hook the Coax to the TV or though the IN coax on the DVR box. You can also hook it up with AV cables to the box or the TV. I have a multi switch box on Mine so my NES SNES and Wii have there own switches, all hooked up at once through one line that switches.|`|jLpIHRHTaa	Super Nintendo?  Rockin' it old school...    If you're using the RF adapter that comes with the SN, it has a built-in feed-through.  Assuming your DVR receiver is hooked up to your TV by coaxial cable, what you want to do is unscrew the output cable that leads from your DVR to your TV, hook up your SN RF adapter to your TV, and then hook up your DVR output coax into your SN RF adapter.    If your SN and your DVR both hook up to your TV through A/V cables and your TV has only one A/V input, you can buy a switcher.  I have one that I use to keep my PS2 and GameCube hooked up to my Vizio with only 1 A/V input, and it works just great.  You can find them at Radio Shack and you'll probably have to lay down $20-30 for it.  Then you hook up both your SN and DVR to the switch, and the switch to your TV's A/V input.  You push a button to switch back and forth between the SN signal and the DVR signal.      If there's some other configuration your using just specify it in an edit.

You can get them for like $15. Stores charge ridiculously high prices for HDMI cables. Mine came with the Rocketfish one from Best Buy which they want around $70 for.
jLpIHRHTaa	You will be much better off using a computer for DVD and VHS copying.  If you don't have a DVD+R drive, get one.  If you're not particularly tech-savy and don't think you can handle installing a new drive in your system - or if you only have a laptop - get an external drive.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...     Now, here's the first problem: the Digital Millenium Copyright Act made it illegal to break the encryption of commercial DVDs.  That means you cannot buy legal software that will copy a commercial DVD.  However, it's generally accepted that it's perfectly legal under free use doctrine to make a backup of media you've purchased.  So what I'm presenting here is a way to back up your DVDs and VHS movies without breaking the law.    You need to buy the Video and Audio Capture Device from ADS Tech.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  The VACD has both an A/V in and an S-video input that you hook up your VCR or DVD player to, and a USB output that you connect to your computer.  You then have the option of either ripping video to store as a file on your computer or burning the video straight onto a DVD.      Warning: this will take a long time.  You will have to play every movie in its entirety to capture it onto a disc.  That means it'll take you about two hours to back up your average movie, and backing up a decent-sized library of movies could take you weeks or months.    This is actually the fastest way to convert VHS to DVD, since you have to convert analog to digital.  There are much, much faster ways to copy one DVD onto another (just copy the disc), but again, that breaks the law.

UAYzLyN4aa	There is no "3.1." There is 1.3. The difference between 1.0 and 1.3 is irrelevant to us.    There IS a difference between "Category 1" and "Category 2" cables. The difference is that Cat. 2 is tested to 1600p. There are no 1600p sources or displays today, but this should mean the cable should have more "margin" for 1080p performance with long runs. For a 75 foot run I would definitely get a Cat. 2 cable. Not that they cost that much - see monoprice.com .     Note that "120 Hz" does not make any additional demands on cable bandwidth. The "120 Hz" is all in the TV, not in the signal in the cable.|`|09zVUMBRaa	I found this answer:      There is no different cable for different HDMI versions. The wires are the same.    However, if you have higher data rates (1080p vs. 720p or 1080i, deep color, higher frequencies, whatever), and longer distances, it's really pushing the limits of what HDMI cables can handle. The poorly built cable (which apparently a lot of them were early on) buried in some guys wall might have been able to handle the earlier data rates, but when plugged into a 1080p/60Hz/deep color source can't handle the rate and drops bits.    Get a good cable (especially if you are doing 30 ft or more).|`|Ae5IYHjVaa	There is no such thing as a 3.1 HDMI cable...I'm guessing you meant a 1.3b HDMI cable...that is the latest standard.  I would recommend a 100ft HDMI cable.  You always want to give yourself a little leadway in length.......They can be bought online MUCH cheaper than what a store will charge.

Get a descent tripod, then the biggest battery that'll work with your camera, and lastly, a wider angle lens.  If you shoot in HDV, then your computer needs to be up for the task.  HDV files are huge in comparison to DV files.  Render times will be LONG...  If you want to shoot DV, then a panasonic AG DVX 100B will do very nicely...  For audio, you need mics on people or you'll just get lots of background noise when taping.  Wear headphones to ensure that you are getting what you think you're getting...  This is just the tip of the iceburg...  your best bet would probably be to go to a local community college and take a video production class so that you know what you're getting into.

UAYzLyN4aa	Using a converter box and using directTV (satellite) do not go together. It's one or the other, at least one at a time - you could have both hooked up to the TV and switch between them. But If you are not currently using any sort of antenna (either rooftop or "rabbit ears") you have no use for a converter box.     The converter box goes between your antenna and the TV... IF you were using an antenna... your antenna used to pick up digital transmissions, now it will pick up digital transmissions. Your old TV doesn't know how to display the new digital transmissions. The converter box lets you see the new digital over-the-air transmissions with your old TV. But you will not see them in HD because your old TV is not an HD TV.|`|hQf0BwT2aa	I hope you didn't buy a DTV box with the government subsidy if you have DirecTV.

HVQFVtelaa	The Klipsh were always great speakers, top of the line, state of the art. They were one of the first to back away from cone mid-ranges and tweeters and go to horns. I used to have trouble competing with them selling speakers, even though my company used the same basic technology, i.e. horns, low end driver design, cabinet design, and a 12DB per octave cut off rate on the crossovers.    The Klipsh corner-horns were always the big dogs in the line, but very few could afford them, much less have a place to put the huge room-corner speakers.     I never had a pair of those, but I had a pair of their gigantic predecessors, a vintage pair of 1961 Electro-voice Patrician corner-horns with the mighty 30 inch woofers. These were actually made for the huge movie theaters of the early days. Truly, truly earth shaking.

I would suggest you take at least a couple of advanced classes in photography instead of depending upon opinion or the "try and fail" method of teaching yourself photography.    Canon supplies an excellent owners manual that answers all those questions.    As long as you use your cameras meter, you will get close enough to fine tune your exposures ...

As for white balance, you should be shooting RAW for studio work, and white balance can be corrected in post, so just put it on auto. I could explain to you how to set all these things, but it could take a while and a much easier way to figure it out is to look in your manual which has all the answers you need about using your camera from a technical standpoint.

I'm not trying to rain on your parade, but 720p projectors(the low-end) will cost between $750 and $1200.  Bulbs usually have a life of 3-5000 hours of use, depending on brightness settings.  Don't forget you will also need to purchase an audio system with your projector because it most likely will not have speakers, or have very very crappy ones.

N1CIndMOaa	Hey Val,    I'm not familiar with the Sony, but I have the JVC. The biggest complaint of many camcorders is the lack of decent video in low light or even room light. Not sure which cameras are the best, but sometimes you loose another feature to make up for it. And camera manufactures know this very well (That's why they have so many to choose from)    If you want picture quality, then you'd need to upgrade to high definition camcorder, also known as AVCHD. I have one and it's awesome, but it was expensive and requires a souped up computer to work with the high compressed video for editing, etc.|`|42tTsVuxaa	Go for Mini-dv every time, a simple example is that anything that involves compressed video = reduced quality. Hdd, sd card, all work with MP4 Compressed files so they can get so much video onto the space available.    Every video editing package works perfectly with Mini-dv, it doesn't matter if you want High def or Std def, you can get it on tape, another bonus is that they are cheap.    professionals still use tapes I think that says a lot.    do a search for "best camcorder format" and see how many times Mini-dv is there      All the best       RR
EfejPjIMaa	You get a better connection with Gold, or so they say.  Remember Gold RCA cables were better than non-Gold RCA cables.      Whatever.  If you have a high-end entertainment system (over $2000), then go with the gold plated.  If you have an average entertainment system, or are just hooking up to the back of your TV, go with the cheapest one you can find.    Over time (years), the gold plated HDMI cable will last longer (connection quality), but there is no problem using a cheap HDMI cable.  If Gold was so much superior to anything else, Sony would be making their own PS3 specific Gold HDMI cable to make money.      Go with the cheapest one you can find.  I have a $150 Gold HDMI cable that I hook up to my home system, and a regular Wal-mart $15 cable I use when I take my PS3 to someone else's house, and there is no difference in video or audio quality.      Don't waste your money on a high-end cord.  Believe me, I did (stupid $150 HDMI cable)!|`|Hb04EISQaa	In my opinion, the best HDMI cable you can purchase is a PHILLIPS HDMI cable with 24kt gold connectors.  The cable costs about $35.00. The quality is superior to other cables because gold is an excently conductor of electricity.  That is the number one metal that NASA uses for their satellites, rocket hardware, etc.|`|NiweOaGJaa	They work the same but if u buy one with gold at the end the picture quality is a bit better.

N1CIndMOaa	Try these, Dawn,    Do a camera reset. Look for a tiny button on the camera. It maybe underneath. With the camera on, press the button with a small narrow object for about 10 seconds. That might get clear things up.    Or, reformat and reinitialize your memory. Toggle through the menus and do that. You will loose all your recordings so be aware.     Or, try reinstalling the camera's firmware. It may be on the disk that came with the camera or you could go on-line to JVC.com and get it.     Lastly, contact JVC and see what they recommend.
UAYzLyN4aa	Use a LOT more light. This may cause the camera to reduce the shutter speed.     Or, spend a lot more on a real high speed camera. Or rent one.|`|7SXA5dhDaa	One problem you may be having is the long first shot delay on that camera.      The key to catching things in high speed motion, think wings of a humming bird, is not shutter speed, but is flash speed. If you're not using flash, start.  Once you're using flash start experimenting with the flash speed.|`|3zDhj57Uaa	There is a control wheel on the top panel that allows you to select one of six different shooting modes. Among these are the ability to start recording images in a memory buffer that keeps clearing itself. When you press the shutter fully the contents of this buffer are saved along with X number of subsequent shots.    So, for example, if you're waiting for a salmon to jump out of the river into the grizzly's mouth you keep your finger half-pressed on the shutter release, and when you see it happen, the previous couple of seconds and the ensuing couple of seconds are all recorded. Pick the frame that's best and Bob's your uncle.    Another mode allows the camera to record a 60 frame sequence at a set speed and then one can constantly review the images on screen so that you can select the one that you want to save. There are also flash modes, using either the built-in pop-up flash or the built-in LED that allows up to 7FPS with regular flash and 60 FPS with the continuous LED, though the later only for close-up shooting, since it isn't that powerful.

They don't match Plasma, but they are considered the best in picture quality, so hence they they are used.  So I would look at the Samsung LN46A850 or the Samsung LN46A550 (the latter having 1 less HDMI port but giving you pretty much the same bang in picture quality for way less $$$).    If you want the "best" then you need to look into an LED LCD.  There are only a few models on the market right now.  I think all of the big boys has 1 model (like Samsung, Sony, and I think Sharp Aquos).  They cost a fortune though (you're looking at least $3,500 if not higher).  But one of those with like 240Hz refresh (to help with motion blur problems inherent with LCD technology) would be top dog.  But again, be ready to pay $$$.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	I recommend Samsung LN46A650 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Color.High contrast ratio, less response time.Great picture.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413...|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	My opinion, and it's shared by Consumer Reports, is that Samsung and Sony have the best LCDs, with Sony being more expensive.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	we have a sharp aquos, great price, great TV!

I can't believe they charge $1,000 for a standard definition SIMULATED surround sound system.  You can buy a good Blu-ray player, a better a/v receiver and a better set of 5.1 surround sound system for that much.    Bose should be called Blose because, well, they blow.  I don't say this because their speakers suck.  I actually think they're decent speakers.  My issue with Bose is that they have created this image that has no basis in fact.  In marketing themselves as a premiere audio company when they aren't and by deliberately selling their products for far more than they know they're worth, they appear to me to be a dishonest company.  In addition, sometimes they ignore industry standards by using what are called proprietary connectors.  What this means is they are deliberately preventing you from mixing speaker and a/v components.  In other words, more dishonesty.|`|sER6UGMWaa	cant buy just the speaker buddy you got to buy the whole system.. thats another reason why BOSE SUCKS
dqzoEw67aa	If your tv is HD you should definately get the HD box, the pic quality will be much better on any HD channels they provide and most of the prime time network shows are on HD.  So Yes.    And be sure to use either an HDMI or component (red/green/blue) cables for connecting the HD box to your tv because only those two type of cables can carry HD.|`|7pzo0znAaa	It looks pretty good, but the majority of picture quality lies within your TV...
TbTO5SXlaa	You have listed two "bridge" cameras - SX10 & FZ28 - and one true DSLR, the D60.    Although most people get all excited about the number of mega pixels, the actual size of the sensor is more important. Both "bridge" cameras have tiny sensors which measure 6.15mm x 4.62mm which is 28.4mm squared. The D60 has a sensor which measures 23.6mm x 15.8mm which is 372.9mm squared. The sensor in the D60 is 13.12 times larger than the ones in the "bridge" cameras.    Since all 3 cameras are in the 10mp class, just think how much larger each individual pixel is on the D60 sensor. That means superior performance at higher ISO settings.    With its interchangeable lenses and huge sensor the D60 wins in a landslide.    To get the most from the D60 you might want to take some photography classes. You will also need to spend time to really READ & STUDY the Owner's Manual for the camera.    If classes aren't possible, these books will help:    "Digital SLR Handbook" by John Freeman    "The Art of Digital Photography" by Joseph Meehan    "Understanding Exposure" and "Understanding Shutter Speed", both by Bryan Peterson    Photographer/author David Busch has written a Guide for the D60. Buy it. http://www.dbusch.com/|`|3mAgM405aa	For the best value overall, the Canon and Panasonic are the better choice than the Nikon D60 because:    1.  The Nikon D60 normal lense is just too short [not a all-in-one zoom] and will require you to purchase still another telephoto which most likely will be an expensive Nikon VR lense;    2.  The Nikon D60 does not have a built-into-the-body image stabilization;    3.  The Nikon D60 does not offer HD video with sound capability which is now offered in the D90;    4.  And finally, the Nikon D60 does not have a live action LCD viewfinder to allow precomposing of a shot.    So, if the choice is between these two advanced bridge point and shoot digital cameras -- the Canon vs. the Panasonic, I'd recommend that you go with the Panasonic since the Leica lense is superior to the Canon lense.    Good luck!|`|ktCFG0tMaa	Your should choose the Nikon D60. More options like higher ISO and higher max shutter. It has manual settings and Nikon is the leader in lens Technology, which means excellent image quality. It's also better for cost among the two, depending on where you buy it.|`|yNGWA678aa	Nikond60  It has great picture quality~|`|FCNAf6NTaa	The D60 is the best bet amongst the ones you list.  But almost any high end DSLR will do the trick.   The Canon lineup of DSLRs are ranked just about equal with Nikons at the top of the heap, but the Sony A700 is spectacular and a little cheaper.     The main issue for sharpness and control is not the camera but the lens.  Prime lenses (lenses that don't zoom) are considerably sharper and often require much less light than zooms, for example.  I recommend a 35mm or 50mm f/1.4 lens if you can afford it.  This will give you tremendous control over depth of field and the ability to shoot at dusk without a flash.    All the autofocus lenses also allow manual focus and aperture control.      I would suggest you look into what lenses are available for each brand (they're not generally interchangeable.)  Then, based on what's out there, price, etc., pick the body that works best for you.  Megapixels can be misleading - you're better off with 10 noise-free mpxls than 15 noisy ones.  They're really only good for deciding how large you can pint your files, and a 6mpxl camera can producer some very large prints.  So going for a lower pixel count is a good way to save money.  I would say don't go lower than 10.    Finally, make sure the camera shoots in RAW mode.  A jpeg is fine for exporting to a print shop, but doing all your processing work in RAW dramatically increases the amount of control you have after you've finished shooting.|`|ipChhEthaa	I have to say that the Cannon is the best deal. I have had many Cannons and all of them have worked better than any other camera in its price range. They may cost more but you won't need to upgrade cameras for a long time. My Cannon won't break I've dropped that thing over and over again but it won't break. I'm not saying It will survive from a twenty foot drop but it's pretty strong. Go with the Nikon if you're not up to the price of the Cannon but try to stay away from the Panasonic. From my experience they break easily and have alot of malfunctions.  Good luck Shopping????!!

There aren't many TVs on sale these days with wire jacks for speakers, and if they do, they don't usually put out good audio.  I have a 42" Soyo LCD that has some, but the output is lousy.  But since you have an audio receiver, you may only be able to use that.
U2XGAwbnaa	Well this is your lucky day because the program comes free with Sims 2. On the bottom left of your screen hit the start button. Then search for Bodyshop or you can go to All Programs, then to the EA Games folder, then to your latest sims 2 then to body shop. There you can create custom content or upload characters.    To upload characters....(these might not be word for word.)  When you open it go to build, clone or package characters. First make sure you have the character you want made. Then go to package sims. Then from there select the sim you want to upload. It will ask you for your username and password. You create an account at thesims2.ea.com. Then fill in a description and name and you're ready to go. Your sim will display at thesims2.ea.com on the exchange we're everysingle sims player can see it.
5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	Tip from a pro photographer.  Buy a comfortable & quality $5.00 - $29.00  neck or wrist strap for your camera & use it.  $125-150  is the approximate price for a CLA = clean lube & adjust settings. Its basically an overhaul / tune up that should be performed every few years anyhow if the camera is worth it.  Sounds like a button got bumped messing with a setting.  Also test all camera buttons to see if any are stuck or sticking when pressed.  The camera buttons should feel or click normal when pressed.  I  would also reset the camera's defaults by removing the large battery & any coin cell backup battery that retains settings.   Leave both out for a few hours|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	it is fixable for $150

BMConIedaa	The 2-screw setup hasn't really been used for a while.  However, there are still things you can buy to work with them.  You need something called a balun - this will have the two leads that get pinched by the screws (use the VHF screws), and a coaxial jack.  The coax-out jack on your DTV receiver box hooks up to the balun on your TV's VHF signal.    Your converter box will transmit to your TV's channel 3 or 4 (there should be a little switch on the back to control that).  Your antenna plugs into the converter box, and it will have it's own tuner, and it's own remote to change the channel it is beaming to your TV's channel 3 or 4.  You will need some sort of antenna, and a better quality one will probably get more stations from further away.    There are stations broadcasting digital signals now.  You will should see SOME digital stations on your converter box.  You may not receive as many stations, as digital signals don't travel as far.    Converter boxes with analog-passthrough may have 2 co-ax out jacks, one for VHF, the other for UHF.  You'll need two baluns for that kind of setup.  When the converter box is off, you can still view analog TV stations up until the day they are turned off for good (whenever that may be).  You would use your TV's tuner for this instead of the converter box (since it's off...), but you'll have to switch back to channel 3 or 4 when you wanted to watch digital broadcasts.    Usually you can find Baluns at wherever you can buy converter boxes, especially a place like Radio Shack.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	mid 1980's , wow I think you should upgrade to a new TV  like a high def plasma or LCD and you will not need a converter box and will get free high definition using a antenna.|`|3654ffdd8c11d6979dc64a3cb8ff3d2faa	If you got as far as to see the set up screen you have it connected correctly to the TV. Your problem may be the antenna you are using. Rabbit ears don't really work well unless you are close to the broadcasting towers. If you are using a outdoor antenna and your analog picture is really good then you should get some HD channels, but if the analog is poor there may not be enough signal for the converter to detect the digital signal.

AA11096028	You can first transfer your iPod music to your PC then transfer them in your Creative MP3 player.    You can use iDUMP, a software that allows you to transfer your songs of your iPod to a PC. Connect your iPod and run iDump and you'll have access to all your songs, select the songs you want to transfer then pick a destination directory and how you would like your songs to be named. And then sit back and transfer all the selected songs to the PC. After that you can already add them in your music library in iTunes. It is easy to use. =)    The good news is iDump is FREE! Here is the link where you can download the software.  http://www.download.com/iDump/3000-2169_...|`|824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	Anything you purchase from itunes will only work with itunes or ipods.

7pzo0znAaa	Well I can tell you now, even broadcast HDTV doesn't hold a candle to Blu-Ray, so that isn't a proper gauge to go by, b/c TV service providers use compression to throttle the large amount of bandwidth HDTV tends to use, so the picture quality isn't nearly as good.  (I'm not saying that broadcast HDTV is bad, just that it's totally different from uncompressed Blu-Ray.  Picture quality varies depending on your provider.)  Also, audio quality takes a huge leap up from SDTV, and Blu-ray obviously is even better.    Swing by a local electronics store, (Best Buy, Sears, etc...) and ask questions there. They can show you a demonstration & more.|`|AA11593071	It sets all 8 of my speakers on fire, so much sound and effects hitting from all areas of the room, like being in the movie itself.    I would never go back.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	To see any benefit of blu-ray you must be using a HDTV, preferably one that supports 1080p and is over 40" in size.  Anything smaller, and the difference between blu-ray and an upscaled DVD is going to be nearly indistinguishable.    Even then, some blu-ray movies just aren't that impressive.  It reminds me of the early days of DVD, where some releases looked pretty good, while others were so horrible, people preferred their old version on VHS tape.    That said, I'm still not wholly convinced that blu-ray is really worth it.  Yeah, I have a large 60" screen that runs at 1080p, but comparing a DVD on our upscaling DVD player to a blu-ray in our PS3, I'm hard pressed to really notice that much of a difference.    The biggest difference I've noticed with blu-ray is that the backgrounds are clearer.  For instance, you can see individual leaves on the trees in the background.  However, if you're staring at the leaves on the tree, chances are you haven't been paying attention to the action or dialog happening in the foreground.  So, is it really worth it?  Hard to say.   Prices are coming down and technology is getting better.  I'm sure at some point it'll be cheap enough that it won't really matter.  But for right now, blu-ray is still very much in the early-adopter stage.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Honestly, an upscaled DVD is pretty nice on an HD TV.  However, a good Blu-ray is much better.  It's very striking.  (And despite what some may say, there is a clear difference between Blu-ray and DVD on my 32" HD TV.)  Another "wow" factor is switching from a football game on regular cable to the same game on an HD cable station.  Even when it's only in 720p it's amazing.

Once your as far in as you can go, stand up. If done correctly, you will be inside the other person and the zombies can't touch you.

MGr5lU3Naa	No, but a blu ray player can play a dvd. You see, a blu ray disc is a "special" disc that has a storage capacity of 50GB. A dvd can store up to 8.5GB. This means that producers have to compress a movie to make it fit on a dvd, lowering quality. Blu ray has a 50gb of storage on it, so they dont have to compress a movie to store on it, making it high definition quality. only blu ray devices can read these discs. it would be like asking can you play an mp3 on a record player.|`|6kC9me0baa	Nope.|`|U1ku2k4Naa	Sadly you can't play blue ray dvds on a regular dvd player|`|UHv71AN5aa	Sorry, but no.

YHu0s3JZaa	Yes, any Bluetooth headset will work with the PS3.  You just have to sync it before you can hook it up.  To do so, go to Settings > Accessory Settings > Set Up Bluetooth Device.  The code for almost any headset can be found in the manual that came with your mic.  But almost always the code is "0000".    -Wiiplay_ds|`|1pmgxvm5aa	the sony ps3 headset hurts the ear try buying something that's feels good any Bluetooth works anyway|`|pl2SocVKaa	i think so but to be sure just buy the sony official headset or any ps3 headset bundles with a game|`|7pzo0znAaa	Most Bluetooth accessories will work with the PS3 (Keyboards, mice, headsets, etc...), so you should be good with almost anything Bluetooth.

eN1bRdo6aa	You're good to go with everything that you have. I did this for my friend a couple of weeks ago, and all you have to do is look at the manual, for how to link it to your network. It takes only a couple of minutes.|`|JRsUkDdQaa	Yes, that's good but let me give you a bit of advice... When it asks you if you want a gold account or a silver account pick silver.  It will ask you if you are sure.  Say yes.  Then it will say you are eligible for one month free gold.  After that first gold expires use your gold card for the second month.  It will save you 8$
FCNAf6NTaa	Every DVD, or just one in particular?  If it doesn't play any DVDs the machine is broken.  If it's just the one (try it on another player) you've just got a bad disc.
dqzoEw67aa	That's right.  New tvs can't output non amplified sound.  Some people have powered speakers, like from computers, and they can plug the wire into the tv's headphone jack and run sound to the powered speakers that way.    But otherwise you'll need a receiver to power your speakers.|`|FZzIZ5GWaa	There will be a way. Check your operating manually as those normally show you where everything is located.|`|ZWHZto1Baa	It sounds like your old tv had a built in amplifier for stereo sound.  Your new LCD does not have this and there are no tvs currently in production with this kind of functionality.  You will need to purchase a stereo amplifier to use your speakers.|`|5e8bfd4f40a66f73272a2b251c8d304daa	It is very unusual to have a TV that will accept external speakers, without a separate amplifier.    Your old TV was an unusual one.  Your new TV is a usual one.
Dfr6uA91aa	If you've already plugged in your USB cable before the installation of TI-Connect, then Windows probably installed the wrong device driver.

tHjBr4L4aa	Change your autofocus setting from AF-S (single focus) to AF-C (changing focus).  When the camera is set for AF-S, it won't take a picture unless there is an absolutely perfect focus for the scene.    I've found that happening often with my D70 and D200 when I've accidently changed the setting.  AF-S is great for portraits and still images, but AF-C is more versatile for daily life.|`|7SXA5dhDaa	My D90  has exhibited the same problem.  Like noted above, the 'smart' camera has decided that the picture, focus or light, isn't any good.  Two suggestions:  1) make the camera happy by getting the focus or light right, BTW I use AF-A.  2) rotate the selector to 'M' and take control of your camera.|`|qR4xcTfaaa	B"H    These cameras are built with a brain, if the camera think that according to your settings the exposure or focus are incorrect then the camera will not take the picture. So, make sure always to look at the numbers the camera is showing you in the viewfinder to make sure they fit the situation and stability of the picture.  Also, if you have a lens with an Aperture ring make sure it is locked on the highest f-stop.  Use only high level SD card and not a cheep one, it could send the camera confusing signals.  Otherwise, take it to the store for checking.|`|0Mq84bDYaa	Your focus may not be fixed; the shutter won't release unless it is. If you're sure that's not the problem, you should contact the reseller and ask for an RMA (Returned Merchandise Authorization); they'll either have it serviced, or replace it. The problem won't get any better, so the sooner you get it serviced, the better...|`|7qoyVAIjaa	Another thing the D90 is known for is a bad connection between the lens and the camera. This is especially true with the 18-105mm kit lens. The camera will not take a pic until you jiggle or re-seat the lens.
pvb9yrM5aa	bring it back to the store or call ea
YKc3YrxXaa	I think that it will go down to about $169 for he arcade, and $259 for the Pro, or at least that's what my friends told me. Maybe if we are lucky, it'll be lower, but I wouldn't count on it. Then again, maybe they'll have to to keep competition with the will-be-lowered PS3 prices. Either way, it's good news for us gamers.    Hope this helps!!|`|ByhgBTvAaa	probably not a major amount!! no more than 20% off the price it is now!
tgT5MAO5aa	Did you buy it used? Because if you did then you may have been given a first generation wireless headset. I bought a first gen wireless headset and I have the same problem and it is sooooo annoying. sometimes I can play for hours without a problem and sometimes it spends more time syncing to the system then I get to spend talking. If it makes a beeping noise when it reconnects then thats probably a first gen and your stuck with it unfortunately, its a malfunction, and an annoying and incurable one. If there is no beep and it cuts out then you are dealing with a slow or incompatible network, or something in the headset is broken.    This info can be confirmed by the xbox support line.
imaeeL9Naa	I'd contact them, because you really shouldn't be getting banned in that manner.  Most likely your being suspend for inappropriate behavior on live.

8Q8ZVwjnaa	First, I'm just going to make sure you know what 3g actually IS... As you probably know, most phones can use WAP internet which... basically sucks.. The step up from that is Edge and then after that 3g which is sometimes refered to as Mobile Broadband.    It depends on whether or not you will actually use the 3g capability. Go onto your service provider's website and take a look at their 3g coverage. If you live in an area with good coverage (Or if you school/whatever is) then you will be able to use fast 3g internet.    As far as I know, iPhones are capable of Edge, no matter what version they are. Edge isn't as fast as 3g but is all you need in order to check your emails on the go and whatnot.    Also if you are frequently in areas in which you have access to a WiFi source there is little point buying a 3g iPhone since WiFi is faster. Although 3g is helpful when you want to use unfiltered internet in school where there are proxy servers. Like when tethering it to a laptop and using it to go on WoW xD... Although that alone wouldnt be reason enough to splash out all that money.|`|Af742FANaa	the iphone is just an ipod touch version of a phone, and iphone 3G is the same thing as the iphone, except it is faster.|`|hfqUp1IBaa	The 3G is only $200.00.  If you already have AT&T I would just buy the 3g.  The difference is the 3G downloads much faster and is a tiny bit slimmer.  I had the Iphone and just sold it 3 weeks ago for $200.  I bought the 3G and it seems identical to me but the plan is $10.00 more monthly.
1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	you already can. the canon 5D is on sales in abunch of places for around $1100-1200.b&h seem to be the cheapest. i think used in craigslist or something, you could get one for a grand  http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/58...|`|WOiH4CGvaa	I'll re-answer this question, only because the correct answers seem to be getting thumbs downs! (and not by me!)    All the people that answered with Canon 5D, are correct! That is probably the ONLY, full frame camera you'll be able to get in your price range for a while longer.     It was released in 2005, and had great reviews!     Nikons first full frame was the D3, released in 2007.     Although, Kodak and Contax N Digital also made full frames, they were not widely recieved|`|qR4xcTfaaa	You can do this right now by buying a used 5D or D700.  New? Probably never.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Easily you can get a used Canon 5D for that price. http://www.keh.com/OnLineStore/ProductLi...  I would look for the 5D that is EX grade or better. Although I am not sure what their international shipping policy is. Thats without a lens though, you will need a good lens for that camera.|`|pC2jGRKraa	Since the 5D mkII came out the price of the 5D mkI has crashed, new they are about 1500 now, so I think you can buy one for that price used.    Lenses are gonna be more problematic, for a 5D you need a lens to match...try out the EF 50mm f1.4 USM for a start.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Maybe a couple years.The cheapest full frame dslr that I found now is Nikon D700 1,663.78 for body only.|`|0Mq84bDYaa	Probably at least another year. The cheapest now is the Canon 5D Mark, II and it's almost twice that price.    Your most important investment is lenses. Generally, Nikon makes better wide angle lenses and zooms, and Canon makes better primes and telephotos. They're both great investments (people that get all emotional about machines are whacked), if you choose your lenses carefully. Sony doesn't have nearly the same selection or experience that Nikon or Canon has. (yet.)    I can tell you that Nikon is a lot more expensive to buy. They have a premium name and you pay for it. That's not an issue for some people; for me, it's a deal-killer. I'm purchasing about $25,000 in Canon kit in August; the same Nikon gear would be $32,000.    My story isn't yours, so don't look at that as a Canon endorsement. Like I said, both are great.    If you're tempted to get 2 or 3 cheap lenses instead of one good one, DON'T. You'll just be tossing them away (selling them really cheap anyhow.) A good Canon starter lens is the 24-105mm f/4.0L IS ($950) or the Nikkor 24-120mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S VR ($550, a little slower, but good image quality.)    I HIGHLY recommend you rent equipment before buying. Nothing seals the deal like trying it yourself.    You can use either lens on APS-C sensor cameras too, so why not start with them? The image quality is very good on many of the 12MP models, like the D90 or the 450D, then sell the old body and get the new 1000 full-frame...I'd rather be shooting with anything, rather than nothing at all!    good luck!|`|EJIsHdZhaa	A clean used EOS 1Ds or if you are very very lucky a well used EOS 1Ds Mk2 should be within budget.   An EOS 5D may be available for a little more than this new as shops clear out their remaining stock, certainly a used EOS 5D will be within reach.    Japanese imports are jumping in price just now because of the poor performance of the pound, so new models like the D700, Sony A900 and 5DMk2 are going to see a significant price hike.    Canon and Nikon are the market leaders in terms of professional use and the extent of their systems.   For the cash Canon have the upper hand in terms of resolution (the 5DMk2 has 21MP compared to the D700's 12MP)    Sony bought out Minoltas camera division, so you can almost regard the Alpha series of cameras as the cameras minolta would be making as the technologies, lens mounts flash mounts etc are the same as the dynax and dimage systems.    Sony don't have the same professional profile though they make very decent cameras.  Thier system is not as comprehensive as either Canon or Nikons.    I am a canon user and so have some bias towards what I know and what works for me.  You would be foolish to buy a camera in this class without getting hands on with it first.   Note that the Canon 1D series operate in a very different fashion to the usual PASM control dial set up found on Nikons, Sonys and consumer/prosumer EOS cameras,     For any full frame camera you want to use the best lenses you can afford.  Look at canons L series or their EF prime lenses.  Their consumer range zooms work well on the cropped sensor cameras, but to get the best at the corners you will need to spend a bit of cash.    The L series 17-40 f4 and 70-200 L f4 & a canon 1.4x TC with maybe the 50mm f1.4 would cover a lot of bases without going absolutely bonkers with the money.

Why even bother with a router then?  Just plug your xbox directly into the modem.  So the path is     Cable from wall -> modem -> xbox    You'll have a solid, stable connection - one which is probably faster than most people's who are sharing their connection with their computer.
YsqxvCxdaa	When they say that they mean your phone needs to be able to be compatible with any cell phone provider. You can buy unlocked phones at best buy and Wal-mart. All it means is that the phone can be activated at any company. For example, I have a blue Chocolate. It is not unlocked because only Verizon can activate it. My friend has an unlocked I phone that is Sprint but before that it was at&t.|`|mjsS54JXaa	Unlocking a phone means that you get the code to use it on another carrier, unfortunately Virgin Mobile doesn't allow customers to activate unlocked phones on their service.|`|PxzlCH7Paa	unlocking a cell phone is normally done with gsm phones. Virgin Mobile (which I used to have) is cdma based. If you're serious about doing the unlocked phone thing, I have a suggestion for you. Go to a retailer and by the cheapest tmobile or att gophone available. Get the phone activated. Buy an unlocked gsm (I'd recommend a quadband) and take the sim from the cheap phone and put it in the nicer phone.|`|gfBnC4zdaa	when they say unlock a phone , it means to let it work on any network that it is built to work on . Normally to activate a phone is to register the phone to a particular network , like when you first buy it.

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	You aren't getting surround sound out of your cable and 360 because they aren't attached to the surround sound system.  Your TV won't pass surround sound audio in from your 360/cable and out to your system, it must be routed through that system directly.  You may be able to run all audio and video signals into your system and then send the video on to the TV via HDMI or component video, or you may have to send the video directly to the TV and the audio separately to the system.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	It sounds like you probably have one of those "Home theater in a box" (HTIB) kits where the DVD player has the surround sound speakers connected to it.  This would be why your DVDs are playing in surround sound.    You'll have to connect your 360 and cable box to your surround sound system with an optical audio cable.  The problem is, if you do have one of those HTIB systems, they rarely have additional audio input ports.      If that's the case, you'll need to buy a new receiver - a real A/V receiver - one that has the multiple inputs and all that.  You'll also need to buy a standalone DVD player, unless you want to use your 360 for that.|`|fc92VK0Uaa	Youre only missing the connection from the tv to your home theater, this way everything that youre watching in your tv can be heard on your home theater setup. It can be via fiber optical cable or hdmi.

k2wiYJAcaa	What will happen is you call Verizon at 1 800 922 0204, and tell them your problem. They will direct you to the claims dept. and you pay your fifty dollar deductible, and you will get a new Alias (SCH 740), alias charger, and alias battery.
imaeeL9Naa	Sure can.    You will need: An Ethernet cable (like the one included with your Xbox), a pc/laptop connected to the internet via wifi, and of course an Xbox.     It might be beneficial to set your firewall to a low setting.    Next is to enable ICS.    1. Click Start, click Control Panel, click Network and Internet, click Network and Sharing Centre and then, on the left, click Manage network connections.    2. Right-click on your wireless connection, and then click Properties.    3. Click the Sharing tab and enable the 'allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection' option. Click ok.    Now connect the Ethernet cable to your pc and to your Xbox. Give it a minute to connect and then on your Xbox go to the system tab and click network settings. Next click 'test Xbox live connection'. If everything worked as it should the test should finish ok except the NAT settings will be set to strict.     This is the point where most people get stuck. Strict means that your router is not letting certain information through. You can still connect to Xbox live and play some games but other features will not work (voice chat, ranked games ECT...)     The only way to set NAT to open is to open certain ports on your router so the information will be allowed through (this is called port forwarding), however port forwarding will not work when you are connected through this method. The only way it will work is to bridge your wireless connection and you Local Area Connection.    1. Click Start, click Control Panel, click Network and Internet, click Network and Sharing Centre and then, on the left, click Manage network connections.    2. Right-click on your wireless connection, and then click Properties.    3. Click the Sharing tab and DISABLE the 'allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection' option. Click ok.    A NETWORK BRIDGE WILL NOT WORK WITH ICS ENABLED.    4. Disconnect for your internet connection (or switch of wifi if your laptop has a switch for it). YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRIDE A CONNECTION IF YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET.    5. Highlight the Local Area Connection and the Wireless Network Connection, right click and either of them and select bridge connection. When complete you can reconnect to the internet.    6. Open any webpage just to make sure you can still connect to the internet.     Test your Xbox live connection again, just to make sure it is connecting. You NAT settings will still be set to strict, so now you must open the correct ports.     1. On your pc go to your router homepage (open internet explorer/firefox and go to 192.168.1.254).    2. Click custom services on the left and in the service name dropdown box select Xbox live games. It will be near the bottom of the list. Click enable and in the select host device dropdown box select the pc your Xbox is connected to. Click enable.    And youre done. Test your Xbox live connection again just to be sure but your NAT settings should be set to open.|`|MWfjfAFYaa	That seems like it would work. There is probably some way to program the wireless router to connect to the internet and as long as the xbox is connected to the internet it should connect to live. The only thing you need to do is get the wireless conector to connect to the internet. Give it a try.
Ur6H8gwkaa	There are no grooves and valleys used in CDs, DVDs, or laser disc.    And laser disc is digital, not analog. All these technologies use 'pits' in two sizes one being a zero, the other a one. Laserdiscs were huge because they are based on CD technology and data density, so it had to be huge and two sided to hold all the video and audio data.    Think of Laserdisc as a gigantic version of a CD, nothing more.

EJIsHdZhaa	If you have an APS-C typed camera (like a 1000D 450D or 40D 50D) then the EF-S lenses are a fair enough match.  The 55-250mm IS lens is an optically good lens that will open up your range and won't break the bank or your back.    However if you have a 5D series or 1D series an EF-S lens will not physically mount, so this may have abearing if you plan to but one of these models in the future.    Canon also do a 70-300mm IS lens (not the 75-300 IS or 75-300 non IS) for a bit more money and this lens will fit any EOS camera from the 1000D to the 1Ds Mk3.  Optically good but suffers a bit from its consumer build quality.    A comparably priced but superior quality lens is the 70-200 f4L (non IS) lens.   A bit less range, but metal bodies, non-rotating filter ring, constant overall length at any zoom and very high optical quality, this owuld be wisest long term lens.  Although perhaps a bit more than you may have had in mind, a stonker that will last and last.    No matter what you decide, decide very quickly because all japanese imports are due a significant price increase as a result of the poor pound.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	Sigma make the best aftermarket lenses for canon and nikon. i got a 55-200, $60 on craigslist and it's sharp. tamron are second. and you might find a canon zoom on craigslist for reasonable money

Pav5KhmLaa	verzion  sprint
sYZ6IPWjaa	Yes, she is wrong. The BlackBerry Curve 8900 is a GSM device only; it won't work on Verizon's network which is CDMA.    I am working on getting the Curve 8900 as I am on T-Mobile. Your best bet would be to get the Curve 8330, which is a solid device. It has a great keypad for fast typing.    You may also continue to give the Storm a chance. I know several people who initially didn't like the Storm's click, but they have gotten used to it and can now type just as fast as they could with their physical keypad BlackBerry devices.

So1T9DKPaa	Up to your preferences...Personally I would go for Storm...I like the touchscreen but I don't want to buy iPod Touch/Phone.  Plus Storm has a bigger screen as I like to watch movies on it.  Curve has physical keyboard so you can type faster and barely any lags.    Why don't you go to a phone store and try both out?  see which one you like best in your hand and user-friendliness and take it from there.    One more thing, I would recommend upgrade the OS to the latest .99 version.   It's the most stable so far...I have no problem running it.  The official one that comes with the phone seems a little bit too slow for me.    HVS|`|ONxaI24Daa	I've got a Curve that I find amazing. I've heard that the Storm's come with a lot of problems. Aren't they coming out with a new Curve for T-Mobile soon too?|`|P9NR9TaAaa	blackberry storm is faster has more battery but screen breaks easly|`|AOZvz2dpaa	the one with the walkie talkie|`|kqUqN7bnaa	Blackberry Storm deffinatley , I just got this phone two days ago . When I switched it on it changed my world! The features are so incredible and it is the first ever touchscreen BlackBerry which is a bonus. The Curve is not so good , as they are hard to hold and bulky , I veiwed both of these in working action in the store I was buying from , The Curve's menu - and the other none touchscreen blackberry's menu is very plain and annoying . Also music on the curve is not so good and you cant minimize the music , and you cant veiw pictures whilst playing music because they are all on one application . Although  on the Storm you can minimise music and go on any other application and browse internet whilst playing it , and it has the album art so you can veiw the cd cover and picture whilst playing the music , also sound quality and volume are much better than the Curve . The Storm as you will know is the most recent BlackBerry so it will have lots more features and more up to date settings and functions . The keyboard on the Storm is amazing , you can turn is sideways - which gives you the full qwerty keyboard . The Storm has won an award for The Best Phone Out . The internet on it is amazingly speedy and easy to use . In the applications - built in is Windows Live Messenger , Facebook , Blackberry Messenger (which is free to any other blackberry's to chat!) , Google Talk , Flickr , Youtube and many more . Thye Blackberry is also the most secure phone out , so people cannot hack in via bluetooth and steal credit , songs, pictures , and contacts.      I highly recommend this.  Good Luck !! :)   Hope I Helped!! ..x  Ellie..x :)
becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	Do you know that the wireless bandwidth is regulated by the government? You can try Wi-fi, but there is not enough bandwidth for what you want to do.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	For a legitimate pay TV service, for wireless, you could likely use MMDS. It would use wireless to digitally transmit the TV signal and access control, kind of like TV broadcast or cable TV, but use a phone line or internet connection for call back, like satellite.    You would have to license microwave frequencies from the authorities, set up transmitter sites, and obtain the receiving hardware to provide to customers. You will also need to contract with any programming sources you wish to distribute..
hQf0BwT2aa	Most that "sell" the software are SCAMS.  I have been ripped big time to find this out.  There are some very legit FREE IPTV (internet protocol TV) sites that have good service.  This is one I watch all the time  http://tvunetworks.com/  Also check out  http://www.fancast.com/  http://www.hulu.com/  http://www.joost.com/  http://abc.go.com/  http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis/    Whatever you do DO NOT BUY!!!    Good luck!
9dqNECO6aa	You can but i wouldnt advise it: Just buy the propper connector. A coax plug will cost you under a quid from high street electronics store or tv place.    There are a few main parts to the cable we will work from the outside in.  1. Outer Coating - Just protection for the innards  2. Braiding - (Lot of little bits of wire)   3. Shielding - May not be present will look like a silver or copper foil.  4. Di-Electric - Usually white foam or clear plasitic  5. Center Core.    You need to strip the cable down so you have one lot of braiding and a seperate center core. Think of them like a -ve and +ve. The Center core need to go to the middle of the connector on the tv and the outer braiding needs to go to the outer of the connector. Like i say i take no responsibility for you interpretation or application of this information.|`|AA10594501	Just get an F-connector at any electronics shop. There are simple, cheap connectors that just screw on to the cable. Check the page below for instructions. You can probably skip the grease part if it's for use inside the house.    http://www.satcure.co.uk/tech/fconn.htm
c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	I don't think this is something you could fix yourself. Even if you got the parts. You might be able to buy another one and take both to a store to have them do it, but I highly doubt it. you should find a repair shop and just get a quote.|`|SUlkDzn3aa	Doesn't have to be the same model TV but does have to be the same panel.  They come in different sizes and different connectors,    Plasmas under 50" are pretty cheap now.  It might be better to buy a new one and sell your broken one for parts.|`|23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	Unless you have a television workshop I doubt that you will able able to do this. You would have to know the exact specification of the broken panel (make, model, type, batch and serial). You would then have to get an exact replacement (definitely the same make and at least from the same production line batch). This is because detailed specifications change at least twice a year (sometimes more often).  When you have found this you'll need full knowledge of how the set is assembled so that you don't damage anything when you take it apart. When you reassemble the set with it's new screen it may be very fiddly.|`|AA12180617	higly unlikley as it would have to be both teh same type (plasma and not LCD) with same voltage  ad drive requirements and the same connectors and as there are about 12 different makers of plasma  screens making for 100 or so TV makers it doubnful that unless you found exactly the same model that it would fit.      Plus the tolerances involved putting this together without error is not a DIY job and you do run the risk of killing yourself with the high voltages used in plasma sets.|`|ZyjEi9oLaa	erm just a little question to you here why not just take it back to the place u got it and ask for a replacement? easy as 1 2 3 in that case, your just throwing complications into the mix when you ask to do that or alternatively contact the manufacturer and get a replacement from the manufacturers warranty|`|PnMtlZ0Yaa	You would need to know that the screen has the same connectors and location/length of wire as the existing screen. You can look up the two screens on the internet by make and model of TV and find the more specific details.    It isn't as simple as both being 40".|`|KFagjt8Jaa	bite the bullet and get your self a new plasma but before you do that check your home insurance policy if you have one you just might have cover

ilScrvPEaa	Technically it's possible, but since newer PS3 versions don't have PS2 hardware every single PS2 game will require it's own individual emulator - it's too much work and money even for Sony.|`|uctxzjIIaa	They'd have to make a full PS2 emulator (the old 80GB only emulated part of a PS2, while still having the rest of the PS2 hardware in the system), and there are reasons this would be difficult, if not impossible.|`|3kyLH5Ikaa	when ps3 first came out there were 2 versions, one with backward compatibility(80gb and 160gb) and one without(20gb and 40gb).  Sony discontinued this when they released the 80gb core because there was some issues with their units.  Im guessing they had a special laser lens for the ps2 games, so a firmware will not work to change it, its  a hardware issue.    I still have my ps2 all i play is gran turismo 4, but you should really play ps3 games they are awesome!|`|HekFanRvaa	it's not just a software... it's a hardware.. that's why PS2 compatible PS3s are more expensive...|`|912889ffe6d1f7e7c946f67482ee58dcaa	I'm not 100% sure on this one, but I do believe it's possible.  Natrually it may never have the compatibility the 60GB consoles had because they used hardware to play ps2 games.  But I'm sure they can use software emulation like they did with the other models.    The thing is they took out ps2 compatibility for a reason.  By doing that, they force people to buy a ps2 to play their ps2 games, which in turn, gets them more money.  So the odds of them adding ps2 support to the ps3 is highly unlikely.  At least it is until they stop making ps2s which could be years from now.|`|UphoLYGYaa	its possible, but sony will look like idiots for doing it.  why strip the feature for cost effectiveness, only to add it back later. that seems silly to me|`|rVRbTkmaaa	yes|`|Q97FAf29aa	no

WMv, RAM, AVI, etc are not open formats they need codecs adding to the system to play and often these are locked to one program to play them.

Ok so the photos aren't the greatest but the video isn't that bad.
j5Apt8hWaa	You can download free software to get a glimpse of what video editing is all about, but shooting video has to do with the hardware and knowing how to use it.    Some schools have equipment you can borrow when you are taking classes in film making.  Without a camera in your hands, borrowed, rented or owned, you cannot make videos except for one type ... documentaries, where your content is from stock footage.  Those are made by viewing the available footage, writing a script around that footage and then doing the editing necessary to make  a coherent video.    What you are trying to do is become a chef without a kitchen.  You will find yourself hungry|`|Cy6LzAwMaa	http://www.lego.com/eng/play/games/backl...    Yay, it's fun!|`|wqeAeSVYaa	If you want to be a filmmaker, you'd better brush up on your English, grammar and spelling.  There is a lot of writing involved, and believe it or not, that stuff all counts.  Maybe you should stick to photography.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	You still need a camera even if you have software on your computer to record it. And even a webcam is going to cost you a bit. Save up a few hundred dollars and get a video camera that uses mini DV tapes. Or look on craigslist and ebay for an old video camera that still uses Hi-8 tapes. those you could probably get for really cheap. If you are interested in becoming a photographer, stop by your local camera shop and get an old used film SLR. You could probably get the camera and lens for under $200.|`|047IPSovaa	Photographer - I completely paid for my entire college degree by being campus photog|`|8aMpf8gxaa	hm. i'm not sure what to tell you.  pretty much anything is going to cost a lottttt.
7yt2Ud0Faa	Yes, the N routers will also work with Wireless G adapters, which is what the Xbox 360 wireless adapter is.|`|ldi4iSgCaa	Don't buy a 360 wireless adapter trust me. It costs a lot. Just put your laptop(if you have one or you can use your PC if its near the 360) and connect the Ethernet wire from your laptop to your 360 then test the connection.|`|45f16ecdf3512cfd43cf659533ee6503aa	The wireless adapter is WORTH IT.  And yes it will work, you will just need your WEP passcode to make it work.
qGfAlDd2aa	The government converter boxes work with Over The Air signals ONLY.  They will not work with DirecTV.  If you want HD from DirecTV, you must get DirecTV's HD receiver and subscribe to HD programming.  And have an HD set which you apparently don't because you said "old TV".    You can, however, use the box with an antenna to receive free Over The Air digital signals; many of which will be HD.  Note that you will not get HD on an old set.  The box will convert it to analog.
8EmeNHyjaa	For you budget you can get Nikon D40 DSLR  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJQ...    or if you want point & shoot camera with good zoom.I suggest Canon Powershot SX10IS   10.0-megapixel resolution   20x optical zoom, wide-angle lens and Optical Image Stabilizer; improved speed and quiet zooming   DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection   MovieSnap mode lets you capture high-resolution still images while shooting a movie   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G5Z...|`|0JV3tQm8aa	These cameras are really great    Canon SD1100 IS  Canon Powershot A590IS|`|JACkBYeKaa	one of my cousins friends is going to be a photographer when he's old and he has a nikon D300  my friend he also loves photography has a nikon D40  there both REALLY nice cameras but i think they might be pretty expensive|`|UnVkjwNpaa	Hi,   If you are interested in photography then I highly recommend that you get an SLR, a quick look at the B+H website showed  more than 1 in you price range. Personally I've used Nikon SLR's for 20 years and the build quality is usually a notch above the rest, However the Olympus range is small, which is an advantage.  http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controll...|`|vkzkXWfzaa	Any DSLR, the difference in low light shots alone make it much more cost effective than yet another compact.    Chris|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com. in the U.S.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...    If you can take a handheld picture of the moon with an 18X zoom, concert coverage should be a breeze.    Good luck!|`|nfua6A4paa	i have a sony cybershot 8.0 megapixles i love it.....  great clear pictures and bright flash, has rechargable Li battery.  face detection technology, has micro ans macro focus.. if it ever breaks i would buy it again. i use it to post large pictures on craigslist and believe me it take very nice pics and gets all the details look at the details in this pic i took of my mustang  i have forsale!!!    http://i242.photobucket.com/albums/ff138...|`|rVPrhd26aa	the BEST camera to get would be a gigapixel like the one that took this    http://gigapan.org/viewGigapanFullscreen...    check it out you can zoom in and clearly see the faces of people half a mile away... 1000+ mega pixels    you might need to work for the government to get one of these though|`|0Z4vqlqUaa	The more optical zoom the better eg. X4 and up  Pixel over 5.1 is very good  You where every you choose to buy the camera they should state if the camera supports Mac.  I am pretty sure you can get a very decent 1 that fits your criteria for less than $490

vs3vz6lIaa	a lot don't if you have all those i bet you could get 200-250 dollars or maybe even up to 300 i you are really lucky|`|bde0658d8cf48c30a8b439401bea4981aa	150 if you are very lucky|`|yf69sjdNaa	I would have to say around 70-80 dollars. You can also look on ebay to see what they go for, but that is around what it will be. Probably not as much as you want, but hey, thats how it is.
d381leKpaa	right now there are only 2 types in production. The 80GB and the 160GB.  I would recommend the 80GB version, because you don't need 160GB, and if you do you can always upgrade to like 250GB for under $100. But if you can wait until April, there is a $100 price drop for the 80GB version. And if you do want the 160GB, that one would have a price drop, but the amount is unheard of as of now.|`|pl2SocVKaa	the 160gb bundle with Uncharted drakes fortune and psn game PAIN and it costs 499.99 without tax|`|vs3vz6lIaa	80GB because it might be a little pricey but it is all worth it because once you get your music pics and movies and games saved loaded and downloaded you will be surprised how quick it will fill up and you will be glad to save room and if you buy the cheaper one then you will fill it up then have to buy a memory card slot to plug into the PS3 then you will have to buy a memory card so eventually you will end up spending the same buying memory card after memory card so good luck please pick this as your best answer|`|HekFanRvaa	you only have 2 choices now and the rest are discontinued.. either 80 or 160 GB. both are exactly the same except for hd.|`|fWclxi9Baa	well currently there is only 2 ps3's on the market the 80gb and the 160gb i would say the 80gb is much better since for 60 bucks more you can go and buy a 320gb hardrive and update it very easy and fast to do while if you buy the 160gb its a 100 bucks more and they dont even give you that much more space|`|v4E8nylXaa	of the ones still in production (80gbV2 or 160gb) either one will do. if these i suggest u go to costco online and but it from there because it come with a ton of things that u might need.   80GB straight up  http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.asp...  80Gb w/ COD:WAW  http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.asp...  160GB w/ Drakes Fortune (The Best Deal Yet)  http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.asp...    if u can find it the 60gb or 20gb ones can play ps2 games as well. if you need more HDD space you can upgrade the HDD in a few minutes. check youtube for the vids on how 2 do this.   good lick and happy gaming.|`|yf69sjdNaa	The 40 gig one. Best value for money one. Only if you really need alot of HD space should you get 60 or 80 gigs.
9nCPjRxcaa	call the company, they should send it to you once you prove proof of purchase|`|7eoY0zVaaa	google r4ds go to downloads section download the latest software put tht onto the r4  youtube have videos showing you how to do this :)

cDn9bhcGaa	You take that risk with EVERY program...    Your options are either "safe" OR "free" - iTunes, etc. being the ONLY "safe" option!

EnkWULaqaa	yeah, that's the problem with cheap headphones.   they sound pretty terrible, and don't last long at all.   if you want some that will last, pick up a nice pair.   I recommend some UE super.fi 5 pros, but those are WAY too expensive for most people, so maybe try a pair of cx300s or if you want to try some over-the-head phones, some cheap sennheisers like the hd202s.   those should last you significantly longer than what you've tried.   you can get them all pretty cheaply at amazon, too.|`|7L0p6Hciaa	Thats common. It means you're wearing the connection out on that side every time. Better headphones (like the shure scl2 or good senheissers) tend to last a bit longer.
imaeeL9Naa	It's not illegal at all.  The only illegal part is when you use your modifications to create illegal copies of games.    www.xbox-scene.com    That site will tell you everything you could possibly need to know.  I haven't seen too much information for Halo 3 modifications, but join the forums and post a few questions.  Off the main page there is a tutorials link that will help you out at well.    Just be careful and take all the time you can when you do this type of stuff.  Alot of people mess up and ruin their Xbox.    ~ Shoe|`|RpCwfcRzaa	You can't ask that here and no one can answer it. It's illegal.
