My partner and I have to perform a scene from 'Waiting for Godot" In our drama class. we are in high school and we have chosen the beginning of Act two. The point is to portray the themes of hopelessness, emptiness and isolation but with a modern twist. One of the other partnerships has chosen to portray by using Vladimir and Estragon as a couple in a bedroom. Like one wants to leave but never does.    If anyone can please help me with ideas it would be appreciated as right now mine are very feeble and aren't original. I really want for my partner and I to wow the teacher.   Thanks so much ;)

20090223075400AAfIJ0O	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Rhyming sestina, a bit of ambivalence, do you think? Comments on this poem please?	If traveling through the airwaves words can fly    My words to you, then, I will swiftly wing    With little effort on your screen will lie    These words will have a sharp, metallic ring    And do you wonder when you see them; “why? “   Please dear, do tell, of what, to you they sing?       Of what, if you do hear them, do they sing?   Do the words cause your heart swiftly to fly?   And if they do will you please tell me why    You don’t come flying quickly on a wing    To on my finger place that diamond ring   But simply let the sleeping demons lie       Or do the words portend a lurid lie   Although they seem in fact to fairly sing   Is there in them a non melododic ring   As now my hand to face will quickly fly             I felt as though I had a broken wing   This feeling made me shake; I wonder why         I can’t explain this can you tell me why?   Know this, my love; to you I’d never lie   I’d keep you safely, warm beneath my Wing    And when your tired soft verses to you sing   Not unlike this the spider to the Fly    Those wedding bells will surely loudly ring      My love I pledge as I slip on your ring   It not within my heart to wonder why   I freed my hold I bid it rise and fly   On closet floor, our skeletons will lie   I think I hear the angels as they sing   And one just brushed against me, with her wing      As I sit here and eat this chicken wing    Watching people, willing my phone to ring   I listen to the entertainment sing   Within my brain these questions ask me why   Why couldn’t I just let this epic lie?   Recede and vanish thought to nimbly fly         Dreams mayfly high; they may take off on wing   I cannot lie, I cannot wear this ring   Please don’t ask why, perhaps I heard you sing

So we had this cute new girl join our firm this past month. I and the other guys have noticed a lot of hostility towards her by the other girls in the office. When we go out to lunch, she eats with us, 3 or 4 guys, instead of the other girls. She's also been rudely cut off while speaking by the other women during meetings. They go out of their way to make her feel unwelcome. I don't get why women are so threatened by a pretty, smart girl in the workplace of all places ? I mean its not like we're banging each other that the girls should be defending their turf or something. I don't get it
20090223080926AAie5EB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback on an excerpt of a play/script that i am writing?	this play/script is a spin on a semi famous japanese legend. there were two famous swordsmiths back when samurais existed, one was muramasa and the others name was masamune. muramasas blades were flawless, but he had a bloodlust and a sick and insane mind. it was said that his swords would cause the wielder to go insane and blind with rage, causing people to believe his swords were cursed. masamune on the other hand was calm. tranquil. and everything of a stereotype of discipline. his swords were said to rival that of the muramasa. the legend ended around the late 1500s. i place this story around the 1800s where a man has started murdering with a sword that was made by muramasa. he has killed hundreds. an imperialist samurai named hayate barely survived. he learned about the legend and went to a shrine where the last known masamune blade was kept (since it is said int he legend that the two blades would rival. this is where the excerpt starts as he starts talking to the shrines priest.      ps: for those who dont know, a diasho is a double sword set, a long and a short.      priest: there is no reason i should give you this blade      hayate: if i speak the name of the blade that drew this scar. drew my blood. you would speak very different words.      priest: ...muramasa...since the beginning of time, a legend has been told. a battle between all that is good. tranquil. all that is beautiful against all the darkness. pain. screams of sorrow that is still heard toda--      hayate: stop. i have not come here to listen to your poetry. each word that i speak represents another life taken by the blade of muramasa. i would very well take a stand, but like all the others who had, i would simply be cut down. i need it. to protect      priest: swords are not made to protect. they are meant to take lives.      hayate: i am here for the masamune. weather or not if you give it to me is your choice. but i do promise you, at the end it will be in my possession. it will be used to take a life. but the blood it will draw is very little to nothing compared to the red stained fields and lives already taken by the muramasa. so i stand here now asking you to make a wise choice.      priest: and if i choose to decline?      hayate: you wont. you have burdened yourself with a duty. now it is time for you to fulfill that duty.      priest: ...the masamune itself isnt strong enough to take on the muramasa.      hayate: than give me more.      priest: i will make you a daisho, along with the blade of masamune. even then however, it still will not mean anything. it will still be a simple sharpened steel used to cut through rotting flesh.      hayate: then what must i do?      priest: you must clear your mind. you must cleanse, and shower all the rage caused by the darkness away. this sword will be cut and burnt into your soul. if you are to become one with it, you cannot allow the darkness to consume you as you still draw emotional power from it. you must be in control..      hayate: i have let go of the darkness years ago.      priest: and yet you still have a long way to travel.      hayate: then i will travel with the masamune.      priest: i will see to it..that you do.      hayate: we dont have time.      priest: and yet you will wait a month as i complete the daisho.

Can you find this Austrian castle? 10 points to whoever finds it?      Small town/village in Austria I believe nestled in a narrow valley with sheer cliffs on either side. There is a castle overlooking in the background. It's extremely picturesque, it makes the entire place look realy fantastical.      I had thought it was in Kitzbuhel, Austria - but no amount of searching on google can help me.      Also I remember that it looks like it's CGI. There are sheer cliff faces on either side and if I can recall correctly, there are certain structures built into the sides of the cliff as well. It looks like a magical place, the sort of place you'd expect to see drawn in that old book Dinotopia or something. It just doesn't look real.      I'm almost certain it's in Austria, but I gave up searching on google images long ago and have spent the majority of my time going through sites that have "amazing places," or "beautiful places," or "beautiful scenery" blogs. but I still can't find it...

20090223093013AAzteLi	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this short, short story?	Adam and Eve never died.  The Bible lies on this account.  Throughout the centuries they have taken pseudonyms and aliases to protect themselves.  In recent times, they have lived in Australia, under a flat tree with their kangaroo called Fred.  Then, in 2012, a scientist discovered who they were and brought his colleagues to study them.  But when they arrived at the hut beneath the flat tree on December 21, they saw Adam throw a rock at Eve, and everything went black.      The world started over again.  Ten thousand years of mankind were repeated, exactly as they had happened before.  Adam and Eve lived through all this, until a group of scientist came to study them under their flat tree in Australia on December 21, 2012.  Adam threw a rock at Eve, and everything went black.

20090223091019AASAr9a	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback on an excerpt of a play/script that i am writing?	this play/script is a spin on a semi famous japanese legend. there were two famous swordsmiths back when samurais existed, one was muramasa and the others name was masamune. muramasas blades were flawless, but he had a bloodlust and a sick and insane mind. it was said that his swords would cause the wielder to go insane and blind with rage, causing people to believe his swords were cursed. masamune on the other hand was calm. tranquil. and everything of a stereotype of discipline. his swords were said to rival that of the muramasa. the legend ended around the late 1500s. i place this story around the 1800s where a man has started murdering with a sword that was made by muramasa. he has killed hundreds. an imperialist samurai named hayate barely survived. he learned about the legend and went to a shrine where the last known masamune blade was kept (since it is said int he legend that the two blades would rival. this is where the excerpt starts as he starts talking to the shrines priest.      ps: for those who dont know, a diasho is a double sword set, a long and a short.      priest: there is no reason i should give you this blade      hayate: if i speak the name of the blade that drew this scar. drew my blood. you would speak very different words.      priest: ...muramasa...since the beginning of time, a legend has been told. a battle between all that is good. tranquil. all that is beautiful against all the darkness. pain. screams of sorrow that is still heard toda--      hayate: stop. i have not come here to listen to your poetry. each word that i speak represents another life taken by the blade of muramasa. i would very well take a stand, but like all the others who had, i would simply be cut down. i need it. to protect      priest: swords are not made to protect. they are meant to take lives.      hayate: i am here for the masamune. weather or not if you give it to me is your choice. but i do promise you, at the end it will be in my possession. it will be used to take a life. but the blood it will draw is very little to nothing compared to the red stained fields and lives already taken by the muramasa. so i stand here now asking you to make a wise choice.      priest: and if i choose to decline?      hayate: you wont. you have burdened yourself with a duty. now it is time for you to fulfill that duty.      priest: ...the masamune itself isnt strong enough to take on the muramasa.      hayate: than give me more.      priest: i will make you a daisho, along with the blade of masamune. even then however, it still will not mean anything. it will still be a simple sharpened steel used to cut through rotting flesh.      hayate: then what must i do?      priest: you must clear your mind. you must cleanse, and shower all the rage caused by the darkness away. this sword will be cut and burnt into your soul. if you are to become one with it, you cannot allow the darkness to consume you as you still draw emotional power from it. you must be in control..      hayate: i have let go of the darkness years ago.      priest: and yet you still have a long way to travel.      hayate: then i will travel with the masamune.      priest: i will see to it..that you do.      hayate: we dont have time.      priest: and yet you will wait a month as i complete the daisho.

Please no sarah maclachlan, josh groban or any other mainstream overused slow songs. thanks!

Im a history major and read that Irish people were the first to integrate with blacks in the 1800s because of both having low social standing.. can someone clarify that for me. I am half irish and would like to know because that seems pretty cool.

20090223092333AA178rM	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	At what point should perfection be limited?	ok so i am a bit of a perfectionist   im not insane about it, i just strongly prefer that everything is organized and in place, but i don't let it control my life or anything   i have a routine for everything, and everything i do that involves fine motor skills or organization      a few examples:   1. my mom got some new christmas decorations in late november. they were two deer one was standing up looking up   and the other one was "sitting down" she put them on opposite sides of the fire place   and for two months it drove me insane!!!!!!!!!   they weren't the same, it wasn't even, so i avoided walking into the living room but it wasn't that big a deal i guess   it just really bugged me       and in school, i avoid writting notes like the plague   just because i don't like my handwritting very much i store everything i write in the back of my binder   whenever writting in pen if i am wriitting anything i will have t look at again and i mess up, i start over again on a blank sheet of paper      and most ppl that i don't either go to school with or spend a lot of time with, don't even notice it   so i don't think it is really all that serious   but a few days ago during lunch, one of my best friends pulled me aside from the rest of the lunch table and told me that she wasn't gonna hang out with me anymore if i wasn't going to stop needing perfection in everything   but i mean its not like i expect everyone else to be perfect, just me   and i always thought it was a good thing, it means that i will never settle for less than my 100% best   so what do you think?? am i too much of a perfectionist or is this normal like i thought?
20090223080819AAuIHP8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fact that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

I have known this guy since grade 4 (lets call him Jake) and I've always had an on /off crush on him, but ever since last week when we were talking on the bus (as normal) i feel like I've fallen for him    im 16, never dated, never been kissed, etc    and frankly do not want to get caught up with dating in high school because I've seen what happens (ie: boy likes girl, girl likes guy, go out, if anything hapens you ruin the friendship and its awkward because you still have to see that guy everyday in school)      what i want to know is has anyone had an experience like this   (does true love really find a way)   I pray about him every night   ps: we talk on the bus every day,and i dont know, something just happened where I just went to myself, "this could be him"   i dont know if he feels the same way about me but i know for sure he likes me as a friend      and now i just can't get him out of my head ever since a week ago, it's driving me crazy!

20090223093317AAFE8uG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What if Alice never came to Bella's house after she jumped off the cliff?	I'm re-reading newmoon for the third time. It's funny, because I used to hate Jacob. But as I read the book a third time, well Jacob just seems so real to me now. Unlike Edward whom is perfect. Don't get me wrong, I love Edward. But Jacob was truly there. Jacob loves her so much. He was always there. Then Edward left. Bella was alone. Jacob was healing the hole in Bella. I know it was not as great as Edward would do, but i know Bella loved Jacob in Newmoon. It's obvious there waqs something there. I just got through the part where jacob was taking Bella home after Harry died, and Bella jumped off the cliff into the ocean. And ofcourse Alice was there. But what would hav ehappened if Bella were to confess the feelings to Jacob, instead of hurting him again. Does anyone have a story in which Alice never showed up. Where Bella confessed all her feelings to jacob(I know, she does not feel the same as she did about Edward). But I'm dying to know what some of you think. I think i'm starting to like jacob. Anyone have a story to share with me? I know all you Edward fans are probably hating on me. Haha. I would have done the same in the past. But reading this book for the third time made me think.      Thanks Everyone :)

20090223073651AA40Ee7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What company first published Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch by Alice Caldwell Hegan?	I have a VERY old suede leather "bound" copy of Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. The leather of the cover is thin and damaged, the board is missing entirely (worms ate it all??) and the impressions of the cover picture and spine lettering are very worn and faded. The book itself is missing some pages and isn't in what you would call museum quality condition. I've just never seen a copy advertised anywhere with a LEATHER cover! They're all published in clothbound covers. Because of the impressed picture and titling on the cover and spine (and a rosette-thingy on the back), it appears to have been made by a machine, not by hand. But the cover is so primitive looking, I have to wonder. I'd like to know where I can find more information about the earliest editions of this book. Anyone?

20090223105315AAXhrbi	Arts & Humanities;History	Where did football [soccer] originate?	Everybody knows football originated in England.   But in the film "Red Cliff", directed by John Woo, you can see Cao Cao's soldiers playing a ball game called "Cuju" , which is very similar to modern football.   If you have read the historical fiction "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", you will know that the Battle of Red Cliff is a historical event.   But the Chinese film director, John Woo seems to show that football originated in ancient China, not in England.   Are there any archives to back up his idea?   Chinese people had long believed that they were the centre of the world until their modernisation.   Sometimes, they even have a tendency to distort historical events to emphasise the greatness of their culture.   The Chinese government still includes the history of other nations or ethnic minorities in NE Asia in their own history.   Well, I'm not Chinese, but Korean. And I have no intention to insult Chinese people, but I don't think they can change the historical events on their behalf.

I really want to get better at drawing because I was always last in my class and I would want to get really good because of that to show that I'm not that bad and that i can be could in that element, the problem is I have no one to teach me and the only thing I can do is to draw and copy off reference pictures.      I can draw basic heads and faces but really basic, I've got hands sort of figured out and feet well...meh.      I was wondering if you could give me tips on these they are the best pics that I have posted (I have drawn more stuff I just haven't gotten time to put them on the net and scan them) so if you could just tell me the good and bad points of each drawing it would be great^^      Oh yeah and just to let you all know i'm 13 turning 14 so if i don't draw like an adult you know why and I've only recently gotten really into this hobby which is probably pretty obvious xD      1:  http://tahnee503.deviantart.com/art/Litt...    2:  http://tahnee503.deviantart.com/art/Naru...    3:  http://tahnee503.deviantart.com/art/Naru... 
20090223102005AAw9W2B	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What do you think about positive thinking?	I'm not buying it.   I suppose to an extent I think if you dwell on negative things, you'll set yourself up to fail, but I think it's a little weird to start supposing that magical waves of energy attract good times to us. It just seems... not... provable? crazy? I dunno.      I don't know much about it. Somebody fill me in?      I got this book description about "The Secret":   Supporters will hail this New Age self-help book on the law of attraction as a groundbreaking and life-changing work, finding validation in its thesis that one's positive thoughts are powerful magnets that attract wealth, health, happiness... and did we mention wealth? Detractors will be appalled by this as well as when the book argues that fleeting negative thoughts are powerful enough to create terminal illness, poverty and even widespread disasters.       Anyone read it?      Justincase, please think positively about this question. Please and thank you.

(Spare me please good or bad feedback its hard enough to get through it) And I noticed that when Alice tells Bella about her graduation party she says you do realize its the 4th? Bella replies of June and she's shocked. Later when she's at Jacob's house and he falls asleep "It had gotten much cooler while Jacob slept; the air was unseasonably cold —there must be a storm on the way. It felt like February, not May." Meyer writes May not June. Is this just my ebook pdf being wrong or did she really screw up the time frame of her own story?

When she died, Peter came to Jesus and asked if she should be sent to hell. Jesus responded in the story, “No, not her. Go find the father who never loved her and send him to hell.”

That's when her gasping, bloodshot eyes touched mine.   She clawed at me carelessly as she carved off my mask.   My face ground on hell's metal, sharpening me like a blade   as sweaty hands gripped my hard wooden spine.            When she reached my soft core, I muffled my screams.   My torture didn't cease though my treasure was seen.   Her angry fingers slammed my nose to the cold sheet   smearing my face. My agony but a metaphor   for the hurt she confessed was her own fault.            She wrote, "God hear my sorrow that has yet been diminished.   He hurt me dear God! He said we were finished!   Last time was the last time Cupid pulled out his pistol.   Our hearts were embracing while nestled in bliss!   Now, though his absence had lasted a month,   Cupid is dead at the hands of my replacement..."            My lungs caved in as a snap pierced through my core.   I had been severed like the heart of this lover.   But her hate filled hands had only begun my punishment.   She returned to hell's razor-blade and carved my point more.   That time i was ready. I held in my pain   as my black honey blood dripped from the freshly cut wound.               Then she attacked the paper again with me as her weapon.               After an hour of sharpening and bleeding,   I stood as a stout nub with a strip of metal hugging my broken body.   My man forged corpse, shredded to wood chips and spread   across a tear drenched novel of a love that had failed.   And I was just a witness to the pain of the girl.   Yet I have been tortured and broken a thousand times over!            Imagine how she felt!

20090223110822AAPsVG8	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Resenting watching this girl's children?	Okay, I will try to make a long story short. I have a small home daycare. A girl who goes to my church and is married to the pastor's son who happens to be my husband's friend asked me to watch her child. I have learned over time that this girl is quite selfish, manipulative, and the world revolves around her. Its been one pain after another. I am a pushover and a people pleaser. Its not a good combination. I am watching her 2 children at half the rate of the other children. This happened because initially, her one child was coming for a very short day. She told me she was pregnant and asked if I could save a spot for the future baby. I didn't mind since I didnt' watch too many children. Anyways, I am now watching her 2 children for the price of one and they are coming long days, but only coming every other week (She is working full time now, 4 12 hour days, and one 16 hour day, and then 5 days off). So, she is working full time with benefits, and basically paying a quarter of what the other parents pay per child a month. She's also a picky parent, and has a lot of requests, complaints, etc. I have had to stand up to her a few times and draw the line, but I still resent watching her children. I feel sort of trapped because I agreed to do this on these terms. If it was some stranger, I would easily write up some new terms, etc. Now, they are going through a lot, her husband had mono, and a liver problem and ended up in the hospital, and she is struggling to make it at the moment. She dropped off the kids to me today on her week off so she could run errands and I'm just full of anger. I had looked forward to having a break this week. What is a healthy way to get rid of this anger, and get some control without totally going off on people who are going through a bad time!
