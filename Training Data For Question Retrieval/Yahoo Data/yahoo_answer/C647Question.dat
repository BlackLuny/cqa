Yo salía a jugar afuera con   un cepillo de piso como caballito. Siempre pasaba un se?or    y me revolvía los pelos de la cabeza y yo me molestaba. Lo    abra hecho dos o tres veces…hasta que yo en la última le fui   por detrás y le día con el cepillo en la cabeza y cayo al piso.   corrieron varios y lo levantaron… yo me metí asustado en   la casona y la “madrina” creo que nunca se enteró, pero el   pobre hombre ahora caminaba por la vereda de enfrente…
20071116143008AA9EEHY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Todos ustedes me pueden acompaniar en una oracion?	Es que ya viene el dia de alta gracia y hay que orar por aquellas personas y ninios que no tienen nada de comer para que Nuestro padre celestial les provea. Me da mucha tristeza en saber que hay mucha gente necesitada. Poreso es que ellos necesitan de nuestras oraciones. Hay momentos que nosotr@s nos quejamos de no tener algo en la vida, mas sin embargo aunque sea poquito lo tenemos. Y no nos ponemos a pensar que hay personas peor que nosotros en este mundo. Que no encuentran ni un pedacito de pan para alimentarse. Ni tampoco tienen unos zapatitos para ponerse.   Hay que orar amigos, siempre nos debemos de acordar de ellos. Saluditos y Que Dios los bendiga a todos Y de paso muchas gracias por sus oraciones.

Estabamos bien pero hace un mes estaba muy raro, creo que lo descubri con un flirteo con su celular. Vivía en mi casa. me decia que me amaba. Al verme triste, me contaron que hace un a?o quiso montarme los cuernos con una conocida en mi cara. Lo heché y no me ha llamado. ?Sera que nunca me amó? ?Se puede dejar de amar de un dia a otro? o ?Para él fue un alivio irse?. Me siento muy culpable... Aunque se que era muy picaflor no pensé que se atrevería a mas. Ayudenme a esclarecer mi corazon!!!   Siento que a la final yo le hice da?o, botandolo de mi casa, no se si fue un arrebaton de rabia y ahora lo perdí para siempre   No tuvimos hijos. El tiene 46 y yo 34. Se que él es una bella persona... por eso lo amo tanto, pero no siempre estuve segura con él. Gracias por contestar...   Urgente estoy desesperada, creen que cometí un error?????????

Tengo 16 a?os, voy a primero de bachiller y este a?o me cambie de un colegio a un insti, soy una persona algo timida al principio pero luego ya me suelto. El primer dia de clase se me acercaron dos chicas, chicas que por cierto no se llevan bien entre ellas. Una de ellas es coja porque tuvo un problema al nacer y no anda bien. Tengo que ayudarla a ir de un sitio a otro y subir y bajar escaleras. La otra chica es repetidora, la gente dice que es un poco down, tiene problemas a la hora de pronunciar algunas palabras y bueno, no es muy bien vista; con deciros que nadie de clase quiere estar con ella porque dicen que huele mal y da asco... El caso es que yo toda encantada pues hablaba con ellas y tal, la verdad es que me considero una persona tolerante y no tuve ningun problema. Llevo ya medio curso, y empiezo a encontrarme ya mal... no por ellas, porque son buenas personas y la verdad es que las comparas con las demas de la clase y valen hasta mas.

20080615015144AAVciqj	Family & Relationships;Family	?Qué es un papá?	Un papá, lo que se llama papá, es una combinación extra?a de razón y sentimiento.   Es aquel que sabe orientar y exigir, pero al mismo tiempo sabe amar.   Es aquel que al minuto de haber rega?ado con severidad, sonríe y gui?a el ojo con ternura.   Es el que sabe decir no cuando es lo justo y sabe decir si cuando es lo conveniente.   Un papá zapatea duro cuando cumple su deber y anda de puntillas en la noche cobijando nalguitas y cuerpecitos fríos.   Un buen papá es el que después, de una dura jornada de trabajo, al llegar a casa abraza a sus hijos y se vuelve un ni?o jugando can ellos.   Un papá es aquel hombre que genera vida, que acompa?a y da seguridad ofreciendo una mano firme.   Un papá es un higo que parece duro y espinoso por fuera pero es puro y dulce en su interior.   Un papá es un director de orquesta, es el constructor de un nido, es el maestro de la escuela de la vida.

20080606221326AA46nfU	Family & Relationships;Family	Como manejas la deshonestidad de los que te rodean???	La honestidad es un valor humano de los que actúan con respeto y justicia, razonando sus acciones con rectitud, decencia y honradez.  El honesto se respeta a si mismo y por consiguiente a los demás.      La honestidad es una cualidad humana que la persona  determina al elegir actuar, siempre con base en la verdad y en la auténtica justicia, dando a cada quien lo que le corresponde, incluida a misma.        Ser honesto es ser genuino, auténtico, objetivo. Esta actitud siembra confianza en uno mismo y en aquellos quienes están en contacto con la persona honesta.      Cualquier falta de honestidad por peque?a que sea nos puede afectar con nuestras amistades y con los grupos con quienes se comparte. Ser deshonesto es ser falso, injusto y ficticio. La persona que dice una cosa y luego cambia de parecer por conveniencia o por perseguir sus propios beneficios, crea una sombra de desconfianza, por lo que siembra sospechas de injusticia y de falsedad.      Les deseo un buen fin de semana a todos.

20080615025516AAO1MQ9	Family & Relationships;Family	Les  gustara estas palabras???	?QUé ES UN PAPá?Un papá, lo que se llama papá, es una combinación extra?a de razón y sentimiento.Es aquel que sabe orientar y exigir, pero al mismo tiempo sabe amar.Es aquel que al minuto de haber rega?ado con severidad, sonríe y gui?a el ojo con ternura. Es el que sabe decir no cuando es lo justo y sabe decir si cuando es lo conveniente. Un papá zapatea duro cuando cumple su deber y anda de puntillas en la noche cobijando nalguitas y cuerpecitos fríos.Un buen papá es el que después, de una dura jornada de trabajo, al llegar a casa abraza a sus hijos y se vuelve un ni?o jugando can ellos.Un papá es aquel hombre que genera vida, que acompa?a y da seguridad ofreciendo una mano firme. Un papá es un higo que parece duro y espinoso por fuera pero es puro y dulce en su interior.Un papá es un director de orquesta, es el constructor de un nido, es el maestro de la escuela de la vida. Un papá es ante todo un hombre con corazón, que sabe se?alar el horizonte con optimismo y confianza.Un papá, un verdadero papá, tiene mucho de mamá, aunque tenga fortaleza de varón inquebrantable. Un papá es refugio seguro para el hijo que llora y sufre...un papá es aquel que sabe escuchar y alentar a los hijos en las derrotas de la vida.A los papás se les dedica un día en el a?o, pero ellos dan todos los días para los suyos. Son generosos por naturaleza, por voluntad y por amor. Además, un papá nunca muere, simplemente se esfuma para continuar mandando en su recuerdo con sus ense?anzas.Los papás, son arriesgados, decididos, comprometidos y tenaces.La vida de los hijos transcurre felizmente a la sombra de un buen papá, como el amigo y confidente que refleja la ternura, la bondad y el amor de Dios-Padre.RECUERDA PAPá...Que si no juegas ahora conmigo, cuando tu quieras hacerlo ya habré crecido.Que la armonía entre tú y mamá me dará seguridad ante la vida y hará de mi un triunfador o un frustrado.Que de tu amor depende mi capacidad de amar cuando sea adulto.Que soy muy feliz cuando me llevas dormido hasta mi cama.Que lo que yo aprendo contigo lo recordaré toda la vida.Que si oramos juntos aprendo a comunicarme con Dios.Que el amor y respeto que demuestres por nuestros semejantes será el amor y el respeto que yo les tenga cuando sea adulto.Que yo también tengo intereses personales.Que me gusta tomar parte en las discusiones familiares.?Y que te necesito como mi mejor amigo!Autor Anónimo.

20080713100319AAHDLgq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	? El dia mas hermoso es......hoy....????	No existe un día más hermoso que el día de hoy.  La suma de muchísimos   ayeres, forma mi pasado. Mi pasado se compone de recuerdos alegres...   tristes...  Algunos están fotografiados y ahora son cartulinas donde me veo   peque?a, donde mis padres siguen siendo recién casados, donde mi ciudad   parece otra.      El día de ayer pudo haber sido un hermoso día... pero no puedo avanzar   mirando constantemente hacia atrás, corro el riesgo de no ver los rostros   de  los que marchan a mi lado.  Puede ser que el día de ma?ana amanezca aún   más hermoso... pero no puedo avanzar mirando sólo el horizonte, corro el riesgo   de no ver el paisaje que se abre a mi alrededor.      Por eso, yo prefiero el día de hoy. Me gusta pisarlo con fuerza, gozar su   sol o estremecerme con su frío, sentir como cada instante, dice:   ??presente!!.  Sé que es muy breve, que pronto pasará, que no voy a poder   modificarlo luego, ni pasarlo en limpio.      Como tampoco puedo planificar demasiado el día de ma?ana:  es un lugar que   todavía no existe. Ayer fui. Ma?ana, seré. Hoy, soy

Que haces si eres una chica de 28 y jamas has tenido un amor correspondido?  Nunca he tenido una relacion formal, y me estoy desesperando porque si tengo 28 y no me ha pasado temo que nunca me vaya a pasar.  Cada vez que conozco a un chavo que me gusta, yo nunca le gusto a el.  Cada vez que yo le gusto a alguien, el no me gusta a mi.  La mala suerte me toco, y me toco, y me toco, conozco un chavo que me gusta, empiezo a so~nar, el rompe mi corazon (a proposito, o porque esta comprometido con otra, o es uno de mis amigos gay)... yo tengo que superarme, conozco a otro chavo y pasa la misma cosa... el rompe mi corazon y tengo que superarme otra vez.      Por que a algunas chicas les toca el amor y la felicidad, y algunas chicas sufren, y sufren, y sufren?  La mayoria hemos sufrido, pero yo SIEMPRE soy la chica que sufre, siempre es otra chica que se acaba feliz, con el hombre.  Yo tengo 28 a~nos y no hay nada que no daria para tener un amor correspondido, aunque sea solo por un dia.

Ayer en un almuerzo con amigos, uno de ellos nos repartió lo que sigue:      Con palabras que inspira el sentimiento   voy a nombrarte padre en este día   pues tu ejemplo ha forjado el sentimiento   que ha reglado los actos de mi vida.      Fuiste de todos los amigos el mejor   consejero en mis días sin respuesta   amenguando momentos de dolor   y a mi lado escalando cada cuesta.      Fui creciendo observándome en tu espejo   y entus arrugas aprendí a vivir en calma   mientras tu anciana mirada fue el reflejo   que iluminó los rincones de mi alma.      Estás siempre junto a mi en el pensamiento   e intento ser como tú en esta vida   tal vez llore y me asista el sentimiento    cada vez que te evoque en la poesía.                    Hugo F. M.

20090223133827AAyxb43	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I nip this in the bud?	Okay so, recently I've become very good friends with one of my boyfriend's guy friends. He's a decent guy, funny and easy to talk to, etc. We had a class together last term and we sat by each other and got to know one another. Anyway, he recently had a "thing" with one of my ex-best friends which ended badly and now that he doesn't have her to talk to, he's been messaging me 6-10 times a day. He NEEDS to talk and it's getting so excessive that I feel like blocking him. We were talking the other day, and I found out he's been on drugs for 2 years (cocaine and weed) and he smokes cigarettes. We were talking for 3 hours and I said some things and now he's trying to quit (he got pills from the doctor). He's taking it very seriously and I'm proud of him BUT this just leads to more messages and more need of attention. I don't mind helping the guy out as I like him but it's like I can't go anywhere (school especially) without him stuck to me. My boyfriend doesn't care and he says it's a nice thing for me to do by helping his friend through this, but it's just overpowering me and I don't know what to do anymore. He takes angry outbursts, he seems depressed sometimes and he just seeks out my attention 24/7 now. I'm not trying to sound like a mean person, but I need to get him to back off a little. Help?
20090223134550AAA7JVC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I tell my boyfriend about what happened today?	My boyfriends brother has a friend (his friend is in his early 60s) who owns a business. My boyfriend worked for him as a side job for a couple of weeks as a side job a few months ago and I joined them and helped one day. Well the other day he called ad asked if I could help him this week and I said I could.      Fast forward to today I went over to his house to work. We started talking and the conversation almost immediately turned to my boyfriends love for porn and that turned into a long talk about sex. He told me things that his family doesn't even know. He told me to NOT tell anyone about this conversation.      He told me how he once worked for a nude magazine as the person who applied makeup to the naked girls breasts. We talked about different magazines that you can model in and I said that as far as that goes, I would only want to do swim suit modeling no nudity. He said that to do swim suit modeling you have to have large nipples and asked if mine were large. I laughed and said I don't know and he asked to see my boobs. The look on my face after that startled him and the topic was changed.      Should I tell my boyfriend about this. I feel as though to ask to see my boobs is inappropriate (I'm 22). But then again working for him gives us money while we both look for steady jobs. What should I do?? HELP!!
20090223103425AAOoTya	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I say back, I want to help him?	My best friend (and cousin) keeps mentioning that he feels like we're drifting apart cos we live about 2 hours away, and he just sent me a text saying;   'We have separate lives and when I hear about you going to parties and stuff it makes me feel like im drifting away. But more to do with life in general. We're no different to any other family and that makes me feel s.hit. We're all the same, living the same lives with the same problems but different names and faces. I want to be different but its not possible."   I really want to give him some good advice and reassurance but i dont feel the same way so I dont know what to say.
20090223124947AAFKRBe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think this is cheating?	I have been with my gf for 6 months. I thought everything was going great until today I caught her exchanging emails on a sex site.  I told her either leave my house or show me her account, so she showed me all the emails. she has a very alluring profile saying she is looking for a long term bdsm relationship and she even put her OWN pic on that site. she got hundreds of emails daily. she responded to about 20 guys on that site in 2 months(she registed 2 months ago) asking them to send pics, and from the emails I can see that she didnt meet anyone, but she chatted with 2 or 3 guys and exchanged emails with 20 guys(mostly short and just asking for pics).    she told me she never met anyone else in the 6months, and she will never cheat on me. she said that to go on that website is just like to watch a porn for her, and online and real life is totally different thing.    the most hurtful thing is she was in MY house using MY computer emailing other guys the dirty things while I was trying to fix her computer.    do you think that is cheating?

20090223103720AAxibY0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My friend is kinda in a pickle?	He is in the process of getting a divorce.  Upon hearing the news, he sorta went crazy and did some drugs and wrecked one of their cars.  It's still driveable, but things are going wrong with it.        In the divorce decree, his wife wanted that car -knew it was wrecked etc. but wanted that car, so that was the one that was awarded to her.  The lien note is still in his name and he owes about $23,000 on it.  Yikes, right?      She just got back from Vegas today, and decided she is ticked about it "all of the sudden" and that "he's ruined her life again", said some nasty things and wants his car now.  I told him she knew about it, chose not to fix it during the entire six months she's been driving it since the crash, and that it was now her responsibility to pay for it since it was awarded to her.  Yes, it is still his to pay the note, but as for any other damages (even though he did do them) she should handle.  She has in fact, known that this car was damaged and could have requested the other car, but did not.        He just wants to know how to handle it.  Advice givers -what is your advice?

He is a tattoo artist and is an amazing man who i love very much. I am 25 and he is 32. He is very affectionate with me and always wants to be around me. When i am going out with the girls he wants us all to meet up with his friends and always calls me to see how i am. Or if i am working he will call me or sometimes surprise me and take me to lunch. My best friend is engaged to his friend & he told me that whenever he is at work all he nearly talks about is me. We almost have sex everyday & he tells me always that he loves me and worships the ground i walk on. I don't mean to sound like a ***** but i grew up without a family & never really felt loved or wanted and he is giving all this to me and i don't know how to handle it. I feel like i am pushing him away and i really don't want to. Please help me as i adore and love this man to pieces.   Thank you

When I want to talk about my feelings to my husband he switches off and immediately goes on the defensive thinking that I am saying he is wrong and I am right even when I know I am not doing this.  He then refuses to discuss anything and ignores me for days afterwards, going to work and out without speaking.  It drives me mad and I used to always be the one to back down but it gets me nowhere as the issues are never resolved and I am forced to spend my time asking strangers for advice on the internet like this!!

One of my good friends will be highly offended if I do not include her.  The last get together I did invite her and she brought her 4 children and husband.  There were people in line for food and she cut right in, serving all her family despite the fact that she completely cut in.  I do not want her bringing her youngest either because my 3-year-old and her argue and she blames everything on my child even when it's not her fault.  It just becomes chaotic and I was hoping of a way to avoid them coming this Friday so I can have a good time.  My question to all of you is, do you see any way around her not coming or will it ruin our friendship?  Any ideas or suggestions would be great!

20090223103634AAOYGwe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are these things I should watch out for, or am I just paranoid?	I'm seeing a new guy. But something about him just rubs me the wrong way. I mean, I like him. He's gentlemanly, won't let me pay if I take him out. We seem to have a lot in common. Anyway, here's a list of things that kind of...bother me.      I'm becoming reluctant to hang out with him, because he's constantly trying to kiss me. A few times is ok, but if we're at the movies, if we're on a date, or if we're just hanging out talking, it's like he *needs* to be kissing me every 5 minutes. We've been dating about 2 weeks now.      We were just talking, and we were like 2 or 3 feet apart, and he asks why I'm so far away. Literally 90% of the time, he wants his arms around me. Which is nice...in moderation.      When he does start kissing me, if I gently push him to break the kiss, he sometimes doesn't respond.      He said he planned to see me today. But this is how he asked: "I'll be outside your house at 10:30. Ok?" I really didn't like that, and just canceled on him because I have much studying to do. Anyway, what do you think?

OK, PLEASE try to help me out here. I want to go to college, be a smart ***, and marry my romeo. Things are stopping me from doing so....therefore I need the answers to these questions: P.S. when i say child, i mean a 14 year old teenager.      1. Whats the youngest age possible to drop out of high-school? some say 16, others say the age has been changed to 18...i'm not sure.      2. How can I get married at a young age without parent consent?      3. How can social services help me move out of my parent's place, if i'm too young? (LONG STORY, DIDN'T I TELL YOU?)      4. Is it legal for parents to send their child overseas? and can they make their child STAY there?      5. Can parents force their child to quit school?      6. What would social services do if a child was sent overseas to complete an arranged marriage? would they stop it from happening?      Please don't ask questions, as this shows I have a very tough life, so therefore no time to answer questions...and probably not enough room on this little screen either!

20090223131259AA4Hc9p	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do you get an adult to wash his hands?	I am an adult with an adult brother.  We recently moved to a new city where we don't know many people yet so we wind up doing a lot of activities together every weekend as we get to know our new city.  He comes over to my house and uses my bathroom and doesn't wash his hands.  I am so grossed out.  When I bring it up, he gets mad at me and tells me I have OCD.  We go eat at a Mexican place and he puts his dirty hands in the chips bowl.  Or he uses my remote control.  I try to tell him I'll get sick but he says, "you need germs to build up a resistance."  I'm so sick of it!  He gets mad when I try to tell him.

20090223102034AA6azvw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why is it that it's almost always the girl that dumps the boy and not the other way around?	I'm 16 and i've had three real girlfriends, two of them dumped me, and me and the third one drifted away from each other a bit so we kinda mutually broke up even though i was the one that said it. However, this is not just about me, i notice it in relationships in my school and with adults, it's almost always the girl who dumps the boy or the wife who kicks the husband out. It seems that although men are said to be 'playas' who 'only want one thing' we seem to be more easily contented with out partners and don't want to end relationships. Could anyone shed some light on this?

20090223120504AAiBtZy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I just don't care anymore, and i don't know why?	Like the title says, I don't care anymore. i used to be an athletic, straight-A student, with lots of friends, and basically most things going good for me. i mean, i've had some bad times in my life (parents divorce ..etc) but i perservered, and it never affected me like the way people say it should have. i used to go out a lot, and i used to ENJOY the things i did.       lately i feel as though i've just been going through the motions. i don't go out anymore, i can feel the distance growing between my friends and myself. my grades are slipping, and i haven't attended school for almost two months. My poor attendence is due to the fact that i have been genuinely sick, but even that helps to make my "i don't care" attitude stick. last year, if and when i got sick, i would go to school sick as a dog, and stick it out until the school sent me home! now i honestly don't care.       i'm not a person who expresses my emotions, so i wrote songs. i can finish a book of songs(lyrics) in a few months, i haven't written a song in 2 months. i haven't even picked up an instrument.      i can' figure it out. i've even stopped playing sports! i've gained weight, and i went from this optomistic, energetic person, to a pessimistic one with absolutely no enjoyment in life. I can't find a reason to get up in the mornings, and I DON'T KNOW WHY!       I just don't care anymore about anything. I've failed this term, i've let my friends down, i've let my team down, but i still don't feel as though i've let myself down. i just don't give a f*ck about anything or anyone anymore.

He knew too but said we were just friends- which i accept.   We had a sleepover a week ago and both decided to text him, she had never met him before and decided to flirt outrageously with him. My other friend asked her if she wanted to meet up with him and she said no, it would be weird.   A week later my crush told me that they had met up and gotten off with each other and apparently went a bit further...when they were both drunk. I feel so hurt and betrayed by that friend that I haven't talked to her.   She is telling everyone she doesn't know what the fuss is about and is saying that I am over-reacting.   Am I?      My other friends and some people that know about it think it is wrong too and that they shouldn't have done that. What do you guys think?

20090223134909AAqFDqM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My family doesn't show any hints that they love me?	My family seems always like they hate me. I know they gave birth and fed me for this long but sometimes i think they like my brother better than me. Every time i try to explain or talk they ignore me and interrupt as if i'm not even existing... When my brother is mad or in trouble they always blame me... I think they like him more because he's smarter than me in school. He gets 100% in everything and always gets averages of 98.5 and up!!! I get only 74-78ish averages... But in elementary school he use to get 60s now he gets 100s in high school. But at least i did better than him in elementary... They never seem to notice that tho... Everyday i cry in my room but even though they know they just ignore me again. I feel as if i'm not loved i know i seem selfish but it hurts sometimes... They make me do chores and my brother gets to relax... I have to act as if im a mother who has to clean and cook. When i get B+-A- marks they say im dumb and will become a garbage woman. My parents always ignore me and call me dumb. They only call my brother smart. Did i do something wrong?

The other guy is unaware and I really don't want to be with him at all.

He asked if he could take me out to my favorite restaurant so we could talk about the future. I really want to get back with him and have him be the father to this child. I know he'll be a good dad even if it isn't his. How can I talk to him? What if he cries again? I've apologized of course and will again in person. I just want to make this meeting/date go well.

20090223145041AAV1t6J	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think my friend may like me?	My “love life” or lack thereof started in the 6th grade. Girls said a guy liked me, & since I was naive I believed that lie. I had crushes on 3 guys since then. 2nd guy [8th grade] knew I liked him, & then he used me. T_T 3rd guy [9th gr.] was really nice, we flirted a lot. But I found out he had a girlfriend. I had a few mini-crushes on the last two guys once each, but It was just more heartbreak. (I fall in love too easily)   So... yeah, that all sucked. I decided that no guy will ever like me just so I don’t assume a guy likes me just because we’re both messing around. Here’s where things get tricky:   There is a guy in my senior class (& in my culinary class I take at a nearby college for 3rd & 4th hour). Say his name is “Jake”. (cuz I don’t like giving out names XD) I had always seen him like many people who didn’t know him: a guy that you don’t want to mess w/. (if looks could kill) I’m getting to know him, & since he’s into all this action stuff, sometimes we’ll “fight” (just mess around w/ each other) Friday night he stopped by & we ended up going to the arcade, (we tried to call up our friends, but they we all busy/didn’t answer) then Arby’s, then Wal-Mart, then we drove around looking for something that was open, & ended up meeting our friend Alex at Denny’s. We were out until 1 AM & it was a fun time. But I considered just that: a fun time w/ a friend. I later thought, “Why did he spend all that time w/ me when he has a girlfriend?” (He said that if we didn’t do anything, he would have been staring at a wall bored) I shrugged it off, but then my friends who have known him longer say that he probably likes me. He’s been acting differently w/ me around & said that I’ve let him too close to me. (Remember: I’ve decided that no guy would ever like me, so this was news to me) Yesterday he called me & asked if I was home. I said no, I was shopping. He called me 3 more times after that. I called him back later, so I wouldn’t be rude, & we talked for a ? hour. He made some weird noise during the call & I jokingly asked, “Did you just stab yourself?” he laughed & answered, “You are the 3rd girl that I’ve talked to tonight that asked me that.” Supposedly he had been talking w/ girl friends, & I figured that I was being paranoid about him liking me. Now TODAY, we went on a field trip w/ our culinary class today to go to a food show downtown. “Jake”, Alex, & our friend Michelle mostly went around together; sometimes we split up depending on what caught our interests. Once “Jake” & I were together, & we sat down to watch a demonstration, then he started to squeeze my knee. I don’t really know when a guy likes me or not (I still think no guy ever will!) but I want someone else’s opinion on this situation. I’m really naive w/ this subject, don’t know the signs, & don’t want to assume anything rash about a guy I consider a good friend.    I don’t know if he does this w/ his other girl friends, but from what I’ve said, do you think “Jake” likes me? =/
20090223150801AAnEzvj	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it weird to tell your best friend that...?	I am writing a birthday card (20th) for my best friend. I get really sentimental and I was wondering if it would be weird to tell my best friend, "You are my best friend and I love you."      We have known each other for 10 years. We are pretty close. I also write in the card that I can't imagine my life without her: like if she died I wouldn't be able to handle it...I have already told her this before, though.      I am not IN love with her, but we have this connection and I want to be able to express that I love her as my best friend.

20090223145347AApmNqa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does my husband do this? TV is his.. his his his?	Why does my husband insist that he be the one in control of the tv remote?  He also insists on listening to the tv so loud that if I am in the next room I must ask consistently to turn it down.. so I can think, read sleep etc.        I go through this daily.  If I had it my way I'd break my spouses fingers just so he can't sit there with the remotes in his hands....           If I am watching Oprah or whatever... and he decides he wants to watch yet another martial arts crap special.. he will just turn the channel... not ask.  When I ask, he insists on me going to the bedroom to watch the little tv.         I really do wish he had 10 broken fingers.
20090223150503AAGt8nE	Family & Relationships;Friends	My room mates are messy, any advice?	I live in a three bed room apartment complex with two other females. They're a year or two younger than I am. Both of us go to my hair school across the street (our place is real close to the school). I'm finished with school and I've been finished since November. I'm busy with trying to get my license so I can start working. Currently the girls are still brand new and going to the school Mondays-Saturdays, so they're busy.   Lately they haven't been cleaning up after themselves. Leaving food on the table that they haven't finished, leaving dirty gross dishes in the sink, letting the trash pile up and not taking it out. The other room mate thats 19, cleans her dishes and normally leaves her stuff in her room instead of the sink. The younger one piles her dishes in the sink.   The younger one barely stays at the apartment and always stays at her boyfriends house. But when shes home her dishes end up in the sink and never cleans them. She actually leaves them there for weeks on end, and I had to clean 'all' of the dishes.. just because they were getting gross and I was tired of looking at them.   Even I cleaned things up and there were no dishes in the sink she had the decency to still pile her dishes in the sink as if the dishes magically disappeared.   I have not confronted them, but I have left a small note asking to clean the dishes. She saw it and I'm sure ignored it. I think she chooses not to clean them because I've seen her home on a weekend.   I have not confronted her about this issue, mostly because I'm not her mother and I hate being a nag. I'm not sure how I can really ask someone to start cleaning up after themselves without coming off as bossy or obsessive. But its getting out of hand and it seems they don't care.. I seem to be taking out the trash a lot too. I've even left a trash bag out in the kitchen and they ignored it.   Any ideas of how to confront these two (mostly the young'n)?
20090223144208AAHmyPJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Is my family in bad-shape?	When I got home from school, only my sister was around. My two brothers, Deven and Max were at Basketball practice. My step-father is at work and my mom is at work also. My sister Carry sat me down and told me some VERY important stuff that I didn't know about.       She told me in a teary voice that she's pregnant! I was very shocked! She also told me that her boyfriend David broke-up with her right after she told him! I was about to say: Sue his ***! But she went on. This has nothing to do with the pregnant thing, but she told me that our family has been messed up for a couple of years.      First off, Carry told that our grandmother has been taking money away from our humble family. She owes us $500. And she will never pay us back because she has NO job, and she's living off her husband's money.      Second, she said that our REAL dad has been trying to stay in touch with us for the past year. No wounder why I hear my screaming in her office on the phone. My mother has been very portective in the past year. She told us to never pick up the phone when you see this number. I was getting concerned about that but finally I knew what it ment.       Third of all, our cousin, Stacey has been kicked out of her home. And she's 11! She has been living on the streets for more then a month. No one will take her in. We can't pick her up because she lives in Tampa, Florida! And I live in Oswego, Illionis. She's still alive though. I wonder if she has dieases.       Forth of all(the last one): My uncle want's to kill himself! I don't know why. I think its because his children are such a disapointment to him.             Ok, I really didn't believe Carry at first. Then she was crying. I couldn't believe that I had the nerve to pick up the phone and call my step-father. He said that everything is true and he's sorry that he didn't tell me sooner.       I'm crying right now, most of the part because I thought that our family was in good hands. But it isn't. Please tell me what should I do!? I'm praying but God didn't do anything yet!

She was a virgin up to the age of 12!  She first had sex with her cousins friend at her grandmas house over the summer with a guy who is 15.  She is now 13 and she was recently on a cruise and she slept with a guy after she knew him for 4 days.(He's 16) The day after she slept with him, she dumped him and convinced another guy to break up with his girlfriend so she could make out with him.(He's 16 too)  In a year she has slept with 3 different guys and she is 13!  I don't really want a friend like that but she has been my bff for 4 years now.  I'm not sure how to handle the situation.

There will probably be about sixty people. What do you suggest for a reception?    My fiance's parents' house is very large with a huge backyard, and a nice pool. Since it will be a very small reception type thing, could we have it there? Maybe barbeque and have lots of food? Or should I find a venue and have a big dance type thing? Oh and what are some good color palettes? Nice summer colors? Please help! I need as much input as I can get!

20090223152232AA4kl8n	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you think of this friend? Your opinion please?	I used to have a best friend who I thought was the nicest person in the world. but she did things that made me think otherwise, like she never called me unless i called her first, we never hung out unless i asked first when we did we had a so much fun though. she seemed like she never made the effort to see me or call. But i am kinda confused because she told me some of her deepest secrets because she said she trust me, i'm not sure if she was just using me as a her venting machine when we did hang out, shes a very talkative person. She tells me things on how she uses her boyfriend because shes afraid of being alone. BUt other times she says she just prefers to be alone even though she is so social with every one she meets. she doesn't have a lot of friends but its not because she s anti social everybody thinks shes really cool and nice. I am really confused. What do you think of this person?
20090223143003AA6mSgM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What incentive does marriage offer to men?	My girlfriend wants to get hitched but I turned her proposal down. She was fairly angry about the rejection, understandably, but I do not see any reason why we should get married.       How exactly does a man benefit from marriage, other than a potentially small income tax reduction?       I love my girlfriend a lot, but I am not blinded by love. I can't think of a single good reason why should marry. We have no children. We currently have a good relationship, which will not change at all through marriage. If we want the other to get our inheritance we can make wills. Plus, if in the chance our relationship does go sour one day, we both would have a lot easier time leaving the relationship. We wouldn't have to go through a divorce court, which has a tendency to rake a man over the coals.       Do not the potential negative aspects of marriage outweigh the benefits?

Well after talking about it with her I decided that I loved her to much to get a divorce. She ended all ties with him( changed phone numbers, e-mail, even her job) and we are getting past this just fine.   One thing that surfaced was how I haven't been there for her and how alone she has been for the past year. I have been spending to much time with my friends and drinking. I feel horrible that I have let our marriage get to this point, but now vow to change.       My question is: After all that I have been through with this, is it odd that I love her more now than I ever in my life have. Even after what she did (which I forgive her for)?

His lg washing machine, his 200 dollar shopping list, his dad being a pushover, i mean really? There is no way I'm jealous because I've been to many places out of the country that I know for a fact he hasn't been to, and it doesn't help when he talks in his gay voice. He thinks because he lives in a plan (with small rooms by the way) that EVERYONE lives in, that he is rich or something. But for the record the homes are normal homes so I dont know. Don't even get me started about his babbling about his new generator. how the HELL do i get him off my back??

It is a very small wedding of about 30 people, I have purchased the guest's hotel rooms for 2 nights I rented the best man and groomsman their tuxedos.  I did this because many of my fiance's friends that are coming do not have much income.  I'm now getting complaints because 4 or 5 of them (including his mother) don't have cars.  They have known about this for over a year.  I don't want them to not come because my fiance will be upset, but I don't feel like this is our problem.  What should I do?

20090223145204AA4GHcr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband and I want to renew our vows after 1 year...Below is the reason why, does this seem strange?	When my husband and I were married 6 months ago, we were going through the motions. We didn't really know what we were really getting ourselves into. We both were more in love with the idea of marriage - or the "its the next step" than actually in love with each other. We went to pre-marriage classes, but only went through the motions to get through.       I planned the entire wedding by my self. I KNOW I was more focused on the details of flowers and linens and food and decorations junk than on the real reason we were getting married. As I'm sure a lot of brides are.       Over the last few months, my husband and I have started going to church and began a relationship with God. We both have a new revelation of what marriage REALLY is and what it's supposed to be in God's eyes. Although when we were married we said we wanted a covenant marriage, we didn't have a clear definition of this until recently.      We are both more in love with each other now, than ever before. It's the happiest I've ever been. When I married my husband, I knew I could love this man forever, but until recently did I truly believe it with all my heart.       Would it be strange to renew our vows on our 1 year anniversary this year- under God's eyes and in our new found love for each other? It would be something more for us than anything. Say our vows - very casual. Maybe an early BBQ or Picnic with family and best friends after. Something simple, showcasing the "love" and not the "wedding"

20090223145555AAueQso	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What does it mean when a guy does this?	I have known this one guy for my whole life, and I've always liked him. When we were little we were really good friends, and we still were during the preteen years. Now for about 3 years, we haven't been talking, like at all. We can't even say hi and goodbye when family hangs out (he's a family friend.) I also have caught him staring or looking at me in the corner of his eye, and I do the same. The other day when we were leaving their house, I actually said bye and waved. He then barely could look at me in the eye, and said bye in like a deep whisper, and could barely raise his hand. I don't understand it at all !
20090223145723AAMVRvJ	Family & Relationships;Family	What to do about my mother?	My mother is middle aged now at 56yrs old. she has been widowed for about 30yrs, chose to not remarry because of her traveling career and raising her 3 kids. Now her 3 kids are 35,30 and 25. I am the 25yr old who moved out about 2yrs ago because we could not get along anymore. she was becoming too controlling and treating me like a child which i understand is absolutely normal. she also bounces around a lot since she does not have a husband to listen to and does corporate work that requires her to move every few years. Now i come from a culture that requires the woman to live at home until she is married. Living at home was convenient because of the ability to save lots of money and just having family to take care of you and watch over you. My mother decided to pick up and move again this time across the country. The biggest mistake i made was to move with her because i hated where she moved to, Indiana. I traced my way back to the East Coast. After i left, she lost her job again and then moved back east because she missed both her daughters not being around. she has lost her job again in the few months she moved back east and she is pushing to have me move in with her, my sister and her son. I love my family but the truth is that i am scared i cannot live with them. I mean as grown as we are, i am the youngest one and i still get treated like **** at 25yrs old especially by my 30yr old sister. i am living with some roommates right now, financially it's not the best but at least i have my own space. I guess my question is what can be done to get this woman dating and involved in activities. she never goes anywhere or does anything fun. all she does is sit at home and then worry about her grown kids as if they are still going to return home. do you think it's a good idea for us to get a large apartment and live together or should each person get their own if they can afford it. remember we are talking NYC/NJ area. these are very expensive areas in the country.

Anyhow when my husband and I were going through a rough patch in our marriage, he had her over all the time. They NEVER talked before.  I was upset because he lied about having her over.  Why lie if nothing is going on?  Anyways we fixed our issues and she is always leaving messages about how she loves him bunches, she misses him so much.  Give him a big hug for me when you see him.  Is this a little extreme or am I overreacting?  I've talked to him, but he just says I could never do that she's my cousin. HELP

Ok, so, im a 9'th grader in high school, & i really like this one girl. Now, she is very popular, & i am not too popular, but i am friends w/ some popular people. But anyways, i really like her. So, does anyone know any ways i can get her to notice me or like me, because i believe she likes another guy. Also, please tell me what these signs mean: I sometimes catch her starring @ me, and when i do, we look @ eachother in the eyes directly for a few seconds, then both look away. Also, we sometimes talk on facebook but not often. bu, for example, when my status says i'm sick, she says somethin like awwwwwwww. Also, if i pass her in the hallway, she seems to try to look the other way, but always ends up looking @ me. & her friends got her to walk around the cafeteria by my table twice in a row + her 1 friend always tries to get her to say somethin on facebook when i comment on her pics. So what do these things mean? Also, could you possibly help me find ways for her to like me or notice me? Also, how could I approach her & talk to her? Please help me! Thank-you!
20090223152052AAu4pGu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband won't work!!!?	He started off with a part time job that was supposed to go full time. He was barely making 5 hours a week. He wanted to stay there, so I said fine, as long as you're making some kind of money and you'll be working full time soon, fine. Nope.. lost the job...       Never sent out a single resume. After 3 months of him sitting at home doing nothing all day, I gave in and did the job searching for him. Finally found one for him and he was there for about a year and got fired from that one too. Its been about six months now and again he hasn't sent out a single resume or filled out one application. I get him  leads to jobs that he can apply for, but he refuses to go.       I'm really getting tired of his irresponsibility. I've cut off the cable & internet as of today and stopped giving him gas money. Every time I threaten him, he acts like he doesn't care.       For example, "We cant afford the bills and are going to get foreclosed on soon"        Husband, "oh well. Good luck finding somewhere else to live."      OR       "you either get a job or get out"      husband - "ok, bye"      I don't want to leave him, but this is stressing me out beyond belief. I barely make enough to cover the bills, and that doesn't include food. What else could I possibly do to make him get off his lazy butt and get a job?

Hi,      I've noticed lately that my boyfriend always expects me to carry the conversation.  You know how sometimes you are just feeling a little mellow, but not mad or anything?

I'll say, what do you want to talk about?  And he'll clam up.  This is irritating me, it's something I noticed.  Is this typical for guys?

There is a girl who is friends with my roommate Stephanie, who seems to think that she has to be Stephanie's mother. Stephanie is 20 years old and is fully capable of taking care of herself. She also likes to stick her nose where it doesn't belong, like my relationship. Before she even met my fiance she told me that she was going to try really hard to not hate him.   She is constantly making other people's issues her own and it's driving me crazy! I've told her before that she needs to bugger off but she doesn't seem to get the message.   Stephanie is too polite to say mean things to her so she asked if I would "tell her off" for her. I told her I would. I tried telling her the other day but either she's too dense to understand or she just doesn't care!   But I would just like a little advice on this.   Thanks!   ~Morgan

We text alot and he tells me that he thinks I'm really cute, and hott, he likes to hug me and he always looks at me and I just really like him. But the problem is he has a girlfriend and they break up alot and get back together. But he still flirts with me.

20090223154232AADjA8l	Family & Relationships;Friends	Feel Like I'm Done With My Life?	I'm addie. i'm only 13 years old. And I feel my life 10 times more hard then it should be at my age. I've tried talking to counselors and parents but they haven't done much help for me. I've got lots of problems at home. My mom had anger issues and my dad always sides with her. So no ones ever on my side. I've got a sister in college and she never has time to talk with me and a brother but he's in Iraq at the moment. My grandpa passed away two weeks ago and my grandma has Alzheimer's so she doesn't know who I am. So the only person I can talk to is my boyfriend. He understands me and we've been together for 16 months. It's my first year or middle school and just like everyone else, I've been trying to be someone i'm not. But I have a good reason. I want people to like me. I don't have friends and I know that's probably the reason why. I come on the computer so I can connect with people and it makes me feel like I belong somewhere for once. But of course my parents disagree and don't let me on much. I had a friend. She was my best friend. But she made some decisions I didn't agree with. And of course I can't change the way she feels about things. She was online dating, cutting herself because she feels like no one cares, and just recently she got back together with the "online boyfriend" who made her cut and tore her apart. Not only have I had the pressure of my own problems. But as a friend to her, I got her into a good counciling program and she stopped cutting. And I built up her confidence. I was trying to glue her pieces back together. But the other day when I found out she got back together with him... I told her I didn't agree with her decision. She didn't listen to me. And once again she's been hurt and she's cutting herself again. I know how dangerous cutting is and even though I'm fighting with her, i'm still begging her to stop. And on top of that she still loves that boy. I don't have anyone to talk to because my boyfriends in Ohio and and I'm in Illinois. So we don't get to talk as much as I'd like. I feel like I'm done with my life and now I'm considering cutting to. If anyone out there as any piece of advice or hope left for me... I'd grately appreciate it.
