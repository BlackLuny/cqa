20090222172215AAerIAs	Sports;Cycling	Bike brakes loose soon after adjustment?	I made the mistake of buying a cheap Huffy bike from a dept. store, and when I finally rode it, the brakes were not adjusted correctly - the front brake squeaked. A mile of riding later, I noticed that neither of my brakes worked.      So, I took it to a bike shop to get it checked over / adjusted. When I received it, the front break still squeaks a little bit, but the rear brake seems to work. Though, surprisingly, just two miles later, the rear brake failed again! At that point, I walked my bike to a friend's place nearby and locked it there.      Is it possible that the brakes were adjusted incorrectly? Or, is the bike clearly faulty? What should I do? Any ideas?      It's a $90 bike, so any repair over $40 is not worth it; if it's going to cost more than $40 to make it safe, I'd rather sell it and buy something much better.

Well they're tomorrow and I feel like I wanna cry because...I haven't gotten any better since I started practicing for real...there are some people who are really good I saw at conditioning and It's like I've stayed the same..I've been practicing my forehand with a tennis racket at home but I haven't really tested it out because it's too cold to play and too windy outside so I couldn't test my new forehand technique...the thing it every time I thought I got my forehand right it never is..I always screw it up and just have to try another way and pick up all over again..so the first time I test out my new forehand is when tryouts start and what if it turns out to be a failure too? I don't know what to do...my backhand is ok and I can serve it good enough but my forehand is the main part of my game...I mean...all my friends know that I play tennis and if they ask "did u make the team?" and i say" nah, i didnt make it" it's like they're gonna pity me and i hate that..and i've been going to conditioning for a month or 2 and everyone sees me there and if they see i didn't make it it's like...i dunno awkward I guess. if my family finds out i dont make it when i try out theyre gonna be pissed and all the money they spent (which was only like $30) was a waste and all the time and effort...it's just that i spent so much time and dedication into tennis if i dont make the team i'll fall to pieces..and have to fake a smile and laugh when i say "nah i didnt make it"...any motivation for me...tryouts are tomorrow..?

20090222183659AAaYQM5	Sports;Basketball	Reply to The Diesels jokes Funny or not?	Three NBA players were waiting at Heaven's Gate. Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, and Sam Cassell.            One Angel says, "OK, fellas, pretty much anything goes up here, but whatever you do, never lie, or you will spend the rest of eternity with the ugliest women in the universe."      So they all agree and are admitted in.            Kobe Bryant makes it a week before he lies about how Great he was on Earth.            Bam! Right at his side appears the ugliest woman he had ever seen.      Lebron James makes it another couple weeks before he lies about how many Rings he won.            Bam! At his side appears the second ugliest woman in the universe.      So Kobe and Lebron are walking around with their monsters of women when they see Sam Cassell walking with the hottest woman ever conceived by man.            Kobe and Lebron say in unison, "How did you land with that babe when we get stuck with these ugly women?"      Sam nudges the babe and says, "Tell them."            She says to Kobe and Lebron, "I lied."

20090222191402AAKYS8c	Sports;Basketball	PISTONS FANS: Did you guys really lose faith in Chauncey Billups?	I cant believe you guys wanted Billups out and were happy with this trade when it first happened. I have had countless arguments with my friends that Billups is a better TEAM player than Iverson. Billups won you guys a championship and he was your Finals MVP. He was the guy who led your team, was the captain of your team, and was your floor general. He knows how to run a game. Im sick of people saying Billups lost his touch. How did he lose his touch? In Denver he has given the Nuggets their best start since the 1976 season and he is playing really well there. I just want some of you Pistons fans to explain to me how Billups lost his touch? You guys went to the Eastern Conference Finals 6 times in a row or something like that. I know it sucks to lose there all the time but those are deep playoff runs. Why not give another crack at it for 2 more years instead of give up now. Plus I think Rodney Stuckey could learn a lot more about how to be a point guard from Billups than from Iverson.

20090222194221AAWF1Rt	Sports;Football (American)	Could the NFL put a team in every state?	Ok here's my virtual proposal. There are over 100 college teams so every year players are being turned away. If the NFL put 2 teams in every state it would make jobs. New stadiums,more players & Staff. This would bring attraction and business everywhere.      They could structure the league by scheduled tiers. To balance out the Competition until it settles over the years and also structure it by markets so people can afford to support their team. Its a flawed Idea that needs perfecting but all I'm saying is with the way the economy is entertainment could come to the rescue if we put it back in it's proper perspective. Other Leagues are trying to emerge but either the NFL destroys them or fans wont accept them so why doesn't the NFL just evolve into a Monster league. In 10 years it would stabilize.       Kinda the way Soccer is all over the UK.

20090222195108AAovg7Z	Sports;Winter Sports;Other - Winter Sports	Which is better, Skiing or snowboarding?	After eight years of snowboarding, I thought I would try skiing for the first time today.  It has long been a debate between skiers and snowboaders as to which was better (all opinion of course).  Based on how fast I picked it up, I have concluded that skiing is much easier than snowboarding even though it takes more muscle and effort to turn and stop.  I rode down a black diamond relatively easily on skis on my fourth run of the day.  However, I found it is not nearly as fun as snowboarding.  I just got bored of it quickly.  It may be because I didn't find it as challenging or versatile.  The only time I enjoyed it more than snowboarding was when I hit flats (the poles are a nice touch).  I'm just curious as to what other people's opinions are who have done both.  And to the skiers, do you have any good reason for why I should ever ski again?  If you have one, maybe I'll give it another shot.

20090222192103AAYL40h	Sports;Other - Sports	PLEASE!!! How do I get my flexibility back?! :(?	Okay well I've been Ice Skating for years, and it's my LIFE! I've never gotten below second place in any competitions and almost all of my best friends skate with me.       But about six months ago my mom found out that she might have ovarian cancer, they performed surgery and removed all of her reproductive organs, but it cost a fortune. Then like not even a week after that, she bashed her elbow on concrete and had to have some kind of plate thing or something removed? I'm not sure but that cost a bunch, too.      With my mom not working, my brother off to basic training, and my dad also sick at the time, we couldn't afford to pay the $900 per month that it was costing for me to ice sate plus the private lessons and accessories && I had to stay home to take care of both of my parents, and I'm in all honors classes, volunteer at my animal shelter, in my drama troupe at school, and take piano and flute lessons.      So bottom line, I had to quit skating for about 6 months and I'm not as flexible. What can I do to get back in shape FAST!!! Also, I've gotten rusty at my triples && my double salchow. What can I do to improve those again off the ice?! Because I don't get as much ice time as I used to, I got a job until my parents get well so I can support my own extra-curricular activities because I know how expensive I am.      How can I stay in shape and not get rusty off-ice?!?!      Thanks in advance?

20090222191611AAdwWlS	Sports;Football (American)	Should i quit football or not?	I'm a sophmore at westlake highschool and i am not sure if i should continue to play football. I am unsure about continuing my career because i dislocated my knee as a freshman and played the entire sophmore year with the pain. I know i have the talent to be a 2 way starter on varsity. This past year i was the starting middle linebacker and special teamist until one day in practice my coach thought i was slacking off, however i my knee was killing me that day so it was hard to play though it. So he pulled me off all of my starting spots, and i never gained back the respect i need. So my main problem is that i dont think the coaches will give me a fair shot at playing, and i dont want to risk my health and time to be bored for 10+ weeks, so if someone can help me think this over that would be great.

20090222215656AAQJSDu	Sports;Cycling	Cost of a entry-level mountain bike?	I was just wondering how much a decent (Iron Horse, Giant, Jamis, etc) mountain bike should cost.      I'm thinking one with front suspension, disc brakes and an aluminum frame.      I recall I went to a bike shop several years ago and $550 was about the minimum.  Have prices went down any?  What kind of margins do bikes carry- can you haggle with them?  Is buying a used one on craigslist a bad idea?

20090222212246AAC84lx	Sports;Auto Racing;Formula One	Snell approved racing helmet?	With the racing season starting for us in May, I need to get a Snell approved helmet in order to race.  The most current stamp in the Snell approved helmets is 2005 and has a production date of the helmet of Oct 2007.  What I've been told is Snell will reevaluate the safety of the current helmets in 2010.  It's very possible that a new helmet purchased today could only be legal to use for one year.  Of course I would prefer a more current production date inside the helmet that would last more than a year.      I don't want to sit out this racing season just because of a helmet issue that NHRA says it's only good for this year.  Is there any legal way around this issue.  I'm not trying to get away with anything.  In fact I am a strong supporter of safety on the race track, but it's tuft to swallow the cost of a Snell approved helmet that could potentially only be good for one racing season.        Racers Suggestions welcome.
