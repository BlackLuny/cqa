Dont compare 30 minute downloads...try comparing 10 meg files. If you send a 10 meg file to someone via dialup, it might take almost half your day. If you use DSL, it might take less than 8 minutes.    Just imagine trying to download a game thats 250Megs? What about a movie? Sometimes it takes even a DSL connection a half a day to download a movie from a file sharing site. For dialup, you are looking at about 5 days to 10 days...if youre lucky.|`|df5de036c84d4b06edbbc5c15664028faa	forget both get the high speed internet DSL sucks so does dial up.  If you still have dial-up you live in a cave LOL|`|AA10230792	The dial up accelerator doesn't work that great, especially when sending files over.  It works okay for uncompressed data but most files that you download from the internet are already compressed.  Dial up accelerators work by using latest in compression technology with caching technology.    Let's say you're downloading a huge file like 20 megabytes.  On a dialup connected at 49.2 kbps you're averaging roughly 5 kilobytes per second.    20 megabytes = 20,000 kilobytes    20,000 kilobytes / 5 kilobytes per sec = 4,000 seconds     4,000 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 66.7 minutes or about 68 minutes.    On a 1.5 megabit connection, you're averaging roughly 150 kilobytes per second (factoring in overhead and etc.).    20 megabytes = 20,000 kilobytes    20,000 kilobytes / 150 kilobytes per sec = 134 seconds     134 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 2.25 minutes or about 2 and half minutes.    So as you can see.  It makes a difference.    And about picture quality... it really only applies to streaming video.  For non-moving pictures (photos), speed has nothing to do with quality of the way the picture is displayed.

It appears this is the method used on the effect in question.    There are some great open-source AJAX tools out there, such as:    http://script.aculo.us  http://prototype.conio.net    --------------------  How to use the aforementioned open-source tools:    - Download the latest version of Prototype and Script.Aculo.Us  - Place them in a folder on your web server  - Link to the .js files in the  section of your XHTML file  - Use CSS to create a div, this is the item you will apply the "effect" to  - Capture an event (onClick, etc) and apply the effect    -----------------  The scriptaculous site has lots of examples and much better documentation than I have provided.

You did not say what brand/model you have so it's hard to give specific instructions.    You usually only need to configure this for inbound traffic only if needed, outbound is usually allowed on all ports. When you open ports, be careful what you open, it makes your network more vulnerable.    To learn how to configure opening ports on your router, look up port forwarding in your documentation or visit the manufacturer's website.    If you don't want to read the documentation, then just login to your router and click around the menus until you find it and then see if you can figure it out.|`|AA10811401	Depends on the firewall/router.

P.S. document.objectname is deprecated (will be outdated in a few years), use document.getElementById ("") instead.    -------  Edit:    Allright the filter will accept any string of the following format:  legend:  expression+ means 1 or more times  expression* means 0 or more times  expression? means 0 or 1 time  expression{a,b} means a to b times  expression{a} means exactly a times  [a-b] means any character from a to b  w means any letter, number or underscore  ( ) is for grouping    using the above legend the javascript syntax string can be translated into the following more standard format regular expression:  w+ ( . w+ )* @ ( w+ . )* w{1,66} . [a-z]{2,6} ( . [a-z]{2} )?    This means any of the following would be accepted:  joe3@example.com  john.smith@example_2.com.us    But not the following:  je$$@ex.net  jim.ex.org.uk    overly long can be accepted because of ( . w+ )* and ( w+ . )*  sally. sells. seashells. on. the. seashore @ the_seashell. store. no24. com    I'm not sure why the domain name is 1 to 66 characters, maybe a convention.

AA12042975	I have two Dells. I bought one of them last year. They usually take about 5 business days to build your computer. Then they will box it and then send you email of when they ship the item.    You can actually log into Dell.com and ask for them to email you for each step they go through. If you didnt set it up to send you notification emails about each step, then they will just send you an email when they ship the  item.     It should take about 5 days to build your computer. Then they box it and ship it. It should take about 1.5 weeks for it to reach your door. You will need to be home to intercept the box.    By the way, after they build your computer, they have to add the programs. Then they go through a testing phase to make sure your computer is running fine. They are all part of the building process. It takes at most 5 days to build your PC, but if you got the basic computer without any options, then it would take only a few days to receive your computer since the computer was probably good to go. If you added tons of hardware and options to your computer, they take their time building it.|`|AA11384708	Mine took 12 days back in Dec 2004.|`|4f35db7518aa8cd4b0cfe0de6a1f3242aa	They build each PC as soon as the order in confirmed.

I currently run a system with XP and Fedora (in fact, two linux kernel versions) and GRUB works just fine choosing between the three.

The others will run under that and share system resources.  The big one is RAM.  Make sure you have enough to support both because they really need to have exclusive use of the part you allocate for the virtual systems.

AA12042975	I had this problem before where I would click on a file and it opened up my IE browser instead.    Go to any folder, then go to TOOLS then FOLDER OPTIONS. Then go to the FILE TYPES tab and make sure your C drive is not opening the search window instead of the normal open activity it should be doing.    The other way is to do a system restore. Go to START then PRograms then Accessories. Go to System Tools and then System Restore.

It could may be as a result of your system being somehow corrupted (but not necessarily) which affects how you normally load the my computer. I f you can open all the other programs folders without experiencing this problem them probably your my computer program (not icon) is corrupted.
AA12042975	Thats a really vague questions since STRUTS is a whole Class of its own for JAVA development. You can get most of the information at http://java.sun.com or just go directly to:    http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalA...    You can download free servers and example class files to set up struts in your server. I recommend using jakarta tomcat to get started.    For a little background information, STRUTS is an architecture used in JAVA development. It uses action classes and java beans in their development. Knowledge on jsp pages, java beans, and xml is recommended.

Once you're in the printer setup dialog, you will have to find the location of the printer on the network.  From this same setup screen, you can do a search.

Too much of stimulation to our eyes and ears through multimedia devices such as the television and computers.    This explains that whenever we are sitting down quietly, we feel agitated and bored with everything else in the real world and we tend to seek for more stimulation from the computer or televisions.    I would suggest you to take a walk at the park and have some fresh air. Perhaps sitting down by the beach or play some sports with friends. Life will be much better.    There is so much need to feed that thirst for meaning in life. Do you find life meaningful? If not, then it's time to change and it's our choice to make.     Let's make it happen! :)

I have only found ONE program that doesnt deal with the servers that limewire and the rest use. try using Soul Seek. but that program only deals with music. you can also try morpheus. It uses the same servers but most of the time it will come up with more then Limewire or the rest. Kazza, bearshare, shareaza, and most of them have alot of adware with them. the three that I have said dont have nearly as much adware as the rest. and if something has gotten past me I will be shocked....|`|AA11397536	Emule, bittorrent?|`|AA11942868	frostwire|`|AA11348333	i use ares it is very fast and has a lot of good stuff.also in limewire check out the programs and get limewire pro,just dont try to update it when you see the new version flashing on the bottom of your screen|`|571f9bff80578f8bc9562c6a21675ffbaa	if your just looking for software and operating systems then FILEHIPPO is very good.|`|e6f783679fc0d5d4feb3e022e2ce6515aa	use bit lord or bit comet to share files. you can use these to download torrent files as well.

They will not be available after you shut your computer down in step 2. <br>  Click Start, click Shut Down, and then, in the drop-down list, click Shut down. <br>  In the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click Restart, and then click OK. <br>  When you see the message Please select the operating system to start, press F8. <br>  Use the arrow keys to highlight the appropriate safe mode option, and then press ENTER. <br>  If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot system, choose the installation that you need to access using the arrow keys, and then press ENTER.<br>   Notes<br>  <br>  In safe mode, you have access to only basic files and drivers (mouse, monitor, keyboard, mass storage, base video, default system services, and no network connections). You can choose the Safe Mode with Networking option, which loads all of the above files and drivers and the essential services and drivers to start networking, or you can choose the Safe Mode with Command Prompt option, which is exactly the same as safe mode except that a command prompt is started instead of the graphical user interface. You can also choose Last Known Good Configuration, which starts your computer using the registry information that was saved at the last shutdown. <br>  Safe mode helps you diagnose problems. If a symptom does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and minimum device drivers as possible causes. If a newly added device or a changed driver is causing problems, you can use safe mode to remove the device or reverse the change. <br>  There are circumstances where safe mode will not be able to help you, such as when Windows system files that are required to start the system are corrupted or damaged. In this case, the Recovery Console may help you. <br>  NUM LOCK must be off before the arrow keys on the numeric keypad will function.<br>  <br>  Also try this site<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.spywareremove.com/removeWinAntiSpyware2007.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spywareremove.com/removeWinAn...</a>|`|7f5267cf4b666bdba925e80510f05ac6aa	WinAntiSpyware Removal Information: <br>  <a href="http://bluecollarpc.net/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=197" rel="nofollow">http://bluecollarpc.net/phpbb2/viewtopic...</a><br>  <br>  INSTALL, UPDATE, FULL SCAN..... <br>  <br>  Ad-Aware [working-freeware, personal use - and premium version]<br>  <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaw...</a> <br>  <br>  OR  <br>  <br>  Microsoft AntiSpyware is now Windows Defender <br>  [working-freeware from Microsoft] <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security...</a><br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  SUPERAntiSpyware [working-freeware, and premium version]<br>  <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a>|`|rPDxIpcSaa	it will never fully uninstall, just do this<br>  Start<br>  Run<br>  msconfig<br>  startup tab<br>  find winantispyware<br>  and uncheck the box<br>  it will not start up again.|`|b92ed6ec66e5f947f15f4122686a6bc0aa	WinAntiSpyware is indeed a rogue virus program which is mostly ineffective at detecting and removing malware, which is usually marketed like something this:<br>  <br>  "Many may have been surfing the net, going through mail, or just working on the internet when a popup like the ones below appear out of nowhere.

Die Polung des Kabels ist an dieser Stelle egal. Die beiden Adern dürfen danach aber keinen Kontakt untereinander haben: Isolierband verwenden!<br>  <br>  In der Regel gibt es auch im PC-Fachgesch?ft nicht einfach mal so derartige Ersatzteile. Das Kabel gibt es nicht als einzelnes Ersatzteil, sondern nur mit Schalter dazu. Preislich liegt das wohl so zwischen 2 und 5 Euro.<br>  Gibt es bei dir in der N?he einen Conrad (Elektronik-Fachgesch?ft, oder im Internet unter conrad.de), da kriegst du so ein Schalter mit Kabel garantiert. <br>  Wegen der Einbaugr??e solltest du den Schalter aus der Geh?use-Front herausbauen und zum Vergleich mitnehmen.<br>  <br>  Für weitere Fragen kannst du mir auch noch ne Mail schreiben.

Click here to download the zipped Free Turbo C Compiler.<br>     2. Go to where you downloaded the file, and double click on the self-extracting file (turboC.exe) in Windows to extract it. This will bring up a WinZip Self-Extractor window (you do NOT need WinZip installed on your machine).<br>        By default, this will extract the files to C:\tctemp directory. You may designate a different location.<br>        Hit return to extract the files.<br>     3. Exit the WinZip Self-Extractor window (by hitting return twice).<br>     4. Once the files have been extracted, go to the directory c:\tctemp (or wherever you put the unzipped files), and double click on the file called install (it may be called install.exe).<br>     5. This will step you through the installation.<br>            * Hit enter to start the installation<br>            * Select the drive where the unzipped file are. The default is "A", so you should enter "C".<br>              Then hit return.<br>            * Hit return, again. This installs from the directory, \tctemp.<br>            * Hit return, again. This says to Install Turbo C on a Hard Drive.<br>            * Use the Up/Down arrow keys (hit the up arrow once) to select Start Installation, and then hit return, again.<br>            * At this point, the v2.01 Turbo C compiler is installed in C:\TC. That is where the tcc.exe executable is. <br>     6. That's everything, but you must add C:\TC to your executable search path. The easiest way to do this:<br>            * Bring up an MS-DOS window.<br>            * Position the cursor on the title bar of the MS-DOS window and right-click.<br>            * This pops up a menu. Click on Properties.<br>            * At the top of the window, click on the Program folder.<br>            * In the middle field, labeled Batch file:, enter the following:<br>  <br>                      C:\tctemp\init.bat<br>  <br>              (This assumes that you unzipped the files into C:\tctemp.)<br>            * Click OK at the bottom of the window.<br>            * Close the MS-DOS window <br>  <br>     7. Now you're done! Try it out by creating a small C program and compiling it.<br>  <br>            * Bring up the MS-DOS window in the same way as you did above. (NOTE: You must close the first MS-DOS window.)<br>            * Type tcc and hit return. You should see a usage message. describing all the many compiler options.<br>            * Now create, compile, and run the Hello World! program. <br>  <br>  Refer this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.acms.arizona.edu/education/opti_583x/sample_code/downloadTC.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.acms.arizona.edu/education/op...</a>|`|4OJARZAHaa	ask your friends for setup, i am sure some of them might be having. once you get the setup you just have to run it.for downloading borland c++u may go to: <a href="http://dn.codegear.com/article/21751" rel="nofollow">http://dn.codegear.com/article/21751</a>|`|wlEZrn5Taa	plz run the setup.exe from the package that u have.<br>  it is very easy .|`|yYWd9tCfaa	run setup if available or paste the folder in programs in the drive with system info

Now...regarding how to go about making one....    ;) Myself, I believe what makes the BEST avatar is when the individual achieves a fairly-good in-depth self-portrait: I honestly worked HARD to CHOOSE the best options where mine WOULD be! :D    [I am honestly even MORE blue in my DL pic.]    Mine turned out to be an internal self-portrait combined with an external one--it looks like the sum of my self: philosophical, medical, all components considered, an image of the inadequately-breathing dead, a way of being honest with myself in regard to my overall health picture, a coping mechanism in its way [just like my nick, I think they make a good match]. ;)    I think that is the BEST way to reflect one's overall look, if one does in fact capture the WHOLE of one's *look*--looking outside AND INSIDE, the honest facts of their lives.    In that sense, I believe my avatar is a declaration that I am at peace with myself, my life, my fate, which is a gift I would wish for anyone on the path to happiness. :)      I think overall the avatar system is fun, light-hearted, and I actually appreciate the somewhat entertaining way to express my more macabre reality. ;)    I mean, where else can you find such a *cute* way to visually express that I have lost my ever-lovin' mind than that pic showing me there holding my head after it's gone and rolled off? ;)    I also appreciate that it gives ALL users the chance to sort through what they value, how they perceive themselves, how they wish to appear vs how they DO actually appear...what they hope to see in the mirror vs reality...whether they like ALL their components...whether they like THEMSELVES...key factors brought to light by your excellent question--THANKS! :D|`|412ea4c2a490937669f8ae1d21ba111faa	go to that yahoo website for avatars

They should be able to provide you with a copy on CD if you can prove to them your key is valid.

AA10811401	Sending e mails through a VPN tunnel adds latency and processing time to the process.   You may need to increase the timeout values to make this work.

Not a good use of bandwith, but if only a few remote clients it would work.  Exchange can have limit's set on email attachment size,  usually it is set at 5 MB. If you are not going through Exchange, it may be that your VPN tunnel has a limit on file size of emails as well.  I never looked into it personally for Windows, but I know Lotus notes has a program that limits email size in vpn environment, one can only assume that is the same.  Try breaking up the file to be sent or zipping it up.  If this is not possible, you may want to setup a FTP site or mail a copy on cd.
AA10811401	Usually the issue with this is that the DNS settings on your client aren't updated correctly.  If your client machines are looking for DNS at the OLD ip address, it would behave this way.      Update all the DNS settings (on static machines and on the DHCP stuff) to correctly reflect the DNS servers associated with your domain, reboot all the devices (or at least do a release and renew), and check the DNS zone file for artifacts (old records with the incorrect IP address on them...delete these if you find them).|`|7b6161dfbc80a01ed14c1d05944ab4a5aa	Are you using RDP or Term Svcs?

Hacking is a skill you learn yourself, other hackers will only hint you in the right ways. Also: hacking takes on average about 18 months to two years to learn...    Here's a good start...    Learn Python  Learn Java  Learn C/C++  Learn Perl  Learn LISP  Learn Html/Xhtml    Aquire/Learn to use Linux    Learn proper english cause "hackers" will only help people who aren't idiots. Also english is the most tech-rich language there is, so it will be easier to communicate with people who speak english as a second language.    Anything other than that... you find out for yourself...    Impatient, want to cheat? Download a program for cracking. Then find out you either left a huge footprint and can be traced. Or it's a virus meant to infect wannabes...    Ben, you cannot go to jail for cracking into someone's myspace. If hacking is done right it's actually easy to avoid going to jail.|`|00889e956125994544e9a2bba059c216aa	Dear Fellow Member,    This is a security risk that is obvious.

Finally I got this site, this place is a very nice community where we can share every thing online. And also about the leader board, I must tell it is great.

The cyber culture is growing, and it is about time that we find our club and that to a very different club, which is not a part of any big website house like the yahoo and google. This site am talking about has every thing that a cyber surfer ever wants.

AA10811401	Well, you can't.  At least not directly.      If this is really two MS Exchange e mail account, what you can do is take the contents of one and dump the contents out into a personal folders file on your local hard drive.  Then connect to the other inbox and you can move those messages in.  Then have the exchange administrator delete the extra mailbox and add an alias to the one you are keeping that matches the deleted box (so you get anything that comes in addressed to the other address).|`|77142ee6cba27ce882366ae991d4849baa	Not a problem.  If you're using Exchange, just go to tools, accounts (account settings) then double-click the Exchange settings.  Click advanced, then add whatever additional mailboxes you want to open.  You'll need permissions on those mailboxes, of course.  If you're not using Exchange, even simpler.  Just add the second account under tools, accounts.

AA10258196	No way... my husband works for one of the major soft drink companies as their I.T. guy.  One of their departments wanted wireless... he advised them it wasn't a good idea, but they insisted.  Now they are constantly saying they can't connect to the network or the internet.  He has no problem telling them I told you it's not a good idea.    I hope this helps.|`|AA10811401	Depends.    If you have a single wireless access point and everyone is using workstations and running normal desktop applications, this is a horrible idea.      If you have multiple commercial wireless access points where they are managed by a centralized WAP controller, it can work regardless of the number of users, but this is a lot more expensive.    Usually when folks ask this they are trying to avoid the expense of cabling and do it "on the cheap".  This would be the most horrendously expensive mistake you can imagine to attempt this if it is your motivation.  The small office/home office equipment would cause all your users to essentially share a single connection on a broadcast basis.  With that many nodes, on a single WAP, nothing would work very well....if at all.

AA10464818	Many make the mistake of believing that once they create a blog, people will immediately flock to it. As you said, there are millions out there so why would they visit your blog?    Here are some ways you can promote your blog    1. Create great content  everything starts with great content. Think 'Linkbait" -- or writing about stuff that would be so great that people will want to link to you. It can be a news hook where you write about something that is contrary to what everyone else is saying; resource hook where you have the only information available or humor hook. Learn more about creating linkbaits in the source I gave below    2. Update the content regularly  make your visitors come back again and again to your blog by providing daily updates (even multiple posts per day!)     3. Submit your blog to blog directories such as Blogdigger http://www.blogdigger.com/add.jsp  and Bloogz http://www.bloogz.com/man_en/add_your_ur... among others    4. Network with other bloggers  comment on their blogs, read and link to other blogs and request them to link back to you     5. Email other bloggers  pitch your post to other bloggers and hope that they will link or mention your blog     6. Use techniques to showcase your blog  examples include meme games such as the Daily Meme http://thedailymeme.com/ or carnival such as the Carnival of Entrepreneurship hosted by About.com http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/entrep...    7. You can try pay per click programs such as Google Adwords http://www.google.com/adwords or Yahoo Search Marketing http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com  though the key is to carefully track your ROI and which keywords actually perform well    8. Make sure your blog is indexable by the search engines - and make sure that your titles have great keywords that your target audience are most likely to use    9. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News.     http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html  http://i-newswire.com/  http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/  http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/...  http://www.pr.com/press-releases  http://www.prfree.com/  http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index...  http://www.theopenpress.com/  http://www.przoom.com/  http://www.prweb.com  http://www.newswiretoday.com/  http://www.free-press-release.com/    10. Submit articles with your blog posts. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.

However, you can read that the size of an e-mail is 15kB which means mail headers, text, graphics all sum up 15 kB. Regularly, one character is one byte. Actually, an e-mail is indeed stored as a file (or in a file) too on the web server, or locally, on your computer.    1 kB = 1024 B  1 mB = 1024 kB  1 gB = 1024 mB (which actually means that 1 gB = 1024*1024*1024 bytes)|`|AA11123515	15 kilobytes=  15000 bytes|`|0e4a51cb7db3d342fac698d9802c8642aa	a bit is a 0 or 1, that's why is called binary system, a byte is a set of 8 bits (not in all of the OSs), a KB is 2^10 = 1024 bytes, therefore 15KB = 15*2^10 = 15,360 bytes or 122,800 bits, so you can save up to 15,360 characters in 15 KB

AA10891893	Any computer regardless whether laptop or desktop, can be used as a server for a home LAN.    However, a server normally needs to be powered ON for a very long time. Therefore the temperature of the CPU (computer processor) needs to be cool all the time.     By design, a laptop gets hotter faster if compared to a desktop. That's why it is not recommended for a laptop to be used as a server for a home LAN.|`|1264b506745bcf7ed0d4b0f5644d6066aa	Yes it can...    But be aware that if you set up your home LAN with laptop serving as a server, than your laptop isn't portable since you'll have ISP service hardware hanging out the back.    What is more advisable is to hook a desktop to a LAN and have the laptop connected by wireless.        These days, wireless LAN is the way to go.  If you do this, you don't actually NEED a server. You can usually do 99% of what you want without a dedicated server (which is the perferred way to go).|`|5d2ca279139390066a1caa9d1baefe2baa	you can do this   you conncet the ethernet cable to the back of the router on the port that is marked ethernet then you take the other end of the cable to the ethernet card on on the back of your pc you conncet it to the port marked ethernet     then you conncet the other cable to the back of the ruter port that is marked DSL then you take that cable to the modem box conncet it to the port marked on the modem  marked DSL   then you conncet the modem  cable box to your phoneline box  conncet the power cable to the router and put the power on   now you put in the cd driver that came with your router  and you install the network drivers  now you need to set up a network id & password on the router  you will be told how to do all that when you install the drivers & software for the router  when you have install the drivers and software fo r the router   your need to restart the pc  when your back at the desktop  you will see a network icon in the taksbar by the pc time  if it has a red X on it right click it and click on enable   if you dont see a network icon in the taskbar   click on start/control panel  click on   network and internet connections   icon  then click on network connections icon   now right click the  local Area connection   icon and click on properties  tick the box   show icon in notification ares when connected  tick the box  notify me when this connection has limited or no connectivity    now click on   then authentication tab at the top    tick the box   enable IEEE 802.1x authentication for network  tick the box   authenticate as computer when infomatiion is available   then right click   local Area connection  and click on enable  now your router internet will log online with in 45 seconds  when your router is online you conncet your phoncable to the modem  marked   phone    now when your router is online     then you need to get in the router home page and click on the wireles lan icon   and you set up a network id for the laptop   and a security wpa key not a wep key dont use that one use wpa key   then you put a wireless usb adapter on the laptop you install the network drivers on the laptop for the wireless usb  then you click on the network icon in the taskbar by the time on the laptop right click on it go to properties then you click on view wireless networks then you click on advanced tab you put in the network id and security key that u set up on the router home back then you click apply & ok then you click on view wireless network's your see your network id click on that then click on conncet       if you have a wireless card in the laptop just     click on the network icon in the taskbar by the time on the laptop right click on it go to properties then you click on view wireless networks then you click on advanced tab you put in the network id and security key that u set up on the router home back then you click apply & ok then you click on view wireless network's your see your network id click on that then click on conncet     if your network cuts out at any time just right click the network icon  by the pc time  and click on repair  that is on the 2 computers you can do this then windows xp will repair the   network for you and it dont take long at all   if you cant set that up   your be better off if you get you (isp)server to help you set all that up|`|AA10620539	sure any computer can server as a server.    enjoy

Unless you understand what they are, how they work, why they are used etc then STAY AWAY!    HD partitions can be the cause of lots of frustration and data loss.

Print them out, read through and familiarise yourself with the principles and the process. When you feel 100% ready, do it.    Incidentally, if you are planning to use more than one OS on the same HD you will need a boot loader program (which tells the motherboard what partition to boot from).

If the PC does not share any files, it will not show up - Basically the other PCs will ignore computers that offer nothing.    Also, check your firewall - Add each networked PC to the trusted zone if you use zonealarm.    To access them by IP you need to have fileshares OR a webserver running. Windows explorer will not access 'nothing' because there is nothing to access ;)    netstat probably won't show anything if your firewalls are not configured correctly.

You cannot just connect to MSN servers and ask "Hey am I blocked?" - IT doesn't work like that - Otherwise blocking would be pointless wouldn't it!    J

dILqe7nBaa	There is not really a way to uninstall Windows 7. The procedure to remove Windows 7 depends on the computer system at hand. Was Windows 7 installed as another operating system in a multi-boot environment or as the only operating system? Is there data on the Windows 7 partition that needs to be backed up because it is still needed? The easiest solution to uninstall Windows 7 would be to simply erase the data on the partition and join that partition again with another one or directly install a new operating system on it. Here is a quick guide what you should consider when uninstalling Windows 7.

m13Se2dAaa	Step-by-step doesn't make it look too easy, but it really is. I don't know what system you are using, so here are instructions for Vista and XP...    From the font site, click on download. Choose Save, not Open. Save it some place you can find it on your computer (like your desktop).    Find the downloaded file on your computer. If it's a zipped file (.zip, .rar, .sit) you will need to unzip it before you can do anything else.     WINDOWS VISTA UNZIP: double-click on the zip to open it, then either click on "Extract all files" or drag and drop the files somewhere outside the zip window.    WINDOWS VISTA INSTALL: Select the font files (.ttf or .otf ) from within the Extracted Folder or where you dragged then right-click > Install    WINDOWS XP UNZIP: You should have extraction software already on your system - try right clicking on the file and selecting expand or extract if it is listed. Have it extract to where you are or where you can find it.     If you do not have those choices, you need to download software - there are many free applications. I really like ExtractNow. It's basically Unzipping for Dummies ;-) Here is a link to a safe download from CNet. http://www.download.com/ExtractNow/3000-... It is free. It is easy to install. Once it is installed, you just launch it, drag your zipped folders into it and click Extract. It's great because you can extract multiple files at once.    WINDOWS XP INSTALL: Go to your fonts folder. Either through the start menu > control panels > fonts (make sure you are using Classic View for the control panels - it's much easier). OR go to My Computer > Drive C > Windows > Fonts. Drag the new fonts (just the ttf/otf files) from the extracted folder or wherever they are into the fonts folder. A box should pop up showing that the font is being installed.    FOR VISTA OR XP: If the download was just a single .ttf or.otf file, skip the extracting steps and go straight to installing.    The font should now show up in the font list of all your programs. If you have any programs running you will need to quit and restart them before they see the newly installed font. Worse case scenario - if the fonts aren't showing up, restart the computer.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Windows programs use the fonts that are installed in Windows - you don't install fonts to programs.    Open My Computer (in Vista it's called Computer) - it's on the desktop.  Go to C, then to Windows, then to Fonts.  Put the font file in there (drag&drop or Copy/Paste, however you put files where you want them).  It'll install.    Then open a program and it'll be able to use that font.|`|ezcaRxLtaa	I've written a tutorial about installing more fonts specifically for users of Photofiltre.

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.    First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.  http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...    2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:    1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.  5. Click OK.    3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:    1. Open your Start menu.  2. Click Run  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.  6.

It is (IMHO) the worst commercial virus checker/security program in the solar system - probably the galaxy.|`|V2nLbZZ5aa	Marvin is right, when Norton AVP is performing a scan, your laptop will slow down.  To see if it is running, start Task Manager (CTRL-ALT-DEL and then select Task Manager) and go to the Processes Tab.  Scroll down the list and look for Rtvscan.exe.  If it is running you will see the CPU number at something larger than 0.  Unless you are performing manual scans on a regular basis then you should let this finish.    If this is not the problem, then you have some other process that is slowing down the computer.  Run the virus scan after a Live Update and see if you have a Trojan horse or a virus.  If not, run a Malware program to see if you have Spyware or some other problem making your computer bog down.    The next step is to check for System level errors in the Administrator Tools section of Control Panel to see if there is a process bombing, look in the Error Log.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Likely, Norton Antivirus is being the resource hog that it is.

Since you are considering it combined with the Dell Inspiron, I have to tell you that you should buy neither.

Goto http://www.sig9.com  Then click Articles  Look for an article about Concurrent Remote Desktop sessions.    Follow those instructions (be warned you have to use safe mode and only be in a workgroup - NOT a domain) and you can actually have Windows XP hosting multiple desktop sessions at the same time instead of booting off other users. Also once done, you can remote control other users sessions so you can see and interact with their desktop (WinXP can either prompt them for permission or automatically give you access depending on settings in group policy editor).    Alternatively, RealVNC is another good alternative, but the user on that PC must run it when you need them to.  Personally, RealVNC is ok for modem connections but I prefer Remote Desktop if I need to login to an un-manned PC. RealVNC is good if there is a user at the terminal and RealVNC is already installed but otherwise...    There are also some other programs such as GotoMyPC though I don't think they are free.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.    Please dont tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.    None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure   your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter,   add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.    Several times each day, YouTube shuts down some of their   servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time.   That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios:   bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few   hours or by the next day.    If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet   files" and RAM (often times called "cache") are brimming to   the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result   being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to   a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way;   or C) never even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in   a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them -- or "clear your   cache" of "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history".  Then reboot.    Note 1: if you have Google Web Accelerator (or something  similar to it), dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   -- do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,   even though this contradicts all my advice. Not only does it   conflict with YouTube, simply clicking on "Don't Accelerate   This Website" will not help you whatsoever.    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "solutions"   have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of stupid   answer is:....[my paraphrase] "Although you can't watch or   access videos properly, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a peculiar fix that once worked for me was altering   the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|FTvkahKWaa	Try refreshing the webpage    or...    Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.    or..    It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.

zorYTX59aa	The only way it can "switch" is if it "stopped" loading your video,  and "started" LOADING a brand new video from scratch. Is that  what actually happened? There would have thus been a notable  time difference or "lag" between the 2.     Or is it possible that you were watching a "prank" video - where   the "scene" changed in the middle of the video?

dkpIjt5jaa	The rule of thumbs for protection is to not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Spyware / Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security) as there is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.    And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      P.S.: In your case, if you run Avira free, you should add an Email scanner - Here are two choices: http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    A host-based IPS (HIPS) is one where the intrusion-prevention application is resident on that specific IP address, usually on a single computer. HIPS complements traditional finger-print-based and heuristic antivirus detection methods, since it does not need continuous updates to stay ahead of new malware. As ill-intended code needs to modify the system or other software residing on the machine to achieve its evil aims, a truly comprehensive HIPS system will notice some of the resulting changes and prevent the action by default or notify the user for permission.    Extensive use of system resources can be a drawback of existing HIPS, which integrate firewall, system-level action control and sandboxing into a coordinated detection net, on top of a traditional AV product. This extensive protection scheme may be warranted for a laptop computer frequently operating in untrusted environments (e.g. on cafe or airport Wi-Fi networks), but the heavy defenses may take their toll on battery life and noticeably impair the generic responsiveness of the computer as the HIPS protective component and the traditional AV product check each file on a PC to see if it is malware against a huge blacklist. Alternatively if HIPS is combined with an AV product utilising whitelisting technology then there is far less use of system resources as many applications on the PC are trusted (whitelisted). HIPS as an application then becomes a real alternative to traditional antivirus products.
D5Asu04eaa	Hi,       Why you are investing money ??? the main purpose is to share file between computers ...well its a very simple solution     You can share any thing between all computer ..You make one computer as a sharing hard disk ..by turning on file sharing feature on one computer hard disk ..you can choose any drive or even folder and some time single file ..User can read,,copy,,delete,,and save file..folders..and other stuff on that shared hard disk drive..folder..whatever you share.   Just after Turing on sharing make sure that your forward PORT 139 both UDP ..and TCP from your router setup page..by going to 192.168.1.1 in IE or may be your router have another IP to access setup ..    So how to turn it one just follow the simple file sharing step stated on the link below  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1549    And other cool way to share file or even desktop etc is to install    TEAM VIEWER    www.teamviewer.com    its free and amazing :) ..Its work even behind routers      Regards,    Qasir

	Unfortunately for you, any music that is not your creation and which   is used in your video is considered "copyright infringement". The big   music/media corporations such as UMG, Warner and Viacom don't  just "own" their music, they also own the "rights" to them, including  how and where "their music" can be publicly presented.    Thus, they're apparently 100% within their rights to claim the music   in your video as their own -- especially if you have not paid them for   "licensing fees", "distribution rights", "royalties", and/or "expressed   written permission" to use and "broadcast" their music on YouTube.    Even if you gave credits to the song, the artist and/or the label, that  should never be construed as an excuse or justification for you (and   really YouTube) to "break the law". You could contest their "muting"  trying to claim that your video is for "personal use" only, but the big  corporation lawyers could ask some intriguing questions of you like  A) why did you upload your vid to YouTube; B) why did you, in their  minds, rip off "their music"; and C) how did you acquire that music?   Even if you bought it legally (and can prove it!), that does not entitle   you to, in their eyes, "distribute" it illegally for free -- or to have your   video potentially come across as though you may be a commercial  agent or official representative of theirs. It may not be your intention,   but for the copyright owner, you may be involuntarily defaming them,  the music or the artist. And if they did not object to your video or do  anything about it, it could be perceived that they "officially" endorse   you, or that you are a part of them.    If you know of other vids using the same music, either YouTube will  take them down eventually, or someone who's jealous will flag them.  If you're willing to take the chance and re-upload your video with the   same music, do not write the name of the song or artist in your title,  description, or tags. Also avoid irrelevant phrases like "no copyright   infringement intended", "I do not own the music" or "I don't take any   credit for this song". The upload servers at YouTube actively search   for words and sentences like that. As well, it also reaffirms that you   have knowingly taken, used, copied or maybe even stolen someone   else's copyrighted material.    You should also consider the fact that the music-recording industry   is starting to use hidden "watermarks" or "fingerprints" buried within  their music, in order to uncover and identify their illicit use. As such,   it is possible that no matter how many times you try to upload your   video, it may always be rejected because of "copyright infringement".  You would thus be better off trying to find a different recording of the   music you want to use. If you've noticed that other videos are using   the exact same music, those videos were probably uploaded before   this new technology really started coming into being.    The only possible exception to everything that I've just written above   is for you to use music that is shorter than 30 seconds. If you listen   carefully to any talk-show on radio or TV, they will never use or play  other people's music for longer than 30 seconds when introducing a   guest or going into/out of commercials. Can you guess the reason?  (Hint: it has to do with "licensing fees" and "royalties".)    I hope my info has been helpful to you.|`|FTvkahKWaa	maybe get the tune from youtube and use it in your video.. might just work..    quite a lot of samples tunes on utube.. do a search at youtube    this will help you...Use 'zillatube'.

f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	It depends what you want to use the net book for    I have the Linux version (actually its a stripped down version called Linux lite or Linpus) I have only used Windows before and was a bit disappointed at the Linux screen, it is very basic, and you can't even put your own wallpaper on it, but after a couple of months I would not change it even for another Linux system.    Why?    You don't have to wait for all the different drivers to load, for your settings to sort themselves out. On my machine I press the power button and have a working desktop in 15 seconds. Within forty seconds I am wirelessly connected to the net with an open browser.    I bought the net book because it is small and portable, I wanted to do what most people do on the net, and have some basic word processing and spreadsheet functions. It is brilliant for that.    The XP version has a disk and hard drive, but you will not get the start up speed of the Linux, you will have the ease of use of windows, but also the drawbacks with viruses etc.    There are lots of hacks to change the Linux machine, its quite easy to get it to look like a windows machine, running Ubantu (another Linux system) but you just make that start up slower.    So it just depends what you want, do you want a windows machine trying to be a laptop but not quite having the power to do much, or do you want a true net book, which you can have up and running in seconds, is more robust than the windows machine because it has no disk drives, and costs considerably less, or do you want the comfort of what you are used too?|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	The question I would have to ask is, have you ever used a Linux operating system before?

Are you prepared to read some instructions and tutorials on how to setup, install programs, configure the system and customize it, and use the computer, then linux will work for you.

h05EEJTvaa	Well, people see others get famous through viral videos and decide that they'd like to do the same thing. Same goes for people on myspace (bands especially).

The best way round this is to use anti-virus software and a firewall - the firewall acts as a barrier for anything trying to access the computer through the network or internet, which is the first step to stop viruses.  My advice is disconnect from the internet - physically unplug. Then use antivirus software to scan your computer and delete any viruses, then make sure windows firewall is enabled (control panel -> windows firewall) and reconnect to the internet.  After that, I suggest you download Zonealarm Free firewall - its much better than windows firewall.    If the damage factor is low, then the virus you have won't matter too much, but you'd best get rid of it.    Good luck.

The only pc building done here is putting together specialist bits to make a PC that has different performance to the norm but as all the parts are modular its a piece of cake to build them its the testing and fault finding thats more difficult.    If you just want to do it by yourself or locally you would never make any money at it and its not a job with any future.|`|2Q2ltt1Saa	Most jobs that would involve building systems involve other issues (troubleshooting, testing, etc.).  A degree in computer science or information technology would be best.  A+ or similar certification is also a good thing.    The places that would hire for this are gneerally smaller computer stores.  You'd probably make $20-$30/hr as a tech at one of those.    For just getting into the market, you could possibly try something like Geek Squad at Best Buy to learn some of the basics with training; you'll make a lot less and it's not enough on its' own, but you'd at least get an idea of what all can go on with a job of that nature.|`|n2HaCqHwaa	To some extent you can train yourself how to service computers.

55bf6fa59b448b11d25247005497227faa	Easiest way (if allowed - I'm assuiomg this is a assignment?) is to use a .ini file.    Then you can create sections - You can keep a count of how many students are in the file, then you can loop through them when reading and writing using names like 'student1', 'student2', 'student3', 'student4' and read their data accordingly.    This is something I did in one of my programs - Admittedly it isn't a preferred method for some reason (I don't know if there are size limitations to ini files). Most programmers prefer using a file and saving it in that format.. however hell breaks loose when you add a new data section into your program and it tries to read a section of data in the file which doesn't exist.    I would recommend using a ini file - then you can index records and keep track of them like that. It makes it a lot easier - even if ini files are supposed to be used for initialisation settings..

1ISOS9Yxaa	The type of VRAM (like DDR) does not matter. The only thing you really need to worry about when upgrading a video card is the type of expansion slot you have.    It looks like your Dell Dimension 4500 uses an AGP 4x slot. Make sure that whatever video card you get is AGP, not PCI or PCI-Express, and you'll be just fine. They're quite simple to install.    Also, I wouldn't bother getting anything over $100, since your computer is dated. If you get anything high quality, the speed of your processor and the speed of your RAM will bottleneck your performance anyway, so you'll just be wasting money, unless you plan on using it to upgrade the next computer you buy.|`|oVz0fde6aa	Go with the Radeon 2600 PRO video card, it will work.

It is my understanding that Linux is a fairly stable OS, i would make sure you know what you are doing and try again.    Good luck!    -Shamar|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Boot the PC from your windows XP installation CD. Choose the "Repair" option on the first screen that comes up. You should be put into the Recovery Console - you may have to log in at this point.    Once you get a command prompt type:    fixmbr    and press enter. This rewrites the MBR on the hard drive, overwriting the GRUB or LILO boot loader.    Then type    exit    and press enter (take the CD from the drive now). All being well, the computer should now boot straight into XP. You can then use the disk management tool to delete the Linux partitions from your drive.    If you need to change partition sizes after that, boot from a Linux Live CD (such as Ubuntu - I recommend the 8.04.1 version) and run the GParted tool from the command line. GParted is a free open source partition editor with similar function to Partition Magic, and it comes with most Linux distributions.|`|CKE9oLlZaa	I would search google for easier answers but I know there are lots of live versions of linux that can be used to partition drives and delete from them too.

How ridiculous.   Right Click and should be a Control Panel/Settings thing.  The IE7 update has to have that off because it has phone home program written into it, its not a bad program, just the company wants to know where you go on the net and how long you stay.

What you will find is that 'officially' wages go up (along with taxes, inflation and the cost of living) and thus we all apparently have more money to spend on these things which is supposed to make them seem cheaper than before. You ever hear people say something like "I saw this and it was ONLY $$$ so I thought I'd get it". Thats becoming a very popular statement at the moment - especially with credit becoming easier for most people to obtain.    In reality prices do not actually drop as quickly as we are lead to beleive. It's becoming very complex to find a real bargain these days..    J

You should also be able to click a link on the auction page that shows you the "you won this item" that says something like, item not received. Once you open a dispute, Ebay will contact the seller and either he sends you the item or refunds your money. DO NOT close the dispute until he has either sent it and you have it in your hands or you have your refund. If you close it before then just because he says he will do whatever...sent or refund, and he doesn't, you cannot reopen the dispute.

1b67e4f7cb17697c024343f115f3dbf6aa	The Basic Input/Output System (or BIOS for short) contains basic information your computer needs to start up to a bare minimum. Apart from the clock, settings about what is plugged into the Primary Master/Slave and Secondary Master/Slave IDE cables are stored. This is where information about your hard drive, CD/DVD drive and zip drives are kept.    When you reset your motherboard's BIOS settings, you reset this information too. Most are set to automatically detect what's there and go with it, but older motherboards don't have that feature.    To reset the settings to a better state, start up your computer and press Del, F2 or whatever key you are told to press while it's running through the memory test. This will enter the BIOS screen. From here, find anything to do with hard drives or IDE. Where you go depends on the type of motherboard you have. There is usually an option to auto-detect the drives, and this should be used where possible. If you cannot auto-detect, you must enter the details by hand, which is where an engineer usually gets called. This can be tricky if you don't know what it is.    Pressing Esc should get you back to the main menu where you can save the settings and exit. This hopefully will make your computer work better. Of course, there are other settings you ought to set while you're in the BIOS, too.|`|7bf155bf4d96535735edbc8177aafa9baa	http://www.techtutorials.net/    http://www.techtutorials.net/cgibin/link...    http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarec...|`|AA10098742	yes your bios tells the computer where to look to boot from.  is this a new install? make sure the jumper configuration is properly set on the hard drive.    go into your bios and set your hard drive to be the boot device.     unplug any usb drives durring boot up.

It's a physically big game which requires many MB's of space on your hard drive. It isn't something that can just be played over an internet connection - It's too big due to the size of code involved.    The only thing you can do is bug the game and/or download the entire thing.

The only difference is the Celeron has a quirky issue with the cache - I beleive there is little or none. The Centrino has built in wireless support.    Other than that, they are more or less the same and will run the same code.

55bf6fa59b448b11d25247005497227faa	Ok, forget the first 2 answers, I see what you are saying.    You have a wired NETWORK card already installed and want to know why you should use a wireless card - correct?    Well the short answer is you don't. You don't HAVE TO use a wireless card to connect to your router. It's a matter of personal preference.    You might want to use a wire to your laptop which trails along the floor and has limited range. This is far securer because people cannot connect to your network and use your internet connection (assuming you turn off the wireless in your router).    On the other hand, you might want to use your laptop out in the garden, upstairs, in the garage, etc etc. However this is less secure because hackers can perform 'packet sniffing' and decrypt your data you are broadcasting. This means that they may be able to crack your WEP encryption key and then be able to connect to your wireless network at the same time as you and then use your internet connection.    As I stated above, it's a personal matter of choice. If you want the convenience of no wires, then go for wireless. If you only ever use your laptop in the same place (EG at a desk) then go with the built in wired network card and use a network cable instead.    There isn't any set rule for you should or you shouldn't. It's your choice based on what is most convenient for yourself.

Another possibility is a decider such as the max() function. The max() takes 2 numbers as inputs and generates the maximum of those two numbers as an output.    For example,     =max(3,7) would give you 7.    =max(-4,0) would give you 0.    You can use explicit numbers (as the above) or cell references or even formulae in place of one of the inputs. For example, suppose that cell A1 equals -2 and cell A2 equals -1. Then:    max(0,A1+A2) would be the same as max(0,-2+-1) = max(0,-3)    This would return the value 0 because the maximum of 0 and -3 is zero.    Good luck.

While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.    1. De-Fragmenting  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4.

You could be packed to the gills with no storage space left, and your computer would still run nicely... as long as your system is clean.    Another thing that WILL slow down your machine, is updated software.  What?  How can that be... say it isn't so...    Yes, it is true.  If you update windows regularly, it will slow down the machine.  Why?  Because the updated version of windows is designed to run on a newer machine.  XP installed, out of the box, in a state that matches it's original configuration from back in 2001/2002 will run much faster than XP runs now.    You can increase the amount of RAM your system has.. this will improve performance a little.  You can reinstall your OS fresh, and update windows completely, then just install the software you use.  This resetting of it will also improve performance a little.    Otherwise, this is just the nature of the beast.  A clean updated Windows XP, 2 years away from when it was new, will run slower than it did when it was new.|`|OB7WdDJHaa	No matter dear... Just follow these steps, do nothing more.  FREE SOLUTION:  REINSTALL OS IF POSSIBLE.  1. Run Disk Cleanup of each partition (C,D etc) regularly, it will delete unnessary files. I suggest u to download a free software for this purpose namely Ccleaner from www.Ccleaner.com  2. Run Defragmentation.  (ABOVE TWO TOOLS ARE PLACED IN START MENU/ALL PROGRAMS/ACESSORIES/SYSTEM TOOLS)  3. Free space as more as u can by deleting unnecessary stuff.  4. Run Antivirus scan frm up to date antivirus software.(viruses causes computer dull and slow.    SOLUTION NO. 2: Effective but need spend some money on ur comp.  1. Upgrade RAM (this will definitely speed up ur computer)  2. upgrade hard disk( if necessary)  3. check fans, specially processor fan, it must be okay.  Those are few and simple steps to speed up a slow computer.  Regards.

I use it all the time and I think it's a great job.    http://www.ccleaner.com/    Cheers.|`|2e0y0mYpaa	have you tried refragmenting it?|`|p4x41mu7aa	firstly get rid of files and documents you don't need. Then try disk cleaner, type it in search, finally use disk defragmenter. again, type it in search. restart your computer, and it should be a hell of a lot faster. And disk clean/defragment REGULARLY, preferably once a week.
nmRZqyeoaa	As other's have eluded to, you likely have some spyware/malware on your system.      I would recommend getting a few free scanners for this and letting them do a cleaning for you.  Also, you may want to look in to getting a software firewall that controls outbound traffic, which will help prevent something malicious on your machine from sending data out to the web.

This way, the old data will be deleted permanently and the space will be freed.|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	since it's cdrw, copy everything off the disc into a folder, and wipe the disc, then burn it back on with the stuff you want to add.|`|I6yyhbu2aa	I don't think you can if the disc is finalised, DVD Ram are the reusable discs as far as I know that is what I use to reuse|`|WaI693jHaa	No. That's why it's called "finalising".

Sounds like you are trying to hack someone elses Network.  If you don't have access to the router it isn't going to happen.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Usually just connect with a wire, browse onto the router and set a new wireless password.    Open a command window (Run,cmd) type in IPCONFIG /ALL, the address that appears under DEFAULT GATEWAY will be the internal address of the router.  Type that address into your browser window and you should be able to log on to the router, it may require username and password. Usually admin, admin - admin, password -or - admin with no password.  Then go to the wireless page and change the password to whatever you like.|`|N3AIS666aa	BT automatically sets the user name and password to admin for both. if you have changed the password then you'll will have to reset the router. usually by leaving it unplugged for a while (probably 24 hours) or if it does have one like the home hub press and hold the wireless association button on the back of the router for 30 seconds.|`|fda9e6822f8d69df64758f68a42873d0aa	If you mean the WEP or WPA password key for the encryption then this app will find it on your own computer if not then I'm sorry but cant think of a way for now:    http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_ke...

E5mFWOqqaa	For $200-$800, you aren't going to find a good laptop for gaming.    The issues with the one you linked to in regard to gaming are quite prominent:    1. It's made by Acer. It's not going to last for more than about 2 years.   2. It has a Pentium Dual Core processor. You should not buy a laptop that has a processor other than a Core 2 Duo or AMD Dual Core X2  3. It's $650 of crud. While it's got 4GB of RAM and a 320GB Hard drive, you're fitting all of that into $650. Considering that's a lot to fit into that price, there's something that's not up to par- which would be the processor and lack of a graphics card.  4. no graphics card. Integrated graphics should NOT be used for any type of gaming. Ever.     You're looking to game on a laptop that's not going to be able to handle any decent games. Your budget is not in the range of any gaming laptop, so you are not going to find a "gaming" laptop in that price range. They're upwards of about $1100 or so for a decent gaming laptop.|`|a9e88b188ab0a1b51ef63361e4bf7330aa	QVC had a nice laptop , a few days ago,for around 700-800 dollars on easy pay.....a dual core 3gb deal .

I'd go with this   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...   it has a really nice nVidia graphics card with 1gb of dedicated memory, a dual core processor, 4 gb of memory, and a 320gb hard drive. thats all for 800 after mail-in rebate. Definitely the best you will find for that price range. If you don't want this one, look at newegg.com, it usually has the lowest prices and its very reliable
55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	yes it is a memory problem add more memory though the printer should have memory in it to help out,     Is it a mixed photo copy? different pages? text and graphics or just text  if it is just text there should be no problems, Graphics takes up the memory
jHuIwZl8aa	Download AVAST. it is free and will not slow down your computer whatsoever. The good part of this software is that it scans as soon as you reboot and before logging to windows.  That is how a good anti-virus should work so that , when you do log to windows, the viruses are detected before and destroyed.    We have AVAST installed and it works flawlessly and you won't need other software for trojan or registry cleaner etc.....

E5mFWOqqaa	A 4400 mAh battery isn't very much- most are 5600mAh. To be honest, you are likely going to get about as much battery life in this 8-cell as you are a typical 6 cell (which is likely what is in your laptop now). For $80, it's not that great a bargain- unless your current battery is in terrible shape and could use replacing.     Plus, you're buying from ebay. They don't have to guarantee anything, and it could be a huge pain to get that "One Year Warranty" they are claiming. Plus, it may not even be new. When a typical battery like this would run about $125-$175, this one being $80 would cause me to be skeptical.|`|In3bWu6faa	you will get 8hrs battery life

DlGV1xv9aa	There are only 2 things you have to worry about. 1 is the slot type. Second is some video cards require power from the power supply, if this is the case, make sure your PS has a 6 pin connector for a video card. So DDR2 is fine. Oh and size shouldn't matter (I mean actual size of the video card) unless your looking at a huge video card.

tbXKXcZsaa	You will need to re-create the e-mail account so you can confirm the deletion of the myspace account. You may need to wait a few (usually 6) months before the email provider will allow the same screen name to be used again.  Just make the account the exact same as before, then sign in to myspace and select the delete account option.  You should then receive the confirmation email.  OH OH!!!!  You can also change the email you use to sign in to the account, so if you have another active email, just do that.

(Why are you even on here if your 10?)  ______________________________________...    Dear Einstein,        I know for a fact, you've made this video on Window's Movie Maker!  You should check in your documents, to check the file format, you need the smallest file format you can get.  (Ex.   .avi  .mov  .mpg) In the version you have, you can't just click on the top "Save as"  or  "Save" button, this will save it as an "edit-able" Version.    To save it as a finished video, in the side panel of options, scroll down and click "Save to my computer"  It will take a while to save, but eventually it will be done.    Save it as something you will remember, because it is this file you need to upload!    On youtube follow the regular steps, (ex.  Title, description, Tags, ect.)    If the message still appears, you should upload your video to a helping website, such as:  http://www.download.com  OR  http://www.media-convert.com    If again it doesn't work, it may possibly be a virus.  If so download some virus pretection!  OR  Try downloading from another location!    I hope I helped,  Regards!  -Nicole S|`|LJkPRqN0aa	it could be that your converter isnt the right one to put on youtube, OR if your video is too long they also wont accept it..|`|MxculX2Daa	Convert the video to some compatible format before you send it.  You need to make sure it is a common video format for example:  .avi  .mov  .mpg    If it is a Windows Movie Maker video you cannot upload in the native format so save it as a .avi before sending.    You might need to use a free video format converter off the web.  Go to www.download.com or www.tucows.com and find a free one.|`|DYITvRutaa	Just Change The Format Of The Video, I Do It In Windows Movie Maker It Will Now Work On YouTube  There Is Lots Of Converting Software Out There Free Studio Manager Is A Grate One, Also Video X Converter Is Good  Hope I've Helped.

But what you are asking is not possible at least from my knowledge.
5NOLctPXaa	If you have your pictures in Photobucket, you can resize them right there. I find this the easiest way to resize. But making the scrollbox smaller with large photos in it will just make you scroll over and still not see the entire picture. I'd try resizing the pictures on photobucket.com

If no one cares about the things you post, you can't drive them to your site with a longhorn stampede.  There's no magic about it.    Having people put up links to your site helps - the more sites point to yours, the higher up you go in search engines - but people have to want to point to your site.  Or you have to have information that makes people post a link to your site for some reason.  "Hey, you won't believe what Elizabeth found out - read her blog" or "If you can find it anywhere, it's probably on Elizabeth's blog".    I'd say, from reading some of your site, that you're on your way - but the Alamo wasn't built in a day.  Give it time.

Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|bymTLEgYaa	u need convert video to wmv for example  i use VidCrop - supports all the video formats depending on video codecs installed, so VidCrop can easily work with avi, asf, mp4, mpg, mpeg, mov, wmv and others. Re encoded output video file would be avi or wmv and it will be controlled with width, height, frames per second and other codec properties.
zvwwfccUaa	You're never going to see perfect 5mb speeds over a compressed cable internet signal like that no matter what they advertise. And, you DEFINITELY will never see that speed over wireless.    Use a network cable and plug directly in to your router, and then run the speakeasy.net speed test (that site is my favorite speed tester). This will give you the most accurate reading of your internet speed.    Another thing to keep in mind is that if a lot of people near you (in your neighborhood, in your apartment building, wherever you are) are also using the internet, your speed will suffer.    If you are still getting slower speed ratings with your computer plugged directly in, reboot your cable modem and router by unplugging them for 10-15 seconds and then plug them back in. Run a speed test as soon as your back online and see what you get.    My solution? Get FIOS =) I have my own digital 20mb/5mb line, and I get 20mbps on nearly every speed test I run on speakeasy.net.|`|KpoR3MiQaa	You are not paying for 5mb    You are paying for UP TOO 5 MEGABITS    these are ploys used by the ISP's to make their services sound better    SO what you think is 5mb, the unit that all your files are stored in, it is actually 8 times slower (8 bits in a Byte)    Also it may be slower if you are in a built up or very rural area because of other people/old cables
7igxiGrAaa	1. Make sure that your website is ready (i.e. no broken links, has enough unique contents, etc). Optimize your website for keywords that are highly related with your website content.     2. Create a sitemap file for your website. Sitemap file is a formatted file with an XML extension. It contains the URLs for all of your pages in your website. You can use free online or offline tools available to generate your sitemap file.     3. Upload the sitemap file to your website root directory.     4. Go to Google Sitemaps website and log in using your Google account. Create if you don't have one. It is free.     5. Type your website full URL in the "Add Site" field on the top of the Google Sitemap page and click OK.     6. Click the "Add Sitemap" link on the right of your website name.     7. Choose "General Web Sitemap " on the "Choose Type" option list. Check all the checkboxes provided.     8. Type your full sitemap URL in the provided field and click "Add Web Sitemap" button.     9. Wait for about 2 or 3 days. Check Google by typing your website name in the search box. If it shows up in the result, it means that Google has indexed your website.

dkpIjt5jaa	Here is my technique on how to do a cleanup: a few tricks (and associated free programs) I use when helping friends with problems.    1) The Java Runtime Environment causes issues, you should use a free program I use myself called JavaRa to get the latest JRE and remove older versions. This will ensure the security of your computer and extra space on your hard disk is created. Find more information here: http://raproducts.org/javara.html and the download link here: http://raproducts.org/ ( Currently, JavaRa supports Windows Vista without UAC so if you have Vista and are not comfortable temporarily disabling it, don't use JavaRa )    2) Flush every single possible accumulated junk (cookies, cache, ETC) in ALL your browsers. As you browse the web, browsers stores information about the websites you visit. You should delete that information from time to time.     Here are methods for the two most popular browsers (IE 7 and Firefox 3):    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.    In Firefox, go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (in the future - about every two weeks for normal use of the internet - every week for heavy use):    In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then click Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do the following steps (in order)  1) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  2) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  Finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In Firefox, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes and then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: You should close your browser ( This is good for Internet Explorer and Firefox ) when you're done to clear cookies that are still in memory from your current browsing session.    For older versions of the same programs or for other browsers, check their help files for guidance on doing the cleanup.    3) Turn off the restore point utility.    Here is a guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and an article for Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows...    4) Install a free cleaner called Glary Utilities ( http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html ) to remove junk files and/or remnants of installs (there is always some) and use it in "safe mode" (for a better cleanup job).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my long time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).    5)  Defragment your drive with your choice of defragmenter (built-in, freeware or open source).    6) Turn system restore back on. ( the same guide and article given in part 3 )    ( A word of caution, with programs this powerful, be sure to read all instructions and help files completely so that you apply fixes correctly the first time ! )    NOTE: Make sure to download and install the very latest stable drivers for EVERYTHING and that they are for the correct OS (Don't use XP drivers on Vista and Vice versa - one exception would be if they are indicated for both OS) for a better overall computing experience.      I hope this will help guide you to a better working machine      Ciao    QD1956|`|IGJGUfjNaa	Load your computer into SAFE MODE(F8 or F6 during startup).

And your entire computer crashes when you do?    I would uninstall Firefox, then use Microsoft Internet Explorer to download a fresh copy of it and reinstall.    Additionally, when was the last time you ran your anti-virus program?  Browsers get infected, and when you boot them up they might be trying to load some malware software which is causing the crash.      I strongly recommend deleting all your temporary internet files (including most of your cookies) on a regular basis.  especially if you like browsing some of teh shadier corners of the internet.
2SSA9e9Naa	Reading binary data into memory is no different then reading text data. You read it into a variable as you have done above. when the read is complete rec will be populated with the data.    The change to your code would be    ifstream ifile("popdata.bin", ios::binary);  Emp rec[29];    for(int i=0; i   {  ifile.read(reinterpret_cast(&rec[i]), sizeof(rec[0]));  }    Each element of the array rec[0], rec[1], rec[2], etc. will have a different portion of the binary file    Note: an alternative to the above is:  ifstream ifile("popdata.bin", ios::binary);  Emp rec[29];  ifile.read(reinterpret_cast(&rec[i]), sizeof(rec));    Which will do the same thing in one read statement.    Make sense?

If you use neural networks your game can learn how to play after a while, you will teach your network by user actions, your network grows and your computer player will play perfectly.  you will need to learn your network before releasing the game but it would be get better and better later.    good luck...|`|ouvvS1Ylaa	i dont really know c++ but i know java.  i would make a class for your AI and then use a for loop for all the new cards.|`|wV9nMhqAaa	That's pretty complicated..from what I read you said that every card has a unique function and ability...thus you would need a class with several functions, each that define each card...You can "tag" each card in their definition according to what abilities they express.  After that, you would need to make a random generator to pick out a random set of cards...next you would need to build an engine that could determine what a certain set of characteristics (that you defined) mean to the game..

P8gGMlbIaa	I've heard the RIAA has been changing their tactic. They still want you to stop downloading music, but rather than suing you for a dollar amount they want to tell your ISP to shut off your internet access. Or at the very least slow it down. They call this filtering, and it's effects could be wider than just what you download. It might also effect your doings and dealings online, it threatens Net Neutrality.

mExwY8jYaa	Make sure the password is a complex password. Use capital letters and numbers (symbols if you want/they are allowed)  And look at this Microsoft article: http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yoursel...    I would recommend 8+ characters and a number (not on the end) or a capital letter (not in the beginning). These are strategies to avoid a Brute Force hack, which they could have used. Also, make the answer to your security question something completely absurd. Just make sure you remember your original password. You don't have to try all of these, its just these would be completely making sure you don't get hacked again. Also, do a virus scan, because they could hack you all over again if you have a keylogger on your computer.|`|b44WwAMsaa	share it with the world now.  whats your e mail and password?|`|KIlNIwTtaa	maybe change other settings as well|`|lutRDDjQaa	Make sure when you changed your password it was to something really weird, ie. it contained letters of different cases, numbers, special characters etc. Apart from that there isn't much else you can do apart from making sure your password isn't guessable and not giving it out. I guess you probably didn't do the latter and it is more likely that your account was cracked. It is hard to avoid hackers/crackers but with a difficult/not expected password it will take longer for someone to figure it out and they will probably move onto someone else's, they are only opportunists anyway.|`|rpbJ6i01aa	Make your password strong i.e numbers+letters..Case sensitive     Always Login at Gmail.com not from any other link given by someone.

9ECwMzZXaa	That is sufficient protection. Avira Antivir Personal is a firewall, antivirus, antispyware all in one, so that's good.    Also, you should turn ON automatic updates and download/install all the latest security patches form Microsoft. If not yet, i strongly recommend to upgrade to Service Pack 3 for Windows XP. You can do that from the Windows Update website.|`|LxMP5mYhaa	Not sure what your money situation is, but i would suggest this:    http://www.webroot.com/En_US/consumer-pr...    For complete protection.|`|tOCESHLYaa	Maybe it's enough depending on your internet habits. But it looks kind of thin to me. First Ccleaner is a file cleaning tool. Windows Advanced system Care Free is a tune up tool. It does have spyware cleaning and immunization. Still I don't consider it a security program.  Avira free does not have anti-spyware protection. So you should use firefox that will help with spyware. At the very least you should have windows firewall. There are better free two-way firewalls out there if you think you need one. Malwarebytes free does not have real time protection.  You may want to add a real time anti-spyware program, if you have problems with spyware and adware. But again if you use firefox you are probably ok.   Your current protection is on the low side. But if you have good internet habits it is probably enough. If you download music or other programs from P2P sites. Then you don't have enough protection.  At the very least add firefox, and Mcafee site advisor. A two way firewall if you go to sites like Limewire, or My space. Make sure all your programs are updated. Not only windows, but adobe flash, java, all third party programs.
Eyw2lfmIaa	you should be ok if you keep everything updated. this is what most people forget to do.

Here are my suggestions (and warnings) for free software (I tried all personally):    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not.     Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.       If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include anti-spyware and anti-adware protection so add an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and see below for adware scanning.    Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security) as there is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !|`|FBQZ06vraa	You could use a good firewall (I don't know if that Windows Advanced System Care has one), and the team of Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D.    That being said, the greatest anti-malware in the world won't do any good if it isn't kept up to date and used regularly.    Also, a monthly scan with Secunia's Online Site Inspector will help protect you. Run it in Thorough Inspection mode and be prepared to be shocked at what it finds.    And of course, Windows Update every month.    Hope that helps.

Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|7fd15b7507af7da3c6ae3fb710bbdd1aaa	Perhaps you should try using Windows Movie Maker to add music to your videos.

Yes, it is possible to fake MAC addresses.    If they're not in range, they may have even more nefarious plans for using it, such as pretending to be you somewhere.    In short, don't give it out.    Hope that helps.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Microsoft knows what your MAC address is, it's part of the information that is sent to them during updates. They use it to track you along with the other information that they suck out of your PC like IP address, and all hardware in your PC. They do this so they can trap terrorists LOL
2b5799147194d19d72182c8e2216fa41aa	I think that since the person changed your friend's pass word from your friend's email account, that is probably where the breach is. I would suggest not only changing the pass word to the email account first but to also change the hint questions they ask if you forget your password. Some of those can be very easy to crack is someone knows anything about you and you put the obvious answers as your choice. For example if your choose as your question what is your mothers name? and you choose as your answer your mothers name, then anyone who knows that answer will have access to your account. If someone can gain access to the email account you use for those other services like " Facebook " then they can get into them quite easily just by requesting a new password, so I suggest changing not only the password to Facebook, but start with the email account, and change the hint questions too. And make sure to change the hint questions to something that is not obvious to someone that knows you, and sometimes those first little quips you think of, are not the best choice either because we are not always as original as we may think. Like my sample question, what's your mothers name? If you put " none of your business " it may seem funny , but a lot of other people probably do that too, so I would suggest something that makes sense to you but not obvious to others.  The best passwords use both letters and numbers and are not words that can be found in the dictionary, I would also suggest to stay away from historically important dates and even Bible verses by themselves because they could be cracked too. I wonder how many people probably use John 3:16 as their password? There are a lot of ways to come up with good passwords, but if you don't also make the hint questions secure it doesn't matter, because someone can bypass the best of passwords if they know the answer to the hint question.    I think one of the best ways to create passwords is to use a mnemonic device and to add numbers to it that mean something to you. For instance you could use a favorite song, poem, etc. and instead of writing it in long form just use the first letter of each word as a part of your password. I will use the song  " Amazing Grace " as an example, instead of the words, " Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, " you passwords becomes Aghsts you should of course mix numbers in with that, and may even add some other letters to your password. Some people create a base password and they just add little " extras " to it depending on what site it is for. Like if the one I used above was for Facebook their password ( without numbers ) may look like FBAghsts, or FacebAghsts, or Aghstsfb. ( or any other number of variations ) What matters is that you can remember it and that it is both numbers and letters mixed in, so that it wouldn't make sense to someone else and isn't just " known " words.    Hope this helps,   andrew|`|4ZE8RG7Waa	email abuse@facebook.com they will get bk to you within24 hrs    easy she should know who she told her password or who shes sat with while she tapped it in  hope she learns a lesson from it and that is to always keep passwords secret!|`|AA11514493	Notify Facebook asap, change the pass word immediately.  that's a start.|`|5db661aa7c4e9f42fa8139651a98c24caa	Who else lives with your friend?

AA10834300	More details the better. It helps to work out what the problem is.    The main reasons for wireless cutting out are the following:    1. You have got a cordless phone or other radio device in the same vacinity as your wireless router.    Some cordless phones use the same frequency band (2.4Ghz) as the wireless router. Move the cordless phone out of the way if it does.      2. Your neighbour also has a wireless router using the same or a close channel to yours.    Wireless routers have got about 13 channels. If your neighbour is using the same channel as you (or one close to it) then it can interfere with your wireless causing it to drop out.    The channels overlap with each other so you need to change the channel to one that is different to your neighbours.    More information about that here:    http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/libra...    The channel is normally set by logging onto the console of the wireless router and then changing the channel there.    You can use the Free Net Stumbler application to see what channels your neighbours are using and then select a free channel to avoid conflicts.    http://www.netstumbler.com/    3. Your wireless router is near some other source of electromagnetic interference.    Microwave ovens and other electronic or metalic objects can also cause problems. Move your router up high as possible away from metallic or electronic objects.      More good advice here at this web site:    http://www.microsoft.com/athome/moredone...        I hope it helps you.

VphEo2HKaa	A fantastic question!    I'm going to get ahead and asume that you have no coding experience and want to do it for free.    First of all, you need to learn HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). 90% of the web is coded in HTML. There are many different ways to learn HTML.    The first, is to go to the W3C School. It's free, and you can learn pretty much any lanugage you want on the web.  http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.as...    The second way to learn HTML is by using a program. A great one is called Dreamweaver. It would use it in conjunction with the W3C HTML School.  Pick up the trial version at: http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweave...    The third way to learn HTML is to use a book. Something like HTML for Dummies, or the Idiots Guide to HTML. This is actually how I learned how to code HTML. Its a great way to learn, but there is a lot of reading, and books get outdated because they are just ink on paper.  Check out http://www.dummies.com for more info.    The second step in starting a website is getting a Domain. A domain is a URL that you own and/or have control over.  There are many websites that offer free domains, but come with catches.  Great places to start are:  http://www.tripod.com  http://www.freewebs.com  http://geocities.yahoo.com/    These website give you a free domain, yes, but they come at other costs. One is that you don't get a .com/.org/.net domain. With tripod, you will get a .TRIPOD.COM and with free webs it will be something like www.freewebs.com/    Remember that HTML is just the building block of a web page. Incorperating things like PhP, Flash, CSS, Java, Javascript, and more will get you really professional looking websites.    HTML is a cumbersome but very rewarding process, and its really fun making a website! The BEST way to get good at HTML is to practice, practice, practice.    Good luck, and have fun!|`|7igxiGrAaa	I use Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 and swear by it. You can get a free 30-day trial to see if you like it.   http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweave...|`|apN17Jddaa	I use dreamweaver to make my websites. But if you are a beginner and want to learn how to make websites try PSPad. It is a very good text editor that highlights the code and it is free. Dreamweaver completes the code for you and you will actualy NOT learn the code.     I advise you to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.     After learnig the basics af these 3 start using Dreamweaver.    Go to www.w3schools.com for tutorials.|`|M7P5GdOGaa	go to weebly.com it is really easy and fun!|`|dUNkSnMqaa	try dreamweaver if you want to create the whole stuff and if you are not familiar with creating a website and want a free one then just create it on wordpress.com and redirect with www.dot.tk this will give you a free domain like: youname.tk|`|skGZk140aa	The best software is - - - your brain.  You can design excellent websites even with a simple texteditor.
AA11312040	If you posted the video clip on your website and you are attempting to play it back its not an upload issue, its a streaming playback issue. If you are hitting this file via HTTP its actually a progressive download.     The player will send a request to the server for the file and begin to play back the bits as they come in from the server. If your server and net connection is fast enough you shouldnt notice anything and it would appear that the content is actually streaming.     If the video bit rate is too high and the file is too large, for example or the net connection is too slow the progressive download process doesnt happen fast enough, which is why you see stops, starts, pauses, etc.     Because getting faster internet or servers is probably not an option you can try decreasing the video bit rate to lead to a smaller file size or move it to a server that supports actual streaming, i.e. RTSP, MMS or RTMP, depending upon the type of video file it is.|`|wV9nMhqAaa	You can't reduce the time it takes to upload..but you can stop it from stopping/playing/etc....Wait for it to automatically play rather than clicking the play button.

DMhAPurkaa	You may be one of those lovely people that need a deeper connection.  I read once that there are steps to intimacy  touching hands  touching cheek to cheek  touching eyes (looking into each other s eyes)   touching lips  the thought here I read was that if steps were omiited  the connection would not be made, or be lost.  You may also need a certain pheromone ( sexual homone that is omitted ) to come by your nose.  Perhaps the person with that pheromone has not come into your circle yet.   They did some tests, and women who were not on birth control ( artificial hormones mess things up)  were asked to smell sweaty shirts and rate them, (yes i m for real )  The women rated their favorite shirts and they found that the women always favored the men who had different DNA than them...it was  hard wired into them ; they surmised to lessen birth defects and produce stronger more viable offspring.The closer your partners DNA is to yours, the weaker the offspring will be . That s why it is advised to not marry brothers sisters, cousins. Too close to your DNA pool.  I suggest you not worry about it, some body will come along and turn your key.  For now, maybe you could read up on tantric sex for when you are ready.  Don t settle! You ll be disappointed.

The best way to get subscribers is word of mouth and a catchy word in your video title... like "sex"|`|lutRDDjQaa	Depends what type of videos,  50 of people falling over and doing stupid things (which are so old btw!) wouldn't put you down as a nerd but I guess one describing how to dismantle an xbox 360 and swap out the hdd mite.    You get a lot of subscribers by making good videos or by adding people falling over (don't, did I mention it is so old!!)    Good luck with subscribers|`|RUmNeAqYaa	Do something that the top subscribers have by making funny stuff tutorials, parody's of songs anything like that.|`|faKgix2Qaa	you wouldn't be nerdy if you have alot of videos you get alot of subscribers by making a video that will actually get alot of views say you made a series that will get you alot of subsribers|`|5ovVAqxeaa	I reckon it depends entirely on what type of videos you have on this 'account.' Anything with a hamster is not nerdy in my books :P    And who cares anyway? Bill gates is a nerd...but he's in every ones house and earns millions XD      To get a lot of subscribers your video has to be unique, or have a popular catch line....look at the top 50 videos on youtube and see what makes them so appealing, and copy :)    xo.

75nbESJUaa	I have found String.format() to be of benefit for direct assigning. Without getting into the technical about you are assigning a value to a pointer, let's just convert. First the double to a string.    String sNum = String.format("%4.0f", nXM);  int nX = Integer.parseInt( sNum );    first the entities: the % placeholders  %5.2f = a 5 column numeric with 2 decimals -- float or double  %4d = a 4 column integer  %b = a boolean  %s = a String  %n = a platform independent carriage return  %% = an escaped percent sign    I find String.format() better than Math.round() and less complicated. String.format() requires the correct type in the args. Make friends with String.format();    And, bascially, int nX is a pointer. Java reads that first and prepares 2^16 slots for that value. double x would prepare 2^31 slots. Different sized cups, as you can see.
KFVaZSfqaa	The Windows Blue Screen comes from problems in the Windows registry.  When you have errors in the registry the communication process between software and hardware shuts down.  The computer does not know what to do in these cases and in order to protect itself from further damage it shuts itself down.  What you need to do is fix the errors.  I use an excellent program you can scan your CPU with at:    http://www.registry-clean-up.net/windows...|`|Iy0jPSJjaa	Could be a problem with device drivers, hardware or software. This  problem can be solved by uninstalling new software, updating device drivers and making minor configuration changes . From http://fixit.in/bluescreenofdeath.html . You can also run a free registry scan using utilities from http://re7.info|`|ZUyyGtKpaa	Hit F8 or F12 to get into the bios.  Set it to show the boot up sequence so you know  what the error is.  Should be something like "fastboot" you will need to change.
rMSJ6Gqcaa	You need to make sure that you have the drivers installed on the main pc.    Also you need to make sure that your router is set up correctly    Just go to the website of the manufacturer of the router and get the set up instructions and most times a wizard for easy setup.    Make sure to reboot after the setup process
AA11312040	If money is no object Adobe Creative Suite is excellent. If that is too steep get the following and you're completely covered:    - Fireworks (image editing and web optimization)  - Dreamweaver (full featured HTML and page design tool)  - Flash (if you want to go into animations, video, advanced effects, etc.)    Each of these are very easy to learn and gain some level of proficiency. From there, as your skills improve you can begin to take on more advanced tasks like dynamic pages and such.

9gdJNTajaa	the cpu is a good one on that laptop, and also geforce 9600 is a good midrange graphics card.  My system specs where p4 3.4GHZ, 2gigs 800mhz ram, and a geforce 8500gt, running the game in the native resolution of 1440x900, you could say it run perfectly, I would doubt that laptop will have any difficulty running the game, but the native screen resolution on that laptop is a bit high so you might want to lower the resolution in the game just a little bit.  By the way fallout3 is a great game, it doesnt take long to finish though :) happy gaming
9xQB7Jsaaa	ideally your modem should be in the master socket, but mine isn't and it works fine, it's all about decreasing interference on your phone line, so as long as there isn't a phone connected to the same splitter as your modem you should be fine|`|BByDc3PAaa	Yes. If you can, the shorter the distance between your modem and the telephone line (hole in the wall) the better|`|AA10834300	Your signal can be reduced if it goes into an extension.    This is known as Signal Attenuation.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation    The signal gets weaker as it travels along a cable. This is because it needs energy to travel along the cable and some of that energy is lost as very small amounts of heat or electromagentic radiation as it travels along the cable.    So if the extension cable is very long, the signal will get weaker and weaker as it travels along the length of the cable.    If the signal is very weak to begin with then it will be lost by the time it reaches the end of a very long cable.    Some people get over this by buying special high quality cables with gold-plated connectors that are very good at retaining the signal levels. They are more expensive though.      You could also get a wireless setup (wi-fi) if you don't want any long cables or move your computer close to the phone socket.

The majority of the videos I try to watch (whether they are in my history page) or ones I search for, just have the loading symbol on them. Some will still play for me though. I'm led to believe with other people seemingly having the same issues, that its an internal problem on the youtube servers. (the search results still show up pretty quick, for me anyway)    I just tried this video and it loaded, granted not really fast like usual, but quick enough to watch it right through with no buffering breaks.  http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_sHcraACQ|`|Tr24mmt7aa	Are you on wireless or dial up.

sFWBTeHhaa	Two methods i can think of: 1. Use your mobile phone. Place the SD inside and connect it via usb cable or bluetooth to your pc. The SD will be detected as a mass storage device. You can then transfer your pics. Note that if windows doesnt have drivers for your mobile you will have to install them. MPT for motorolas, Nokia PC suite for nokias , Samsung PC Studio for you know what.                2. If you dont wanna use your phone then your can use a memory card reader. Your PC may have an inbuilt reader if it is mordern enough. Lol. If it hasnt u can get one and plug it into your usb or cardbus slots. Your SD wil once again be a mass storage device and your can access your pics. That should do it, i hope!|`|55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	the big mistake people make is pull them out without un-mounting them with the little icon on the task bar bottom right     you should click on that and click on safely remove usb drive then window can close the files you have on it, if you don't close it the right way you have problems seeing the sd cards     it is the same when you close windows down you have to close down properly if if you just swich the power off then windows needs to go through safe mode before it will boot up|`|a239331a3708e7161bc32073922d1f96aa	At least tell the model so I can figure out if you have card slot, Do you have one?  If yes, then just put it into the card slot or send it to me I'll send you the photos :P   If You don't have, then two possibilities, 1- Put SD card into a card reader and connect it to your USB port, or 2- Put your card into your photo taking device and then connect it to your computer with a cable wire (if you got one with the device) and just paste them onto your Hard Disk Drive.  If thats not what you are asking then put some more info girl!
63wObi8Faa	Well if you mean how to add a picture and put it on ur page other than just your default picture then you could go to photobucket.com or tinypic.com and add the picture you wanted to put on your page then copy the code and paste it on whatever column you wanted like heros, music, movies, etc.    I Hope I Helped.

If you want networking, there is the hardware side and the software side. Hardware is just as it says. Software side can mean servers, account rights, policies, databases etc.     Its more CS and IT is what you are saying.  IT has more jobs right now than CS.  But don't go to make money, go for what you like and hope to make money :-)  It encompasses much more than just networking, you can go for project managment, or the liason for the business and computer side of a company.

I was in operations, got my degree in networking and set around in operations for over 3 years waiting for an opening - finally one came up in programming - and I took it - (had the "knack" for it all along, but the college I went to didn't have programming classes at night, only networking) - having a great time - they've sent me to classes for different things and now am working on data table changes and writing some programs.

I stopped going to college (It was a community college, so it doesn't even count) and that's when I looked into development. A few months later I enrolled in a university for a Bachelors in Game Development and a Masters in Game Design and then transferring to another University to get a Doctorate in Computer Science. I'm about 1/3 of the way through my Bachelors Degree and I'm loving every minute of it.    It all comes down to what you like.

Most websites like these distribute viruses, usually spyware, but it can be something different. If you want movies for free, i would try torrents, they are much safer. But nothing is for free, they always have a price and usually for your computer.
9ECwMzZXaa	Torrents are just like the internet. Some are safe, others are not. You just have to be cautious, don't download anything from torrents that looks suspicious, and check the user comments for reviews.    Torrents is not a website, but you can find torrents from websites. There are many websites offering torrents for download. Once you download the torrent, you need a torrent program like Torrent or BitTorrent to open the torrent, and start downloading the actual file you want.    So, torrents are just like a key, you download a key and Torrent uses that key to 'download' a box, then when finished you have the box. The box is the file you wanted all along. The box is not locked, now you can just use it like any other file.     - Torrent (program)  http://www.utorrent.com/download.php|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	torrents is not a website, and no, torrents are not safe.|`|uQSjdI4Haa	Torrents is a File such as .exe or .bat or .doc or .mp3/etc that point to different sites to download a file to(Maybe I don't have that exactly right?)    but it is somewhat like that.

Try to switch off both routers and then turn them on wait for few minutes and check the connectivity    Or          Go to your wireless router ...setup by opening 192.168.1.1 in your internet explorer and then look for DHCP try to release old DHCP and renew it ..    Hope it works     Regards,    Qasir

All the connections are wireless.  Some are on 802.11b (slower) and some are 802.11g (faster) and we all connect to the router and are able to access the internet/share files over the network.    It comes with a quick and easy startup guide.  Basically, plug the cable/dsl into the router, plug the router into the power, then if you have your wireless enabled on your pc, it'll find it and you'll be able to connect.    It'll walk you through how to setup your network.  If you have other people living near you that you don't want using your internet, you can easily setup a password so only you and people you give the password can use it.

You don't need a floppy drive, you just need to save the drivers on our computer.    Make sure you save them in a place where you don't have to type in a particularly long file path, such as c:\ so when it asks you for the floppy drive you can choose the part where it says look for driver and put in the path where you saved it.    That should solve your problem.    Good luck!

Age?|`|b7w8JaWzaa	you have to make sure your motherboard can take the 2gb ram your buying.  you find out the name of the motherboard you got and find it on its official site and it will tell you what kind of ram it can take.|`|3LjMWownaa	Yes, but make sure your motherboard can support that RAM that buy.|`|NJBp6uJkaa	well, there are different types of RAM (DDR, DDR2, and DDR3) then there are different voltages in each.   first buy a low voltage memory, probably DDR2.  then also be aware that some older motherboards max out at one gig of RAM.  also, be aware that a 32 bit OS (probably what you have) only supports 3 gigs.  also, you have 2 memory modules probably in dual channel mode, allowing the 2 stick to process at once.  you would be better off buying 2 more 512 MB RAM then you would have 2 gigs, then and 2 sets of RAM running in dual channel which would be faster than 1 2 gig chip.|`|omNEQ4Tkaa	you can and probably should check you compatibility

8ohAAwrEaa	Any of them will work.    ALL of them are faster than your internet connection.    If you're not transferring files between multiple computers on the network, I'd go for the cheapest router in a good name brand.|`|RyvKws7Laa	Don't worry about the speed, its the version you want.  You want something that is Wireless Draft N 2.0.  That's what you need to be worried about.  That's the max speed you'll get right now.  There are some sub-$100 ones that can do an okay job for you.    Remember that right now, wired will always beat wireless in bandwidth.  So things like watching iPlayer or doing the gaming may or may not hold up in wireless, no matter how much you spend on the wireless gear.  There are other factors too like how many people nearby you use wireless gear.  That can actually dampen your signal strength (even if you're ignoring their connections).    I think Linksys (310 and 610 models are good) and Belkin (N+ is likely the one you want from them) right now are delivering the best wireless routers (and by best I mean there models are the ones performing best in benchmark tests).  D-Link 655 Xtreme N is actually pretty good too.  And I hear good things for the SMC SMCWGBR14-N Barricade N.  I don't know a lot about it though, but it reviews as well rounded.|`|BByDc3PAaa	Well the higher the better really. Although you are not going to need alot of wireless bandwidth, eventually when technology progresses, you'll want to be there.    Might be worth reading this article about the "true" wireless speeds produced:    http://askville.amazon.com/SimilarQuesti...    When they normally say e.g. 300mbps, that is a potential speed, alot of the time it is unlikely to reach that speed depending on range etc.    Also, the higher speed ones seem to output a stronger signal.    But to be honest, if your internet connection isn't very fast, then there isn't alot of point in buying a really fast wireless.

FTvkahKWaa	you need a tv recorder card that connects pc to the tv for recording programmes.    or.. get clips from other sites such as metacafe, veoh, ..    or.. use a web cam and start recording something... or    Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker(included in your windows machine)  to create new masterpieces.... then save it as video file such as wmv ... finally upload.    this will help you....

8Yd3UO0Baa	Yiasas, Maki. NOD32 was Anti-Virus of the Year 2006 & 2007 and close second 2008 (Avira was top), according to http://www.av-comparatives.org    If you're happy with Kaspersky, stick with it, especially if you're using the security suite rather than just the AV, Kaspersky's firewall is much stronger than the new Eset firewall, see:   http://www.matousec.com/projects/firewal...    Alternatively, you'll find that NOD32 is lighter on resources and faster and, in some of the tests, outperforms Kaspersky by a fair way. It works well with the easy-to-use, free, OnlineArmor firewall.    But Kaspersky is absolutely sound.|`|e6f195e21b288c85ad75d09b3481f889aa	you will be better off with kaspersky, eset misses alot.|`|9xQB7Jsaaa	kapersky is a good option but it is really annoying when opening .exe files or games|`|QuiT3yS4aa	Kaspersky is the most safest as it has a much stronger protection and removal system than Eset.

I just had a full search on Google and decided that AVG freeware is the best, it protects against spyware, viruses, or more complex situations like threatening websites, blogs, income emails, it even has a protection for your computer system too. Of course, it's all based on internet connection, the worst that could happen it's when your connection is down...or if your stick/USB has some viruses. Now, that I see this question I must realize I have a very good antivirus AVG but my stick has got viruses I donno where from, so I can suggest take AVG, it's free and ok in most situations.
8ohAAwrEaa	If it created a new partition, you can delete the existing partition. If it has al the files for both XP and 2000 on one drive.  There is not much you can do except delete all the partitions and start from scratch.    You can edit & delete partitions using the Windows XP installation (restart with CD in tray).  You can also goto START->CONTROL PANEL->ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS->COMPUTER MANAGEMENT->DISK MANAGEMENT.    You CAN edit the boot table to not SHOW you the option to dual boot anymore though.  START->RUN->msconfig  From msconfig, go to the BOOT tab.  Edit/remove the dual boot option.

So, while it can be done, I strongly don't recommend it.
4QmgVhS5aa	You are infected with spyware if:    * You see too much pop-up advertisements.  * Your browser has toolbars that you haven't installed.  * Your homepage has changed (and you can't change it back).  * Other settings have changed without your permission.  * Your computer is slow.    To get rid of spyware and keep your computer clean you can use an antispyware or even more.   You can download a antispyware software. There are 10 good anti-spywares.  here is the reviews: http://toptenantispyware.com/    You can download one and scan your system.  All are safe and can be trusted.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware.    Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|dILqe7nBaa	run your virus scan >full scan|`|78xcSNrKaa	Stop downloading Music illegally.|`|M0cRnQ1Daa	if your logged into an administration privileged account then just delete it, if not restart in safe mode and run full virus scan, i suggest avast.com free anti virus (home edition)|`|YLnEaiZBaa	this is simple just download a spy-bot S/D its a spyware and malware removal software i will recommend ur frm www.filehippo.com its a safe site go ahead download this software u will get rid of trojan virus becoz i got rid of them|`|340ZVz4daa	run a full system scan with your antivirus, and run your disk defragmenter and disk cleanup, in that order and if that doesnt work, e-mail me and well talk.|`|b44WwAMsaa	stop downloading  torrents! omg this is the first question i answered politely.

Vw5hR0Pyaa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze.

Just ensure there is no power cut during the process.    If you are running Windows Vista, its designed to defrag on its own and doesnt show a graphic or fragmentation visuals.      The Windows program has limiations like minimum 15% free space needed for a defrag, requires to be run manually and you have to ensure no other programs are running during the defrag.    I recommend a better defrag program like Diskeeper, which is automatic and once installed do the job in the background without needing any manual intervention. You can go about your normal PC work without any hassles even when it works. It defrags even if you have less than 15% free space and is much faster.

Despite the marketing blitz convincing naive customers to the contrary, Windows (in general) is problematic. Here's an idea for you: next time you see someone on an Apple Macintosh, ask them if they've used Windows machines and how their views have changed since using a Mac. I encourage you to conduct your own research into this matter. I'm confident that you'll notice you're not alone in your frustration, and you'll also find out that computers don't have to be this way.      Funniest (and truest) quip on Microsoft ...

9ECwMzZXaa	It depends what you use it for. Confirm with you local law enforcement agency.    If you use it to hack into other people's accounts for your own benefit, steal personal details they don't want you to know, malicious intent etc then it is illegal    If its a law enforcement agency, a university, a corporation, they may install keyloggers on their computers to track and prevent misuse. That's legal.    I'm not a lawyer, but I'm assuming if your just an average internet user wanting to spread havoc over the internet then YES, that's illegal.|`|VBpVI4s7aa	Yes they are. This question wasn't worth the 5 points you spend. lol|`|AA11620962	Yes and no depending on the purpose of what you are doing|`|fB0gmEioaa	It's illegal if you were to  secretly install one on someone's computer to collect information on what their typing into their computer, things like credit card info and other personal information.

zhIVzJj8aa	sounds like you got yourself in a little mess their and trying to cover your tracks.  Their is not away to do that legally with any software,  You can do a spam email and accomplish this.  You have to know a little bit about computers but since you asked that question I am not sure you would understand what I would tell you to do. Best thing to do is date the body of the email as yesterday then put an error message and undeliverable at the top or bottom of it.  What you will want to do is send an email to a fake email address.  Make it crazy so you know it will come back not delivered. copy the error message and put it on your email you are sending.  From their change the error message and delayed send.  When they see this they will see you sent it yesterday but it had troubles in the lines and showed up a day or two late.  yahoo and gmail have these problems all the time so it is legit.  good luck to you

You would need a database for a forum because you would need a database to store all the forum messages and user accounts and whatever else you need to store.    You only need to create 1 database, but you would need multiple tables in that 1 database.
7pAXElgSaa	old monitors have a D-Sub port or some times a cable straight from the monitor with a D-Sub plug. Many newer machines and video cards have DVI ports.

Any newer computer will have either a DVI and/or a VGA connector on the back.     If it has VGA, it's good to go. If it only has DVI, you simply need to purchase an adapter so you can plug in the VGA cable from the monitor. The computer may even come supplied with the correct adapter.    How old exactly is the monitor? If it's really small, or it doesn't support a resolution higher than 800x600, you may want to update it anyway.

BRpEZTO8aa	Wireless Interferences are common if you're on a location where there are multiple wireless networks. To try fixing this, use the channel that aren't use that much by the other wireless networks you detect. The recommended channels are 1,6 and 11.(But this still depend on your area.)    And to isolate the problem, check if you get the same constant disconnect with a computer wired directly to your router. Because if you do, then there's a problem with either the modem's Internet connection or the router.     I would recommend that you do an firmware update on your router.|`|YkRUtO8Daa	You might can change you wireless channel to be a different value. The default is channel 6, so you could make it channel 1 or 11. If there are a lot of wireless networks, you could download NetStumbler and it will show you the SSID;s their channels, their signal, and signal to noise ratio. I am not familiar with Network Magic, but this may help. Pay attention to yours and if the channel change doesn't help, watch stumbler for 20 mins to see if there is a spike or drop in the monitor graph window. That would indicate a physical problem with the router or something causing the interference. Also, Have you tried located the router in a different spot? You maybe limited by your cable, but sometimes a few feet can make a difference. Also, I have recommended to customers that leaving the router off overnight by some miracle takes care of the problem and sometimes works.  http://www.computertipstricks.com  Netman42
2SSA9e9Naa	The command prompt is not a controlled environment for windows. Unlike an application windows doesn't know what is happening in the command prompt.    If something is running in the command prompt windows cannot send a kill command to it (which is what happens in a windows application when you press X). So, it is being extra cautious to warn you that the X means it can't control what will happen.    So, if you really want to kill it go ahead and use it don't worry.|`|GpitqYxcaa	When you're in the CMD prompt, put in the command exit to close it. Never hit the X, it says it's not good for it.|`|BChKHLRXaa	You are okay to let windows terminate command prompt, but the best way to close it is to just type "exit" at the prompt.  Do not use the x to close it.    With regards to not recognizing commands, you may want to check that your PATH variable contains the directory of the executable you wish to use.|`|FBQZ06vraa	I suspect you're using command.com.  If you have Windows XP, use cmd.exe instead.  It's as good and better.  For one thing, it recognizes long file names.  For another, it lets you click the X-button to close it out.    Hope that helps.

Secondly, twitter is great once you start using it correctly. When you follow someone, go to your Home tab on the site and you will see their tweets.

VMVW3E7Aaa	There is only ONE Photoshop, and it is made by Adobe. The current version of Photoshop is CS4.    Photoshop is an example of a image editing program. Other image editing programs are Photoshop Elements (which is PS's smaller cousin), Paint Shop Pro, the Gimp (free download), etc.    If YOU want editing software, I suggest you get Elements - it is good enough for most people and much cheaper than full on Photoshop (less than $90 vs $600).
fUo106q2aa	If I'm not mistaken, I think you should be able to record your own voice with a microphone & use effects to have the audio start when you switch slides.

But I just had to do a 20 minute presentation with my friend last week, and we had to use all kinds of mediums to make our presentation interesting.<br>  <br>  Sorry your group isn't so reliable. But usually, it's pretty obvious when one person had to do all the work - the rest of the people will be reading off a paper for the class, sweating and worried. But you'll be fine; just don't stress out too much. I too don't like presenting in front of groups so much, and I always sorta flip my hair for some reason unbeknownst to me.<br>  Best of luck!

hdTJ5Lpnaa	its wrong what you have done.  m|`|	whats your good reason?|`|	god wont allow this|`|	whats the reason for it?|`|	well.....the fact that you describe it as stealing in the first place should probably answer your question.|`|	buy it or something, say you'll give them 15 bucks ?|`|	It's not "safe". I dunno if you'd get away with it because of the detector things you have to walk through. They put your games on the other side of it via the counter so the buzzer doesnt go off...|`|	Yes.  Stealing is stealing, even if you are taking food to feed a starving child.      Stealing a small item can result in legal penalties that can affect your life in a big way.    If you need it that badly, it is best to ask for it.    When stores rent a video game, the cover is part of the deal.  They have to buy them and pay to replace everything that is stolen.    I hope this helps you make your decision.

Additionally, many files on limewire are viruses, so you can easily infect your computer using limewire, which is obviously not "safe" either.

BsIAvIe0aa	Start up in Safe Mode, tap the F8 key as you power on and select "Safe Mode".  My advice then....    In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|6MubAquRaa	This happened me, i used malware bytes anti-malware and it resolved my problem ... so get it .|`|fawhiGtsaa	Press the F8 keyboard to Safe Mode.|`|i9XtA7mCaa	http://www.comodo.com/products/free_prod...                  http://www.malwarebytes.org/

RyvKws7Laa	You didn't say if you're a Mac user already or not.  If you're thinking Windows vs OS X, then you need to go and do some test driving of the OS X.  Forget what people thing, make sure you're comfortable with the OS.  It not a good/bad/one is better than the other, its about your comfort level.    That being said, I would go with the White Macbook of the current sets or just buy a last generation Macbook on the cheap (as they are being liquidated all over the place - Amazon, or the Apple Refurbished store for starters).  The new ones, with the new casing and GPU, are the first generation of a redesign.  Thus more prone to bugs.  The new trackpad and GPU have been giving a few people problems.  Its not widespread, but it is showing up in complaints online here and there.    You could even get like a last generation MacBook Pro 15.4" for like $1499/$1599 on like Amazon.  Sure its not "shiny" like the new ones, buts a great price for a powerhouse laptop.  I think that's the best bang-for-buck in Mac laptops right now (until they sell out).|`|XlyLakYAaa	I severely dislike them, especially compared to PCs, for the following reasons:  1) They're terribly overpriced (not "expensive"... "expensive" implies you're paying more for higher quality, which is not the case.

There is a slight pro for a Mac, and that is that it's less likely to get a virus than a Windows-based PC without antivirus simply because fewer Mac viruses currently exist.

Or they DON'T HAVE an account?    I'm guessing it's the latter...    If you stated in the auction Paypal is the only acceptable way for payment,or in the payment option box you ONLY check PAYPAL then you are not required to sell this item to the person because they obviously didn't read the auction carefully.    If ,however, you did state anywhere you'd except any form of payment besides paypal you have to sell it to them.(money,check,cashier's check,money order etc.) I would do signature verification,and use tracking.All this costs extra,so unluckily for this buyer you have to pass the extra cost onto them. Send them an e-mail explaining the extra fees etc.    Also check their feedback. If they have '0' feedback be weary.|`|qsqmykzsaa	Yes. Definately signature delivery.

LtZwIJtraa	youtubes main data survey is having problems i recommend try tommorow|`|AA10834300	From what I've heard today. YouTube has been having some problems with its service over the last few days. It's probably linked to a wider problem so don't let it get you down.    Try using one of the regional sites like this one:    http://uk.youtube.com    Which is the UK version of YouTube - you might have more luck with that - it is working for me.    If possible, try using a different web browser to rule out any problems with your actual web browser. If you are using Internet Explorer, try using Firefox to see if that makes any difference:    http://www.mozilla.com/firefox

b8tgCAQJaa	You do realise that a video card is a physical piece of hardware that you have to buy and then plug into a slot on your computer's circuit board?    Your computer's built in video hardware is a Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3100, which is not powerful enough to run this game. Updating the driver won't change this, it's the hardware that's the problem. You need to buy a recent ATI or NVidia video card, and then plug it into the PCI Express x16 slot on your PC's motherboard.

O4SraPVoaa	Here is a help article and video tutorial that will teach you how to get rid of AntiVirus 360...    http://www.cleartechinfo.com/Learn-How-T...|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM, rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.    TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):    A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory. For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    P.S.: Forward this message to all the friends you exchanged Email with since you started getting this problem but only after you have completely eradicated it !|`|fB0gmEioaa	http://www.malwarebytes.org/rogueremover...    http://www.superantispyware.com/superant...|`|BsIAvIe0aa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|AA10834300	Boot into Safe Mode (tapping the F8 key during startup) and then run your scanning software in safe mode.    Your computer is less likely to let the malware run in safe mode meaning that your scanner should have a better chance of removing it.    Some of the malware is so tenacious that it is very difficult to remove and in those cases, unless you have buckets of time and patience, wiping your computer (back up your important stuff first) and reinstalling everything is often the easier option.|`|fj6YUwBUaa	backup individual files;  scan backups using trinity rescue kit or similar live disc application;  wipe disc and reinstall windows;    It's the fastest way in the long run.

An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Re load windows.|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	Try downloading Tune up Utilities from www.download.com it is free to use for 30 days with no catches.  It is really good and you will be amazed at the difference in your computer!  Also what antivirus are you using, some of them are quite heavy users, I use Avira Antivir which is free and is quite light on my computer.  Also make sure you dont have too much software on your desktop.  Just try Tune up!!!|`|OuNXvoh4aa	Probably needs upgrading, with more RAM. RAM stands for random access memory, and is where you computer works. If you are trying to run newer programs that require a lot of RAM, then you computer will freeze whenever the strain is too much.|`|U0k6pG04aa	More RAM, just buy it, and the people in the store will help install it.  You might also have a virus, so if RAM doesnt help, yo might have to restore your computer using a restore disk. But this removes all files that you might want to keep.|`|mE3wNi8Raa	you need more ram,you can get it cheap

SHXzkL6Gaa	Unless you are playing Crysis at the highest settings on a 30" monitor, you do not need a Tri-SLI GTX285.<br>  According to reviews of Tri-SLI with the new Intel i7 965 CPU (which is the fastest CPU money can buy) the increase in performance from SLI to Tri-SLI is only noticeable in benchmarks and not in gaming experience.<br>  Spend your money on something that will give you a real benefit like a SSD hard drive, more RAM or a better monitor.<br>  <br>  Will your CPU bottleneck your 3 video cards? No, because no game currently available fully utilizes quad core CPUs anyway and no game NEEDS 3 GTX285 cards. Tri-SLI support in games is far from perfect - in some games Tri-SLI performs worse than SLI (Fallout 3 for example) and the scaling (added performance by adding GPUs) for a third GTX285 is only around 30% on average, that is pretty low return for your investment.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	That depends entirely on what sort of application you are running.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about games, most games make heavier use of the video card than they do of the CPU, so a bottleneck is unlikely.|`|3dv7Qdoxaa	Probably not. 3.6 Ghz on a Q6600 is pretty impressive. I can only get mine up to 3.25 Ghz (on air), and your motherboard is pretty high end. If you were to upgrade any of those parts, however, I would upgrade the CPU to at least a Q9550. If not, I would buy a X58 motherboard and get a Core i7 CPU. I would die for one of those. <br>  <br>  Also, you should have mentioned what kind of RAM you have. That can sometimes be a big bottleneck to your PC.|`|PAWDklmQaa	The GTX285 is some graphics card!!!<br>  <br>  That is a very powerful Graphics card.<br>  <br>  You should't have bottleneck problems.<br>  <br>  A reccomendation I want to make is to rather get an E8500 Dualcore (3.2GHz). It is much more reliable. I have one. It beats the Q6600 hands down.<br>  <br>  The links may give more insight.<br>  <br>  In other words...your graphics card shouldn't bottleneck. Rather look at you CPU|`|7BHIyMFmaa	In Tri-Sli, if there were a bottleneck it would the processor or FSB. The processor could become a bottleneck on programs that aren't multi-core optimized. Run some Crysis benchmarks, I'm curious what kind of framerate 3 GTX 285's can churn out.
QqXpkatHaa	Oh dear - I'm a greedy sod and have two computers that do both (a Vaio and MacBook). Both are fine.|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	Windows XP, because it's affordable no way I'd ever spend 1200 dollars on a computer that I could get for half the price and still be a great computer.|`|DGA5Rtc4aa	I've used both Mac and PC.  Apart from some games, I've never encountered a problem where software existed for a PC but not for a Mac.  Denz123 is wrong about entertainment.  I have a Mac Min attached to a TV.  I use it for iPlayer, listen again (radio)and playing DVDs.<br>  <br>  I've also used Macs for presentation preparation, project planning, video and image editing, spreadsheeting, programming.....<br>  <br>  I've owned both PCs and Macs.  With the PCs repairs would take a couple of weeks, with the Macs it's been on-the-spot.  For both types this includes hard-drive and board problems.  I've also tried to buy software in an Apple store and been talked out of it.  the Apple techy showed me how to solve my problem using the software I had.  That's happened to other people too.<br>  <br>  If you can go to PC World / Currys etc and walk about, talk to the staff and explore the support you'd get in the event of problems.  try the same in an Apple store.<br>  <br>  Whatever you get I'd suggest an extended warranty.<br>  <br>  If you have any connection to education then ask about Apple education discount.  You can do this in store, or using the freephone number listed on the website.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your choice.|`|837xgMwLaa	Windows. It can do everything I want from a PC, including games & there's a lot of free software around. Macs are good for editing pictures, movies & music, but that's about it, they aren't really for entertainment. Plus they cost 3 times as much for less features.|`|nYgUfUd7aa	You really can't go wrong either way.  Just look at the software you want to run and the amount you want to spend in order to make a decision...|`|s3E3KfBsaa	I think I will stick with Windows.|`|gtcQ8l5laa	It depends because their are so many choices. I'd rather own a Core i7 PC with a ridiculous amount of RAM than a Mac Mini, but compared to a Mac Pro the choice would be the Mac Pro; even more so when the Mac Pro inevitably undergoes a transition to the Nehalem architecture later this year.<br>  <br>  My next laptop will probably be a Sony or Dell though, I like the idea of being on the move, getting passed a software disk and just installing rather than loading Bootcamp and deleting files to make room in the limited space. Macs will probably always be my desktop of choice on the other hand. Roll on Windows 7 and OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.|`|8kK3mMgtaa	I would have windows as i find it easier to use and its not as expensive as apple but apple are less targeted for viruses etc... im not sure why<br>  apple are aimed to be used for graphics though<br>  but softwares for mac which r for pc may not be compatible or u av to wait a long time for the mac version to come out + it might be more expensive than pc version ~ if u av more than one computer and runs the same (both pc) i think u should keep windows as it will be expensive to buy so many softwares<br>  but also if u like apple and the price isnt right ~ the design of vista is like apple...but is not the same software etc...|`|1AiwRVpGaa	Windows XP PC will be better because you can get readily available software any where in world , for Apple you have take pain for searching that those are developed for apple. XP PC is affordable and  repair technician are available easily with low cost . <br>  and in performance almost OK|`|AA10586732	it totally depends on what i'm using it for. currently i'm in a setting where all my family and coworkers use PC's so it makes sense to use a PC. however, if you're doing a lot of design work with film, photography, or computer art, Macs generally are more powerful and specialized for that. If you're low on cash, then don't by the mac. they can run has high as twice the cost of a PC.|`|BDb3eBAHaa	Well in reality if you went with a new apple mac you can put windows on as well.

For just general home purpose use I'd go for an Apple Mac because of the capability, programs, speed, looks, ease of use and the fact that they don't have many viruses.<br>  <br>  Windows on the other hand would be better for work since nearly 80% of all computers in the world are Windows, which means that the software, games and files would be compatible with more other computers.|`|ycQZQ3IVaa	Personally I'd Go With Mac. But It Is Based On Where You Stay And Availability Of Softwares For Mac O/s. However Even If You Don't Have Softwares For Mac O/s Windows Xp Or Vista Can Be Installed On Any Mac System Allowing You To Have Both Operating Systems One One Machine. A Windows Pc However Does Not Allow Mac O/s To Be Installed On It. <br>  <br>  And Also Keeping In Mind That Mac O/s Is Safe And Free From Viruses As Well As User Friendly Makes It The Perfect Operating System.|`|QvGORDamaa	APPLE MACBOOK every time :D|`|Tk52Pd3taa	Macs, unless u want to spend 1200 dollars on getting ur computer fixed every week|`|a19fzzuDaa	apple mac
dkpIjt5jaa	Here are my suggestions (and warnings) for free software (I tried all personally):    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not.     Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.       If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include anti-spyware and anti-adware protection so add an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and see below for adware scanning.    Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security) as there is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      P.S.: DO NOT USE toolbars as they contain a form of spyware (even the ones from big names)|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	I would recommend Avira Antivir as it is lighter on resources and is an excellent product - I have tried all the others and always come back to this one as it doesnt slow my machine and I feel confident that it will protect my machine.  I agree that Avast slows your machine down as I have just taken it off mine and I really have noticed the difference!|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Avast    www.avast.com   FREEBIE - good to|`|AA10834300	Try Avast free edition:    http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...|`|JWYs2pBgaa	AVG also free and pretty good... get it from www.download.com|`|zCgbeMQQaa	Mcafee
ykXzzx65aa	no it wouldnt, the scalling would bring it down a lot, and the clock on the 4870X2 are much higher than the 4830's, and the Memory on the 4870X2 is GDDR5 compared to GDDR3 on the 4830 which is less than half the speed    Plus when u actually use all 4 slots in that mobo it runs them all at x8 x8 x8 x8, so the bandwidth becomes small    but when u Quad fire with 4870x2, its only taking up 2 PCI-e slots, making them run at X16 X16, which will make the 4870x2 Run Much faster

7HkVTeqvaa	No, what you heard is wrong. The first digit determines the series. Each set of thousands has a different version of DirectX. The higher the first number, the better the version of DirectX and the higher the rest of the numbers, the higher resolutions and frame rates you can run.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, get the 9700.|`|HakdwKKAaa	Search on yahoo or google for reviews of the cards.<br>  <br>  No, the higher number does not always mean better or faster, sorry guy that answered before me.<br>  <br>  Better as in what?

n2lxsCiUaa	first of all the multiplier on the 6600 is locked so you cant set it to 10x , 9 or lower is all yuor gonna be able to manage.    secondly the reason the options are greyed out is because they are not enabled by default you need to set it yourself , with the cpu host clock control (or something like that depending on your bios) it neds to be enabled before you can do anything.    speed step is normally called CPU EIST in bios and you want to disable CPU ENHANCED HALT (C1E) while your at it , both can make for an unstable overclock.    make sure your lock your PCI/E frequncy at 100hz DO NOT leave it on auto yuo could damage your GPU    and under NO circumstances should you leave you CPU voltage on AUTO , set it yourself    and remember overclocking the FSB overclocks the WHOLE system so watch your RAM , use the dividers to keep it in range or your PC wont even boot , and make sure you know how to hard reset your bios    if you dont know what your doing (you dont obviously , no offence mate) do plenty of research|`|hl8MBus6aa	http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=kQoI9ML8Wx...|`|AA11703028	hi mate                 some motherboard hard lock their f.s.b,s to avoid support calls,however in your case speed step needs to be disabled before you can edit the multiplier                   speed step is a technology built into specific motherboards that allows the clock speed of the processor to be dynamically changed by software.                 speed step also uses much less power and creates less heat                  to disable speed step you must have it turned off in the BIOS and in WinXP. If you go into the Power Applet in Control Panel and select the Always On option it will disable Speed Step. Right click your desktop > Click properties > Click Screen Saver > Power button > Change the Power Scheme to always on.                  have you considered using a software based overclocking utility such as nvidia n-tune(for n-force based chipsets)(http://www.nvidia.com/object/ntune_5.05.... ) or "sys tool" ( http://www.techpowerup.com/systool/ )                nvidia n tune is the easiest to use and has two types of overclock(or tune) the first is the coarse tune which takes around 20 minutes and then theres the fine tune which can take around 3 hours,as with any overclock your pc may reboot several times during the tune and n tune will restart after every reboot               sys tool is compatible with both nvidia and ati based chipsets and also includes enhanced speedstep control,and also allows you to change the f.s.b from the desktop via sys tool                the graphic user interface(gui) is well layed out and easy to navigate                 good luck mate !

Google's search engine is vastly popular and around 70-80% of world's searches are done through Google. That makes google more in demand. So its supply of adverts is high. Its demand for showing those adverts is even higher. Its a nice complete circle for google.<br>  <br>  Besides google is present in areas of software development where yahoo may be lagging far behind.

Ev6WQRmzaa	Make sure 3d acceleration is enabled    But why not just use a native N64 emulator for OS X?  http://mupen64.emulation64.com/|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Your graphics card is fine, I'm sure - it's VMWare that's the problem. VMWare doesn't support 3D hardware accelerated cards, I think it can only be used to run 2D apps.    If you can install Windows on your macbook natively (using BootCamp or something like that?) instead of VMWare, you should be able to run those emulators just fine.
IFtV7g2Zaa	Several things come to mind.<br>  <br>  1) You said this is a copy of the XP CD.  You said the original was scratched.  When did you make the copy? Before it was scratched, or after?  If the CD was scratched too badly to be completely read for the installation, its too badly scratched to make a copy of it.<br>  <br>  2) Assuming your CD copy was made before the original was scratched, then I'm wondering how you made the copy.  If you simply copied all the files off and then burned them to the new disc, or you created an ISO of the discs files and burned it to a new disc, or you simply let the burner software copy the files between the two discs, then you probably didn't get a complete copy of the XP disc's data.  To correctly copy these discs, you need to do a disc at once copy, which reads from one disc and copies to the other, sector by sector, ignoring the contents of each sector.<br>  <br>  3) Instead of installing XP to a new partition on the same hard drive, install a 2nd hard drive and install it on there.  Disconnect the Vista hard drive from the system.  Reset the jumpers to make the 2nd hard drive the master.  Install XP.  Shutdown the computer.  Reconnect the Vista drive, and reset the jumpers so the Vista drive is master and the XP drive is slave.  Reboot the computer.  Vista will start.  Modify the startup information so you will be prompted for the operating system to start.  If you simply must have XP on the same drive (different partition), you can copy everything from the XP drive to the partition, if you want, once this is completed.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately # 3 is really the only way for the XP installer to not find Vista on CD boot.  The XP installation is smart enough (or dumb enough) to notice that you've got a later version of Windows already installed.<br>  <br>  And next time, use a d-skin on your most valuable CDs and DVDs.  They work wonders and they make scratches a thing of the past.<br>  <a href="http://www.d-skin.com/how_it_works.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.d-skin.com/how_it_works.php</a>|`|h8rn6CNtaa	put the disc in when the computer is on, then turn it off.turn it back on then press f8 repaetedly until you hear a beep, the nlack screen should come up with options for R for restore or Q for quit select which one you want.|`|VPCl2C9daa	temporarily disconnect the vista drive and try again.<br>  <br>  and have you loaded xp from this exact cd onto another pc?

5MuqMJKGaa	Depends on the virus But typical viruses will be gone with a easy system restore u should get some anti viruis programs at least a free one to keep yourself protected It only takes one time for a person to steal your info|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Malware, deeply roots itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    First, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) as it foolish to not have Antivirus.      Now get these programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	never use systerm restore to get rid of an infection --it is still alive and well on your pc --get a free anti virus program like avira or avast|`|xdlsGvldaa	No system restore will not solve the problem, if you are not using A Internet Security Software like Norton Internet Security 2009 you have and will continue to get all types of virus, trojans, spyware, malware and more bad bugs every time you go on line. Install Internet Security and run a full system scan. If you can not afford a Internet Security program then download and use a free one. http://www.avg.com or http://www.avast.com  Hope this helps|`|XXQNsa9gaa	Unfortunately eyadodado if a file by that name is present on your system then no, just restoring to a date prior to the infection will not solve the problem. That file is part of a Worm.Mabezat!sd6 infection, which includes an autorun component. If the worm infection is there it will have created other copies of itself as well as written it's own autorun files on all drives on the computer. This includes any USB/flash/thumb/pen drives that have been used on the computer recently as well. So unless both the computer and any infected drives are all cleaned at the same time the worm will continue to create new autorun copies of itself. Mazebat also may include an executable file infection part that it will use to alter some of your legitimate system files, which will require either replacing the files with clean copies, or using a known antivirus software to see if it will "heal" the files.    I won't even try to suggest one or another antivirus/anti-infection scan to you here to repair this infection, as it is just too complex for just scanning alone to clear up.    I do suggest you instead start a new request at http://MalwareCrypt.com and I will assist you with cleaning up your computer. Once you have registered at the forum, just run and post a new HijackThis log in the MalwareCrypt HijackThis logs and Malware Removal forum here:    http://malwarecrypt.com/forumdisplay.php...    Before running any scans be sure to install any USB/flash/thumb/pen drives that have been used on the computer recently, so the scan results will include all the infection information necessary to start the cleaning procedures. If you look through some other requests already posted there you will see how the repair processes work.    Jintan - http://MalwareCrypt.com

This assumes you did a bootable install to each drive|`|GpbtPC2Waa	you need to setup a dual boot system.  Both op systems have to be on on same drive but in different partitions.  So if you have only 1 partition then you must create a second for the windows 7.  Or if you can`t do that then you can change the boot order in bios to boot from which drive you want to start, but you will have to do this each time you boot if you want to change op system.    Your additional info means you must partition the sata drive a i said earlier.  The run install for windows 7 and select 2nd partition as install drive.

9ECwMzZXaa	You can retrieve the key for you wireless network through the router's control interface. Type the IP address of the router into your web browser and log in. Navigate to the Wireless security area, the WPA password is usually there.    To find you router's IP address, press (on the keyboard) (Windows key + R), type 'cmd' then press enter. on the black screen that comes up, type 'ipconfig'. Look for default gateway, and thats your router's IP address. Type that number into your browser. 10.1.1.1 OR 192.168.1.1 are common ones.    To log into the router, for most modems the username is 'admin' and the password is also 'admin' by default. Check your usermanual, or search you router's brand on the internet.    Another way to find the WPA (or WEP) wireless network key is with WirelessKeyView:  http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_ke...  Download, install and run it inside the computer which already has the wireless connection to find the key inside that laptop.|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	You would need to access your wireless router console through a computer that is currently connected to it.

Customer service is terrible with them, and the speed of them is terrible. They usually last for about two years before they're completely disposable.     I suggest you opt for a hp, toshiba or an Acer.   HP and toshiba's last for ages, and although acers are a relatively new brand, they work just as well as any established one. I'm using an acer aspire 5920 right now and I love it! it was cheap for the amount I got for it. (335 for Core 2 Duo 2GHz, 2GB RAM, 200GB HDD, Vista Home) is pretty good nowadays.     Whatever you go for, (because, as you know, there are different strokes for different folks) I suggest you view your chosen laptop in an instore shop (or two) and give it a little fiddle.

31gyS90Saa	By a third party charger, or order/ask for a new one through Dell. It sounds like your charger is fried, probably near the end you plug into the laptop. It's dead, there is nothing you can do, except play around with the connection until you find a position that works. Chances are you won't. Until then, put your laptop on a power saver mode and keep usage to a minimum. Keep the brightness of the screen down. This happened to my last laptop, I had to constantly keep changing the position of the cable. It eventually died, and I had to buy a Targus charger. Try looking at OfficeMax to find one. I'm sorry that they can't make these things more sturdy.

Fp0jrUtOaa	It's almost certainly a real merchant.  That doesn't mean that it's reputable.    As you noted, they are a Hong Kong based wholesaler.  They do appear to have a legitimate domain registration.  They run a mirror domain at wholesaleweddinggowndress.com.    As you noted, Google finds nothing negative under either names.  On the other hand, Google finds nothing positive either.  That suggests to me that this is a very immature company.  Reinforcing that opinion is their return policy.  They have one - that's good - but it says that you must return the merchandise within 3 days and sets some other criteria that are not very customer friendly.    They also are taking significant steps to hide their physical address.  Even to the point of requiring you to email them to get the address to which returns get sent.  That is a very disturbing sign.    Taken together, I think it is highly likely that this is a knock-off operation.  You'd probably get a white dress but I doubt that they are actually selling the brands that they claim.  The quality will be uncertain and if you are unsatisfied with your purchase, you will likely have a great deal of difficulty resolving any problems.    On the other hand, it is cheap.  It's up to you if you want to roll the dice.|`|xmzvUFR3aa	If you're weary about a website, then you shouldn't order from it. From what i saw on the site, I wouldn't trust it either.

zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance   (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission   (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).  http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject    But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:  -- You create your own "original" videos  -- You own all the copyrights concerned  -- The content is 100% yours, no income splitting if there's advertising revenue  -- You upload videos on a regular basis  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers  -- You're a resident in one of the 19 countries* where YouTube has a local site  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.    Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination   of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied comes to tens of thousands   of channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, at least 800 subscribers   and 25 videos, or maybe 400 subs and 50 vids. Some institutions with special  videos have become "partners" with somewhat less - like Concordia University.  http://youtube.com/user/ConcordiaUni    Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:  -- a special "banner" for your profile page   -- a banner alongside every played video   -- your channel-page video on "autoplay" ?  -- automatic "high-def" to all your videos  -- extra "profile" and new "bulletin" boxes  -- "special" videos over 10 minutes long  -- custom skins/sizes for the video player  -- the possibility of sharing in ad revenue  -- being at the very top of search results  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section  and which features only your own videos.    If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page,   click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner". Or click below:  http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...    I hope you find all my information helpful.    *These are the 19 nations with local YouTube sites: Australia, Brazil, Canada,   France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, south Korea, Mexico, the   Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, U.K., and the U.S.  (Even though you can also set your country preference to the Czech Republic,   India, Israel and Sweden, they do not have official local YouTube sites.)|`|WVOcvc8waa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXW12QFta...

RyvKws7Laa	Ulead Video Studio by Corel is sub $100.  It might be the best option in around that price range.  Though at least a few Yahoo! Answers folks seem to like something called AVS Video Editor.  I believe it is $50 (but has a free trial as most of them do).    Completely free is Video Spin.  I'm not sure how robust it is though.  You could look into that though just incase.  Worst case it doesn't work out, but you didn't lose any money on it.    If you are willing to go up a step, then consider Adobe Premiere Elements.  Its about $140.  Its reasonably robust.  Its not as good as the Pro version, but that is a big price difference.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.    Please dont tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.    None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure   your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter,   add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.    Several times each day, YouTube shuts down some of their   servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time.   That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios:   bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few   hours or by the next day.    If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet   files" and RAM (often times called "cache") are brimming to   the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result   being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to   a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way;   or C) never even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in   a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them -- or "clear your   cache" of "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history".  Then reboot.    Note 1: if you have Google Web Accelerator (or something  similar to it), dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   -- do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,   even though this contradicts all my advice. Not only does it   conflict with YouTube, simply clicking on "Don't Accelerate   This Website" will not help you whatsoever.    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "solutions"   have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of stupid   answer is:....[my paraphrase] "Although you can't watch or   access videos properly, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a peculiar fix that once worked for me was altering   the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|FTvkahKWaa	Try refreshing the webpage    or...    Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.    or..    It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.    Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .    It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.    ==========================???|`|NehXlaOMaa	move the circular thing near the pause sign to the right

Anyways, back to the point, this is all fresh to me as I just did this last week.  In short, YES you can do this, but you need alot of cables!!! Let me explain.    You need an HDMI cable, costing you in the region of 20-30 dollars for 2 meters.  The other end of the cable should be DVI male.  The difference between HDMI and DVI is that HDMI also recieves sound signals, but DVI is only for video, so in other words you need another cable for sound.  I got this from an xbox premium box, its a cable that plugs into the A/V and only sends sound signals.  There is also a microsoft made cable but ive only seen it for D-Sub.    :) hope i've helped

SJM0rzHtaa	Two ways...    The first way would be to connect your cable box (or satellite or Fios) directly to your monitor.  This works only if 1) you have a digital HD cable box with DVI or HDMI outputs and 2) your monitor is HDCP-compliant.    The second way would be to buy a TV tuner/capture card and plug that into your computer, which will allow your computer to display TV programming.  At the moment TV tuner / capture cards are restricted to ATSC or ClearQAM HDTV programming only (i.e. free HD from your local TV stations).  It will not allow you to watch QAM-encrypted high-definition premium channels like Discovery HD, HBO HD, etc (you can watch the standard-definition premium channels through coax though).    Hope this helps.|`|m9pXE9Puaa	you need a tv card and an external aerial to do this    you can get a TV card in usb form now and there really good to use    Just plug it in, install the drivers and plug the external aerial into it and done!|`|2yl8omcAaa	Yes, You will need to buy a TV tuner to hook it up to your pc.

RyvKws7Laa	I'd say buyer beware on a bank transfer.  I wouldn't buy unless they take pay pal or visa or something (so I can get help from a company with big nasty lawyers if I don't get the item).  At the very least, pay extra and have them ship it via some kind of traceable method (FedEx whatever).    As for the automatic bidding, no there isn't.  You just have to keep bidding until all of a sudden they "stop."  That means you've crossed their top bid that they put in.
zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance   (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission   (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).  http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject    But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:  -- You create your own "original" videos  -- You own all the copyrights concerned  -- The content is 100% yours, no income splitting if there's advertising revenue  -- You upload videos on a regular basis  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.    Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination   of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied comes to tens of thousands   of channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, at least 800 subscribers   and 25 videos, or maybe 400 subs and 50 vids. Some institutions with special  videos have become "partners" with somewhat less - like Concordia University.  http://youtube.com/user/ConcordiaUni    Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:  -- a special "banner" for your profile page   -- a banner alongside every played video ?  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay"  -- automatic "high-def" to all your videos  -- extra "profile" and new "bulletin" boxes  -- "special" videos over 10 minutes long  -- custom skins/sizes for the video player  -- the possibility of sharing in ad revenue  -- being at the very top of search results  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section  and which features only your own videos.    If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page,   click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner". Or click below:  http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...    I hope you find all my information helpful.|`|AA11312040	This a channel setting that is modified on YouTube via the Account settings, select "Branding Options."

Unless you have the computer with the ACTUAL sticker that has the license number on it and that was the number you entered, then you are most likely using a pirated key.    If you have the actual sticker on the computer that you are trying to install it on, then you simply have to call Microsoft and prove it to them.

In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

If your start menu and other things appear and your pc works as normally, then the explorer process is not starting. if not, you will need to repair windows. Before we reinstall windows, click New task again, type "%systemroot%\system32\restore\rstrui.ex... into the box and hit enter, try restoring your pc to a date before this started.    If that does not fix the problem, insert your XP cd into the drive, reboot, resist the urge to hit R to recover windows and instead follow the prompts to reinstalll windows, It should detect your current install and repair it for you.|`|zhIVzJj8aa	yeah those are never fun but usually they are easy fixes if you know how.  I am taking it that you don't have firewalls setup on your computer to catch things like this.  What you will have to do first and what i would do is a system restore.  Go back far enough before you even downloaded and installed the software on your computer, half of the time it will erase the virus before it does anything to your computer,  If that does not work you can use a recovery disk if you have one and that will get rid of it as well.  If you don't have that then you will have to install the OS again,  The problem with this is you will erase your hard drive because you cannot tell it to save your hard drive contents otherwise the virus will still be there,  If you have an external HDD then you will want to move all contents that you want to save then do it.

You can not actually have 4 GB of RAM, or memory, available to you with 32-bit because 32-bit technology limits your total RAM to 4 GB and your devices will use some of that 4 GB.

Also does the laptop work fine except for the keys sticking? Did any other parts of it get broken? If it is just the keyboard and u can't clean it u will probably have to buy a new keyboard for ur specific model, take apart the laptop and replace the keyboard. I doubt that best buy carries a keyboard that fits your laptop, this is a thing that u will have to buy online. If u are not technical enough to take apart your laptop and install a new key bored u MIGHT be able to take the laptop and the keyboard to best buy and have them install the new keyboard.<br>  <br>  so...<br>  If only the keyboard is broken i would first take it to best buy and see if they can clean it. If not then ask them if they carry a replacement. If they do not have a replacement while u are there u can ask them if you get a new keyboard if they will install it. If they were not able to fix it and do not have replacements u can search online for a key bored replacement for ur laptop. If u can not find one tell me what ur laptop model is and if i am on i will help u find one. <br>  <br>  sry i do not have a price. But hope this helps.|`|qgCwy4Pgaa	You could just take apart the case and rinse it out with warm soap and water, but yeah putting it back together might be tricky...<br>  <br>  I heard(and don't take my word for it fully) that service costs for computers could range upwards of 30-150 dollars depending on the situation.

3Eixj6Syaa	I'm not sure, but I think it works on something called a Cell ID. I assume this means that the phone is Identified by an ID, and Google needs the phone number to find which ID it needs. <br>  <br>  I'm not entirely sure why it would ask for your friends email adresses, but it seems that most of the phones that have this function, are smartphones, so will be email enabled, that may have something to do with it, but I don't know.<br>  <br>  Have a look at these links for more info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/topic.py?topic=19501" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=105928&topic=20071" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin...</a>
M7i30zP6aa	Computer freeze especially with a new laptop and Vista is not common, so in that case it's not normal.  <br>  <br>  Here's something you need to find out:<br>  1) How often does it freeze?  <br>  2) Does it have to do with the duration of usage or a specific program?<br>  <br>  Answers to questions above will help a tech support to get some idea at first.<br>  <br>  Here's what you could do:<br>  1) Since it's a new laptop you should get a restore disc.  Backup everything from your computer and use the restore disc to reinstall Vista.  With a clean installation I hope the problem will go away.<br>  2) If that doesn't help then I would suspect it's the hardware problem.  There could be something wrong with either your memory or graphics card.  In that case your option is to call ASUS or talk to the store where you bought it from.  Since it's new I am sure you will get the right person to take care of this issue.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

However, I have had mediocre experiences with Sony Products. They tend to be very Fragile. IMO, Toshibas can offer a good deal, but they are heavy and become outdated a weeks after you buy them. Sony sells luxury, Toshiba sells value. Go with what you can afford.

To read white spaces you should use cin.getline<br>  <br>  general format<br>  ----<br>  cin.getline(variable,size);<br>  -----<br>  int size =20;<br>  char name[20];<br>  cin.getline(name,size);<br>  <br>  now you will be able to input pretty girl|`|6MhUUO9Uaa	1. I am not sure what u want when u say you want to break out of  a loop .

Uninstall firefox<br>  2. Click "Start" "Run"<br>  3. Type "cmd" in the Run dialog box.<br>  4. When the black command window opens, type: chkdsk c: /r<br>  5. Press "Y" to the prompt to start the scan after a restart.<br>  6. close the black box window<br>  7. Click "Start" "Stutdown" Restart"<br>  <br>  When your computer restarts it will perform a chkdsk and try to repair any messed up things on your computer.<br>  <br>  When it is done, reinstall Firefox and try to access the internet again.|`|hCplhuIDaa	Try using apples browser it's the best around.Have you tried reloading your computer?
