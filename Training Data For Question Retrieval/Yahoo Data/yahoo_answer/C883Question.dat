The last week of january I was called into a meeting with my manager at work and was told that due to changes within the company and cost cutting, that they would be ending my employment (I had been there for 4 months, 2 months shy of the end of my probation period) Another manager was also present in the meeting - in the meeting I was told that I was to work until the Friday (I was told on the Monday) and that I would be paid wages up until the end of February.  There was another couple of girls who were finished and were told the same as me.      Now, 3 weeks down the line, I am due to start a new job on the 2nd March - I have recieved a letter from my previous employer basically saying that I won't be paid for a month, I will be paid for a week.  Obviously I'm not impressed as that was what I was told in the meeting - that I would be paid for all of Feb not just a week.  When I rang my manager to ask about it he basically admitted that he shouldnt have told me i'd be paid for a month, he should have said I'd just get paid for a week but he didn;'t realise until the next day - that isn't my fault?  He says he did try and get HR and payroll to pay me for the month but I don't think they're agreeing - but he says he'll let me know but he cant promise I will get paid for the month - nows he avoiding my calls.      Obviously I need the monthly pay - I have a mortgage to pay and am going to be 3 weeks without pay - and I have only been told a week before my mortgage/bills payments are due to be made - so I havent even been given anytime to make any other arrangements.       Does anyone know where i stand in regards to this or any advice ??

Unless we find mistakes or you owe other taxes, you should receive your refund by March 3, 2009   Do you think this date is accurate?? We have that stupid Emerald Card as well.  Anyone else have a DD for this day?  Either way, we WILL NEVER use HR Flop again.

Right now things are stressful because times are hard and people are afraid to lose their jobs. Well there is one girl that always seems to have it out for me. There have been girls that have left because they can't seem to take the drama with the Admin staff and it doesn't help this particular girl that is in her mid "30's" is best friends with my boss. We all have been here for quite a long time. I had politley asked her for a billing number for a project on Friday she writes back not only replying to me, but CC'ing my boss and says that she told me she would have to figure it out the following week..and she says don't you...remember? Thanks. I just don't get the need for this type of high school crap. This seems to be a regular occurance as well, ok so we all make mistakes some times, we all do. But asking for a billing number I don't feel needs to be CC'd to my boss with a reply making me look stupid because I didn't remember??? What gives? I am constantly feeling cornered by her..I think something needs to be said..but I'm sure if I say something to her face today she will probably say something to make me feel even more stupid since she thinks she is so superior to everyone else. Any suggestions? Thanks!! :)

20090223064658AA3DwI3	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	A question about how to list this on my Resume?	Everything else on my Resume is fine. The other places that I worked at were at least around a year or two that I stayed there. But with my last job, I was laid off on December 22, 2008. I started on August 7, 2008. Soo...just a little over 4 months. So basically what my dillema is...the other two jobs on my resume say: 2004-2005 and 2005-2007. But I'm not sure if the 4 months exactly 'justifies' listing it as 2008 as a year. In a way, doesn't that indicate that I worked that whole year if I list it that way, or no?      But also, I'm iffy about it looking like this:      08/2008 - 12/2008   2005 - 2007   2004 - 2005      Obviously...that looks mismatched and doesn't match the other 'whole' years. Is it okay to do that, or should I just stick with 2008?

20090223073025AAkfgGl	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Should I take a new job?	I have a well paying job in the private sector.  There doesn't appear to be an immediate danger of layoffs, but one never knows.  I've just been offered positions in multiple federal government agencies, which pay a good deal less.  Government jobs are hard to come by (it took 8 months to get these offers), so I'm reluctant to turn them down.  And I hate my current job.  Should I just take them, knowing that there is value in security of a government job?  Or should I stick with the higher paying job, at the risk of losing it in the next year (but having made enough extra money to make up for a gap) plus be miserable every day?  The difference is about 10%, which may not sound like much, but I'm in a high paying position so this is not a small amount of money.      P.S.  I'm currently JUST making my bills.  If I take the cut, I'll be dipping into savings.  Which, given that I've been well paid, are enough to sustain the difference for a couple of years.  However, that will put kid's college fund in jeopardy.

20090223052636AA641Tt	Business & Finance;Credit	Credit report and credit score advice?	Hi,   I have recently viewed my experian credit report as i am looking to get a loan to pay back my credit cards as the interest on them is meaning i cant get my balance down. I know my credit is not perfect so i thought id get my free report i was entitled to. I have approx 10 accounts, half of which are settled and the rest i am keeping up with payments but unfortunatley i got into some trouble last year paying off the cards. I have one credit card with an AP-arrangement to pay (not a default) and another card with 2 late payments 2months in a row in the early part of 2008. Although these are on my record it does show that ive kept all other accounts, store cards, phone bills etc perfectly up to date and since these blemishes all payments on the credit cards have been on time. I dont know what my credit score is as it was going to cost ￡15 to get the score. Is there a service where i can go and speak to someone who can advise me on my how my credit score will affect what i can apply for and the best way of gettin a loan that doesnt have a ridiculously high rate on it. My circumstances have changed since last year and with my wages i could easily prove with my payslip that i can pay back a loan comfortably every month. I dont want to just apply for loans without seeking advice as this will affect my credit score if i keep getting turned down   Any help would be greatly appreciated   Thanks

I stopped paying on my capital one credit card a few months ago. the balance was very low (under $300) but they kept charging me an annual fee.

Again, I called them and the assured me it would be taken care of but never was. After that I told them I was not paying them again until they dropped these charges. They now call me every day startig at 8 am and do not stop until the evening (at least 10 calls a day). I keep telling them to drop the charges and I will pay. They always assure me that if I pay, the charges will be dropped on my next statement. I told them I;ve played that game before. I have talked to friends who have had similar problems with Capital One. They all told me that they ended up paying. I refuse to give in! Any suggestions?

20090223071139AAVT96z	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Should we do a voluntary repossession on our car?	My husband is being laid off this week. We are trying to plan ahead using "worst case" senario. We just bought our house in Sept. 08. Our house payment is very reasonable and we were not one of these couples who purchased a home that they could not afford. Saving our home and feeding our kids is the first priority. I currently work and receive monthly child support benefits from my first marriage. With my husband's unemployment benefits that he will be receiving we should be able to "squeek" by. The only thing that would put us in the hole is his car payment. He is MAJOR upside down. It is a 2007 Scion TC that we own around $22000 for. Would it be more benificial to let this car go back to the bank and take $3000 and go pay cash for a used car? I understand what this would do to his credit, however, it would give us enough money to live until he can find something else. After all, we do not plan on buying anything on credit and we already have our house. Remember...I am toying with a worse case senario.

She said I will be put on a three month trial before the job goes permanent so I am currently just a temp worker.. I have been here for a month but this job is not for me as I have a feeling she wants to make it full-time when she finally does make it permanent. For personal reasons which I do not wish to disclose to her, I am unable to do it full-time. Should I let her know now or just look out for another job before I quit?      The reason why I'm finding it difficult to tell her is because if I tell her now, she might let me go within the next few days and then I would have to sign on. I would much rather sign up with a temp agency and then have a job ready before I tell her. But that might take several weeks.

I lost my job back in December due to the economy?  I've always had a job but never a career.  In my last line of work, I was a building maintenance engineer.  Although it was a great job and the people I worked with and for were great, I always felt it wasn't the right line of work for me.  All my life I kind of fell into jobs where I got the "hook up" type deal and never really gave a thought on what I really wanted to do.  Now, it's that time where I have to sit and think to myself what exactly is it I want to do as in a career.  I've asked family, friends and former co-workers for advice.  I've even visited a few schools to see what they're offering.  I would have never thought it would be this difficult to figure out what career I might be interested in.  Does anyone out there in Yahoo!Land have any advice or any suggestions in career choices.  I would really appreciate it.

I moved to NY in Jan 04 due to a death in the family.  Beginning in Nov 2003, I began to transfer accounts and forward mail, and actually moved in 2004.  I filed MA taxes in 2004 and now NY is sending me bills to pay $3000 of taxes, interest and fees for not filing in 2003 in NY.     I stalled them by sending in my tax returns from 03 and 04, but I know they'll want more proof of my residence.  I may not be able to prove residency in MA after Nov 15, 2003, due to not having a signed lease (lived with roommate starting in sept 03 and had no bills except cell phone in my name).    What can I do to prove my residence?  I've thought of getting driver license records, but don't know what my license number was in MA to request it. I thought bank records---but Fleet bank is now Bank of America and I don't know if they'd keep them this long.  All of my paper copies of everything were accidentally shredded....   Help!  Thanks for any insight.   Lisa

20090223055406AA7lPQ2	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Is it wise for me to use leverage to purchase dividend paying stocks?	Is this the time, between now and say summer, for the average investor to    borrow money to purchase buy and hold stocks?  A basket of normally expensive blue    chip type stocks that have high dividend yields and are thought to be value    priced in this current market?.       These stocks are expensive to buy for investors like me who invest using a    portion of our paycheque.  We are forced to purchase index funds/mutual    funds until our wealth is high enough that we can justify paying brokerage    and trading fees for ETF's or individual stocks.  Perhaps now is a time to    consider borrowing money to purchase long-term buy and hold dividend    yielding stocks because the dividend yields and potential share price    increase will erase the cost of the transaction fees.          Here are my thoughts:          -Yes dividends are not considered safe until they are PAID but once paid for    me they are taxed at 25% of my normal income tax rate (Cash interest is    taxed at the full rate for example)..          -Assuming (in Canada) the interest owing on borrowed money used to fund    equities purchases is tax deductable.          -Or else I can borrow money to contribute to a Retirement tax shelter (RRSP)    and instead of claiming interest as a tax deduction, I would get a automatic    reduction of income taxes owing.  In my case it'll be 34% of the amount I    contribute to the retirement shelter.          -As a personal creed I never borrow money unless I have an equal amount    available to pay off that debt.          Now this may not be a course of action for myself but what about others?  Is    leverage recommended for the little long term investor?

When I got my first credit cards (2 cards) I maxed them out pretty much right away trying to get things for college - books, furniture for my apartment, etc... I was making the minimum payments, which of course, got me nowhere close to paying the credit cards off. Eventually, I stopped making payments because of personal circumstances. I owed a total of about $3,000. Just last month, I settled with the companies (I had been sent to collections) and paid off all of the credit cards.      I know the situation is all my fault...but I really need to try and rebuild my credit score so I can qualify for future students loans, etc. I also hope to eventually refinance my car at a lower rate... everything that would require me to have a reasonable credit score.      I know that I could raise my score by getting a credit card - and yes, now I know how to manage it... But I'm not sure how long I should wait to try and get one. I don't want to keep applying for credit cards and getting denied because I know that each time a credit check is run, it lowers my credit score.      So how long should I wait before trying to apply for a card?      Also, does anyone know of the best place to find a student credit card?      I dont need a high limit - I'm only going to use it for small purchases to help raise my score... and I already know that the interest rate is going to be high.      Thanks for your help!

Hey I recently graduated in engineering and joined a prominent oilfield services company. I've been a very good student and my resume looks pretty good. This was pretty much the second company to offer me a job and I couldn't bother going for more interviews, so I just took the job.      Initially it looked good, the salary was above average and there was the really attractive field bonus. But now, I've realised that other companies pay a lot more for the same job, and I've yet to see any of that field bonus, since they say trainees aren't eligible for it.      My seniors are advising me to be patient and get through a couple of years after which they claim I will reap the benefits, but I'm getting tired of the hard physical work that I'm not being paid all I should be for.      I do enjoy the work, it's challenging and fun, but can't get rid of the nagging feeling that I can do better.      Should I stay put and count my blessings or go for greener pastures?

20090223072921AAFfc4F	Business & Finance;Credit	Collections Litigation Department Summoned Me?	Back in 2002 I opened a credit card with the worst credit card company, providian.  It was for $300 credit limit and I defaulted on the payments out of young stupiditity.  They said I owed them now $900 and I then made arrangements for them to take $50 out of my account every month to get out of this bad debt.  It wasn't changing the amount onthe balance owed so I stopped paying all together.  The credit card was bought out by a collection agency and they have been harassing me for the money ever since.  It's 2009 now and just shy of statue of limitations.  This account has negatively affected my credit for 6 years.  I have paid probably close to $800 already to providian for this credit card and now the the collection agency is asking for over $1000.  I have tried many times to ask for the paperwork to show me how they came up with the amount of $1000 and they refuse to give me any legal documents to show me.  When I got summoned they only gave me my original agreement to the credit card.  Now I have 20 days to answer the summons, but I am still getting calls from the litigation department, is this legal?  I once again asked for the papers and she said she doesnt have them that it should be in my statements.  I asked for them to negotiate a number with me and they wont do much but shave off about a $100 and they also told me I owed more money thay what the stated on the summons.  What should I do?  What happens in court?  Should I get a lawyer?  What kind of information should I bring to court?  How much will this cost me and do I have a chance of a judge understanding my case and giving me a lowest amount to pay?  Please help me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

20090223073724AAYh933	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	Are my Medical Insurance Premiums deductible for 2008 Tax Return?	While searching Internet, I read that "You cannot deduct insurance premiums paid by your employer or by making pre-tax premiums you pay as a result of a salary reduction agreement with your employer. If the premiums are included in box 1 of your W-2, they are deductible."      I did not understand the meaning of the first sentence, so I asked my employer but they told me to ask a tax professional for an answer.   So I checked my W-2 to see if the second sentence makes sense or matches my case.      Box 1 of my W-2 is the sum of Base Hourly wages, Overtime wages and Vacation pay from my last pay check in 2008.   I did not receive the entire sum amount throughout the year because Federal Medicare, Federal Social Security and Federal Income Tax Withheld were reduced as well as the "Medical Insurance premiums" as deductions.  This means that the premiums should be included in box 1 of my W-2.  Am I collect?      To make it simple, I like to use numbers from each pay check as an example,   Base Hourly wage: $2000   Federal Medicare:$30   Federal Social:    $125   Federal Income:  $300   Medical Insurance: $315   ---------------------   Net Pay: $1230 (=2000-30-125-300-315)   I am only paid this "net pay" amount biweekly, not the amount shown as "Base Hourly wages" which are shown in box 1 of the W-2.      Can I add my Medical Insurance Premiums (about $7500) to other itemized deduction items ?
