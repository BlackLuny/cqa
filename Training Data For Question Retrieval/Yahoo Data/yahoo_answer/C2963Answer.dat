Cq8gHlt7aa	The sun is the ultimate energy source. plants get their energy from the sun, animals get their energy from plants, and some animals get their energy from other animals. each time an animal eats something for food, only 10% of the energy is transfered.<br>  <br>  So if you ate a cow, you would only get (roughly estimated) .001% of the suns energy, because the cow you ate, comsumed grass, and the grass absorbed sunlight.<br>  <br>  The farther up the pyramid you go, the smaller the percent.|`|QGrnEIETaa	i don't even know what it means....<br>  <br>  :D
oIRLs6Spaa	Your question is pretty vague, but when you clarified you said you wanted details about digestion.  Here's an article I wrote on that:<br>  <a href="http://www.flytrapcare.com/venus-fly-trap-background-information.html?start=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.flytrapcare.com/venus-fly-tra...</a>|`|QGrnEIETaa	The venus fly trap has enzymes in it's system that create digestion in it so the fly is digested.|`|ofSBjcYuaa	a venus (not cenus) fly trap uses little hairs on the inside of its mouth to tell when something lands in there, then it shuts

You know that you pay in taxes to recycle then you pay the recycling companies again....it doesn't make sense and is a bunch of stupid **** that teachers force on you.  Better idea make sure the trash hits the trash can...only recycling that makes sense is like aluminum cans...all other recycling is substized by the governement|`|QGrnEIETaa	confusing.....<br>  <br>  <br>  :D|`|2nXrQhkeaa	Naughty joke goes here.. lol|`|8PAfsI7Iaa	i dont know but thts a good question, you should look it up on google or somthing!

5TKEtXERaa	If you go to the website below and enter your zipcode and what you want to recycle it will tell you where to take them. As far as throwing it all in the garbage bin unless you have single stream recycling and your trash goes to a mrf then you are just filling a landfill up.|`|QGrnEIETaa	Look it up on google...<br>  <br>  :D|`|6074ba9150b4dd8433de8921a00a080eaa	You can go to a large supermarket to recycle your recyclables. I think Walmart is a good place to go. So whenever you need to do some shopping, always have the things you want to recycle inside your trunk.
iTetA3oCaa	Under the endangered species act as currently managed there is no protection for any species.  Being placed on their list is almost an assurance that the species will become extinct.  Their record is not good.<br>  <br>  Their population counts on proposed species are atrocious.  For example their count on prairie dog infested acreage in Colorado was less then 100,000 acres originally,  A local farm group came up with over 600,000 acres of severely infested ground in less than a week.  When a follow up was made it showed that even the local farm groups count was way low.<br>  They do not know what they are doing.<br>  I have long proposed that we should declare the organisms that cause Yellow Fever and Malaria as endangered along with the mosguitos that cause them.  The old swamps around Washington D. C. should be declared prime habitat and maybe we would get rid of some stupid politicians from those diseases.  That would be a real benefit to mankind.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	How could U even ask a question like that? It is so open ended -- maybe if U asked about a particular species this question would make more sense. If an animal is deemed endangered, of course we would want to protect it's food sources and living quarters. Are U a housing developer that sees all land masses as potential $$$ or something? If we do not keep swamps, rain forests, marshlands, etc. open and thriving, we are destroying a big chunk of wildlife and our own survival. <br>  Everything is tied to something else. When humans get too crowded or too densely populated, they suffer diseases and stress. The only "mistake" God ever made was humans, if U want to consider all the damage that we have done to the environment. Humans have greedily caused damage to mountain tops, coast lines, and now we are polluting outer space and under sea, as fast as the ice caps are melting and we can get subs down there to lay down mineral rights's markers. Shame on us as a species.|`|723c7cb5953ba3908aba706688deac1aaa	Species and ecosystems are interrelated. We do not fully understand these interrelationships. From a human-selfish point of view, damage to other species and to ecosystems could harm human beings in ways we might not be able to predict.<br>  <br>  The wording of the question makes me think it is some sort of set homework question. <br>  <br>  I don't quite understand what "From an ecosystem goods and services perspective" means.
