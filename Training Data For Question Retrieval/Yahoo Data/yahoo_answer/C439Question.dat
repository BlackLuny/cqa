20090307013812AAS8uV0	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Apartment Air Conditioning During Winter?	Hello, Everyone!      This is my first Yahoo! Answers question.  Let's all drink to that!  Anyway, I live in an apartment complex in Dallas, TX.  The apartment is a flat $950/month, with all bills included.  I am a person who relies heavily on a cool environment to get to sleep.  We moved into the complex last October, and had great air conditioning for about a month.  It then shut off, and we all figured it was the landlord's decision for the winter months.  Over the last couple nights, however, it has started significantly heating up again outside, and we are miserable.  It was only an hour ago that I realized that, after doing some searching online, perhaps our personal AC unit was just malfunctioning.  I know that the answer is as simple as a walk or call to the office, but I work all day tomorrow and would like a more concrete answer now.  Unfortunately, at this time of night, there is no one I can call that works for my complex, so it would have to wait until Sunday.  Anyway, I know I'm ranting, but have any of you ever heard of or lived in an apartment complex that shuts off the air conditioning during the winter months?  Thanks.

Eventually she's going to give me the option to buy it. The owner is renting it out to me for a little of nothing. I mean Nothing..the deal is sweet. here in florida the average rent for a 2 story house is like 1700.00 a month. Im renting this house on a lake for $600.00 a month. The house is in forclosure and she brought the deeds from the owner for only a $1000.00. Its very nice 2 story home that sits on the lake. Anywho, the catch is, it needs a lot of work on the inside and thats where the cheap rent comes in. im renting it as is. The previous owner pulled the base board up and there is other things, but this i want to know. Baseboard is a lot of money, how can i make the house look decent without buying it. if i buy it it'll be like $4000.00 and the whole house needs it. I can't afford that right now. Can i use an alternative?

20090307045900AAEfcGh	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Housewives and Househusbands..... Do you ever get excited over the little things?	For example:  Yesterday I decided to finally purchase the towels I wanted.  I had all right bath towels, hand towels and washcloths and they would have served me fine for more years to come.  But they were gifts and I wanted all white.  It is so much easier to have all white and be able to bleach them when you need to without worrying about the color fading.  Or not having to worry about the embroidery needing to be pressed so it lays flat.       So I walked in the store, grabbed two dozen bath towels and 4 dozen each of hand towels and washcloths.  I actually could not wait to get home and get them washed so I could put them away.  Now I know that sounds boring, but now I have an abundance of what I have wanted for the last ten years.  I just stood back and looked in the linen closet and said thanks to God that I was able to get what I wanted.  And to have enough to make life easier.  I also purchased new dishcloths and dishtowels last week and that was nice too.      So what was the last thing you got excited over that would sounding boring or small to others?

The amp (homemade) currently has castors (non-swivel, that's what I want) that have a hard rubber wheel - every time I wheel it along, every impact or bump goes straight to the electronics in the amplifier, or dislodges the battery which, being pretty heavy, causes damage inside the amp. I need some rather small pneumatic wheels to stop this from happening. anything 8 inches or smaller, or some castor-siz pneumatic wheels on castors would be great, links, ebay references, etc, any help you can give. Nobody suggest bunnings, then just don't have the right thing. I live in wahroonga, Sydney, NSW, 2076.   The total height of the castor I'm currently using is 4.5 inches. More more than 6 inches total height with the new castor could create problems - finding a castor this small is a problem, hence asking yahoo...   huge answers when I asked this question but I neglected the height info, hoping to get the same response this time...

I found a few recipes online and used to easiest one I could find, but they haven't turned out how I thought they would!   I used 300g Bicarb of Soda, 100G citric Acid   Mixed them together and added some Red and blue food colouring (Hoping it'll turn purple!), and 2 tsps of Vanilla fragrance then mixed it all again, then got a bottle to squirt water into the mixture, I squirted 3 times, mixed and did this until it was like damp sand...   Then when I tried to put it into the moulds, the mixture wouldn't stick together to make one round ball and I don't know why...   I gave up on trying and just made half circle ones and left them for 24hours. Now they are really hard, the bath bombs i've seen and was trying to make have been hard, but can crumble away if you wanted to do that!   They were not the right colour either, they turned out pink with white bits in it! Did I just not mix it all in good enough for that, or was the mixture not fine enough??   Should I be using something else to make them like I want them?   There are so many different ways to make them I'm getting really confused about what I should use!

He did not seal it and it was just a crap job. We left him cash and he did not want us to pay VAT so he obviously wasnt going to tell the tax man he had done the work.We did not get a reciept. My dad was also having some work done by him and the tiler did not return to finish it once my dad had payed him the day before, also no VAT or no reciept. (there were a few tiles left to be put in and he did not return to do it once he had been payed.)  We have rang him daily and he will not answer, so we wrote a letter, with photos in, recorded delivery, it was reveived, opened and then sent back to us saying the person does not live at this address.....what can we do next? We had to get another tiler in to do the job and he said it was a cowboys job....we even had to replace all the tiles, when we took them off the adhesive had been put on so thick it was still wet, 1 month on! Help....what can we do with no reciept! We want the money back! We have a couple of photos.Thanks.

20090307071436AA4FcJ2	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	What kind of music helps plants grow the best?	A few days ago my class and I was assigned to grow Rosemary seeds and by Mother's day, whoever has the largest plant (stalk size, leaf amt, etc.) will get a prize.      But, we I accepted this challenge, I realized I knew nothing about Rosemary plants.      One thing I believe is is that music is highly acceptable with plants. Is that true? I cannot ratify this because there are so much people who have inaccurate information on the internet. But, I've seen some websites that say that the vibrations from the music help strengthen the stalks of the plants. That is why I believe this is true.      I know from research that Rosemary like hot weather because they originated from the Mediterranean Sea. This is becoming an issue because I have mine on my window sill, where there is not that much heat. I was thinking of making a little minor greenhouse for it but then I thought "What's gonna happen when its too big for it?" Yes, I can't transfer it outside in my garden because I need to bring it back on Mother's Day for my teacher to evaluate it.      If there's anything else you can tell me for my first-time plant issues, just tell me:) And if you have a site/myspace add my site! -->  http://www.myspace.com/cake_bits

Hi-   This Kenmore gas range was left to me by my grandma who bought it new from Sears.   I am sure you may have seen them before, but I have surfed all over and cannot find one exactly  like it. The door next to the oven is a broiler (not a pot warmer), which was never used until I got it.   The center square griddle (shown in photo) can be swapped on the center burner. Needs refurbishing, but we still use it almost everyday. I would like to find it a good home (as strange as that sounds) as there is a story that this stove was a surprise to my grandma, when they had picked out a less expensive stove, my grandpa bought this as a surprise. We can't keep it..... Thanks for any help!!!!!!       I have the original stove handle and burner knob. I have put links to the photos below.       http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr210...     http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr210...     http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr210...

20090307072623AAH0lta	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Too windy for my Lemon Meyer tree?	Hi,      I planted a Lemon Meyer Tree about three weeks ago and it's starting to look pretty bare. My area is a pretty windy area and I was hoping I would be able to grow the little guy here but now I'm second guessing myself.       I thought about digging it up and repotting it but I hope I could have it grow up to a large tree.        We have other trees growing in my area so I know that there are trees which are able to tolerate the wind here so do you think it will eventually be able to tolerate the wind as well when it starts to get older?
20090307074522AAzJQC6	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	How do I deal with Scott's lawn service?	I hired Scott's lawn service in October of 08 and I was told that they would fertilize the yard 3 times a year. Well they did, they did it in October, November and December..3 months in a row.      The first I agreed to, the second Time they called to let me know they were coming I told them not to, they did anyway. The third time I didn't even get a call, they just showed up.      Now my lawn is burned out in several places because I believe they over fertilized it. I was new grass and has just been planted that Spring.      Now they are demanding 140.00, and when I contacted the Manager they said that they did nothing wrong and I needed to play the bill.   I have no problem paying my bills but not for lousy service.      Can I fight them on this or should I just pay them and be done with it. I'd really hate to do that because big companies try to walk on you all the time and I am fed up with it.      Thanks
