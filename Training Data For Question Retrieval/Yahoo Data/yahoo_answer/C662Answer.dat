uF5Xgtgraa	Did she ever stop to think the reason his family is rich is because they don't go wasting money on frivolous gifts?  Or expensive gifts for someone they barely met?<br>  <br>  Your friend is in the relationship for the $$, hopefully this fella figures it out...|`|DF22BQ3yaa	In this case it is best to just listen to her without the exchange of your words or your imput in their relationship because worse case scenario, she will more than likely blame you for their breakup (when it happens)<br>  <br>  Just be a friend a listen since you see she is going against what you are telling her. Another thought is since he has loads of money and she keeps spending on him, he may feel like she os only doing the gift giving to get a grand gift from him but that is something he is not going to give her since he has already caught on to her gaudy taste in gifts and possilby just trying to get him to spend money on her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|ezT7xruoaa	She sounds a bit... superficial?... maybe just let her be. They will break up eventually anyways, if he's such a cheapskate.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	She will probably have to learn the hard way.  Buying a guy gifts is nice but if he doesn't reciprocate it probably means that he isn't that into her so you need to tell her he is probably thinking that she is pathetic and she needs to knock it off|`|307b068fb54739ff84dc4c0f98a1d055aa	let her get on with but to stop moaning to you if she keeps on spending loads.you've said your piece,not much more you can do.just tell her to stop moaning to you.he may be rich but he sounds like a right tight wad.|`|TCpWVW4Raa	It's not about how much money you spend on each other, it's about the thought.. Atleast he bought her multiple items.. and not just one thing|`|CysVPqXsaa	Tell her that if she continues to buy him expensive things and he keeps buying her cheap things, then she should buy him something cheap cause he is gonna make her reeeeaaaaallllllyyyyy upset, and tell her you are only telling this to her because you care about her. Also, I think he is using her to get things for himself, and she should break up with him before it's too late!!!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!!! Good Luck!!!!!|`|vBmyBI4waa	sit her down make her listen tell her he is playing her for a fool and he knows that she is going to spend loads of money on him he knows that but if she doesnt and he gets a fright and she tells him straight treat my like yr gf and not something else or its over spend as much on me as i do u or u could pull him and tell him to stop messing yr m8te around bt make sure he dosnt s.h.i.t stir u know|`|PvkbBJMVaa	Tell her that she doesn't need to spend a lot of money on him. Any present that comes from the heart and is given a lot of thought is worth more than anyone can buy. She shouldn't complain for the same reasons. If he feels differently, then he doesn't deserve her.|`|DlAPD2UNaa	Tell her that this could of happened because he didn't want to embarass her when she hadn't got him much so he didnt get her much.<br>  Also, he wasn't lying he did spend alot on her seeing as they had only be dating for a couple of days.|`|XoKcMlRAaa	As "EG" - Everyone's Grandad - I've been stepdad to 4 lovely young ladies, now @ 18-34<br>  <br>  Do click my name & see my 2/3 new '360 blog' entries, posted today, as 1/2 are directly relevant<br>  <br>  <br>  Short reply?<br>  <br>  He aint worthy of such a Princess<br>  <br>  <br>  Tell her to join <a href="http://www.MillionaireMatch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.MillionaireMatch.com</a><br>  & say MrVersatile48 recommended her, OK?<br>  <br>  <br>  My allegorical, metaphorical headline there, to whet ya appetite, is >><br>  <br>  "Richer than Croesus as a son of the Almighty Creator"<br>  <br>  <br>  See also <a href="http://www.practicalprosperity.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.practicalprosperity.co.uk</a><br>  <br>  & <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090305065223AANa5y7&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  "Live long & prosper!"

Oh, and ask her questions (not too personal at first, or you'll creep her out) about herself because people love talking about themselves.|`|JB8gqDuPaa	walk up and introduce your self.ask her to sell you your favourite liquor.She is probably gonna ask whats that.Then tell her or be play full and ask her to guess..<br>  then pick up a conversation from there|`|mshewx1maa	The only pick up line that works:  "Hi my name is ____.

The first thing will happen an thats number 1. you are going to get horney 2.kiss her on her neck an lips. 3. grab her hair gentlely. 4. go down on her an take ur time dont be and a rush an start to lick her click back in forth she going to love it after that slowely stick one of your finger inside her click<br>  take ur time we are very sensitive in that area. 5. then you going to have her to get on top of you in ride you now when you get ready to *** or feel like you are ready to *** get up so the sex can last longer<br>  back to licking an kissing her licps then you clamb on top in begain stroking her not fast cuss you are going to *** faster. i can tell you more if you like this hit me me back at popmycherry24@yahoo.com|`|gQBqgzJmaa	You need to go to the public library and look in the section on sex and relationships.  Seriously.  Know what you're going to be dealing with (and where to find the clitoris, very important!).<br>  <br>  A couple of other things:<br>  <br>  1)  Most (9/10) women don't orgasm from intercourse alone, so don't be surprised when she doesn't.  You need to stimulate her clit.  Ask her what feels good and do it.  It might help if she learns to masturbate so she can show you what feels good.<br>  <br>  2)  You might want to consider having a more in-depth conversation with your fiance about sex before you get married.  Sex is a big, big part of a relationship, and sexual incompatibility is a big problem in relationships.  You might want to talk about your expectations, such as:<br>  <br>  -  How often do you expect to have sex once you're married?<br>  -  How open are each of you to "experimenting" with new things (threesomes, anal sex, tying each other up, etc.)?<br>  -  Are you both open to performing oral sex?<br>  -  What do each of you consider "cheating"? (sex, kissing, too-personal talking, etc)?<br>  -  Do either of you have any usual (or usual) sexual fantasies that you'll want to explore in this marriage?  If the other person open to exploring these?  If not, are you willing to go the rest of your life without exploring these fantasies?<br>  <br>  This might feel like an awkward conversation, but you need to talk about these things.  If you're not ready to talk about sex, as two mature adults, with the person you want to spend your life with, maybe you're not ready to get married yet.  Hope this helps.|`|9qf2HSGYaa	I agree with A New Fisher, dont rush it.  Dont expect it to happen right away, maybe hold each other and get to the sex later (days later). Somewhere down the line after you have been married for awhile, you wont be able to keep your hands off of each other. Also, sex for a female is not very enjoyable the first couple of times (maybe because the focus is on getting it right, or how much it will hurt). Wish you the best, glad you guys waited until you get married!!!|`|pCk98v3Daa	As stated in previous answers it will be very awkward for both of you because of your lack of experience.  My only advice would be to take your time with gentle kisses and soft caresses.  It will get better in time.  It's wonderful that you both have abstained from sex until marriage.|`|6sXG3Plkaa	The first time is awkward so don't expect to much.  Just be romantic make it a memorable experience.  It will be more at leading up at the moment then the actually moment itself.  Have candles, rose petals, etc.  the things you see on movies and think how cheesy.  Use it.  Make it a romantic night.|`|hdTztmKDaa	just take things slow. Just because your getting married doesnt mean you absolutely HAVE to have sex. The more you guys pressure yourselves about it, the less enjoyable it will be. Just relax. Spend a nice evening with each other if your not ready. Dont rush it. Just lay together and hold each other. Let things go from there. No worries, u'll be fine.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	are you for real? lmao|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	the easy answer is, turn down the lights, get into bed with nothing on and discover each other.<br>  <br>  The more complete answer is;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-14-2004-55443.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-14-20...</a>|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	Im not going to lie the first time for you both is not going to be all that great, Things will be awkward and maybe even embarrassing. Just start by making out of your married the both of you are ready for sex and its not like you have to worry about rejection. Start by sitting on a bed and making out and let nature take its way. Just don't expect the first time to be amazing. Everything gets better with time. Just enjoy each other.|`|gfHutvEFaa	just start by looking her in the eyes, take both your hands and place them lightly on the side of her face, pull her to you and start kissing her lightly. When she starts to respond more (you'll know when this happens) pull her closer and run your hands lightly up and down her arms, once the tongue shows up, pick her up and place her gently on the bed (looking in her eyes while doing this), then start to take your shirt off (be confident even if you don't feel confident), then lean down and claim her mouth (harder, tongue, etc...), she will start to respond quite a bit (even if she's shy), then while your still kissing, start caressing her lightly (u know where), the rest will come naturally.<br>  <br>  Have fun, congrats and good luck!!|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Get a book on "Forplay" as this is most important for first timers.  You want to build up to that intial intimate moment when you have intercourse.  That way it is less intrusive for her and more of a good feeling.|`|pVuNxfBZaa	Are you serious?
hjc2y3TMaa	YES! I do not want anything to do with a penis that stands at attention for just about any reason. I like one I can go to work on.<br>  My husband can be very quick if its been too long between sessions but he can also last and last and let me tell you, after 14 years---it works great for me. I am so disappointed when he blows his load early and my ride is over with only one turn to have my time.  <br>  We have friends who get it up for no good reason at all IMO and I think they are gross. Sorry.|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	No, I started dating my husband because we were easily turned on by each other and had good sex. Obviously there was much more to it than just sex as our relationship progressed, but let's face it, physical/sexual attraction is what brings most couples together in the first place. When I dated my husband and even when we were first married, all we did was have sex. He initiated all of the time and of course I was only too happy to accept his offers. It "was" awesome. I think the majority of women, including myself, like their man to prove and show to them that we are sexually desireable to them. It's the best feeling in the world when you are in a relationship with a man who wants you sexually all of the time and the added bonus to this is if he really loves and cares about you and he makes you his wife.|`|3LL4CEHWaa	Just like guys, women are not that interested in "hard to get".|`|LS8LcuRaaa	No, I prefer a guy who is turned on easily by me.|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	No - i like my boyfriend to be as turned on as possible!<br>  <br>  then i feel more confident!!!|`|5cJrnaQaaa	Not for me..|`|u1uECuFNaa	No.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Hell no!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Joe, what do you really know about what other men get, huh?

No. I need some movin, switching it up, role playing, dirty talk, etc....<br>  <br>  I don't know any women who wants her man to just lie there.

But since I am here I will answer your second and third question.  My favorite quality of my husband that I would never change is that he is a very caring and loving man.

I hope I could help.|`|eawDlYHnaa	not sure- id seen your 2nd question before your 1st question and after i answered the 2nd one, i answered the 1st one.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	"Negativity Bias", Psychology 101.<br>  <br>  Look it up.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	I did not see your other Q.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I dunno.  I answered the favorite thing question right away.  I could easily list 10 things I like about my wife.<br>  <br>  During marriage counseling, my wife won't say a single goddm nice thing about me.  Why is this?  Then she says that I am too nice, and all my nice behavior gives her the creeps.  She said I need to stop hugging her and saying i love her.<br>  <br>  It's almost as if the purpose of life is to have conflict.  Being nice doesn't lead to conflict, being mean does.  People get turned on by fighting.  So, people have figured this out, and your question about the good things... well, it just isn't sexy.<br>  <br>  Pokin' your spouse in the eye, well that's sexy.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	We learn this in school at a very young age. How to focus on the negative, and everything is a problem to be solved etc etc. When people can escape form their 'focus on the negative' mentality they will find themselves with happier children, spouses and themselves. It interferes with acceptance.<br>  <br>  We are taught to strive for perfection rather than acceptance.<br>  <br>  Another good question might be: What type of person would you marry if you were blind? (How would you know you were attracted to them?)

Kennen das kind vielleicht kaum und haben keinen weiteren bezug, weil die mutter selbst nur das geld ,nicht aber die einmischung oder die pr?senz des vaters wünscht.<br>  <br>  Vielleicht sind das auch z.t. v?ter die das kind überhaupt nicht haben wollten. Zum kinder machen geh?ren immer zwei aber die entscheidung ob das kind zur welt kommen soll oder nicht , wird wohl in den meisten f?llen von den frauen allein getroffen. <br>  Der mann fühlt sich bei der entscheidungsfindung übergangen und verabschiedet sich.<br>  <br>  Vielleicht sind das z.t. auch m?nner die charakterschweine oder unterentwickelte affen sind.

65ojSBXgaa	I'm sorry to hear that, finding out that someone you loved and trusted would do this to you its like a kick in the stomach, I know. My advice to you is wait to get married now that you found out what happened you cant rush into things because you are pregnant I know he's the father of your baby but I believe you can still be with each other and work things out but first you need to heal from this terrible wound. I see you are angry? Hey im with you and I understand you need to ask him Why? what was the reason for him to do this to you? Why would he lie? Doesn't he love you? all these things you need to find out in order to get over it and put it behind you. This is very serious he opened the door to problems now you wont be able to trust him and trust is very important in any relationship. right now you will need time. Time to be alone and think about what you are going to do. My other advice is Honey woman of today dont need a man to take care of them independecy is our for the taking. I seen woman with 2-3 kids making it own their own and you can do that too just stay with one child for now and give him or her the best. everything will pass (this is just advice if you dont want him anymore and thats fine). Just know what you want now if its going to be with him or not. You can do it!

I would just leave him, but first see how you feel besides the angry and betrayed part and weigh out the good and the bad.|`|Xu4x19y6aa	My personal opinion is tell him "okay, you made a mistake that you did FINALLY admit to - now you say you are committed to me and our child.".  Then, I'd tell him that as the baby is coming and you two are engaged, you want to see proof of his commitment and just finally be married.  If he hesitates to marry you, I'd really wonder if it's over with that other girl.  If he won't commit, or if you find any other proof in the near future that he is still seeing that woman, dump him. You'll get child support and trust me, you are SO much better off without a liar and a cheater in your life!|`|k9uspUrTaa	You are in a tough spot.

Good luck|`|AA11435157	just say hey i havent talked to you for a while whats up and he'll probably say nuthin much and you and then the conversation will get going but then when you guys go through a silent moment just say something that happend at camp then say wanna hang out? ok|`|a6fc90cc93daa9de0c7fa13fcc6f8377aa	Just e-mail him to say how you enjoyad camp and see what his reply is.

Find things in your area like the coffee shops, ours has great poetry readings on Sundays. There are jazz, theatre, and comedy clubs everywhere. Call good old Ben & Jerry (Cherry Garcia and Chunky Monkey are the best), find your favorite movie, and relax. Books are a great way to escape boredom, if you aren't into long books, find some with short chapters and you'll have a good stopping point to pick up again later. Keep your brain entertained, I get into logic puzzles and Sudokus while I have downtime at work. Nintendo DS has a couple of great brain games, Brain Age (has soduku on it) and Big Brain Academy is another. Find a hobby or pick up a course in something you're interested in. It's only a state of mind, you get to control it. Good luck, hope these help.

a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	How to Ask a Girl Out<br>  <br>  When you would like to ask a girl out, just find the right time and place to ask. Sometimes you will just be hanging out, talking, when you feel you would like to make a date with her. If you do not really know her, but have seen her in school, or with other friends you know, then it might take a little more effort, but it certainly can be done.<br>  <br>  Steps<br>  <br>     1. Get to know her. Hang out with her friends and find out about the activities and hobbies she likes. The more you know about her interests, the more things you will have to talk about.<br>  <br>     2. Approach the girl you like. Try to dress fairly decent, but don't overdo it. For example, if you're a T-shirt and jeans person, wear that. Do not show up with button-ups and ties, because you want her to like you for you, and you don't want to give her any false ideas. If you have a million stains and wrinkles don't worry. If she doesn't like you because of what you wear, she's not right for you.<br>  <br>     3. Engage her in friendly conversation. Say "Hi", tell her your name and compliment her. You will find that conversation will flow a lot easier if you speak about a topic which both of you have some knowledge of and an interest in.<br>  <br>     4. Gauge her interest. Take notice of eye contact, smiling, laughter, and enthusiasm in her responses. Learn to read women's body language.<br>  <br>     5. Ease into your invitation. After you have been talking for awhile, though, say something like, "Hey I'm going or doing whatever this weekend. How would you like to tag along? I promise it'll be more interesting than whatever you had planned." Say this with a small smile, teasingly. Do not use a cheesy pickup line! Think about how you want to steer the conversation around to asking her out.<br>  <br>            * Ask her out for something specific if she's demonstrating interest. Maybe for a movie, or ice cream, or a hike in the park.<br>  <br>            * Spend time with her and a group of other people (not a one-on-one date). This will make her feel more comfortable as it's not as intense as being out as a couple. <br>  <br>     6. Keep your cool if she says no. Don't take it personally. Continue to make an effort to hang out with her and get to know her. Once she knows you better, she may grow to like you. Given enough time, she might even end up asking you out. At the same time, don't pressure or harass her, and take the hint if she's really not interested or if she's got her eyes on someone else. <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>      * Be nice and treat her with respect. This is a must. If you can't treat a girl right, don't even bother trying.<br>  <br>      * Become her friend. This is half the battle, and at the very worst at least you have one more friend than you had before.<br>  <br>      * Be calm and confident. If you're sweating and stuttering, that girl will feel nervous about going out with you. Girls want guys that are confident, but not cocky.<br>  <br>      * Some girls prefer to be called "sexy" or "hot." Others prefer to be called "lovely" or "beautiful." Make sure you don't use the wrong word. There are other good ones too like "stunning," "irresistible," "really something," "gorgeous," "a hottie," etc. Try not to get stuck on just one.<br>  <br>      * Practice talking to her. If you feel uncomfortable talking to her, you probably aren't ready to ask her out.<br>  <br>      * Think of subjects to discuss on the date; stories about yourself, things you want to know about her, etc. in advance.<br>  <br>      * Being relaxed and confident is the difference between a comfortable silence and an unbearable silence. It's natural to have breaks in the conversation. Don't sweat it.<br>  <br>      * Last and certainly not least, have fun. No girl wants to be with a guy who is boring. <br>  <br>  <br>  Warnings<br>  <br>      * Above all, do it in person or over the phone. It is not romantic at all on the internet. But try to do it in person. Look into her eyes too, unless she looks away. Don't stare, but continue to look at her face. If you are really shy, you could try a handwritten note. Try to stick around after giving it to her though.<br>  <br>      * Keep your hands to yourself! Trying to get physical with a girl right away just tells her that you consider her to be an object and not an actual person.<br>  <br>      * Be persistent, but not too persistent. If she turns you down gently, then she's politely telling you she's not interested. If she flat out refuses, back away. You don't want any girl to think you're a stalker.<br>  <br>      * If you have to ask her out through a friend, you will get a "no" by default. Girls do not enjoy hearing "hey! I'm asking you out for (Name of guy). He doesn't like you enough to overcome his lack of confidence" And they will hear this regardless of how tactful your friend is. <br>  <br>  If you want more information or help with anything else, you can email @: godsbaby42@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  *Much Love* **God Bless**|`|6VMNEgiHaa	Pack her a picnic, take her to a lake, or park. Pick her some flowers, and bring a game. ( board game, football, Frisbee. Something to take the boredom away from sitting in the park. Your never to young to learn how to play the field.

Now you know your not available so why you clowning all the time.|`|8cc4db0adf12b9d656a5b7052f9aa4f6aa	This is good and all...and I totally agree with your headline on this subject.  However, in order to become interested in someone, there has to be some sort of physical attraction for that other person which generally means looks.  Think about what you notice first about a woman, when you first see them.  You can not see their inside when you know nothing about them so there has to be some sort of attraction for you to want to get to know them on the inside.

96b37f105aa83095e3107db73b89836aaa	Olá Aniana,<br>  <br>   Da próxima vez, pense bem antes de ficar com alguém. As pessoas geralmente criam muitas expectativas quando est?o a fim de ficar com alguém, principalmente quando se espera por bastante tempo.<br>   O rapaz pode até ter pensado que você esperou tanto tempo para se "auto valorizar". E na verdade, parece que você ficou com  ele pela insistência, ou por se sentir meio sozinha naquela fase que todos est?o empolgados com o final do curso, final de ano, proximidade das férias, etc.<br>   Agora só há uma solu??o, seja direta e reta com ele, porque fugir é atitude de pessoa covarde. E também n?o entre nessa de dar o perdido no rapaz, dizer que n?o está, n?o atender liga??es quando ele telefona. <br>   O dia que ele quiser falar com você, ou vocês se encontrarem pessoalmente, seja clara, e fale que n?o está a fim de namorar com ele, ou ent?o minta, fale que você está com muito trabalho e n?o tem tempo para pensar em namoro, que você pretende fazer um curso em outra cidade, ou até mesmo que invente que seu ex namorado te procurou e você ficou balan?ada. <br>   N?o deixe o rapaz sem resposta. Sua franqueza pode parecer "dura", mas n?o há nada pior que ser ignorado.<br>  <br>    Boa sorte!|`|9863df588b43410451688a7493f7d85aaa	Amiga todos os "n?o" machucam é inevitavel mas ficar deixando o rapaz enganado por mais tempo é pior, seja sincera com ele a verdade doi mais n?o mata ,diga o que senti pois sem quimica  a rela??o n?o vai para frente,,,e desejo sorte para vc nessa situa??o complicada  ja passei por isso e é desagradavel demais.beijinho|`|d9bb31dff4c22bce4907730f8875f706aa	chama o cara e fala pra ele o que você sente|`|1a4082edfae33240673f1c264ca4a9ddaa	Bom...Essa situa??o eh bem complicada viu,passei por isso a mais ou menos 3 semanas atrás....Eh difícil para quem fala e mais difícil ainda para quem ouve um N?O,eu estava ficando com um certo menino,só que ? estava me sentindo bem com ele....Todos diziam que ele me amava muito e que iria sofrer d+ se eu terminasse com ele.<br>  Só que pra mim ? dava mais,parece que cada vez que eu ficava com ele lembrava mais de quem eu realmente amo =[<br>  Eu,lógico fikei péssima,pois ? keria ver ele magoado por minha causa,só que pensei,pensei e descobri que antes de qualquer coisa EU tenho que me amar,EU tenho que pensar em mim primeiramente,EU tenho que fazer o que eu acho que vai ser melhor pra mim....E foi isso que eu fiz,fui lá.conversei disse tudo o que sentia,e terminei ='(<br>  Ele....Chorou,na minha frente,foi terrível,fikei morrendo de dó,mais a minha decis?o já estava tomada.....<br>  Fiz somente o que o meu cora??o pediu,foi melhor pra mim,e creio que pra ele também,pois ? queria brincar com os sentimentos dele,e sei que ele merece alguém que goste dele de verdade.....Ent?o eu acho que vc deve fazer o mesmo,converse com ele,fale o que vc pensa....Vai ser difícil,ele vai sofrer no come?o,mais depois passa!!!<br>  <br>  *Bjuss e boa sorte viu*|`|1d3b27dd26b77a993a4a2a635dde80cbaa	Seja sincera e fale para ele o que você sente de verdade!<br>  Ele vai compreender!|`|05f96161a53bdc7a144104e0e75afc6caa	Converse com ele e fale sua decis?o.|`|0b278737cc3c5420f67850d4b1a6e1f9aa	Conversa com ele e diz o que sente de verdade.|`|0b291ebb8d3089126a63e8e77d057c05aa	estou em duvida é pouco delicado!!<br>  boa noite bjs.|`|aac0d1a3ce4e238c09954e08ab0cd8c2aa	Pelo visto gosta mesmo do cara, pois ate se importa com ele.<br>  Porque nao tenata a sorte?<br>  <br>  Como advogada vc deveria saber que o que vc disser podera ser usado contra vc.<br>  Vc é uma besta mesmo, isso eu tenho certeza.

KroHBBnEaa	nah. i was a little hurt earlier after a text message conversation with my ex. we had a little playful banter and then he just stopped the conversation cold--i said good night and take care and all he said was "u too ruby." i know, not the end of the world, but it hurts that things are so friendly, it makes it more and more clear that he and i will never get back together. :-( thanks for asking!|`|0noYPdqTaa	yes she loves someone else|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	not really. r u? if yes than why?|`|fe59ff64a15f67693ce3afd11718c088aa	not really,, but confused.... bcoz of a girl maybe.. sighh... i hate being shy!!!

AA11617606	you're 15, dont worry about being a virgin. Maybe you'll find someone later, maybe in college or later in high school, you never know. You do need to flirt a little and break down your barrier of being shy. And sometimes it's better to have guys as friends, than as boyfriends, because sometimes having a boyfriend could hold you back from having any fun! Live it up and enjoy!|`|2HJhbHmTaa	post a pic or send one to email...kwcox1025@yahoo.com ill see then offer advice|`|KroHBBnEaa	ok first of all, you're only 15 and you're upset because you've never had a boyfriend and you're a virgin???!?!?!?!?!? that's not a bad thing!!!!! you should never rush the sex thing, believe me, after you get it over with, it's not good for a while!!!! you should just have guy friends for now and see which one could make a good boyfriend. and for godsake, please don't go rushing into having sex just because you're bored! that's the worst thing to do. if you're as pretty as you say you are, you should have a boyfriend, so my guess is that your personality doesn't match your looks. be beautiful inside and out and stop being so dramatic! you're only 15!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|viufFgtCaa	I see,Well good luck with that<br>  <br>  7/07/07 the return of Tupac<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  "Never will I die, I'll be back" <br>  <br>  -- "Only Fear of Death"  Tupac Shakur<br>  --------------------------------------...|`|DfCtFqdQaa	Thanks for answering my response.  Good luck to you and your boy troubles.<br>  <br>  Don't let it get to you.  Virginity is something that is taken way too young today, and for you to wait like that is excellent.<br>  <br>  Also, if you want something go for it.  Take chances in life and don't look back.  It's how you succeed as a person.<br>  <br>  nsh|`|Gy58SYA7aa	Well, if you want a relationship with someone...you should hang out with people at your school some. At the very least you will then be invited to parties or introduced friends of friends and maybe find someone special. If you are just looking to hook up with someone, go to parties! But school is the way to go, especially to find someone near by. I know it sucks, but you have to try to meet people. You could try to do the modeling thing and maybe meet someone through that!|`|fZCpxKuQaa	first you're too young to be worring about being a virgin. Second there is nothing wrong with being without a significant other. You don't need a bf to go out and have fun. You want to meet people that aren't at school, get a job. The best friends I have now at 29 are the ones I met working together when I was 17-18.|`|AA11707883	im 15 too and im a virgin!<br>  thats fine!<br>  dont get a boyfriend just to have sex.<br>  you should just flirt a little,<br>  laugh at even the dumbest jokes,<br>  then just kiss someone that said you were hot.<br>  you seem confident.<br>  just get over it (your nerves that is)<br>  and so something incredibly outgoing.<br>  dont get outgoing and dumb confused though!<br>  just suck it up and kiss someone!<br>  soon you'll be a pro and people will be asking you out!

G5qumIGaaa	it means that she wants you to be more of a nice neater guy. she doesnt maybe want her friends think that she has a bf that just farts all over the place. so maybe trying to stop the farting and stuff cuz if it was my bf doing that to me i'd be disgusted too! lol! wish you luck!|`|7d3d6055f9dc6ecc99ef3bac91624614aa	You're starting to gross her out and it's having an impact on your relationship.

First off you need to realize that you aren't going to be with your parents for the rest of your life. You have your own life. You are 27 and in love with a woman who just happens to be a mother. Ask your parents if they would accept her if she just abandoned her child and wanted nothing to do with it. Ask them if it would make them feel better if that were the case. <br>  <br>  My mom and dad met when I was 4 and married when I was 6. He was 17 and took me as his own while my mom was 21. They were both in your postition. His parents didn't like that my mom was dating him and she had me. It all worked out in the end. I got a kick *** dad out of it. <br>  <br>  Bottom line is... You can't spend your whole life trying to make your parents happy. I mean you should know from the teenage years that its NEVER going to work. lol. You need to make sure you are happy before anyone else. You are the one who has to deal with your life and all the descisions you make. I say go for it. You never know what will happen, but if they see you are happier than ever, they might actually end up respecting your descision to be happy, and be happy for you. Anything is possible.|`|cfVDH1e9aa	Just say your going on vaction with a FRIEND|`|tjU8CC6haa	same thing happened with me. i think you should just do it. yea tell them of course but they need to understand that your an adult. you can decide who to date. they should be proud of you, especially if you are a father figure in her child's life.|`|tpyx3uezaa	Beg ur parents! Tell them u love her so much. Without her u will die. I hope that will work.|`|x0ZJ0WdLaa	well first off i wish you lots of happiness for your future and if you rents don't see how happy you are with her then i think you need to sit down with them and have a serious conversation and let them know whats up. don't let them run your life now that you are  happy with this girl, trust me if you let them then you will never have any freedom and i know how much that sucks so just follow you heart. i know this might be hard for a guy but if you gf means so much to you as it sounds like she does then don't let anyone stop  you from you happiness no matter who they are. Trust me

If you're too young, you shouldn't be dating a 46-year-old in the first place. However, if you're around his age, him lying about his age shows his insecurity... In the long run, insecurity isn't ever a good thing. It tends to lead to problems and clingy behavior.|`|urSARnmVaa	Y is your crazy *** doin searches on people and i bet if he knew that he wouldnt date you|`|bc78XGyAaa	it's not that big of a lie...maybe the age differents scares him...but he really likes you...i would wait around...and see wat happens...how do u kno if it was him for sure...maybe you should talk to him...and ask some questions....

In my case, we can go out on other dates with people, but we cannot sleep with anyone else but each other. It differs.|`|245f3bbe5215b9abe5d63fbda7c6ebeeaa	It means you are not limited to dating other people. Basically you are in a _ _ _ _ buddy relationship. When 2 people care about each other they don't want to share.|`|334e65f63dd5697d32620e20690e3d18aa	You have sex... with no emotional commitment, no respect for one another, catch sexual related diseases... you become that person's whore and that person is your whore. <br>  <br>  My opinion... Its a lack of respect and personal worth. It can lead toyou having feelings for that person and that person not caring or the other way around. its low, and sick once you find out you have STDs or HIV. If that person has sex with you with no strings attached that means that  person can easily be doing that with 3 or 4 or 5 others... YUK!!!|`|4GQLQvkMaa	many variations to this kind of relationship.  for some---sex in as many varieties as both (or more) wish.  for others, the "no strings attached" only regards emotional or questions of exclusivity.  there is the understanding that both partners are free to explore or pursue others, date, etc. without guilt or possessiveness.  this gets tricky because you can't help but get intimate if you do other things as well with each other.  there are dangers of course.  one can reduce one's sense of intimacy and full sexual gratification into merely a biological itch that is sometimes scratched to fulfillment.  he, we all know sex feels great.  but can also just become another indulgence we satisfy--like a sweet tooth--and that seems a shame.|`|5eqP4HtUaa	well, you put it in her *** without asking since it dont matter if she gets mad or not!!|`|60afbfe439e05b1d5193ff149ac91aebaa	You have sex and that is about it. No relationship stuff involved. Just there for the physical part of things.|`|AA10263955	if its a "sexual" relationship,,,its all between the sheets! anything goes!!|`|SRwE42qQaa	That varies from F Buddy to F Buddy.  Most of the time these things are kept to only on the nights when you're hooking up.  Some people will go drinking first, maybe grab something to eat.  Other don't do anything at all, they just come over and get some then leave.  <br>  A real relationship consists of getting to know the other person and developing more to the relationship than just the sex.|`|PIdomzNSaa	LOL, good question. I'd like to know too<br>  <br>  But it SEEMS like if you're in a "sexual relationship with no strings attached", the kinds of "stuff" you "do" is just HAVE SEX.|`|W1VetIhWaa	they do freaky naughty stuff.lol|`|dcae4f7c6e901792b9e5e39b56678620aa	Well, you have sex.

Just sex.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Sex can be a "recreational sport", but who wins?|`|rMq9D06Faa	Not in one but....<br>  <br>  Sexual relationship involves JUST sex!  No pretense about going out to dinner, no commitment, can be involved in several at once.<br>  <br>  Real relationship is just the opposite.  One person, dinner/dancing, movies, love.|`|AA10667433	Great question.  Personally, I try to keep it in the bedroom as much as possible.  We will occasionally get drinks.  But things like dinner, movies, etc. makes me feel like it's opening the door for things to get serious.|`|KWp0QvZMaa	Um, everything and anything.  And it differs because there's no whiny piss-the-pants feelings to deal with.  <br>  <br>  It gets boring after a while, though, and unfulfilling.|`|abbd790861dff7f18e40d591c583f02eaa	You just have sex!

He is trying to see if him telling you he loves you and being all sweet will get him some..but talking to his cousin saying man if she doesnt give it up im leaving. Dump him you dont need that..all he wants is sex...love him but love yourself more..maybe you need to lose him hes trash|`|5GJpoaD8aa	sweetheart, if you are going to 'lose' him, then there's nothing you can do about it.<br>  <br>  withdraw now before you get more hurt, then you will have the stronger upper hand and not end up the 'victim'!<br>  <br>  his cousin is trying to help you by telling you the truth, but he's too gutless to do that.<br>  <br>  I'm happy to be here to talk to you more.

9FUQo82aaa	I would'nt waste my time on either group.|`|e42641e8fb7906527b9fc54cebaf0146aa	i would say group b, because with them you can loosen up and have your own opinion.|`|yXjGizF6aa	their is a lot of things that happen at time partys that shouldnt happen, and you could get cuaght up in a situation you can get out of, find you something that is safe for you to do, so you wont find alot of pain along the way!!!|`|0FTCt3yZaa	well to me it sounds like group a keeps you happier. however, just because you sit with one group at lunch, doesn't mean that you can't be friends with people from another group outside of lunch. also, think which group is going to make you happy the most. <br>  again, like i said, to me it sounds like group a keeps you happier. they are your best friends, as opposed to group b. group a has the friends you have fun with and laugh with, whereas group b is somewhat the same, but probably not entirely. i would go sit with group a, even if they worship the one girl. besides, even if they worship her, doesnt mean you have to. hope this helped!|`|37736d917657b0a129a77fec3ff53f04aa	Well, nothing is wrong with hanging out with two different groups of people.  But it does seem like GROUP A needs to get over themselves.  Worshiping one single person in a group would get old fast, so I'd have to say I would go with GROUP B.  But please don't cry over your situation.  It'll all work out for you....and in a few years you probably won't know most of these people anymore.  But good luck anyway|`|IKzNMt16aa	I would stay friends with both, you dont 'have' to be in a group, you can be in lots of groups.  You get something from both groups.  I would talk to both groups.  Tell group a that you know are feeling sad, because they have been talking about you (probably doing it because they are jelious) and tell them you like all of them, but dont want to be talked about.<br>  <br>  Tell group b that you are not a big party girl, but you like to hang out with them. <br>  <br>  sit with who ever you want to at lunch or split your time between both groups|`|wrMcxfbAaa	this is a tough one but i had the same problem but i chose group B cause it worked out better they turnned out to be better friends then my old friends... but i am still good friends with group A

Unless you distance yourself from the beginning, one day you will weaken and can kiss your family good bye.|`|NKHlXmSKaa	Hi, doc! I don't think the situation is that they're just out to break up your marriage. More like, "I want him, and, if he loses his family in the process, at least he's mine now!" That's what you have to contend with. You are a man of stature, well respected and a professional person. Humans  are a, 'I see it, I want it!'  animal and, they sometimes don't care what happens along the way. It's up to you to act on these issues and disgrace your marriage or not. On the other hand, some of these women may just genuinely like you and want to give you the most important thing that  they feel they have to offer, namely themselves and some casual sex. Ultimately though, the decision lies with you whether get seduced and cheat on your wife or not. But, I can't say that their attentions are all bad, maybe some of them actually do just look up to you. But----if you feel this confusion strongly enough to ask about it, maybe you might want to examine your innermost feelings toward your wife and marriage. Good luck Doc and, take care to proceed with caution.<br>  <br>                                                           askaman|`|qPvM1gUGaa	If you are truly happy with your marriage then I would ignore their flirting and even ask them to keep it to a professional level while working. I always say to myself, would i like my partner to do the same thing I'm doing, if not then don't do it.It is wrong to encourage or permit that kind of behavior. Stay true to your wife and let her know how much you love her........
63bdd51aaa8a3efd11b7d670257460a3aa	You want the truth?   Because we want to get into your pants. Face it (I'm a guy) and the bottom line is we are all dogs! I admit it in myself though I am a one woman guy (I despise cheating). But on the same note, many of you girls are sooooo sweet in the beginning then you try and change us into someone you want us to be. Don't try to change us because we only end up getting upset.

nTJ8bKJnaa	YES!!!!!!!! There is no doubt you should have been invited. This is a blatant insult to you and your children. What really bothers me the most is the fact your fiance accepted the invitation, any MAN or Woman who truly respects their chosen mate would have either insisted the Whole family be included or they would have turned down the invitation altogether. His behavior tells me he does not accept you and the children as being part of "his" family, nor do his relations. You need to have a Very Serious talk with this man and tell him in plain English that his and his family's behavior is unacceptable and you will not tolerate being treated like outcasts. What kind of a message are they sending to your children!!!, that they are not good enough to be included? I'm sorry but this question really TICKED me off, and there would have been fireworks at home. You may want to examine your whole relationship with this guy. You are good enough to care for him and support him but not good enough to marry or be included as family. For the sake of your children and your own self esteem do not allow this to go on......all of you deserve respect and much better treatment. SHAME on him!|`|nCWjdyddaa	So, you've been "in a relationship" for 9 years and engaged for "three or four" - amazing that you don't know which.

What is it going to take before you realize that you are not number one with this man, and he is not going to marry you?<br>  <br>  Wake up and smell the coffee! Get out of this relationship before you throw all of your youth away on this sorry excuse for a man! Go! Get out now!|`|90fa5628c30c83d33bf26fc13850ce64aa	Wow! Talk about a long engagement! And, ya, you should have been invited. But, is there any reason why you weren't? And why don't you ask him? If you can't even ask him, why are you engaged? You should be able to ask him anything after 9 years. And if there are going to be children there, then your children should have been welcome to join you to dinner with him. But, if it was an adult affair, you should have still been invited. Talk to him. Maybe this engagement isn't a good idea.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yeah I do think that is wrong. Your fiance should have invited you and I would be pretty pissed if I wasn't invited. Maybe when he gets home you should talk to him about it.|`|1JMNcVshaa	of course it's not right..<br>  <br>  u're in relationship with them n u n your kids are not welcome????<br>  <br>  is that what they calla family???
JGGbQhCaaa	Seems like some indecision on your part has helped husband get to his real feelings on the matter. Think it over. Talk it over real good. What are your reasons for wanting more; his for being satisfied with two? Is there some way to compromise; maybe extending some time, attention, assistance to other children needing such?|`|RtkB46peaa	I'm sorry, but is this what you said:<br>  <br>  -You have two kids<br>  -You decided you wanted another, and so did your husband<br>  -You tried for another kid<br>  -You decided you weren't sure and needed to think about it.<br>  -Now your husband doesn't want one either.<br>  <br>  And you're upset?  That's insane.  Are you pissed because you both agree with each other?  Oh, and how do you deal?  You respect his desire not to have more children.  Just like you would expect from him in return.|`|a5c96f01ce98dccbbe83fee4b61edbd0aa	You both need to be in agreement with one another. I think he probably figured since you needed more time to think about it, that is telling him you are not sure. He wasn't either. What was there to think about?<br>  <br>  How do you think he felt when you said that you wanted more time to think about it?? Look at it this way. You both already have two beautiful little boys!! There is always time for another addition, but when you are ready.|`|oDMEYSKjaa	Did you two sit down and asked him why he didn't want one? I know for some males, two kids is enough for them. Maybe he's thinking it financially, and about the boys. Would they be ready? Did he askt he boys about the situation? <br>  I would find out why he doesn't want one and then go from there. You can only take it one step at a time.|`|qXUkHxEFaa	I don't understand? If you decided you needed to think about it some more then you were not sure you wanted another child. So why is it so hard if your husband is not ready? Three kids are much harder to take care of than two and you both sould be in agreement before you try.
AA11185479	There's a difference between "like" and "obsession."  <br>  It's fine to be interested in comics during your teen and pre-teen years, and it's fine to appreciate the finer points of comics and comic art.  <br>  But if you're so obsessed that you can't hold a decent conversation on any other topic, or you can't get through a day without discussing/reading comics, or if the ONLY shirts you wear ALL feature comic-related themes, then it's definitely crossed the line.  Widen your interests.|`|WPZI510laa	i find it nerdy|`|eVTsGsCWaa	Not real weird but if it revolves around your whole life, then girls feel inferior and like they don't have a common interest with you and that can scare girls off.

My husband and I are both nerds, it's a wonderful life :)|`|OSJg4GXkaa	Eh, not to me. I love manga personally <3|`|SqTRBUTYaa	noo thats not weird=]<br>  |`|74P30bdcaa	Girls don't care about what you wear, what your hobbies are, or really anything about you as long as they find you physically attractive and you have the right attitude.  There are plenty of comic geeks that are good looking but they behave in the stereotypical way that geeks are depicted on tv and that turns EVERYBODY off, not just girls.  If you go around talking about nothing but comics then people in general will not want to hang out with you for too long.  If you can remember that not everyone is going to be into what you're into and can find other things to relate to them on, then you shouldn't have a problem.  <br>  My wife doesn't like comics so I try not to talk to her about them and I don't like the books she reads or most of the shows she watches but we watch shows we both like together and every once in a while we will each delve into each other's interests and ask each other questions about them.  <br>  Of course, if you're an artist and plan to make comics, then comics will be something that you will talk about more often but, like everyone else, you will have to learn to leave work at work.|`|zH80yyDQaa	It depends on the girl truthfully.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	You need to run far far away.  That's ridiculous.  This guy is not marriage material.  He is living this promiscuous life where the thinks he is some NFL or NBA star.  You are just a piece on the side--nothing more.<br>  <br>  He had a wife.  Oops.  Didn't mention it.  I hate when I forget that.  But they are getting a divorce so he didn't mention it.  But since the two of you have been together 2 women have had babies.  Funny but a woman from way back in high school isn't still pregnant.  Come on.  What kind of a line was that?  It only takes 9 months.  So you may have known the girl from high school but that isn't what the fight was about.  The fight was about sleepign with her now.<br>  <br>  He cheats on you and lies to you constantly.  The only way you find out is when his family tells you to keep you from getting your hopes up.  His sister tells you, and his brother tells you.  I guess I just don't get your question.<br>  <br>  How many times does he have to be caught cheating?  How many times can he "oops I knew I forgot to tell you something" I'm married, still dating others, going to the hospital b/c my girlfriend is having my baby.  You should learn a big lesson from this and then try to forget all about him and his pathetic lying ways.
VKRmIj6Gaa	Lol, I'm not answering that part<br>  <br>  **part 2**<br>  I have a theory that if you have to question yourself about it... then you most likely are it. Hurting people before they hurt you is definitely due to insecurity in some manner. I know you're a pretty smart girl Mizu and I have also been through a lot so I am going to assume that you know the answer to this question and what you really want to know isn't someone else's opinion on what you are.. I have many reasons for believing this. <br>  <br>  To continue, I knew someone who had the same problem, and this person no matter how many times you told them what was right they had too much pride caused by insecurity so they went ahead and did what was wrong. I think really the felt like they wanted to love people with all their heart but their heart instead of being a full heart was broken into segments and when they tried to love and pour out their heart and repair it they either poured out of the wrong side... or used the wrong tool and their heart completely fell apart. Instead of loving, everything went wrong and what came out was actually hatred. Maybe you just need to use the right tool. What are the chances that every person you try to trust will hurt you. That person just had to get over themselves, letting go of their pride was the first thing they had to do to get rid of that insecurity. <br>  <br>  I believe that insecurity causes pride because a person will build up pride to cover up for what they lack. A person who doesn't have any athletic ability for example would be insecure about that when someone brought it up... but pride would build up and they would start bragging on themselves to make themselves look better in other ways.. the same applies in other ways and I did the same thing..Except it was the other way around, I'm good at sports but its the other things that I lack.<br>  <br>  sorry if this didn't help or isn't what you are going through! ^.^ but it sure helped me in some way! Luv ya Mizu! That aint no joke either... I wanna be cool wit u iight... If you need a friend you got one in me iight?|`|FdqCnU03aa	Awww... Toki-kun...<br>  <br>  <br>  [[YESH. That shall be your nickname from me. >:O You can't escape without one eventually.]]<br>  <br>  <br>  Not really insecure. You were probably just mad that your friend didn't share certain things and let out his problems to you.<br>  You probably just wanted to help him. <br>  <br>  --shifty eyes--<br>  <br>  ... right?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  how do you hurt the 14-year-old's ego?<br>  ... uhhh... ignore him?<br>  be all cold to him?<br>  <br>  or the other way around, and be eerily sweet to him. He'll get creeped out. xDD He'll be all like, "This person was supposed to be extremely annoyed/mad at me! Is he crazy? EEEEEEEE!!"<br>  <br>  ... or he'll be like, "Why thank you [[for bein' sweet to him and maybe sayin' he looks nice or somethin'...]]!"<br>  ... then he'll realize the sarcasm. xDD<br>  <br>  xDD tho if he's dense, or just tough, then that might not help since the EEEE part was my imagination.<br>  <br>  <br>  ... I have actually no idea. I'm not a guy, sorry... D: so I can't help you much. And thankfully I've never had freshman problems...<br>  <br>  <br>  So far.<br>  <br>  <br>  Part 2---<br>  <br>  O_____O<br>  You just seem.. very bored. And of course selfish. Everyone is. But that's 'cause you're lonely sometimes. [[Right? >.> I hope so. I'll sound so cheesy.]] And you feel the need for their attention. Tho the insecurity...

DA2ik8rqaa	for a first date i wouldn't do anything too romantic cause it is too early for that...do something fun like laser tag, paintball, go-carts or something|`|96HWpdkFaa	If you live near a beach, maybe go there...(depending where you live and the weather) Maybe have a picnic. If it's ice cold then maybe go somewhere like starbucks or barnes and noble and get some hot chocolate and just talk to eachother.|`|s5Oa83sYaa	umm take her to the arcade and make her feed you nachos while your play street fighter|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	Go kart racing is definitely a fun date and so is laser tag...but if you're in the mood for something simpler  sometimes just walking and talking is great parks can also be fun to...street fairs especially ones with glass blowers are awesome and so are carnivals|`|HyCT0esBaa	well u can go 2 the beach 2 watch the sunset<br>  <br>  or the park or somewhere with flowers where its quiet|`|AA10106538	picnic and talk|`|z7YA6Ek8aa	I'm also debating on where to take the girl I like. I think I've built up the courage to ask her, but I'm not sure where to take her either. I've thought about dinner, but in my opinion, that's to 'romantic' for a first date. Try doing something you know she likes to do. For instance, the girl I like is on a school basketball team. She is also really good, therefore, You can come to a conclusion that maybe, just maybe, she likes basketball. If whatever she likes is not something that you like, then try finding something that both of you like. If you can't inference anything by just watching her, then try asking one of her friends. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|LhTOIoJ7aa	take her to the mall and buy her something i dont know maybe a shirt?
ZyLGjzo1aa	The best solution is....leave him for ur own good.I'm giving u a piece of advice thru' my past experience.My ex was a drug addict,drink,hang out with friends.I have to work and study at night.I pay for all the bills and just imagine I have to walk to school when I was 4mths pregnant because I dont have enough money for my bus fare.At last I have to quit my studies because he serves no purpose in our marriage life.After my miscarriage situation gets worst.So I decided to leave him for good.Look at the bright side....Remember "Letting go of someone dear is hard but holding on to someone who doesn't feel the same is even harder".I can see a future ahead of me after leaving him and I believe u can too.Yes...the same situation here..we live in my house which I bought it with my sis b4 married to him.We share the same fate.A self-centred guy like urs and my ex dont deserve to be treated good.Wish u all the best..and remain blessed.I always pray that God will lead u to the right path...Cheers!|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Part of your job as his wife is to help him become a true MAN.  A true man is a solid and reliable PROVIDER.  He works hard and supports his family.  Even if his wife makes more, he works hard to be a major contributor to the house.  Maybe if she is the bigger breadwinner, he helps more around the house, and learns how to fix things that break.  That is what DEFINES him.  Little boys "hang out, drink beer" and leave piles of mess for others to cleanup.    Real MEN step up, work hard and act responsibly.  If you give him money to buy his beer you are acting like his "mommy" not his wife.|`|GVVoTtp8aa	Girl i would kick his *** OUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!! No question!! MAKE Him fend for himself! How is he supposed to father a child when he can't even take care of himself??!!? And just because your prego, doesnt mean you need to stay with him, babies can feel tension and stress, its sad, but they can. They get cranky and its just a sad deal all around. Its better to be happyand have a happy baby, then put up with a "CHILD" thats supposed to be the MAN of the house. <br>  <br>  Nows the time to act, you only have one life and one change with your babies childhood.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	i can't understand a woman who'd stoop to live with a man like him.  he doesn't help take care of life responsibilities, and seems to have no dignity.<br>  <br>  he's a loser.  plain and simple<br>  <br>  do what is best for you.  <br>  <br>  i wouldn't have stayed with him for 3 days.|`|24858b655af419324c43251eb8993fd9aa	kick his *** the f!ck out! he's wasting your time and if he wants to waste his life on meaningless activities, tell him to go by himself. u don't need to raise a newborn baby and a man who is supposed to be grown. he has a LONG way to go.|`|fjCxv2I4aa	its your house,why should you leave?while he's "hanging out" put all his crap on the porch and change the locks.and be sure to hit him with a child support order as soon as the baby is born.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	dump his ***, you deserve better.<br>  <br>  plus you are obviously capable of being on your own...|`|AKkfepINaa	I think that you should sit down with him first and talk to him about everything that is going on and tell him what u expect in your relationship and how you deserve to be treated... If he continues this behavior then I say leave but if you really love him maybe you guys can get some counseling. If that doesn't work then I would leave, it seems to be that you are a very strong person to be taking care of everything and he is another child to take care of. He has to grow up and realize that his behavior is not going to be tolerated. He has to become responsible very fast to take care of you and that baby, but he seems to young. Just make sure to find someone that loves you and your baby... Good luck to you

Ox9xc9fKaa	you can't i don't think. he has to pay child support, and is given to the mother, and she probably does use it for the baby.. <br>  i don't think there's a no.1 and no.2 priority on this list, there are however, two no.1s and those are the babies he had.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	God this has nothing to do with you <br>  as hard as it might be this is not your business <br>  this is his child he needs to take care of it and as long as the child is well fed and taking care of it should nt matter how she spends the money, you seem to have lot of info on this woman that was your hus x if he is the one that is telling you those info than you should be careful how much time they are spending together|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Your husband fathered a baby with another girl BEFORE he ever met YOU.<br>  HIS DAUGHTER is his FIRST priority not you.<br>  Getting all worried about if a nickel of the child support might be spent on the other kid does NOT alleviate him from his responsibility to his daughter.This girl and  his baby will not magically disappear they will be a part of your life forever hon.You knew ALL about this BEFORE you married him and married him anyway.<br>  Either support him and help him to be a good father to the kid HE brought into this world, or leave him.|`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	this is his child, it is not about the woman.  ANd you know what?  the money will go to HER and BOTH children.  Though it happens BECAUSE of his child with her.  No mother would ever spend any money just on one child.  What is she supposed to say to child # 2, "No, dear, only  Jonnie is allowed to drink that milk because it was bought by his biological father and his step mom will have a hissy fit if you drink milk from that jug!"  <br>  <br>  What is wrong with you?  You should have thought about how OK you were with his reality before you got married.  Now you're in it for good, like it or not.<br>  And you know what, if that baby isn't more important to him than you, then you married a real j8ckass.|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	hun he is responsible for his child, irregardless of what the mother does or how many kids she has.<br>  As for the money going to a child, it is, not for toys and luxuries, but food and shelter and all else it takes to keep a roof over the childs head|`|LQISGYbEaa	His first priority is to his child with his ex girlfriend. That is how the court sees it and that is how anyone with even a little bit of intelligence sees it.<br>  He should not have had more children if he is so worried about caring for the first.|`|wYojn096aa	You simply can't.  Child support really doesn't what she does with the.  They only care the he is paying. Hell she can give the money  to her other baby daddy.  It happens all the time.|`|EtWU3MQUaa	i no who you are talking about i am the ex grl friend and i still luv him sooo much and i bet he still loves me...omg i could distroy ur relationship im not the ex its late and im crazy sooo sorry ummm and i dont no what to answer im soo sorry that just made me feel bad to say that.
3wKGTZvAaa	You shouldn't do that to people you barely know ONLINE. Do it face to face. Hope you learned your lesson. ;-)

CD7F5hBbaa	just control it!!!!<br>  your husband is not your sex toy...he would feel upset over you since you push him too much for sex...Subsequently, he would probably presume that the marriage is only about sex...Not Good!!!|`|kHRD7uUAaa	keep using the toys or show him how he can use them on you|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|nX1W35Veaa	If i were you i would romance him a little more , make it impossible for him to resist you . the more love you give a man the more you will receive , just don't over-do it .|`|du5MNrQ6aa	it's happened to me...the whole hormonal change, it's insane! when my hubby didn't want to or was too tired, i got out the toys. lol. sorry to put it so out there...but yeah.|`|slCUkmm1aa	Same thing happened with my wife.. not so much me haha but it was kinda hard to get stuff done. She calmed down after a couple months. Though that might have been because she got pregnant.. haha :]
szVvf7Nkaa	I understand when you say that your husband still loves you. And I know you are having guilty feelings about cheating on him. But you do not have to ask him to divorce you. If you no longer want to be married to your husband then there is nothing stopping you from telling him that you are getting a divorce. You don't need his permission if you want to divorce him. But is this what you really want to do.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Divorce him anyway. You don't need his permission. These aren't the cave man days.|`|SckWdjnVaa	Lady...u r lucky to hv such a kind hubby who refuses to divorce u even after u went astray!!!<br>  <br>  Guilty....yup, u shud be, but more than that, u owe him n apology & promise for a lifetime of happiness...together !!!<br>  <br>  Ofcourse, if ur boss still interests you more now...u shud get the papers ready & divorce ur hubby (for his own good) !!!!|`|d448LFtqaa	You feel guilty because you know what you're doing is wrong. Stop now or your next step will be unwarranted viciousness toward your husband. If he is willing to forgive you, then you already have a much better man than the one you are F***ing.|`|c8lBbWtQaa	You divorce him then|`|suxunLtLaa	leave ur boss , love ur husband <br>  thats all
rQfzifT7aa	I was married to a man for 8 years and I had a little boy about 4 years old when we married. He was good to him at first but he began picking at him about little stuff, then it got bigger. It was like he could never do anything right. I remember my son brought home all S's on his report card. He has a S- in handwriting and my husband got onto him. Told him he  could do better. I just thought that was way to much. Here he is proud of his report card and he gets no praise and gets told to do better. Anyway we finally divorced but the damage had been done to my little boy. He is now a teenager and even though he has overcome alot of what happened to him, it was very hard. He was never physically abused but verbally yes he was. I did not realize at the time that verbal abuse is just as bad.  We had a child together soon after we were married and I felt like I had to stay. We finally divorced. And I have since remarried to someone who is very good to both my children.<br>  <br>  My opinion, if you are just casually dating someone. There is no need to inroduce them to your children. Only when it is something that is going to be serious. Talk up front as to what you want a potential partner to do. Let them know what is acceptable and what is not. Like in our house hold. If my boys need disipline, I do it. If his daughter needs disapline he does it. We each have our own ways of disapline and it works for us.<br>  Talk, talk and talk about the children you have. And never let anyone mistreat your child. Not even if it is just words. <br>  <br>  I am now mom of two boys and a step mom to a little girl. I feel like I treat my step daughter just like she is my own little girl. I probably spend more time with her that I do my boys cause well she is just into everything that I am and my boys are not. I have unconditional love for her and I want the very best for her and would do anything in the world for her. She loves me just the same.<br>  <br>  The only difference is and this is just my opinion. It is easier for me to find her faults than it is my two boys. I have no idea why. Maybe I think my boys came from me and they have no faults.   That is really the only think I can tell different. I treat her very well and give her lots of love and attention.<br>  <br>  It takes a special person to be a good parent, it takes and even more special person to be a good step parent.<br>  You should never treat a child bad, what you do and say today to a child will be with them tomorrow. <br>  Our children today is our future. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Rkik3eUuaa	no, i can not love someone else's children as my own neither i have to. i also do not require it from my husband. he has own children he loves, i have my children i love. we re polite to each other's children. neither of us disciplines other's children. nobody will love your children as his own, get real woman. and u shouldn't demand it from anyone. unconditional love to someone else's children? from what planet re u anyway?|`|AA11788494	Hell no.  I don't want any kids and I would not know what that was like anyway.|`|YyP5tarFaa	wow a hard question to answer because I have more than 1. My children's father passed away when they were 5 and 7. My current husband and my ex became friends before he passed away and my current hubby promised my ex to always look after his kids. My 2 oldest kids still call my hubsand by his first name and that is ok with all of them, My husband was not trying to replace their dad just be there for them. My current husband has been in my children's life longer than their father was and they have always respected him as a father. WE now have full custody of my husbands 2 children their mother has always hated me and accused me of wanting her children, I never wanted them but I loved them because they were part of my husband. Like I said before we now have full custody of them because their mother abused and neglected them, and allowed them to be physically and sexually abused by her boyfriends, yes they are now serving time in jail, but his kids call me mom and it seems a bit strange to me. I do understand that when they tell me I have been more of a real mom to them than their mother ever was that that is the truth but on the other hand my husband was nore of a father to my 2 oldest kids than their father ever was because he has been in their life longer. <br>  Do I feel the same towards my husbands kids as I do mine? ......I really don't know. Can I treat them the same way?......No I can't. Will I love them lno matter what?....Yes. Will I do whatever it takes to make their life better?......yes. <br>  <br>  some of these answers come from the curcumstances surrounding us getting custody of them. <br>  <br>  As a single mom can you find a man out ther to help you raise your kids and be a good father figure to them? Yes you can. A really good man will love your kids as much as he loves you. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i|`|8fXoctcjaa	No, you cannot, but you can come pretty close, only if the children involved want you to.  No one can come into their world (uninvited by them) and create a relationship as close as biological parents unless they are infants, or (like I said above) the children really want it.|`|Gmi5p8HIaa	My fiance has a three and a half year old son from his previous relationship.  I love that boy to death!  And he loves me just as much!  I do treat him as though he were my own son.  However, I don't expect him to call me "mommy", he calls me by my name, sometimes he does say mommy, but that's my fiance joking around telling him to call me "yummy mummy" hehehe.  Only problem is the ex.  Now that she's seeing how much her son loves me and loves spending time with me and my fiance, she's getting jealous and trying to manipulate the boy to not come visit us.  Her attempts have failed however...It worked for a while but the kid loves being with us, we have tons of fun.  So, since you're a single mom, when your ex does meet someone and the child really likes/loves this person, don't hate her or try to take the child away from him.  I would do anything for that little boy and even though I know he's not mine, I still love him with all my heart.|`|i2V17yi4aa	no i could not treat them as my own--->  because they are not! i could never have unconditional love towards someone else child and i would not give the best of me to the child simply because i don't have to hes not my problem! and no i do not want to better my self simply for my husbands mistake i want to better myself for myself and my husband and our future!<br>  <br>  look its going to be kind of hard for you to find someone out there that you will love and they love you back with extra baggage... i mean kids from a previous relationship is not really a turn on... <br>  <br>  i personally don't even consider myself as a step mom because i don't believe in that you have one mom and one dad... and its their problem and not mine. why should i take care of some other woman's child its just too funny to me...|`|xrq4qKRbaa	Some may and some may not. I one is in love with a person that has children and the children are part of them then it would seem that it's a package deal. So yes one can BUT only if they arte willing. This is also an area that needs to be talked about and treated delicately.<br>  If not dealt with correctly and with respect from the new person in the children's lives they can learn to recent that person and even hate them. It's typically easier to take on a best friend role rather than be their full fledged father. If the new person in the family see's the family as theirs then all will fall into the to be loved and cared about unconditionally. It takes a lot of communication to make it work in all aspect of a new relationship with kids. <br>  <br>  Good luck and keep you kids best interest at heart.
tCiVuFK9aa	NEVER be with a married man.  I don't know one married man who cheats that doesn't say that he is having marriage problems.  But the wife doesn't know there are any problems.  Tell her to get away from this guy, does she really want to be with someone who disrespects marriage that much?  Besides how will she like it when someone takes him from her?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Even if he is in a happy-less marriage doesn't mean that's alright for her to try anything with him. His wife may not know that they're not happy. Your friend needs to let him know that she knows he's married and that their relationship needs to end. If he isn't happy he needs to get a divorce and then things can happen. They shouldn't do that to his wife. It is WRONG!|`|GusGwDu7aa	well... its a common problem. I think if you happen to fall in Love with someone already having a life partner, its better not to show your love to him or her or ask him or her for a relationship or marriage because in case you ask him or her, you can not only lose a good friend but this may also bring destruction to his or her married life, especially in case he/ she is willing to build a relationship.|`|iQMudBMCaa	Tell her to ask him. It′s just a questions, he shouldn′t get mad for that. If he gets angry, he is the one with the problem.
tCiVuFK9aa	Yes it is still rape.  I can't believe he would force you to do something that you did not want to do.  Besides it is not healthy for you to have sex that soon after giving birth.  If he has that little control over himself, I would be worried bout my future.  You do have some choices.  One would be counseling if you could get him to go.  He needs to know that what he did was wrong.  One choice is to discuss it with him and let him know how wrong that was.  And there is always the legal way to go.  Rape is a crime.  You could prosecute if that's what you wish to do.  But the first thing you need to do is go see your doctor and make sure no damage was done and that you are healthy.  Do that now.  There are many things that could go wrong.  Go now.|`|WeUEAIg9aa	Regardless of Your maritial status, NO means NO!! Call the police and they will even help you decide what to do. If you have an attorney, talk to them. I'm really sorry this happened but it is rape. Stand up for yourself and don't let him take advantage of you again. |`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	That's pretty bad, he could have seriously injured you, call a divorce lawyer and find out what your options are.|`|NQIKCGgfaa	Yes honey, it is rape even if still your husband.<br>  <br>  I am so very sorry this happened to you. Specially when you are delicate hormonally, emotionally and physically after having your child.<br>  <br>  What to do now? I guess it would depend on what you want your future to be from now. Be with a husband that wont take no for an answer and force you? and commit the most horrible crime that can be commited upon a woman?<br>  <br>  I think you should contact the police or at the least a divorce lawyer.<br>  <br>  When you said he Force you. Do you mean held you down and against your will penetrated you? Or he coaxed you and talked you into it? There is a big difference. If is the first then get out. This is horrible. There are medical reasons for women not to have sex after birth. Obviously he has no regards for your physical and mental health and he cares nothing about what you want as long as his needs are met.<br>  <br>  GET OUT, grab your child and get out.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Edit: To those saying a rape charge is surely going to ruin the marriage, well RAPE surely ruins a marriage, rape charges or no. Those guys saying that she should discuss things obviously have no idea how rape feels like. HE ruined the marriage by forcing you. The fact that 2 weeks ago you had his child just adds fuel to the fire. He is an abusive person. Divorce is horrible and should not be the answer to every marital trouble. But in this case it should. He could've jerked off, he couldve asked for you to give him a hand job or for oral sex. He chose to impose himself on you. There is no other way to look at this. So screw talking to him and understanding of his needs. He doesnt care about your needs, your health, your body, your life.<br>  <br>  You do not want to be with someone like that.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Yes, it's rape.  If you want to pursue it, call the law and report it.|`|0Id85yiYaa	yes|`|8F3IHGADaa	Yes, it is still rape. Wifely duties are no longer good enough to force your wife to have sex. If she says no, no means no, and violating that is rape. You can choose to press charges but that might not be best for your situation, what with the new baby and all.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, yes, it is rape. If it were my husband I would explain to him that no means no, and for him to force you to have sex when you say no is RAPE.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	That is marital rape. After rape you have a small window of time where you can have a rape kit done and press charges as long as you don't shower, douche, eat, drink, use the bathroom, etc. I suggest you go for counseling. If he can't respect you and forces you to have sex I'm wondering if he's obsessive and possessive or emotionally abusive. You do not have to live with that.|`|1LxK1Grcaa	Yes, that is rape. You can file charges against him if you wanted to. Threaten him with it at least. You just had a baby, your not ready, you need time to heal. He had no right to do that to you, married or not.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry :(  I think you should file charges so in the future if he does anything else to harm you they have all the information on record|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Yes-when you say no and they still go-that's rape. I'd say you should call a rape crisis center and ask them for guidance. And I must say what an insensitive pig you have married!|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Yes, it's still rape if he forced you. You could contact police and press charges.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Yep.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	It's called spousal rape.<br>  If he forced himself onto you, and you told him no, then it's still rape.<br>  <br>  You can file a police report, but if you want it to stick, you have to be willing to back up the charges.|`|kpPbnzwXaa	YEAH IT IS|`|vhK7lfkdaa	Yes, it is still rape. It is so disrespectful for him to force you to have sex, especially since you just had a baby. You need weeks/months to recover from having a baby because of what it does to your body thats why the doctor tells you to refrain from having sex. You can try to talk to him about why you can't have sex and back it up with some research , try to recommend counseling, and if that doesnt work you can call the police if you choose to do so. I hope that once you talk to him he will be understanding and I hope he never does it again. Please get checked out by your ob/gyn and make sure you're ok since this happened and recovering ok, or get the proper treatment if something did happen.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your baby and good luck.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	In the United States it would be classified as rape (not sure about other countries).  Of course the chances of you proving that in a Court of law is slim to none, you will end up being divorced (not that big of a deal if the guy would use "force"), your husband would likely get joint custody of the kid and your two families would hate one another.  |`|sLLgERQWaa	You call the police and press charges<br>  <br>  You see your doctor to make sure he didnlt cause any internal injuries or infection...it takes at least 4 weeks to heal enough internally from childbirth before you can consider sex, especially if you still have post-partum discharge...there's a d@mn good reasons doctors give you a time frame about when sex can be resumed. Birth traumatizes the tissues and they need time to heal properly...boy, what a piece of you-know-what....you must have been in such pain because internally you're probably still raw....(not healed yet)<br>  <br>  If he will do that to you, he doesn't love you...and he will always put himself before you and your child, even if it risks your health...don;t put up with it! Good luck.|`|otzqtLBiaa	You did say no and he forced you? I am sorry to say, but that is rape. You need to seek counselling.|`|WPipgT9vaa	I can't believe he could be that selfish. Yes it is rape. you can report him to the police. Which I know he's your husband and you love him. So you might not want to do that. But if he doesn't care about how he treats you then you should not care if he went to jail.|`|rlh0fqIvaa	Apparently he did.|`|cxq30D4Aaa	call the police on him... that was rape|`|hH6kGUvBaa	That is awful because you needed to heal and to force is assault. |`|AA11627844	Yes it certainly is rape. I would call the police because this is just the beginning of the problems between you and him. no one can force you to have  sex not even your husband. i would get away from him as fast as you can.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	Yes.  Whether married or not no means no.  The only thing that can be done is to go to the police and press charges.  |`|kgZqCNt1aa	yes, forceable sex is rape even if you are married.  If you feel violated enough to ask this question, you need to call the police.  However, since you waited, evidence may be hard to gather.|`|HsojfyoTaa	Yes it is rape. I would tell him how you feel and that you consider it rape and hopefully if he is a good husband he will realize he did something wrong and apologize. It is up to you if you want to forgive him.|`|96c290bfaab394d3e69b4f690ea5fff0aa	yes, and he already did... just go to the police and get rid of him.|`|AA12058058	why did you marry him?|`|AA11356977	YES YES YES> It has been in courts before, NOW>>>> What are you going to do about it?|`|tKqOGuqKaa	In the US he can't rape you. You would have to go to the police and press rape charges on him. <br>  Husband or not, no means no.|`|Gq1zMZBmaa	Yes, spousal rape is a growing issue and you need to take it very serious. |`|24zjh9Vsaa	YES your husband raped you.  AND you just had a baby 2 weeks ago. Do you plan on pressing charges?  You just had a baby and  your body has not healed yet. There is a reason why your doctor told you to wait at least 6 weeks before having sexual intercourse. If you go to your doctor right now, just one look will let him/her know that some activity has taken place down there.  It all boils down to whether or not you plan to forgive your husband and let it go, or if you want to press charges.  If you plan to press charges, see your doctor soon.|`|otO7CIIlaa	No means, no, but he is your husband and it would be impossible for you to prove it.|`|jmOSuyQ1aa	if u say no then the answer should be no regardless of who it is. a person should never be forced into doing anything they dont want to do.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	Yes, it is rape. You are the one in control of your body because you marry someone does not give them all access. What you want to do about it is a different matter. You could file a police report. Realize if you do this you cannot later take it back (no Bobby Brown and Whitney). Rape is something that is very serious. If he is found to be guilty it will affect the rest of his life. You could also have your Doctor explain to him the reasons you cannot be intimate right after having a baby.|`|mjXiF6Ilaa	Yes its rape. No means No any time. But unlike 99% of the answers, I recommend  talking to your husband about what he did. Let him know how much he hurt you and make it very clear to him that if it happens again you will then go to the police. A rape charge against your husband is sure to ruin your marriage, family and his life and you're not going to be able to take it back. Think about it.|`|IQ7SE9e3aa	hi i work as a rape an sexual abuse worker for cheshire in the uk, yes it is rape an women do not understand that this can happen, i would like to talk to you about this as i can help you an put u in touch with people who can help take this further. Please do not think that coz ur married its just sex coz it isnt, wot he did was wrong and u dnt need this pressure afta just havin a baby, please email esr33@student.open.ac.uk <br>  <br>  Lizzie|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	Yes, if you fought his advances and report it immediately there could be some retaliation.  You need to weigh the consequences here though, if you feel you are in danger remove yourself and your child from the home then make the report and get a restraining order.  you must take forcible action though or nobody will take it seriously.|`|IBP5bDI5aa	OMG!!! Datz a big problem!!! That is considered rape i think you should go to the police!!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is rape. Anytime that you say no to sex and someone forces you to have sex then he is raping you. If that happened then you need to go to the police. It's all up to you what you want to happen. He will get in trouble though if you report him. |`|VQPtZhTRaa	regardless of the fact that he is your husband...ANY forced sex is RAPE. If you chose not to report him at least leave him and protect you and your new baby.  But, you need to report his actions.  Seems he is a bit on the controlling side and it will only get worse|`|3p1MsPdHaa	Yep that's not good I would be saying see ya **shole!!|`|Z5Rv2fXqaa	I would leave him, let him know that was wrong. Is he a violent man? Does he generally put his own needs first? If so I would be worried about the baby. He probably needs to control people. You wouldn't want him to abuse your child. He needs help.|`|V1pWHfdMaa	Yes it is! You can be raped by anybody, husband or stranger. Do you feel that he will try again? You have to make him understand that what he did is very serious. If you want more answers you can go to RAIIN.com, and press charges!|`|PPLxDKYwaa	Amish men do that to their "wives" too .. ur husband is sick in the head! If my husband did that to me (which he would NEVER) .. all you'd see is my fists in the air !! How dare he act in such an animalistic manner!! |`|SWbiblvPaa	take you child (children) and get the hell out of there. that is SO rape. Get out and then go to the cops No means No regardless he is your spouse or ur boyfriend. There is only one meaning to the word NO!!! |`|D78jfOMZaa	Yes, if it is without your consent. It can be a rape even if you are married. Don't let him do this to you specially if you just had a baby.|`|kgEy8d8Gaa	it is, but if you want to have him arrested, it may be hard. <br>  <br>  If you are a married couple - he will more than likely deny it.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|9AgTTqtUaa	Are you kidding me??<br>  <br>  What kind of a husband do you have?<br>  <br>  If he did do this to you why are you on Yahoo Answers?|`|aiogS1Pwaa	Yes your husband can rape you. Only recently has rape in marriage been recognised as a crime.<br>  
91d5c22e6f8912ce779abc527502ec12aa	una vez lei en algun lugar algo que decia: "padres felices=hijos felices". me llamo mucho la atencion esta frase pues dice padres no pareja o matrimonio, si no eres feliz ella tampoco lo sera, eres su ejemplo para medir la felicidad.<br>  <br>  Si no hay nada que arreglar, quieres que tu hija crezca en un hogar sin amor??? cuando sea grande el ejemplo que le diste sera lo que ella inconcientemente vivira....una familia sin amor.... como padres debemos saber que nuestros hijos son nuestro reflejo del manana, si no damos buen ejemplo y lo llenamos de amor, indepedientemente de si en pareja, matrimonio, solteros o divorciados, eso seran ellos en el manana hijos seguros y felices con padres a quienes acudir....no padres amargados viviendo una mentira.<br>  <br>  Los hijos se dan cuenta mas rapido y entienden mas de lo que tu crees.... se feliz TU para que tu hija sea feliz contigo, habla con tu pareja e involucrate con todo lo referente a tu hija no importa que no esten en el mismo techo....claro....siempre busca un buen terapeuta que te ayude a sobrellevar la situacion y que te ayude con la nueva relacion con tu hija....suerte|`|8688ea221ce7f2d51c3991a9542a48dcaa	Entiendo que tu hija tiene una pareja que es mujer y que todos vivien juntos.<br>  Si tu consideras que ya no puedes seguir viviendo junto a ella, entonces alejate y dejala vivir su vida, si esta cometiendo errores, ella aprendera de ellos, Creo que no es bueno que los padres vivan en la misma casa con los hijos  a menos  que exista algo de fuerza mayor que los lleve a esa situacion,  pero lo mas recomendable es que los hijos vivan su vida y los padres las suya, porque los padres tienen el papel de educarlos hasta cierto punto pero luego los hijos se van a  vivir su vida, es la ley de la vida.<br>  |`|O1VcMSvzaa	porque no van con un consejero matrimonial para que puedan arreglar las cosas y asi no te separas de tu tesorito que es tu hija?

2FiMbvjRaa	Pues mira que es una situacion muy delicada cuando es a ti cuando sucede, por que cuando lo ves en amistades no lo ves tan grave.<br>  <br>  Una de las cosas que tienes en que pensar es en ti misma, se que es para ti una persona muy importante por que los a?os que llevan saliendo, no se hechan a la basura asi como asi y menos cuando es el primero en la vida de noviazgo y/o en relaciones.<br>  <br>  Como tu ya lo mencionaste antepusiste tu dignidad como  persona y buscaste la mejor opcion; si él realmente te queria devio buscarte he insistir asta convenserte, sin embargo no lo hizo por que ya como lo mencionas, no eres su prioridad. . . y quien sabe ya no sienta nada por ti. Por que a estas alturas resulta ser mas que ovio.<br>  <br>  <br>  Creo que eres una chik muy valiente y sobre todo demaciado inteligente, por lo que él no sabe lo que ha perdido que ademas con el tiempo se dara la arrepentida de su vida.<br>  <br>  Creo que es normal que quieras buscarlo por que para ti, él si era tu prioridad por que tu si saves amar. pero como te vas a dar cuenta, no te merece.<br>  <br>  Tal ves te mencionen por alli un dicho muy conocido  que "un clavo saca otro clavo", sin embargo a mi me parece que no es asi de facil. <br>  <br>  Yo creo que para cuando llegue otra oportunidad en tu camino vas a estar renuente y vas a querer proteger a tu corazon con todas las murallas que puedas y, que para el peor de los males nadie podra venserlas a pezar que lo pidas a gritos.<br>  <br>  Si te lo pido como un favor a pezar que no tengo el gusto de conocerte que nunca atentes contra tu propia vida por querer borrar lo que algun inconciente te hizo. Nada ni nadie merece tu apreciable vida que solo a ti es a quien deve importar y aferrarte a ella.<br>  <br>  Mi muy humilde opinion (por que es solo eso), es que convivas con tus familiares y amigos para borrar esta situacion tan lastimosa, y procura no mencionar el tema por el momento por que aun esta muy fresca tu erida para que no te lastime, pero no por eso te sierres a la posivilidad de darte otra oportunidad. <br>  <br>  A partir de ahora tu veras a los chikos con desconfianza y al hacecho en todo momento y asta sentiras desprecio por cada accion que tomen en un sentido machista/feminista, no nos jusgues por que alguien te lastimo; aqui afuera ay alguien para ti, que realmete te sepa apreciar, te valore  y te vea dignamente. Solo tienes que seguir buscando y arriesgarte dando tu 100 en todo momento.<br>  <br>  Te deso lo mejor en la vida y espero poner un granito de arena a la cuasa de amor que todos necesitamos y por lo que hemos sido crado, te mado un fuerte abrazo y espero que cuando en el futuro sepa de ti que sea que estas en mejores condiciones.

Me deprimí tanto que en un mes perdí casi 6 kilos, no comía y lo que hacía era llorar día y noche. Le supliqué que me perdonara, que volviéramos, cosa que no me hace sentir orgullosa... Pero sentía que mi vida se moría, que no tenía sentido, pensé en el suicidio, en dejar todo y mudarme de ciudad, no podía estar en mi casa si quiera porque todo me acordaba a él. No entendía por qué lloraba tanto!!!

O fue que te casaste sin amarlo ?<br>  Los argumentos que expones para separarte no tienen gran peso excepto por lo que dices de no amarlo, cosa que a mi modo de ver se trata de una nueva etapa de la relacion, pues no siempre viviras en el punto del enamoramiento donde todo es Hello Kitty.<br>  Piensalo, es cuestion de madrurar en pareja, de crecer.  Buscate una actividad individual que te saque de la monotonia.  Afiansate en lograr nuevas metas, esto enriquecera la relación y con el tiempo veras que solo se trataba de una crisis.  Uno debe afrontar las crisis y no salir corriendo despavorido porque asi no aprenderas nunca las lecciones que te pone la vida.

AA10925759	My first thought was moaning the name of say Ann Coulter. But I thought again.<br>  <br>  You r wife would be a democrat right? She would get her news from TV, newspapers, the internet and all of that. So you moan say Nancy Pelosi or Hillary.<br>  <br>  Or in casual conversation you say how much you admire Hillary Clinton keeping Bill after he just made that little mistake with Lewinsky and others. She must really love him. Then let it drop and say little else. <br>  <br>  That would get a women's mind thinking on so many levels it would not even be funny.

bsgba6Evaa	-I got married on a cruise ship (Royal Caribbean).  The wedding cake came with the reception package. I really didn't worry too much about it because I know cruise ships are know for having good tasting food, and if I didn't like how the cake looked, I knew that it would be cut quickly. I had no say in how it would look, I told them how many guests were attending (for the size of the cake), and I  chose the flavor --it was the best wedding cake I ever tasted. I did, however, request that they use some flowers to decorate it, and they did. A few flowers were on top of the cake (no writing on it), and were decorated nicely on the table surrounding the cake. It actually looked elegant. <br>  <br>  -I would keep calling the cruiseline. Also, try to speak with a supervisor rather than a representative if he/she is not helpful. If you don't get a response, it's better to bring your own cake.<br>  <br>  -I hope that helps!|`|RYL6BNX3aa	We were married on a boat and brought the cake. My Dad's only job was getting the cake. I got one that was in three seperate pieces so it was easier to move and was on three different stands each at a different level. I also thought if it didn't work out and something happened to it I had the option of getting another cake later and take pictures of it to add to the album. Can you have a slab as a backup?|`|BitAsc8daa	bring it on the ship.  then u can get a perfect cake and not have it go horribly wrong.|`|hDkGc9uAaa	Calling them would be much better than email. But i would assume that it is easier to get it from the cruise bakery
qcQm8eIbaa	been there.<br>  <br>  Okay, so you already know that you need time.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a hobby. Finding things you like to do.<br>  <br>  1. You'll be a better person.<br>  2. You'll be busy and won't have all that time thinkin' about him.<br>  3. You might meet other people.<br>  4. You might find something you really like to do.<br>  <br>  Other then that, just remember this is one of your first 'loves/crushes'. <br>  It's a pain, but really, the only thing that helps is time.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER- Word of warning. Your brain can get into a rut. You get used to thinking about the same person over and over.<br>  When your ready to move on, your brain might still be in that rut of thinking of the person.<br>  <br>  Your goal right now is to move your brain out of a rut. Give it something else to think about.<br>  Like a hobby. Drama, Debate, making bracelets, coloring. ANYTHING besides what's his name.|`|fwnitiZhaa	It took me a huge amount of time to get over my first boyfriend when i was your age. Now I am 17 and have been with someone for over 2 years.

You will look back and laugh! Because I did. Just don't make the same mistakes I did:<br>  - It's not your fault!<br>  - And its not the end of the world.<br>  Get out there and have soem fun :)|`|nqFAFkWtaa	yeah i understand what you feel for now, it is like me before i really hurt when we broke up because i really love him on that time we thought both parents we get married but then i refuse, i am like your age 14 but i already feel falling in love with that guy, but i don't want to get married on that, so we just give some space both sides if we were meant to be but then later he found someone else that his parents want him to get married, i don't have choice i just let him go, and on that time i just told myself i think it was only a puppy love,and now im happy i am a filipina and then i married a canadian lovely guy.<br>  so dont let yourself ruin only by a boy, your still young just move on make your life happy, forget your boy before it can make you tired always thinking of him, for now as young as you are love yourself first than the guys, it is only your vegetables for now, so be happy and godbless take time for being a young girl still.|`|3WCONjyfaa	OK<br>  <br>  A. You are far too young to be thinking that some guy is your everything.<br>  B. 6 weeks is too short for a relationship to even consider stuff like that. <br>  and C. It's been a year. There are hundreds of guys out there. Just wait until you turn 15 or go to high school to start re-dating. Take time off, hang with your girls, and then when you feel the time is right, then put yourself back out there.
2ZXt112Qaa	Maybe is in the way you project yourself. I have a similar situation to yours. Instead of attracting druggies, I attract depressed people. People that need help or that have very low self esteems. My problem was that I got involved in their lives trying to help them and I ended up hurting myself. I think is the way you project yourself to others. <br>  <br>  I heard a saying "you attract what you are" I hope is wrong though.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now I spend most of my time alone or with a very small number of people. I also have kept away those that were wrong in my life or hurting me (affecting me) in any way. That's my best solution to it. Be very selective and keep away from those types of people. The more you have the more will approach you.|`|zfWmQst5aa	Personality change|`|onrcmQf8aa	There is still something about you that draws them to you.  You may not have changed as much as you think.

It sounds like that was a hard move to make but you did it, and you're a better person for it. <br>  As for attracting the wrong people.... well, have you given the people at the gym a fair shake? They may be thinking that you're the straight laced one and are hard to talk to - or maybe you intimidate them a little? I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just giving an honest opinion. And stop hanging out in places where you meet druggies & gang bangers - old habits die hard. Re-arrange your college schedule, if you need to, to stay away from those types of people. <br>  Also remember that the friends you make AFTER college are going to be your life-long friends.

It was a perfect moment in many ways.|`|vOyPjccxaa	On vacation in Punta Cana, Dominic Republic. Under the stars on the beach. It was sooo romantic.
iPNOVR6Gaa	Given the right circumstances, I would probably "stick by" my spouse or child through any of your list.  These circumstances would probably involve these things not being a pattern of behavior and the person being truly sorry for what she did and wanting forgiveness.  I would then continue to love her and give her another chance.<br>  <br>  A few months ago, my teenage daughter shoplifted.  I stuck by her through her probation, community service, etc.  I sincerely hope she has learned her lesson.  But it would take a lot more than that to make me stop loving her.  She has also smoked marijuana, and fought us about our absolute prohibition of that.  She seems to have given up the fight - either she stopped using it completely, or she now uses it so rarely and discretely that we can't tell.<br>  <br>  Just over a year ago, my wife got fired from her career position for using drugs.  This was such a complete shock to me that it rocked my world.  But one of the first things I told her, as she cried in guilt and shame, was that this was not going to break us up.  And it hasn't.  She's been clean ever since, regularly attending counseling and Narcotics Anonymous meetings even up to this very day.<br>  <br>  Obviously, I've never had to deal with murder, but under the circumstances you describe, I don't think it would make me stop loving either my wife or my daughter.  As a man, and since they're females, I can't even imagine them raping someone or abusing me, so I'm not even going to try to address those.<br>  <br>  If my wife cheated on me, yes, I'd like to think that I could and would stick by her.  A long time ago, I cheated on her, and she stuck by me, and eventually forgave me, so I feel I would owe her to treat her at least as well as she treated me.  Obviously, it would be extremely tough, worse than the drug use that actually happened, but the roots of our marriage are deep after all these years.<br>  <br>  Finally, let's address this "defend" thing.  No, I would never defend them for any of those things!  When my wife got fired for drugs, I did not march into her boss's office and demand that she get her job back.  When my daughter got arrested for shoplifting, I did not hire a lawyer to try to get the charges dropped.  If they do the crime, thy must do the time.  So, stand by them, yes, under the right circumstances.  But defend them?  Never.|`|dAQHWvY0aa	1 - yes. <br>  #2 - yes, and I have stuck by someone in this situation - It doesn't mean you don't find them help, which I did, and thankfully, he's in recovery (3 years and counting.)<br>  #3 - yes, but it would be eons until I would trust them/forgive them for bringing such pain to someone.<br>  #4 - Same as number 3.<br>  #5 - Neither would be so stupid, but should it happen, yes, I would stick by them and kick their ***<br>  #6 - Yes. And he would be getting help. Big time counseling help.|`|jrqXRqqCaa	i will disown my spouse,but not my child,thats clear,i can have another spouse as many as i can,but i can never change my own blood and flesh!|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	my spouse is disposable for most of those things.  my child, i would love them no matter what.  i would NEVER stop loving my child or disown them.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Okay, if one of my children hit me I'd have to beat them down to the white meat.<br>  <br>  But if my child did any of the other things you listed I wouldn't disown them but I wouldn't condone that behavior either.  A parent's job is to praise their child when they're right and let them know when they're wrong and try to assist them in correcting that bad or irrational behavior no matter how old they are.  <br>  <br>  And when a parent has done all that they can do then you pray and let the child go.  Eventually, they will accept their wrong and change or do their time or they will continue to fail.<br>  <br>  As for a spouse, same applies.|`|1tiCB311aa	Boy these are tough. <br>  Robbery: Question why did they commit the robbery? If it was just for the heck of it. They need to spend their time in jail. Would I visit? Probably.<br>  <br>  Drugs are a bad bad thing. My son has been there. I stood by him. It becomes a disease and addiction. It's hard to beat once they start using. He has spent time in jail because of it and Mom stuck by him. <br>  <br>  Rape: There is never a reason for rape. I'd have a hard time with this one. <br>  <br>  Murder: If they were defending me or themselves I'd probably stick by them. If it was a random murder, I'd have a hard time sticking by them. If it was my child, I probably would visit, but he'd have to pay the price for the crime.<br>  <br>  Abuse: I've had an abusive husband. It took a while for me to get away from him. But I did it!!!! This is not an easy thing to do. I've never had a child hit me. Thank Goodness. <br>  <br>  Cheating: It's not right, but I could forgive them. It would take a while to trust them again, if ever.|`|djUMvICoaa	I'm a little surprised at a question like this what does any of it prove?  To the first four if you said no you'd have to be an idiot either way.  You stand by them and help them work things out.  You don't condone those things but you stick by them unless it's a pattern.  No to the spouse hitting and if you didn't teach your kid any better you deserve to find out the consequences of what you unleash onto the world.  No to cheating.  Question to you, would you ever kill anybody?|`|hCJ66msnaa	well as far as the child goes thats a tough one lol you always want to be there for your child but for both child and spouse if it were they started using drugs i would try to get them help if they didnt do it then i would have to say no simply because i have multiple children so if one did it it wouldnt be fair to put the others in that situation they would have to leave my house until they got help as far as the others robbery i would say no to that too there is no good reason to do that and no to the rape there is no good reason for that  the murder thing would probably have to depend on the circumstances for which they commited the murder of course i dont condone this by any means but the circumstances behind it would weigh on my decision to stand by them or to disown them|`|J3W0pTd2aa	I'd try and help them to stop robbing or get off drugs but as forrape and murder I would face a serious moral dilemma. Itreally depends on the context but if this happened you would have to wonder if you'd been a good enough parent if youraised a child that commited these acts.|`|AA10151168	I don't wanna answer these but what I observed is people mostly go for their child instead of their spouse..So children find more support but I wouldn't want to be ashamed of any of those..None of them are supportive and they are all wrong..|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	This question is too serious. I won't answer it.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	I would never disown either of my children, no matter what they did.  My father disowned me for the horrendous crime of not obeying his wife when I was an adult paying my own way, and to me that is pretty sorry.  So my children are stuck with me no matter what.<br>  As for my spouse, I would stick by him until I could not anymore.  <br>  Sticking by someone is not the same as condoning their behavior.  You can still love and support someone and totally disagree with what they did.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I see a spouse and my child in two completely different lights.  My spouse would be a grown man, my child is a child, and I am all he has in the world.<br>  <br>  So, to answer:  The spouse is on his own in all of those situations.  He has made his choices and I make mine and it includes not tolerating any of those behaviors.<br>  <br>  I have been a single mom for 10+ years and the issue here has been close to me, because I have been a criminal defense attorney for many of those years.  Many criminals were reared in homes by single mothers and their fathers were either absent or themselves criminals.<br>  <br>  My son has been told by me for years that if he commits a crime, I will not bail him out of jail, but I would hire a good attorney to make sure his rights are protected.  He is 12.  I have taken him to the county jail on "field trips."  I have taken him with me to court and let him see the men in orange suits and restraints lined up in the jury box on Fridays for arraignment.  Ultimately, I will keep my word, and I take every action now to avoid ever going there with my son.

John is a free agent and you and your husband are both pawns in his sick little game.  You are worried about "cheating," and should be more worried about why you bothered to get married, at all, to anyone, in the first place.  Neither of you have the first clue what marriage is about.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	i think that all 3 of you need to take a step back from this situation and realize how twisted that this is.  this sounds like something from jerry springer and nothing good will come from it.  you either need to figure out if you want to remain married to your husband or split up.  this won't work long term.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Your husband wants to have his John [er, cake] and eat it too...<br>  selfish, selfish, selfish.<br>  Tell him that whole Goose/Gander story, Honey.<br>  Good luck!!  :)|`|R0U4qy6haa	i do not see why he is complaining he still has both of you -and you are getting what you want also--good girl -enjoy|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Oh the webs we weave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4t4U9eFOaa	What an interesting situation.  It sounds like you have a pretty open marriage (i envy you).  I think that your husband feels insecure with your cheating and obviosly you don't feel insecure about his relationship.  Maybe some guidelines should be established to make sure that everyone is safe and secure in the relationship.  Good luck|`|jBigEy0Caa	Ha!  So he wants to play, but can't take it when you do.

I would never marry a gay or bisexual <br>  man. In fact i would never be intimate in any shape or<br>   form with any man that had kissed, rubbed or f*cked <br>  another man, it's just a major no-no for me. <br>  <br>  But, all I know to tell you is to apologize for sleeping <br>  with his partner and swear not to do it again or, if you're<br>   really desperate then maybe suggest a 3 some.<br>   Again, this behavior is all very strange to me, but it's whatever floats your boat. <br>  <br>  Just don't fan the flames and everything should cool down.
SyuGWtq0aa	I have been in this situation and it's quite difficult to get used to. My husband used to come home every other weekend and it was like a holiday but nothing important was ever discussed in case it ended badly because he had to go again. Then he left this job and moved home permanently, we both found it hard to get used to as we each had our own routine but after about a year we now find it normal again.|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	It if drives you to distraction to have your routine disrupted you are in the wrong relationship.
b1c1cfae4e69dbb558dcec1bac53da19aa	I have hosted some bridal showers, my sister and a close friend's shower, as well as attend. Here are some games I have played or seen done.<br>  <br>  1) Give each guest a balloon and see who can blow up the biggest or even who pops it first, yes it can be loud, but some what fun too. It is basically who can blow the fastest.<br>  <br>  2) Bridal pictionary, separate into groups, draw things that are related to weddings and/or the bride<br>  <br>  3) Box of recipes, when sending out the invites, put a recipe with the card and have each guest write down a recipe whether it be an old family or just a random one and then put it in a book for the bride.<br>  <br>  4) This is more of a bride game, you pick four random objects (can be kitchen or household or anything else) and have her blind folded so she cant see what she is touching. Then have her describe what she has, she can touch, smell or even taste if she feels like it. You will get a kick out of what she might think it is to what it actually is.<br>  <br>  5) This can be a door prize, you have each guest write down their wedding date or if single, their birthday date and whoever has the closes date to the wedding date wins.<br>  <br>  6)You always got the old standby bridal bingo<br>  <br>  7) Making a wedding bouquet out of toilet paper, divide each guest into teams to come up with one, best design wins<br>  <br>  8) Another old stand by bridal crossword puzzles<br>  <br>  9) For an ice breaker, give each guest a close pin and then at the start give everyone three words, related to the bridal shower or how ever you want it, and throughout the shower whoever says one of those words loses their clothes pin, the one with the most at the end wins, it is almost like the "baby" game at a baby shower where you cant say baby.<br>  <br>  10) This game is where the bride leaves the room and everyone has to write down 10-15 things about her. What she is wearing, hair-eye color, jewelery, shoes, socks (pending on what she wearing) whoever guesses the most wins.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. I know some of them are lame but its a wedding shower, they can be fun.|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	go to <a href="http://www.bridalshower.com/d-games/complete.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bridalshower.com/d-games/comp...</a><br>   it has a lot of fun games to play|`|OHydEvTCaa	Who knows the bride best..

WMR8hVlfaa	There are shelters and programs all over the country that exist to help rescue women and their children from domestic violence situations. Your friend must be willing to let them help her, but they will and can get her and her daughter out and to safety.

(b) Any history of abuse by one parent or any other person seeking custody against any of the following: (1) Any child to whom he or she is related by blood or affinity or with whom he or she has had a caretaking relationship, no matter how temporary. (2) The other parent. (3) A parent, current spouse, or cohabitant, of the parent or person seeking custody, or a person with whom the parent or person seeking custody has a dating or engagement relationship.

If she really wants to get out of that relationship then that is great.  There are too many women who just sit by and let their spouse or boyfriend beat up on them and then their children.  If they don't beat the children then they are for sure causing emotional abuse because the child sees how they are treating the mother.  She needs to write everything that happened down so it doesn't just look like she is making it up.  Since they are both married neither one of them as custody, they both do.  So she can take her and leave the state and there isn't anything he can do about it.  If she still wants to be with him and thinks he can clean up then she could tell him that he has to go into a program, clean up his act and if he does she will come back to him.  Or she could just take her daughter, leave and then file for divorce.  She should find one of the state hotlines for abused women, I know they are usually in hospital bathrooms and such.  Then she can call them and they can't call the police or anything but they will tell her what the right thing to do in CA is.

AA10287824	You can live. You can breathe. From a guys perspective, as you are healing make sure that you don't give him a back door to come back. As you are healing and getting your independence back you will be appealing to him again and he will be willing to do whatever it takes to earn your trust (superficially) and as soon as you get used to him being around again and enjoying the warm blanket of his love he will dissapear again. I don't know why guys do that. Sometimes we want our woman to depend on us and be there for us but in the midst of being there sometimes we get overwhelmed and irritated. Then we want to be free. When we're free then we want her back when she has her independence back. IF you do take him back then he has to wait. Like 2-3 months before you let him back in how he was. If he can get you back with a date at your favorite place and some sweet words he will never respect you. Good luck.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	You haven't done anything that we haven't all made the mistake of doing, spending 100% of your time and energy on one person.  Now, you realize that you made a mistake, and just go from there.  Don't beat yourself up.  What I'd do if I were you, is call one of those old friends and try to re-acquant yourself with them.  Most good friends are pretty forgiving and then, when they come back into your life, you treat them well, and never abandon them for a future boyfriend, ok?  Then, once you have some people to talk to you can really heal yourself.  My friends have been my salvation, throughout my divorce, trust me!  Then, after the friend issue, you look at your life, evaluate what isn't working and work on that.  That will give you a positive focus.  For me, it was eating right and exercising.  It was positive to get into the best shape of my life, it made me feel optimistic about life.  As for the guy, you grew apart.  You may have noticed that you are different than you were when you were 18 yrs old.  It will take some time, but you'll get over him and move on.  It will just take some time.  Allow yourself to heal.  Don't call him and get out of house arrest.  Good luck and go call an old friend today, ok?|`|AA10674998	what you seem to be experiencing is a like event to something that happened in the past, and with it all the feelings of the past are coming up again.  What feelings?  In a word, some event made you feel worthless in the past.  Right?  And now the new event makes you feel worthless again.<br>  <br>  Alot of the relationships we make in life are for the purpose of getting new identity messages about who we are.  Whereas we have all heard that we are worthless in the past, we keep making relationships that we think can erase those messages from before, but almost always they just affirm what was said before.  This is because we pick the type of person that hurt us to erase the message, but it is that type of person that hurts us again.  <br>  <br>  Here is an example: Joey had a parent that was aloof or missing from an early age.  His father sent away for long trips.  This made Joey feel worthless.  So, what type of person will Joey seek out to make those feelings go away?  Will Joey pick someone that is always there for him?  You might think that would be a good decision, but Joey wants to get that message erased by someone like the one that gave it to him, so tragically Joey seeks out someone that is aloof and vacant to erase this massage, and such a person only makes it worse.<br>  <br>  So, like Joey, we tend to spiral down.  First we get a message like one that we want to undo.  Then we attempt to do some kind of strategy to CHANGE who we have been told we are (worthless.)  When that fails we resort to behaviors (like manipulation, drinking, pity) that only proves again the message that we were given seems to fit ... Then we try hard again to CHANGE ... and around and around we go.<br>  <br>  Here is the way off the horrific ride - New identity.<br>  In Christ, we are given a new identity.  We no longer need to look to others to tell us who we are.  Instead we received God's assessment of who we are.  Would we be worthless if He gave up His own innocent life for us?  NO WAY!  <br>  <br>  This transformation, once you are deliberate about focusing on who you are in Christ, takes several years to really begin to pay off, but the day is coming when you will not recognize who you are, nor what used to get you spiraling down.  You will have a firm idea of who you are that people and events won't be able to shake.<br>  <br>  Now, I know you belong to the Lord Jesus, so I don't mind saying all of these things.  And even if you do not accept my words, the plan is already in motion.  You life will prove what I am telling you, so I don't need to convince you ... I guess you could say that I'm just here to say that God is not through with you yet.He is making something beautiful.  He is planting you on the Rock.  You can accelerate the process by bing self aware of when you feel this way and looking to God for identity messages to erase who you once were, rather than looking to others.|`|d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	Well, I am a guy, but I can relate to these feelings. I was the guy at school that was always bullied and a lot of the times girls would not date me, now days, I notice when I go the gym I get looked at quite a bit, so the times have changed for me. Anyways, Whenever I got through a relationship I would be the very same way you are right now. You feel so lost, empty, you feel worthless, you feel like nothing in the world matters, etc.  Hopefully this guy will come back to you, but if not, I am sure there will be someone better just waiting to be with you.  My advice for you through my experiences would be to try and get out with anybody. If you mean you have no friends in the local area, try and drive for a bit to the friends that are around. It also really helps to be around family members as much as possible so that you get the emotional support you need. If they live far away, talk on the phone with them, talk on the phone with friends. Get involved with Facebook and try and find the people you knew long ago, I did this and it helped, I got in touch with people from ages ago and we talk now.  I notice that going to the gym helps get rid of this built up stress in life and also allows you to see new people, new surroundings and you also get to talk to new people and make new friends. I was not deprived as a kid or through my life in family matters, but was very much deprived when it came to friends and girlfriends. But, I have had my share of girlfriends to know exactly how you feel. My past life has influenced my current life, I love relationships so much that it is like a drug and I give 100% dedication to one person, I want everything with that person. I love the attention because I never got it in the past. The only thing I can say is that time heals all wounds, it just takes patience. But those ideas I gave should really help. Also, one other piece of advice I have as far as natural pathic ways are concerned and have worked WONDERS on me is what is called "Chill Pills", go to any local natural health food store and ask for those pills, they adjust the mood naturally through vitamins and my Mother works in a natural health food store and usually within a week or two, the customers come back for more because the son or daughter was using them because of a break up and said they worked wonders. The idea is that when you get stressed or sad, your body uses a lot of the Vitamin B within your body, when the vitamin B gets used up, you start to feel more stressed, the idea of the "Chill Pills" is that it puts this vitamin B back into your body and balances out the bad chemicals making you feel horrible with the good Vitamin B that makes you feel really good. It is natural and uses herbs that have no side effects except that you feel good inside and happier in general. Also, I take what is called "Goji Berry Juice" made by "Genesis today, Goji 100". The Goji berry is also called the "Happy Berry" by nickname because it has nutrients in it that are concentrated more so in the Goji Berry that makes us feel happy, even if you are not in a break up, this in general will make you feel happier, I notice a huge difference in my day to day work and life, all around happier taking this juice. A bottle of this juice though is about $55 or so and lasts a fairly long time, you only need about 2-3 tablespoons a day from roughly a 1.5L bottle. This juice is good because it is 100% natural, organic and has absolutely nothing else in it. It is also cold pressed, so you do not get the processes involved that eventually make the product a bad thing. Cold pressing makes it possible so that the heat and chemicals involved with processing does not break down the beneficial things within the Goji Juice, for that matter anything, like Olive oil for example. Anyways, try the chill pills and maybe some Goji Berry Juice, I have tried other Goji Berry Juices and did not notice much, the one I listed, "Goji 100, Genesis today" was the one I got the best results from. Hope this helps and best of luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Pauper|`|wXaGIPSPaa	music helps...go to youtube and listen to these songs:<br>  I will love again Kaci<br>  I will learn to love again fabian<br>  better in time Lewis<br>  <br>  go to these websites and explore:<br>  www.broken-heart.net<br>  <a href="http://lovesagame.com/the-secrets-of-ultrafast-break-up-recovery-newsletter/" rel="nofollow">http://lovesagame.com/the-secrets-of-ult...</a><br>  www.womansavers.com<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie, it hurts a long time.

The bad news is that you allowed yourself to become isolated and totally dependent on this one individual who is obviously not very mature. At the same time, you were not wise to lower your defences, although I understand this is easy in theory, not so easy in real life. <br>  <br>  Watch Oprah and surround yourself with many empowering women who can help and support you. I recommend you purchase a copy of 'New Earth' written by Eckhard Tolle which may guide you to your true purpose of your existence. It will not interfere with your Faith, if you are a religious person, it will only strengthen and provide insight into what you already know.<br>  <br>  Do not be scared or afraid, I assure you that many people have been where you are today. This may be of little consequence when you go through your own pain, but it is fact and you need to know that you are never alone.

8AqePkCqaa	It depends. Can you afford an apartment and all that goes with it. You must have a steady job and be able to comfortably support yourself. In these days and times it's very hard. 2 of my kids have had to come home because it's so expensive that takes all your check you have nothing to spend. But if you have a great job and can afford it's cool. If you live at home check out prices of places you want to live then pretend your there take that money money for food gas utilities etc and put in a savings and see if you can live without that money as if it were for real.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Well first you need to make sure that you have a stable job.  Your job should pay you enough to pay your rent, utilities, car fare (gas, maintenance), buy groceries, Hygiene products and you should still be able to save some money and have money for activities such as movies, etc.<br>  <br>  If you can do that and you're responsible enough to pay your bills on time then I think you would enjoy the freedom of living on your own.  But you might want to save money for furniture before you move in.  And have a house warming party.  Friends and family will buy things like toasters and dishes and you get the opportunity to share your new beginning with them.|`|RLoilwCNaa	I'd say once you have a steady job, maybe after college, then you're ready.

People acquire these abilities after their teenage years. Thus, I guess, that a very good age to start considering about living by yourself is at about 19-20. But still, if someone is still immature by that age then I guess that he should still live with his parents or something.|`|Hd4vMUZaaa	I think you'll know when its time naturally. It is when the fear and worry of living alone leaves you. I have been feeling this lately, and a sense of confidence in finding a flat with a friend is kind of overwhelming, and exciting.

wMWfCjBpaa	A good seamstress will always do three fittings. One now, another a month or so before the wedding, and a last one the week of. This should be included in their price. They are fully aware that it does not always fit the first time every time.

Ahk5jr5Xaa	I am assuming you are a young person... I felt the same way at times when I was a teenager.<br>  <br>  What I learned is that girls can be very petty (myself included) - I ended up having more "guy friends" than girlfriends. My feelings did not get hurt as much that way, and I never felt like they judged me, like some of my "girlfriends" did.<br>  <br>  As far as the jealousy thing... the Bible says that Jealousy is as cruel as the grave. (Song of Solomon 8:6)<br>  <br>  It is very important to guard your feelings - jealousy turns into bitterness and before you know it, you hate who you have become. I have been there and done that... not a happy picture.<br>  <br>  Don't be rude to your friends, but start backing away a little, and find other friends that are of the male species.

This is a good thing that you are a great friend, but it can also cause you to feel betrayed, left out, or hurt when your friends enjoy others company. <br>  <br>  Put yourself in their shoes. You probably have a few different friends and you love all of them in a different way. They shouldn't be labeled best, 2nd, 3rd, and so on. You probably love each of them because of their different traits- one may make you laugh, one may be a good listener, on may be a good shopping buddy. Your friends see you the same way. They go to you because you're special to them and getting jealous will only push them away. Avoid talking negatively about their other friends and possibly arrange for all of you to hang out in a group.<br>  <br>  You are not alone in these feelings and you can coach yourself through this with time.

A couple of years ago a was with this guy. We broke up on what you might call none speaking terms. Well he didn't do good things and he got locked up. His brother and friend told me so. Now we stay in communication through his family and he wants me to write to him. That's what I am going to do today. It's good for them! In my case because I know him I write to him, but then again if it were to be a total stranger  I honestly wouldn't. I haven't forgotten him though some people do exactly what you say. Once they're locked up everybody forgets. He suffers a lot of depression inside their so is a way to free his mind from what is happening. <br>  <br>  I hope I answered your question!|`|piUC8oVqaa	maybe its a shame thing i guess it depends on why the person is locked up.. maybe we don't want to remember that person in jail i know that some people have bee upset for eg my friend went to jail for vandalisim and theft of a local secondary school (he is 18) his mum said she went to visit him and he's very quiet and lost weight it upset her|`|0LdQcKgAaa	thanks for answering my question it was a good answer. i feel the reason why we forget them is because they done something bad and maybe you did not want 2 be apart of theire lifes anymore or maybe because they just dont have time fro someone in jail i hoped i helped|`|q3Wrptpcaa	Its not that we forget about them i mean life just going on just like if they were to die we don't forget about them its just life proceed with out them not on purpose|`|lIx6kngbaa	Out of sight out of mind.

AA11312653	A fake wedding is exactly what you DO NOT want. It mocks the seriousness of marital commitment to have a wedding when no marriage is taking place, as if a wedding were all about the "nifty" costumes and pageantry instead of about the start of a new family.<br>  <br>  You invite people to your anniversary party, and then surprise them with a reaffirmation of your marriage vows. You change the vows a little to reflect that (1) you are already married and (2) you are also making a commitment to care for the children. Then you have a champagne toast and go on with the party.<br>  <br>  I advise that you do not mention vow renewal on the invitations. That will make people think you are just doing this to shake them down for gifts. Congrats on your 10 years and best wishes for the years to come.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Since this is a relatively new tradition, you can go about it any way you like. Have as many or as few guests, any size party, wear whatever you like. But I would recommend having the kids involved.|`|AA11323102	To formally renew vows the officiant prepares a ceremony similar to the original marriage vows making references to your wedding date and any significant things along the way. Children can participate as attendees or say some words or read a poem. Usually the original Marriage Certificate is endorsed on the back that you renewed vows, where, when, by whom. This custom is done a lot in Texas but some areas do not know it even exists.<br>   Select a trained officiant who has experience doing them and discuss it fully.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Its not at all like a wedding, and it should not be treated as such. That means no big fluffy wedding dress, no ring exchange, no bridesmaids or flower girls, or giving the bride away. You can however, do whatever you want for the party/lunch afterward.<br>  Vow renewals are personal affairs. While it may be meaningful to you, its not celebratory in the same way that a wedding is. Its probably best to keep the guest list small, even family only would be fine. <br>  <br>  I have to correct the person who said because its a relatively new concept, means you can do whatever you want. Thats not true. People who treat vow renewals like a wedding make themselves look foolish and make a mockery of both weddings and vow renewals. Keep it small and tasteful, and you wont go wrong!|`|9de68204fb68bbbc0e10fc5b9880ed2eaa	Renewals are usually done exactly like weddings.  Many people include their children because it teaches them that marriage is important and that it has purpose. And as far as the reception goes, it can be pretty much anything you choose because the event is more about the renewal and not all of the festivities that go along with it... although people enjoy that as well.. the limo, the cake, the boquet, etc.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	Essentially just treat it like a low-key wedding, though you can pretty much do whatever you desire, including re-creating the original wedding ceremony.

Back when I had a job my husband would leave the house earlier than me in the mornings and get home a lot earlier than me so sometimes I'd leave notes around the house for him to find.  You don't have to do anything extravagant or expensive, it's the little simple things that matter.  Now that I'm unemployed, I have a lot more time at home so my husband comes home for lunch.  I always have lunch ready for him and sometimes make treats for him like cookies or brownies.  If all else fails, tell them you love them and just pour your heart out.  They won't be able to look over that.
58qjx7XTaa	I wouldn't think anything bad about it.  Im sure he loves you very much, but maybe in his mind he thinks that when he marries someone it ruins it.  Seeing as he's been married twice before, maybe he's afraid that it won't work and he will lose you.<br>  <br>  When you say that you would love to spend the rest of your life with him, maybe to him he thinks your speaking of marriage.<br>  <br>  What about going to a counsellor and talking about his "getting married" issues.  Because you would have to decide if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who won't marry you, especially if thats something you really want.|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	maybe hes just really scared that if he gets married again that maybe he will be on a losing streak and doesnt want to lose you as well.|`|IPS3hWweaa	1. He may have been married before, but he is afraid of it now. He might have been scared off the subject by his ex wives, so he might not be ready to go through that again. So even though he loves you, he doesn't want to get married to you.<br>  <br>  2. He's willing to spend the rest of his life with you, but it won't be as a married couple. He can talk about it that way because in his mind it doesn't involve marriage, when you talk about it, it sounds like you're thinking you'll be married to him.|`|vrPDbUkVaa	well hun, hes probably been in alot in hes past two relationships and doesn't want it to happen again, he probably loves the way you two are now and doesn't want to ruin that.

I would take this as a very strong indicator that he isn't going to marry me and if marriage is what I wanted, I'd leave and find a man who wants it.<br>  <br>  Just because he's been married twice doesn't mean he will do it again.  Even if you do marry him, understand that the D word gets easier every time, not harder.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	There IS a reason he was divorced TWICE before & somehow I doubt it was the other two women's fault.  <br>  <br>  Do you know why you "date" (no sex) and get to know a man for a good 3+ months before you decide to enter an intimate relationship?  Because its harder to maintain the fiction / lie of who they are over a lengthy period of time.  Once you bring sex into the equation (which is triggered by lust / attraction and we often define as "love), it becomes A LOT harder to remain objective about your boyfriend and if he has the attributes to be a good husband (you start to make excuses etc. for him).<br>  <br>  At any rate, the bottom line is that his reaction and avoidance is an indicator of a problem.  You need to be direct with him, tell him you are looking for the truth from him about where your relationship is going and what he wants out of life.  If he is unable / unwilling to, well now you know why he got divorced.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Perhaps he is not afraid of marriage but he is afraid of the laws that govern marriage and divorce.  <br>  <br>  When people just shack up together without any legalities and formalities.  Then the government often is unaware of this relationship and doesn't get involved.  <br>  <br>  But as soon you make it legal and let the government know.  Then people are not free to do as they please.  They must ask the government for permission to end their relationship, if the relationship isn't working out.  And the government is free to decide on what conditions their relationship can end.<br>  <br>  And the problem with having the government decide something like that is that the government's decisions are not always fair or easy to fulfill.  Family laws are made by politicians.  And for them quite often political ideology and expedience is more important than considerations of equality before the law and justice.<br>  <br>  He is probably afraid of the government.  And that's why marriage is a taboo subject for him.|`|QhCy2009aa	Even though hes not afraid of marriage, having 2 previous marriages go bad would make anyone not want to think about it....

Good luck|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	Doesn't sound like he is very honest with you. He is playing mind games and manipulating you. That is what my gut instinct tells me.<br>  <br>  He's been married twice, it is unlikely he is mature enough to maintain a relationship or commitment long term. It is possible, he would like a long term relationship, but without the legal paper and depending on where you are in life, if you can live with that, a paper does not guarantee a marriage. Friendship does. Honesty does. Commitment does. By these qualities you need to judge what kind of a person you are dealing with. <br>  <br>  If you have a chance to meet any of the ex-wives, maybe that could provide some insight. Keep an open mind. I have always found the key to testing a man is when they are willing to take out life assurance. If not, they have no interest in protecting you for life and to 'flip' merely confirms how touchy this subject is. Few men have the guts to be honest, because they enjoy the game of cat and mouse. A man who is serious, you do not have to question. He will tell you the truth in so many ways. A relationship founded on doubt is destined to failure. Be careful and protect your heart.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	He has insecurities. He may say that he is not scared but he is. He is ok to talk about it, but when you start making plans or even mentioning them, he flips out and gets all offensive. It's all the signs of a commitment problem.|`|lxnwyLNVaa	he's probably got something on the go at work and is stressed out and just needs to relax for now. my suggestion would be to ask me about it later in the year when he has calmed down a bit. : )|`|vP3Tu9SVaa	It sounds like to me that he can not commit to a relationship. He is not worth waiting for. My suggestion is to move on and find someone else. If he loves you as much as he says he does, he would have committed his life to you already.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	maybe he's not that into you.|`|gkVd0encaa	we are afraid of you taking our money, or leaving us when we say we want a prenup....|`|hCJ66msnaa	him freaking out does not necessarily mean that he doesnt love you or that his feelings have changed. you said he has been married twice before and it obviously didnt work or you wouldnt be with him right now lol that is what scares him. ive been married twice too and while im not closed to having a serious relationship with someone or even spending the rest of my life with them im not sure id want to get married again. its got nothing to do with his feelings. marriage is a serious thing. and sometimes difficult to get out of and its very costly to get a divorce, just dating makes it alot easier to get out if it doesnt work. it doesnt mean he doesnt want it to work but face it there are no gaurentees in this world and since he has had two marriages already that didnt work its more real for him the fact that nothing in life is a gaurentee even being with someone you love very much can end without warning or explanation people grow apart and change it happens and he knows that all too well twice. give him a break and dont push you are together and that is what matters now. what is marriage anyway a piece of paper that says your together you dont need that to profess your love for each other or to share your lives together. good luck|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Ask him frankly do you love me? Do you think of your ex wives like me? Open discussion is the only way. He has a fear of commitment by paper right now. <br>  In Canada & the USA common law is the same thing after a year as far as possessions. So you can tenderly say look we've been together 2 years and if anything were to happen like you change your mind about me, then it by la is technically the same.<br>  As they say one bitten twice shy, he has been bitten twice soooo.<br>  I assume if he has been married twice you are younger than him?<br>  He may think all women are the same. Go ahead open discussion not a fight. Write your feelings down too. Get him to do the same.<br>  Only way to save problems is to discuss the previous divorces and what happened and ask if he thinks that will happen to you two?<br>  If he is scared that's natural and it may be up to you to reassure him though he is a grown man. :-)<br>  Counselling I would suggest but he would probably think why can't you leave things well enough alone.... Men can be very insecure as we too can be.

And the cause can be things like jealousy - can you imagine?  Well, you just concentrate on being the best you can be.  Do not retaliate.  Show her love and I guess that will show her that you are different to her and at one point all she will have left is the guilt of having treated you the way she did.  Hopefully, one day she will say "Sorry for making your life a living Hell."

2G1vkdTzaa	First of all, how are you a single mother in the military with full custody? What branch are you in? It depends much so on that because different branches handle things differently. Your best bet would be to leave your son with your sister and pay for daycare while she is at work if she would agree to that. The military should take care of your family. Talk to family advocacy and they should be able to tell you exactly what you can and can't do.  Good Luck!
ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	in my oppinion.. your both cheating.. any time u need to turn to the opposite sex to fufill something your not getting from your spouse in an intimate nature... is considered cheating, whether it be sexual, physical, or emotional.. with him.. hes definately taken it to a different level with the baby, sexy , beautiful, and love you.. your on the other hand, are talking to a man about personal things in your relationship and using him as your emotional crutch something your husband is suppose to be.. (not that i blame u with what he's doing with the other chic) <br>  <br>  Im thinking that your marriage is more then likely over, your both turning to other people instead of each other, its probably time to throw in the towel..|`|67QVKHQ3aa	who the hell is this girl hes texting?? do you know her?> are you really letting this go on?? if i was married my man deffinetly would NOT be textin another women sayin any of those things, and as far as what you are doing, all women have a male friend..you not in the wrong atall, just maybe dont do it in front of your hubby that can make a man jealous even tho he will act like hes not!|`|u1uECuFNaa	Both.<br>  You put aside all others when you marry.<br>  He is wrong for saying those things...and talking to someone else like that at all. <br>  I text my husband and my sister and sister in law.

I wouldn't worry too much about the texting, and "baby" and "beautiful" are normal endearments between friends. "Sexy" is inappropriate though - he needs to cut that one out. If she is a friend, then I don't think you need to get hung up about him  saying "love you" either ... that signifies friendly love, and he probably does love her as a friend.<br>  <br>  It's interesting that your husband accuses you of cheating for texting and chatting to your guy friend ... that's the bit that would ring alarm bells for me!! If his interaction with his female friend is all sweet and legit, then the thought wouldn't enter his head that there would be anything wrong with you having contact with your guy friend! <br>  <br>  I don't seriously think either of you are cheating at the moment - but I think the fact that you're not getting along leaves you both vulnerable to it. I think you both need to make sure that you nurture your relationship with one another first and foremost, respect each other's concerns with regards to the 'friends' issue, and make sure you respect the boundaries that need to be in place.|`|AA11447210	Here's a good way to determine inappropriate behavior in a relationship. You and your husband can talk about each of your behavior and apply these tests:<br>  <br>  1. Would you do it in front of your partner?<br>  2. Would you be okay if your partner did the same thing?<br>  <br>  So, would you or your husband be comfortable sending those texts you send, with your spouse looking over your shoulder? Wording them exactly as you usually do...<br>  <br>  Would you or your spouse be okay if the other one sent texts to someone and had the same feelings and wording as you do when you send the texts? Would he be okay if you said 'love you' or called your male friend 'sexy'? Would you be okay with him addressing his female friend in the same manner you do your male friend?<br>  <br>  It's okay to talk about problems with trusted friends, but can cause issues if those friends are opposite sex. It's not okay to tell your friend you love them, call them sexy, beautiful, etc and especially not if you don't say those things to your own partner/spouse. <br>  <br>  Is he cheating?

He is not any better texting a woman...I will say this, I think that it is a very slippery slope that you find yourself on when you turn to other people other than eachother and if you are not careful one or both of you will cheat and that will be that. Make sure that you are ready to deal with the consequences if you continue on the road that you are on.|`|WJt1MwkVaa	Maybe he tries to make you believe that you are cheating, so he wont feel as bad about himself and the way he is behaving with this other girl. It is not cheating, talking out your problems with some one else. If you dont feel anything more for your friend, then it is just as if he was one of your girlfriends. I wouldnt really call what your husband is doing, cheating, either. But that doesnt mean that I would have tolerated it. If I were you, I would have been pissed.|`|hCJ66msnaa	well words are just words. saying something like he has been saying is one thing do you know if he has ever been with her in anyway? you talking to your male friend about your problems with your husband is not cheating but based on the things he says to her if they havent done anything there is a good chance that he will eventually i find it hard to believe he has said these things to her and hasnt already. sorry about that have you talked to your husband about this and tell him how it makes you feel and that it is not right to be saying these things to another woman while being married. you really should discuss things with him. if he doesnt want to be with you and wants to be with the other woman its best you know now before things go any farther. you are just going to continue to get hurt this way it may not be what you want to hear cuz im sure you love him but think about it do you want to continue to live like this with what he is doing. get things out in the open and discuss your options yes it will hurt in the beginning if you do end up splitting up but in the long run you will feel better. you deserve better and if he cant give it to you maybe he is not the man for you|`|Gfwt9XPJaa	hey, im not marriedor in a serious relationship but from my point of view both are you are in the wrong but more so your husband. if this guy you are texting was a friend before you and your husband started to have problems then there should'nt be an issue. But your husband has no right to say what he is saying as he is getting involved with this girl for more than friendship, he is telling her heloves her and calls hersexy whilst totally ignoring you. My advice would be to get out now before you get hurt anymore. Yes it will hurt now but not half as much as it will if you leave it and find out he is sleeping with her or worse he leaves you for her. You will feel stronger within your self for haveing the confidence to walkaway. good look hun xxx|`|AA11231094	YOUNG MARRIAGE!!! toooooo young to be married, still playing games of teenagers!!! thats what y'all are doing.<br>  You never tell another woman other then ya mom or sister love you, Calling her sexy etc. is him hoping to get in her pants... He doesnt text u like that nor talk to u like that im sure.. he is having sex with her if not planning on it real soon.

My hubby spent hours on the phone with a "girl" and lied to me about it..to me it was just as bad as when I did catch him cheating on me.  Don't worry...I stay for the kids.  If you don't really love him then get out before it is too late as in my case.|`|RLoilwCNaa	He's flat out wrong for sending the other woman that crap. Girl you need to give that dude a check up from the neck up. That's BS. You're just talking out problems with a friend (Though I can see why he would be jealous).

But your right in this situation, end of story.|`|eEu3zbVTaa	There is an emotional cheating and physical cheating.  Your husband is having an emotional affair.  He is cheating.

I don't see how you are cheating.
CFgxTI9yaa	You can't. But! You can make her enjoy time now. You can give her different experiences than she's ever had. You can share things she's never felt before. You can help her focus on the present and look forward to tomorrow! You can let her see that her needs can be met today! <br>  <br>  I think what you most have to look out for is - which is really weird - is that you're stable enough so that her thinking about her ex doesn't destabilize you... You pretty much have to be almost completely unaffected by her melancholy or completely understanding of it and bea at ease with it for it not to frustrate you. It might take a lot of time for her to forget. She may never forget! But! If you are constant and not frustrated nor destabilized about it, you might offer her a good chance to ease into being with you. Otherwise, you'll become a source of bad energy for her, if what you bring is anxiety, fear and frustration. Make sure you're able to cope with that before you even try! And you have to be stable yourself or otherwise you might end up as just a shoulder to cry on or the rebound guy! Be careful! Be sincere and be ready for what comes! Good luck! : )|`|nqFAFkWtaa	well if she accept you as her boyfriend so she s ready to listen your heart and try to forget the past of her boyfriend, but it is not easy like that you really suffer sometimes and you need to understand because you choose her to be with you, yeah need more patience listen to each other feelings, shes willing to give her heart to you if you really want to have her.<br>  be nice to her, give more love, let her feel that you really care, and she realize that even if she is like that there still someone can lean on willing to wait for the love. take care  both of you and god-bless.|`|MAMrNkZiaa	Its true that you will not able to erase the feelings completely from her but you have a option to show her more love than that she could get from him so that she will forget him at least in your presence.

Just call her at least once every two or three days make sure she's okay and doesn't need anything.  Try to have a little conversation and offer to bring her dinner or something and leave it at that.<br>  <br>  Women love sincerity.
qeNrGoMsaa	My parents married and should never had. It was a very British household, my father dominated all. My mother was a slave. My brother hated him, yet of course loved him somewhere inside. He did everything to not being like my Dad, but two failed marriages later he realizes he was repeating the attitudes of dad. My sister left at 18, 3000 miles away came home sporadically. She constantly admired Dad from there, distance makes you forget. I was the only child who stuck in the same city to watch over my mother. When my Dad died as much as we all denied it we loved him, just didn't like him much.<br>  Good Luck and don't give up yet.<br>  Both my brother and I went through counselling. <br>  We buried it for years and finally it rears it's ugly head and haunts you.<br>  I spent three years being counselled by my Church Minister.<br>  My brother had money and went to a private counsellor. Hence It became a passion of mine to help others in the same way...So I for years I counselled others, until I retired.<br>  A trusted friend is fine or counsellor. Lastly talk to Dad and tell him that it really hurts you the way he hurts your Mom. That they aren't together and move on and be happy with your new life but please don't treat us badly. I'm glad you are happy Dad, but I need to be happy too and like you & respect you and that is a gift earned, ad not a given just because you are Dad.|`|djUMvICoaa	My lessons on this were love the person but you can hate the things they do.  If you can seperate them out it makes more sense on what has been going on inside you for years, feeling love for him and yet being bitter.  Sometimes it's hard to fess these things up to our parents, the communication road just isn't there and they might just tune you out.  Another lesson on how to forgive them.  Take  a time when you're going to be alone for a while and it's quiet, take pen and paper and start writing your dad a letter on how you felt at the time of the breakup and even other things that you would like him to hear.  Start your letter out  and end with an I love you.  But write this letter with your opposite hand, it will be hard but it somehow takes you back to those times and the feelings really come out.   I never saw anybody do this and not cry and feel better afterward.  If you do it and it works I'd like to hear you thoughts about it. good luck|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You might get your best help from a professional about this.  If you don't get some kind of resolution for yourself, you can carry it into your relationships and seek to have your "father" needs met by them (and I don't think it is possible).<br>  <br>  I find that going to God with my "father needs" helps me, and my parents didn't divorce, but no family is perfect.  I try to help my son learn how to go to God to have his "father needs" met.  I recommend that you try this, especially if you turn down my suggestion to get professional help.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I don't suggest you go to your dad, but you can try. Just be prepared for him to have no idea what you are talking about.  He appears fine now and will possibly resent your intrusion with this.  I'm sorry, btw, and for what it's worth, I'm dating a man who had to end all ties with his father over this in order to get on with his life.  But, I'm not satisfied he has really gotten closure and it does affect us.<br>  <br>  Again:  So far as a friend "recognizing the bitterness" and helping with it, I think this may be an unreasonable expectation from a friend.  I think our friends want to just like us the way we are, not "shrink" us.  Sure, friends want to be there for us to lean on, but not carry the weight of our life's misery.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Why wait for someone to discover the bitterness in you?  Talk about it with your dad.  That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if he denies any wrong doing.  He may suggest that he had to be happy, etc., and not take responsibility for how he treated you all.
r3O9XCSBaa	I know how you feel about bitterness and resentment. Maybe you should try to be different then your father. Do the opposite of what he did with his family. Be there for your family, try to have a close relationship with them and want to be there for them. I can't tell you have glad I am to know that my father and I had a good relationship and there was nothing bad between us before he died. Don't take your family for granted. You never know how long you will have them in your life. I was only 20 when I lost my father. And my grandmother had and stroke 4 years ago and now she is a vegetable.

There is nothing wrong with him (except that he should forget about the girl buddy) You have different expectations as far as sex but there is no "dirty" sex between married people and NO one person in the marriage controls the sex. Not you and not him. Only a mismatch in libido and sexual tastes. No man likes making love all of the time and I am sure no woman likes doing the "F" word instead of making love. The key to keep both of you happy is to have a middle ground.<br>  <br>  Example: <br>  <br>  Your Compromises: No girl buddy. No blinds open. You want to be made love to in addition to being devoured.<br>  <br>  His Compromises: He agrees to take you out more often so that you two can connect and spend time bonding which I am sure he is not doing. He also agrees to take you to the shopping/spa every other month and get couples facials or pedicures or something.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	sounds to me like your husband is either a sex addict or getting it from someone else (and is consciously trying to turn you into her).  any man that forces his wife to compromise her principles and comfort level simply to up the ante in the bedroom is not someone that you should want to keep around.<br>  <br>  i think that the next time that your husband wants to recreate a porno movie (and he needs to differentiate between porn and reality.  most wives won't do half of the stuff that he sees in them) tell him that you are tired of this and you want counseling.  if he doesn't consent to go with you, wait a month and ask again.  if he still doesn't want to go, start considering divorce lawyers.  <br>  <br>  not all men are this way.  your husband is acting like a jerk and like transformers, there's more here than meets the eye.|`|AA10151168	I guess he is watching a lot of porn.geeze..no not all men are like that..he probably has some fantasies..<br>  <br>  gosh what is this <br>  <br>  "he tells me that he wants to sleep with his girl buddy at work"<br>  <br>  probably he is trying to find some excuses for another woman<br>  <br>  sorry but not all men are like that..talk to him..|`|EJWphb88aa	i guess he is thinking tat he's being more creative... y don u both go for counselling|`|5GJnrfKQaa	Hey chick,<br>  <br>  Well lets say I've got a simliar problem, but in this case i'm the one wanting :-) So lets try and explain it.<br>  <br>  Guys are by nature visualy stimulated. So having you prounce around in a skimpy outfit just really does it because it's a visual thing. It's also not to say this should be the case everytime, it would work both ways. Having said that though, I think his craving the excitement... Kinda like when you where a kid a being naughty behind your folks and hoping they wouldn't "bust" you. That getting dressed in a flash when you hear the car pull up. There's also a bit of extra naughtiness that comes with outfits.<br>  <br>  The curtains open, well ya... Not cool. Try getting on when visitors are arriving, it creates the suspense of "Are they here" and just fufills that excitement gap.<br>  <br>  Unfortuantely I think most men (some might not say) have a craving for outfits, etc. Another point to consider is men are hunters (as with animals) and naturely tend to want to bed other woman. Dressing up fools (so to speak) the mind into thinking it's someone new, and fills that craving. But i don't think that's your case.<br>  <br>  From the boring point, I'd suggest taking control of your bedroom. Guys tend to enjoy having the woman take control (weird i know). So hang up an outfit all by yourself, he'll clearly get excited, but then tell him it's for friday, and make him wait 5 days. Besides making him go insane, it gives you a break from dressing up everyday. Don't let him rip it off in 3 minutes, let him wait... Perhaps cook a meal in it and he definitly won't call you boring anymore :-)<br>  <br>  Well i hope i've explained it as well as i could...<br>  <br>  Cheers ;-)|`|AA11231094	what started out as a fantasy for him has now become a addiction.

There is a fine line on whats healthy and not healthy and he in my opinion has crossed the line. He needs help. Dont continue allowing him to use your body for his crap. If you hate it dont do it. He needs more help then i can give him thats for sure. But always be true to yourself. we as woman tend to want to make all there wishes come true.. but when it reaches a point of a sickness.. well... there is a huge problem, and the other woman thing.. tell him to **** himself. #sums r ok i guess if its something yall both want. but damn he is really going off the deep end and very selfish might i add.|`|MYU46ap5aa	It's nice to explore your sexual side.

You should never do anything sexually that you don't want to do it's messes with your mind.<br>  <br>  If your husband is fantasizing about another woman then let him be with her.

He asks you for certain thing ask him to do the same tell him I want you to lick me downthere , I want you to do this and that , I am always wondering about some men when they want to initiate sex with their women they dont think that we need to be turned on, they just want to do it with out doing any efforts , think about  it can you drive your car without heating it ? can you operate any device without reading the manual and learn about it , every thing comes with a manual and same for women we need to be heated and prepared before we do sex or making love.  I tell you what if he stay doing this without pleasing you and doing What you want , just find another romantic guy , someone who appreciate and knows how to treat a woman and sensitive , your husband is treating you as a material and he is never satisfied by telling you that you bored him in the bed room.

Remember that you don't "have" to do any of it if your uncomfortable with it.  <br>  <br>  He isn't going to change because of how you feel about it, and he certainly isn't going to stop doing it if you go along with it.  If he cares about you and the marriage, he should be willing to compromise.  Decide what you are willing to do, what you want, and come up with an agreement between you that you both can live with.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	If you feel degraded and that's the only way he can have sex. I would say he might be having erectile issues as he is a maturer age and not a young one. I also say if he constantly is putting you down and the only time he appreciates you is when he can make you feel less that loved he might be seeking an outside relationship, or maybe having one.<br>  You deserve true love respect and if it's really hurting you suggest counselling, if he flips out, then I think he does not value th relationship. Put your foot down and say I want you to go with me, if he won't. Shock him and separate and if it doesn''t affect him that bad then you know he's out, and move on love.
iPNOVR6Gaa	-He says he has a low sex drive, but he watches porn every chance he gets for hours. Does he know that he is depriving us of intimacy and doing real harm to a good relationship?<br>  <br>  A: He probably does not know that.  If his addiction is long-term, as you say, he may not even know what a normal sexual relationship is supposed to look like.<br>  <br>  -Is there anything I can do to make him want to participate in sex and not be solo/voyeur?<br>  <br>  A: Invite him.  But first, do a little investigation.  In particular, find out what times of day he prefers to look at porn.  It will be best for you to choose a time to invite him to have sex that lies before he would normally start looking at porn.  When you have sex, take your time, and make him take his time.  Porn is all about instant erections and immediate gratification, so don't even try to compete with that.  Undress him slowly, for example, and take your time getting to the main event.  Porn is also all about visual stimulation, so again, don't even try to compete with that.  Instead, pay extra attention to engaging his sense of touch, both by touching him all over and by asking him to touch you in the same way.  And don't touch using only hands; use also lips and tongue, and rub your bodies together.<br>  <br>  - Why does he collect and download pictures instead of just looking and moving on?<br>  <br>  A: Some pictures are more stimulating than others.  If I look at 10 porn pictures, most will be pretty good, but maybe only 1 will be truly outstanding.  So, sometimes the thought crosses my mind how great it would be to create for myself a "library" of my personal favorites.  That way, I could avoid slogging through stuff that's only pretty good and instead go straight into looking at 100% pictures that really turn me on, one fantastic picture after the next, because I'm the one who chose them.  I have never actually constructed such a library, but it sounds like your boyfriend has.<br>  <br>  - Is it possible at all for me to help him curb this so he becomes a moderate user and uses it as a stimulant for short periods (like a toy, magazine etc) or is there nothing I can do.<br>  <br>  A: I think you need to stop thinking of it like a stimulant.  If I were to toe the Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) line, I would be telling you that anything short of complete porn abstinence would be wrong.  Instead, I think what you should do is carve out a schedule with him.  How many days a week do you want to have sex with him?  Choose the days, and set it out in advance that he shouldn't look at porn at all on those days, unless he wants to look at it after he's had sex with you.  On the other days, put porn completely out of your mind and "let" him look at it as much as he wants.  I think the most reasonable goal you could have here would be to insure that YOU are sexually fulfilled.  I think an unreasonable goal would be for your to cure him.  If and when he decides to get help for his addiction, then and only then will he find a cure for himself.|`|bO2rzfISaa	<a href="http://pornaddicthubby.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pornaddicthubby.com/</a>|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	I'm sure he knows what he is doing is wrong but it's an addiction like anything else.  You need to sit down with him and try to figure out a solution.  Tell him it is affecting your relationship and he needs to tone it down or he will lose you.  If he is willing to stop and can't ask him if you can put a password on his computer that only you know restricting him from those sites.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	addictions can be very hard to break. I suggest watching it with him so that he sees it is ok to watch, then maybe him knowing it is acceptable will make him not want to do it anymore. Some people watch it just for the thrill of knowing it is taboo.|`|djUMvICoaa	Addictions are in the mind and can have varying degrees of dependency.  He may have a low sex drive but he is making it worse to be with a woman because in his mind he has all the violence that goes into some of those films ingrained in him as his stimulants, regular sex doesn't do it for him anymore.   The only thing to get him past it is to get him removed from porn and his hand for a few months.   He feels that there is something extra stimulating about what is in that picture, something he feels he can't get anyplace else.   I don't think there is much you can do unless he wants to give it up completely.  You don't offer a drunk just one beer, it never works.  Same way here, you don't cut down you cut out.  If he's finding it more stimulating than what he can get in bed with you I don't know how you can stand a chance.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	well he downloads and saves for the same reason that a magazine exists. we usually don't buy them and get rid of them, we collect them, all girls are different and he might have liked some of them(looks). he probably has a low sex drive because you are probably not doing it for him. porn is a way for guys to use their imagination and fantasy, maybe you should try telling him that you want to watch it with him and maybe he would get into it with you and slowly walk away from it. it happened to me. maybe you should get adventurous with him with toys and sexy outfits. you should talk to him about how it makes you feel when he watches porn all the time instead of touching or pleasing you. <br>  you should be grateful though that he is watching porn instead of cheating by going out to get girls and having sex with them.

Avoiding you etc.<br>  <br>  If when you find out she makes it crystal clear you two are over and no chance of getting back together, try getting a hobby, doing something you like to get your mind off her.

SCg3kDz2aa	Do not make such a big problem from this situation, and mainly stop torturing each other. Tell your wife that you WANT her to start a relationship with that guy. Tell her she should stop hesitating about it, she should DO it. Believe me, this will fix all the problems. Or she will be disappointed with the relationship and return to you, or will leave your  house and step forward in her life. That life what you live together now is just worthless. "interest", no sex, mentioning, questioning, endless disscusions, etc. are just a fool way of the life. For a while be friends, but be really that, ask her to initiate something, then tell you the details, and the real life will arrange everything.|`|6E81yM9Eaa	Sometimes in life its hard to accept certain decision that someone else makes. Icould relate to you because i went threw a divorse because of indifferences that i later found out this is not the man for me.

See someone else reached out because when she was you were death in hearing|`|tCI8ksvdaa	Get a lawyer and get a divorce.

Do you really think she is going to be trying in this marriage? Take this as a new beginning. Get joint custody of your child and move on.

This kind of situation is just how many marraiges are today. It unfortunate that even after she has had an emotional affair, and you still want to stay with her becasue of the love, she is moving you along. As a man, you need to be firm with your wife and let her know what your heart feels. I believe her mind is made up, and do you really think she will tell you they have had sex. The only thing is your 21 month baby that keeps you together. She has found someone else and wants to give it a try when you are seperated. if it works out with him, she will be gone, if thier relationship does not work she will be back. But one thing i promise is that from today she will always do this when she feels she is never happy.|`|AF3uDop3aa	I believe sitting down and talking to one another would greatly help. You should ask each other direct questions such as "Why does she prefer the other guy over you" or "Is it something with you that's driving her away from you." These questions would definitely demonstrate her interest in you, if there are any left. <br>  From what you are saying, it sounds that she is a bit shy talking about her "fantasies." Once again, talking and asking to put all out on a table would help a lot.<br>  I understand that no person would ever want his happy family to break up, but there are incidents in life that change us to the better or worse. After all, if she has this interest in another man, perhaps she does not deserve you, and perhaps you would be happier down the line alone or with someone else than with her knowing she is cheating on you. However your situation turns out, you should not kill yourself over it, but look at positively as it will turn out to be a better thing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	I don't think it SHOULD be banned, sorry.  I think couples should ultimately work on their marriage to the best of their abilities, but MAKING someone stay in a marriage that isn't working for whatever reason is just not right.  Not to mention the physical dangers involved in some cases...|`|ECe1rgsdaa	It shouldn't. I do think most people should try harder to keep their marriage, but sometimes, it's necessary. Do you really think someone should stay with an abusive spouse forever? Do they not deserve happiness?|`|lqtA2qhAaa	I dont believe in divoricing because your husbands not paying you attention one day, or you had a disagreement.

Your causing more pain to your children and family by staying.|`|xGshAiXOaa	No.  They can't ban divorce until they ban marriage.  Divorce is not a sin, it is a choice just as marriage is a choice.

Before divorce laws became no fault, women were in abusive marriages and couldnt get out.  Women were sex slaves and subject to alot of cruelty.  <br>  <br>  If I had to give a reason, I would say you would find it in the religions who teach/preach no divorce.   Thats the only place I can think of.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	If people want a divorce due to domestic violence..adultery..they have the right to have one..
wia9SXCPaa	Wow your are in a tough spot.  If you leave him you are afraid he will commit suicide and if you stay you will be miserable.  If you have exhausted every avenue to help him what else can you possibly do to be happy.  As far as having a baby you need concentrate on yourself and a happy marriage.  You need a foundation to bring a happy baby into this world.<br>  <br>  I don't think I could have been as patient as you sound.  You may have no choice left but to leave him.  You do deserve to be happy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|i0WQzVDZaa	Well I'm not going to suggest you leave if he's not verbally or physically hurting you then what you need to do if you can is sit down and tell him how you feel. You entered into marriage for better or worse and now your at the worse part and as his life partner you took a promise to whoever is your god to be there. Its sounds like he's having just as much of a hard life as you are. Sit down talk about what your problems I suggest to you if you can take a trip get out of your everyday life and leave his and yours family out of it. You didn't marry them your married him. You both married each other for a reason you need to find your way back to that point and when you get there never go back to the past leave it behind you. As a guy I hate to say this but women rather they be a wife or girl friend always has the harder job in the relation ship because face it guys are stupid most of the time. If you can't get anywhere or the issue your in is dangerous then do what you think is right. Take care of yourself.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	"through sickness and in health, till death do us part" Your husbands is sick, he has a disease called depression. Depression can cause mood swings, slee disorders, and make it hard to do anything. You want t oleave your husband while he is at his lowest. That is ridiculous. marriage is a life long commitment even when your not gettign what you want. Instead of worrying about what everyone else thinks and about yourself, you need to worry about him. Help him get better. Try taking the love dare, it is a great book and i think it could really help you. There is a movie that goes with it as well called fireproof.|`|4t4U9eFOaa	It sounds like you know what you want to do, just like most women we need some reassurance.  In your position,,would probably leave.  Depression is dificult to deal with in men.  Maybe talk to his therapist about you breaking it off to keep her alert to what is going on but ultimately it is his decision to live or die.  If you are not in love and don't have the same goals for the future or expectations then things won't go well and you will end up just as depressed as he is.|`|Z6auiyZkaa	I think if you stay its like three ppl died and I dont see the point in that really at all.

If he isn't willing to try that...Walk away life is short and everyone deserved to be respected and loved and cared for.<br>  Good Luck|`|a39b12ad0bc6c31fa2bd81f656b6f248aa	First of all you have my sympathy. You also deserve happiness because what your husband is going through is not your fault. You can either have him see a therapist so he can work through it or separate for a little while and then decide what to do when you are on your own. The bottum line is that you yourself cannot save him. The LORD helps those who help themselves. Go to church with him. God Bless You.|`|Cpwedckvaa	Judge the man for the man and not his family first of all...Only you can decide what you can take and for how long.

Maybe spend more time getting to know each other before even thinking about a baby.  Depression is tough, but you you need to be happy. <br>  <br>  I'm not religious, but I try to live life by this model: treat others as you'd want to be treated yourself.  This usually answers your question(s).  <br>  <br>  Basically, if you were in the same situation, would you expect your husband to leave you?  If so, then fly away, if not, then get him help!|`|hCJ66msnaa	leave now your right you do deserve to be happy and you are not responsible for his problems while i understand the suicide of a loved one is hard and i know this from experience, its not his fault that his brother did it and he needs to move on with his life because he is still alive. i know this from personal experience. my first husband committed suicide and left me with two young children under the age of two. i wander alot is this my fault could i have done anything or said anything different that would have prevented him from doing it. i realized probably not some one committed to doing it will probably eventually do it anyway. my husband didnt leave a note there didnt appear to be anything wrong prior to him doing it. i kept telling myself i was his wife i should have known something was wrong even if he didnt tell me but i had to realize it wasnt my fault and all the what if's in the world didnt change anything obviously he had problems deep down i wasnt aware of and i have to move on with my life. in my case i had children that needed me. you cant blame yourself for something someone else does. and you shouldnt stay just cuz your afraid he wont be able to handle things if you leave cuz by the sounds of it he is not handling things very well with you there and he is just bringing you down. move on with your life and anything he does or doesnt do after you leave will be on him not you. he is a grown man and him and him alone is responsible for his own actions. you deserve to be happy and be treated with respect and obviously being with him your not getting it move on now before he does do something stupid to himself or possible even you too

People get hurt by nasty words, especially by those people who they think are their friends. <br>  <br>  You all sound the same. I don't know if you can salvage all this, it depends on how forgiving Kelly and Sarah are. Once Sarah finds out what you've said about her she's going to be extremely upset and you have lost her trust. <br>  <br>  You cannot ***** about someone to someone else when you have been talking about them too! It's dangerous ground. <br>  <br>  In future, if you have opinions, either keep them to yourself or be honest with that person. <br>  <br>  I hope it works out for you, but it seems a lot has been said and much apologising is needed on all parties.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	I don't mean to be rude but grow up a little, stop b!tching about people and ignore what others say about you, if you don't like what people think about you why would you hang around with them|`|RzaP9bQmaa	How I miss school, <br>  <br>  Leave it now the damage has been done, the more you try to work things out the more problems will arise.

LA1ltWwBaa	I have never been in your position before but I would definitely bring the photo. It couldn't hurt your case any.Do you have any other evidence to bring with you to back up your claim ie: police reports,emails,pictures??? Do you have someone representing you? If you do then maybe ask them. If not then call around to different attorneys in your area and see what they say. I would hope that the courts would look at the picture and realize that there are children involved and do the very best thing which is to keep him away. Good luck.|`|AA11510145	No it would not be petty and even if it is a bee bee gun it does go to show his state of mind. the other thing is that if he has posted it online then he has no right to privacy in reguards to it.

Start your defence, and make sure you have all police report files if there are any.<br>  <br>  Only way to be safe is take security into your own hands. Learn self defence, do not allow yourself to be in alone situations with him. Have a girlfriend or relative always be around.<br>  If he threatens you in anyway call the police. Do it over and over. Do not let him breach the peace bond. Get women's counselling for abused women.

Many non-violent people own BB guns.  Hell, my 8 year old has one (we obviously keep it out of his reach) that we all take outside and shoot at boxes and targets!<br>  <br>  I think taking that to court and trying to imply that it is a deadly weapon would be wrong of you.  Just tell the truth, explain what he has done to you and how he has hurt you, and allow the Judge to make their own educated decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD ON:  In 2 lines you contradict yourself.  In your first additional details line, you say "I'm trying to trick the court."  Then, in your 2nd you say "I'm not trying to trick the court."<br>  <br>  Honestly, just go in there and tell the truth.  No need to try to imply he owns a real handgun when it's only a BB gun.  Thumbs down me all you want.  I know he abused you, but right is right, and 2 wrongs don't make a right.

You are limiting yourself to one set of men, when there are so much more out there.|`|idUQiMkwaa	Depends if they have aids or not|`|MW1yrHbOaa	not all mixed or black girls or people for that matter act "ghetto" or "gangsta" maybe they just don't like you. How come the terms "ghetto" and "gangsta" always comes down to black people?|`|AA11946005	My brother is white and is married to a mixed woman and they have two young children.  It's more common to see white women with black men- at least where I live in So Fla, but it could be the reverse in other places.  My brother and his wife live on LI.  I think it depends on the guys family- what their beliefs are, and if family values might make them reluctant to have a relationship with someone of another (or mixed) race.|`|67ThRN4Taa	I don't think that "scared" is the right word.  Human nature is that we want to live with, work with, marry and have our children with people who are just like we are:  racially; ethnically; culturally; linguistically; religiously; politically; socioeconomically.  We're all hard-wired to be that way.<br>  <br>  I'm white and a professing christian but I've always had a thing for latin and jewish women; I can't explain it.  My fiancee is an american of portuguese ancestry.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  "I'm the girl," is there *any* society in the world that isn't racist?  Is there *any* african nation that would welcome a large number of white, latin or asian immigrants?  Would Japan welcome one-million white & black people?  Would Saudi Arabia welcome one-million jews & christians? <br>  <br>  I think that you get my point.  America is no more or less racist than any other society.  I'm white, "human," and I freely admit that I wish that certain "groups" weren't here, to include all the red-neck "white trash."  But they're here, they aren't leaving and I managed to live in peace with them (in part by avoiding them as much as possible, but being polite & civil when I do encounter them).|`|vyurA7heaa	it varies from different white men. some people like to marry a female the same race of them maybe because they feel more comfortable. You are not wasting your time because there are plenty white man who are different and like to try different things. dont give up. My sister is black and she has a colombian boyfriend and had a baby with him. anything is possible because my cousin is married to a french woman and he's black. there are many different men out there who is willing to try something new or fit in their category|`|8uvLG8Lbaa	well of course. stereotyping is immature and you don't want a guy like that right.. im sure there some "white guys" that would love to date you..|`|29WFvvNPaa	NO.

DXzOChcEaa	I am a 50 year old female. My husband also just turned 50. I am trim and in shape. I work out to keep fit, walk etc... I have an active job that requires lots of movement on my part and so that has helped to keep me fit.  My husband is very over weight, drinks a lot and has a huge beer belly. He also smokes daily and so has developed a smokers cough every few minutes. He is starting to have ED when we make love. In case you don't know what that is, his boy toy is starting to break down.   We have been married 30 years now and I do love my husband much but... lately I have started looking very hard at other guys. Younger guys and guys that are my age but in shape. There is a younger guy at my job who complements me whenever he sees me and it just brings immense feelings awake in me whenever I talk or think of him. I have started to think of him at night when I lay down to sleep. I know its stupid and dumb and like I said I do love my husband but he has just let himself go so completely. I try to talk to him about losing weight, about drinking less and smoking less but it make no difference. Whats a woman to do?|`|BUET39wmaa	frustrated?<br>  i don't think you can answer this because not all people just become frustrated???|`|9rLi9pSRaa	Right after the honeymoon would be my guess.  Good times don't always last.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I can only answer for those in their late 50's, but I find sex still very fulfilling, the only frustrations I find is not having enough time with my wife.  She is full time student and also full time employed so our schedules do not coincide often enough for me.  She is 37 and still very sexual, and her complaint would be the same as mine, just not enough time.|`|fGE7hL12aa	About the time your kids become teenagers and you can't just send them to bed so the two of you can get it on.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	36!|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	i started mine around 36 and still going strong frustration that is|`|ZQE61wUZaa	sexually frustrated? well I am 40 and I would say the last 5 years I am not frustrated just really into it. Women peak at this age anyway, frustrated I would say back in my 20's,  When I did it I liked it but I wasn't fully satisfied.  Guys came too quick, very inexperienced and certainly didn't appreciate foreplay.  <br>  Guys on the other hand I would say are more frustrated older, they are better with age I think, but they themselves are frustrated.  They want to be that young wild guy again, that can come over and over, but with age that kind of goes away, I guess thats what I've been told anyway.  Don't worry guys your much better in your 40's than you've ever been.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Funny you should mention age 37. I divorced my second wife when I was that age because she had become celibate. She was 38. I remarried a woman 3 years older when I was 41. She had the sex drive of a 25 year old. We were married 7 years and she decided she needed a girlfriend. Remarried at 52 to a 48 year old. Our sex life has been okay but slowing down as time passes. I'm now 58 and could have sex almost daily if she was willing. Sadly she isn't. We do have sex 2 to 3 times a week but she usually only goes through the motions. She says the drive just isn't there.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	my wife puts out every time i feel like it, and i do the same for my wife.  <br>  what really is a big deal?  if you spouse needs you to scratch their backs,  do you say "not tonight dear, i have a headache?"  <br>  <br>  lol.|`|7113da11ac2041f96cfd274833a1e7f5aa	It has to go both ways and that is hard men adn women are so different.

y4SUDnpaaa	I imagine you and the sister engaged in more than oral sex, which is bad enough on it's own for a married man cheating with his sister-in-law. When she  talked to her sister she probably got the whole story. If she's acting strange she's probably just trying to figure out what to do and how. It would be perfectly normal if she's started divorcee proceedings and  is waiting for you to be served with the papers as a big surprise. She could also be considering if she can forgive you. Who knows what she's thinking but it isn't how she can make your life better. You've basically involved  her entire family ....... if they don't know about what happened between you and her sister they'll find out at some point. When you screw up (pun intended) you really do it good.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i once knew a person this happened to, and in the end she forgave her sister, and divorced her husband. if your wife is acting strange, just how did you expect her to act. u betrayed her, and when it happens with a relative its much worse.i think u set yourself up and u can't blame anyone buy yourself.|`|29WFvvNPaa	Wow.  Yeah, I think your in for a bad streak of luck with both women.  You shouldn't have cheated on your wife because that gives her full permission to have a different man.  So if shes not upset, maybe its because she was tired of you too and wanted to try someone else.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Keeping the family jewels all in one family eh?|`|hoBREUGLaa	LEEEEROOOOY JENKIIIIINS.|`|a984cQjKaa	oh yeah, she's going to leave your *** and take you for half of everything you own.|`|JlbxqSM6aa	I guess she just doesn't care|`|Midbg5BJaa	she's probably screwing your brother...|`|djUMvICoaa	Anyone who says they forgive you, especially for something like that, and then starts acting strangely is certainly up to something.  Haven't you wondered what exactly was said between the two sisters?  Are they on the outs with each other?  If not I think you are seeing the edge of the coming storm, you just don't know when it's going to hit.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	I would not care about this question. If you do not provoke them by this old story then they will forget it and all things will go on the normal way. Maybe that was the mistake that you told your wife this action, and the two women are solid with each other. I think they are just right. Finally they are sisters.|`|Vm9JQ6zSaa	That is pretty weird that shez not upset. If I found that out I would be really pissed. It sounds like her sister is putting the blame all on you, but she is just as guilty as you are. Sisters dont mess with eachothers men. Thatz wrong. I would try to talk to your wife and see watz up.|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	You already set yourself up you dumbass! <br>  <br>  Were you with your wife when you let her sister do this to you?

Her being lethargic about it might mean she's already started signing out of your relationship!|`|yWUQUjx9aa	Of course your wife is upset that you made throat babies with her sister.<br>  Confront your wife and try to get a straight answer out of her.

To mess around with the sister is pretty low, because you are willing to risk ripping a family apart for a b/j, that is a testimony to your character, whether you like it or not.  How would you feel if your wife fooled around with your brother or best friend, how would she look in your eyes?|`|7eeeda9da85f22097325c1be6cef044baa	Wow!

But the bond between sisters is really unbreakable sometimes.  I do smell a set-up.  Perhaps the wife is being extra caricular?  And if you found out that to be true, you can say nothing (in their minds).  After all, you are guilty of the same thing.  Consider their thinking "what's good for the goose, is good for the gander"  "do unto others", etc,etc.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	lol yea you probly are getting set up...that seems way to strange..my guess your wife doesnt want to be with you anymore and is trying to set you up so you screw up and she can divorce you and take your money..|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Maybe, or maybe your wife has been cheating on you too.  Either way, you guys need to get counseling or a divorce and move on.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Your wife has probably had something going on with someone else, which is why she didn't throw you out.

I also work evenings and I'm self employed and work out at the gym three times a week.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't get the feeling that my wife does nothing around the house, she does a lot of things as well we both do our hobbies and have friends over several times a month.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I take out the trash, along with cooking dinner four nights a week, I do all the household laundry on weekends, I clean the bathrooms and clean the house during the week.  I take care of the yard and all the vehicles, service and cleaning.  I work full time, we have seven children, (oldest two have moved), so do I do more than my share, yes.  But, my wife also works full time and goes to college full time.  So before you think I'm a good guy, I'm only doing this as an investment in my future retirement.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Not much.<br>  Does dishes half the time, trash, vacuums sometimes, we share cooking jobs<br>  Hes done more cleaning before but he doesnt do a very good job. <br>  <br>  I do majority  of the house work, but he works more often, for longer hours and has a shitty job which pays more.|`|UgcPxd4maa	trash, and dishes, if I've cooked that night. <br>  I usually do all the rest of the cleaning...|`|xQJjTuEWaa	We both work full time but he also has an extra part time job to help with bills so I do most of work around house.  He usually just takes trash out and helps with laundry and cooking if I not home and helps with dishes every once in a while.  I don't usually complain though cuz he Works more than me.  If I didn't work at all I would do it all though cuz I believe they should come home to a clean home if you are lucky enough to not have to work.|`|krQiDGCHaa	You need some background here first.  I work 60 hours a week, but I work from home so it is easy for me to get some housework done then.  He works 50 hours a week, and away from home, so he can really only help out a little on the weekends.<br>  <br>  During the week I:<br>  Do ALL the sweeping/vaccuuming/floor washing<br>  Do ALL the dusting<br>  Do the dishes<br>  Do the laundry<br>  <br>  During the week he:<br>  Takes out the trash<br>  <br>  On the weekend: Any household chores that may need to be done are divided evenly.  Typically, I get almost everything done during the week so on the weekend he only has to run mauybe 1 load of dishes or laundry, or pick up a little bit.|`|v0596BTeaa	My partner looks after the garden and my car (pumps tyres, fills washer bottle etc.), we shop together, and he occasionally cooks.  He sometime takes the rubbish to the bin, but doesn't do a lot really, mainly because he leaves for work an hour before me and arrives home three hours after me, so I guess it is fair.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	well lets see he leaves for work about 6 am comes home about 5 pm showers eats dinner watches tv and is usually asleep my 7:30 in the winter months come spring he is like a bear who has been hibernating and woke up then he works comes home showers eat swims in pool, coaches daughters softball team fixes things around the house.. does dishes and helps more with kids... <br>  <br>  he is my winter bear and my spring go getter has always been like this..|`|dbXnW5emaa	I'm retired and I do it all.

I also vacuumed and cooked on occasion.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I clean, do laundry, clean the cat litter, vacuum, do dishes.  Just about anything that needs to be done I do it.

Ai1uZU3Jaa	i think rosy cheeks because it appears like u have a "healthy glow". i sort of compare paleness to anaemia. i mean, its a subconscious reproductive preference thing, so if u ask a guy, he probably wont know what to tell u.<br>  <br>  plus it might also depend on the racial preference, because many asian people are pale anyway, so they dont have much choice lol.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Pale. Rosy cheeks smacks of the illustrations in story books.|`|cCGrBnuVaa	I like girls with browny skin and straight hair (black, of course)|`|IS4ND9Sjaa	i think a guy should like you no matter what you look like. i know we all have our perefence but if he really likes you he will take you just as you are.|`|EjfJaNn7aa	i think it depends on what the person looks like. pale skin looks awkward on some people as does rosey cheeks.|`|DVRSCYU1aa	THEY PREFER--MONEY ,OUTING -NO EMOTIONS,TIMEPASS,|`|4UaHYaDcaa	It really depends on the guy, but I like a pale complexion.|`|ei0e7RwOaa	Girls with a pale complexion look to Gothic, something out of a horror show.<br>  Girls with a little color "Rosy Cheeks" look like they're alive.|`|AA10655386	rosy cheeks...<br>  i dont think a lot of people likes pale complexion<br>  <br>  rosy cheeks are just livelier, better looking and cheerful|`|I5gjOrEzaa	beautiful girls are always preferred... may it be pale  complexion or rosy cheeks|`|TZ1Z2nhhaa	Me yes do you have them?|`|z2TjjnxVaa	depends on the guy.
AA11455733	If you live close to them take Nicole out for a special play date or movie and while out try to explain to her what is going on and why. She may not understand fully what is wrong and why? Let her know she can call you anytime she needs someone to talk to even if all she does in complain and whine about her sister.<br>  It is hard on the well child when her needs are not met but acting out is not the way and this needs to be nipped in the bud now before it gets worse.<br>  After you talk with her let her parents know what is going on and see if you can help maybe stay with Jade while they take Nicole out for some special time of her own. <br>   I spend one on one time with each of my three girls so they can have a little more Mom time and talk in private if they want. It is up to them what we do or where we go (within reason) it is great for all of us. We all have a hooky day where they stay home from school and I stay home from work and we lay in bed and watch movies all day. This is done once every school year, when nothing is pending for any of us.|`|mF3PsJUVaa	It's hard having a relative with any illness, but your aunt and uncle shouldn't treat Jade any different and should still pay just as much attention to nichole. Maybe you can take Nichole out for a girls day and take her somewhere age appreciate for her. I know it's not your job to take her places but you said you want to help so try making her feel special. she shouldn't be left out bc her sister is sick.|`|48huGW59aa	In your way try to explain to nicole that what she is doing is wrong and tell her why.  To Jade all you can do is pray and give sympathy towards her and her family.  Good luck!
SbdWqDCGaa	That's not a good reason not to have a girlfriend.  It's a good reason why the chick won't be hot, but you can still date some fat or ugly broad|`|vzEUP1fdaa	these ppl are shallow... but after the additional I'm thinking maybe you are too. also crying like a 5 year old... you sure you're 21? <br>  <br>  maybe your personality is why you don't have a girlfriend..! Girls only like confident guys to begin with. nobody wants somebody that falls apart and they have to continually pick up the pieces. Also you'll never get a good girlfriend.. or even one at all, if you keep thinking you're too good for them. why are you better than somebody else. It's weird, I never thought there could be somebody who lacked confidence but was somehow shallow as well. good luck man.|`|AA10655386	no it is not a good reason to have a girlfriend<br>  though pretty girls can be shallow and superficial, theres also other kinds of girls out there. find a girl who's interested in your personality.<br>  <br>  and oh..<br>  see a derma|`|gdRhkxmqaa	is this a reason|`|htWw0OlCaa	That's not a good enough reason to not have a girlfriend.... Really, you need to come up with something better than that. Now, if you said you were a total jerk and you use women, then yes, I would say that you don't a girlfriend. Believe me, women overlook that kind of stuff.  We are attracted to personality and sense of humor. You are letting that get in the way of all this. Im telling you, if I were to see you today, and you hadn't mentioned your scares, I would not have even noticed them. Wouldn't care..... Its your personality and sense of humor Im after...LOL... Seriously.|`|zka26204aa	Go to a dermatologist.  There are chemical peels and other things that can reduce the appearance of scars on the face, and prevent new ones.<br>  <br>  Your looks are not the only thing you have to offer a relationship.
eTO0ZIGvaa	It is very depressing, isn't it, when someone (especially someone you're fond of) calls you ugly? But you know what, take it as a challenge, not as a criticism. Looks is not the only thing that is attractive to girls. We also like confidence and sense of decent and intelligent humor. So build yourself on that. Treat her like a shallow lesson learned. One day, you're gonna get yourself the hottest chick in town.|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	When are you going to stop chatting with sluts|`|VNgrURnCaa	She's a *****, don't worry. There are more girls in the world than that.|`|fkbRC8eEaa	Who cares what she said<br>  if shes says that about you then she doesn't deserve you.<br>  There's plenty of fish out in the sea my friend and i bet most of them that you will meet will be way more better than her.<br>  Anyways, looks don't matter.. It's your personality and by reading what you just wrote your a pretty awesome guy!|`|gNaGdJzzaa	well the girl you fell inlove with is really mean.she should have just sayd that your not so ahndsome for her instead of sayign shell puke and everything..so i think you should just forget her and find somebody who actually cares about your personality and is not all about the looks..looks arent everything but to her they may be...|`|TvXZToFaaa	It may indeed be that looks are a big deal to her.  But if she wouldn't want you as a boyfriend because you look a certain way, then you wouldn't want her as a girlfriend.  Really, think about it: would you want a girlfriend who is that shallow?  You deserve a person who will appreciate you and be attracted to you for who you are.<br>  <br>  It sounds like she still has some growing up to do.  Until then, don't waste your time or energy on her.  Continue to be her friend if you want, but keep your eyes open for someone who will like you for you.|`|Zje3PpGpaa	She's obviously very shallow and even though I don't know you, I believe that you can do a lot better. Nobody deserves to be put through that and if she can't see the good in you then that's her problem. You should move on and find someone who's worthy of what you can give her. Good Luck. :)|`|aDfNYAJgaa	Save your respect for someone who is not so shallow. Looks can be an important factor but they fade. I mean they fade quickly. And from the sounds of this girl once her looks are gone you will have nothing left. Love is blind. That is a true statement. Ignore her thoughts on your looks. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. another true statement. When you find the "one" she wont care if you look like a pile of crap|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You would not want to go out with such a shallow person. Anyway everyone has different tastes so tho she thinks you are ugly doesn't mean that others will.
USooqQlWaa	You should not be put in the middle.  That must be very hard.  I'm sure you continue to do it for your love of the children and it's sad that they have to go through this as well.<br>  <br>  I'd bet that the mom would agree to your proposal but that dad would fight it like has the rest of the situation.  You might be better off if this continues to give them an ultimatum of either finding other care or coming to an agreeable resolution that leaves you out of their divorce drama.  I know that might be hard especially if you've bonded with the children but there are lots of parents out there looking for care (at least where I live).<br>  <br>  It sounds like you've already gone above and beyond by offering them discounts and taking split payments.  This is much more than any commercial daycare would do so they need to understand that but you have to consider your own sanity and family first as well...don't compromise yourself because of their drama.|`|6cd66b36887ecbb069f11e405495a56baa	I would tell them that for the sake of your business it would be your preference to have one of them pay for their daughters daycare.  It should be their mess to sort through, certainly not yours!  Good luck!|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You need to work it out with the wife only and tell her he is just making it very difficult for you and to please help you come up with an arrangement whereby your contact with him is minimal.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Write them both a letter and tell them that you will not continue to do business this way.  Tell them that you expect one check, each week, and the check needs to include the over-time.  Tell them they can take it up with their attorneys and/or find other child-care if this is not satisfactory to them.<br>  <br>  It really is that simple.  Sorry for your headaches with their situation, it shouldn't be put on you.<br>  <br>  Mom might be nicer, but she is just as guilty here.  And my guess is dad is paying child support, which could have included daycare, if they had their divorce/parenting plan done right.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Sorry, Heather, but one thing I know about myself is that I would be terrible at running my own business, because I would not know how to handle stuff like this!|`|0myrXJKMaa	Enough is enough! You have gone out of your way, bending over backwards for this couple. You are the business owner and need to set the ground rules. If you continue to make all these exceptions for them, they will keep expecting it and it will probably get worse. I say "them" eventhough it sounds like the father is being the real pain here. Explain to them that you are sorry for their troubles but as a professional there needs to be some changes. No one else gets special rules made for them. Tell them how you need it to work and if they can not comply then they will have to take their child to another day care. Good luck with that, because I dont know of any business that would bend over backwards like you have. Good luck|`|0wdEcNk1aa	You are running a business, that business is not divorce mediation. i suggest that you write them each a letter informing them that from this point on you will present each of them with a bill for your services (the full amount for the week) and at that time they can divide the sum to be paid between themselves. If they want to debate who pays what, they can do it on their own time, not yours. This should be a printed letter, not an email. Your time is valuable it should not be consumed with their personal issues.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	It's not your problem or your responsibility to handle their finances. They are both being very immature and selfish to ask you to handle the splitting of the bill at all! I think it would be appropriate to ask them to split the month up and not the week. Such as the husband pays the 1st and 3rd week of the month and Wife pays 2nd and 4th or vise verse. It is really unacceptable that they ask you to split it up for them and that the husband nickle and dimes you. On his weeks when he does that start doing it back: charge for every Kleenex or paper towel his daughter used or for how many times you had to get the vacuum out. Maybe then he will see how ridiculous he is acting!
zsxK8O5Uaa	He most definitely likes you. I think you should confront him about it.  Good luck!|`|l973fSEqaa	he definitly likes you, the question is why does he deny it??? maybe hes not ready to date? or maybe hes afraid it will ruin your friendship?<br>  w/e the reason just be patient and everything will work out eventually (:|`|pZVEBEmLaa	He really likes you.|`|rNmekxLcaa	It sounds like you're already dating. Haha!|`|0Y89uCinaa	cute!i think he likes u!:D<br>  <br>  <br>  but is he a gay?that changes things a lot!:S|`|XZEaQ4Myaa	i think he likes u|`|b6cligwWaa	it seems like he likes you but also could just be a playa Lol there are soooo many guys like that at my school|`|FB1zwZkMaa	I think he's still in the stage wherein he wants to get to know you more, so that when he asks you out he will have nothing to worry about because you two are good friends already. Don't be frustrated it's all part of the process. ;)<br>  Good Luck!
u7Y1SAViaa	Set things straight and have a talk with him that you have a full time job and needs help with the house and kids. He can't just be a lazy old bum. It just makes things worse.|`|d4fef0f6ca92f27b2701290acce6be5daa	having raised 3 kids myself and having had to raise my grandson for his first 3 years---I will tell you right now---kids suck the life out of you and wear you out.I am 47 and my daughter now has 3 kids and I put a limit on how often I will babysit.I love them dearly,but, it is ME time now.I don't know how old your "steps" are but you have not seen anything until you deal with teenagers.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	He should absolutely be helping share half of the responsibilities with you, if not more whether they are yours are not if you work full time. That is a lot of shirking of responsibility on his part. As long as you put up with it he will be perfectly happy with that arrangement.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Run far away from him... and build your own life... don't try to save his!|`|djUMvICoaa	It's not fair for you to have to take care of his kids.  It's even more unfair to your kid that you had them at such an early age, he's going to suffer for it.  It seems that you have someone who talked the right talk to you, got you to drop your gueard and panties and now he's distancing himself from you, he doesn't want to get trapped into a marriage with you and he won't as long as you abide by what he tells you to do.|`|72MtoWxRaa	Sweety, he has a family already, he is 16 years older then you. Im sure he doesnt want any kids, Im sure he doesnt want to get married. Everything that Im sure you want. Its not fair to you that you are putting yourself in a situation where you are accepting this responsibility. Either your going to deal with it or your not. Im sure there are tons of men out there your age that would love to be with you that you can start your own family with.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Don't do it. You're not ready to take on that responsibility and it wouldn't be fair to you, the children or your husband. Don't let the kids get attached to you because it doesn't sound like you're cut out for this lifestyle. Listen to your gut!|`|874EAxkfaa	are you blind? did you not notice this guys children when you met him 2yrs ago? if he is 56you must be 40, so,i think you have grown as tall as you are going to get.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I don't think that it is fair. You need some time to yourself as well. Tell him how you feel and take it from there. It's good to vent sometimes.|`|AA10961005	you are growing up too fast, hun you need to slow down|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Ok I'm a little confused are you 16 years old or is he 16 years older than you? If your 16 what the hell are you doing living with someone with three kids. You are just a baby yourself> If he's 16 years older than you are and you want to continue the relationship you are going to have take some of the good with the bad. I'm assuming you knew he was a father from the start and that he sees his children on a regular basis so you need to accept that. If you need more help sometimes all you have to do is ask for it. If that doesn't work for you then move on!|`|w7J73sUUaa	well at 16 you are still really young  i do not know the laws where you are but here if a guy is over 18 and has sexual acts with a woman under 18 he can go to jail but that being said no it is not fair for you to be working full time and be expected to have to come home and take care of things. i do not know all the details of this case but if he is all ready doing this kind of stuff i think you might want to find you some one who is more like you because at this rate you will end up with two full time jobs house wife and work some where else it sounds like to me he wants a mother for his kids and some one to pay the bills for him that is to much to ask of some one of any age in my book i wish you luck on this one but personally i think you should find some one else that is more responsible and caring maybe with less kids do not get me wrong i love kids but i am in my 30 and am responsible for the things around me i would never ask any one to do what he seems to be asking you but to each person and situation the answer is different|`|N8EB7YkMaa	All of the advice here is good.  One thing I do not understand is why he doesn't work full time.  This situation needs to be discussed between the 2 of you and if the resolution doesn't fit your needs, you would be wise to move on.  He is responsible for the majority of the children and he should act accordingly.  He may not even realize that he is taking advantage of you, if he doesn't, he will more than likely feel terrible and begin taking on more responsibility.  As said in a previous answer, trust your gut!|`|oRUgHRG0aa	that's how it'll be if you make a family...<br>  no matter how tired you are you will<br>  always run after the rest of your family...<br>  is it fair to ur kid if you take three more??<br>  if you are still thinking about it maybe you should<br>  give it some more time!!<br>  noone can answer this for you because we don't know<br>  your need and your powers...<br>  only you do!!<br>  before you make up your mind you should make sure that<br>  ur kid is going to be ok!!<br>  that you can handle having no more time for yourself<br>  and that you are ready to take care of a family?|`|SYyDkVpoaa	guess it's not fair cause you seem upset with it.<br>  <br>  why would you get into that mess in the first place?|`|i2V17yi4aa	hun you need to be in school and not worrying about someone else kids!!! are you serious you should just be getting off playing with barbie dolls ... you kids grow up to fast and then when you get older you start to hate your life and start thinking about the mistakes you made... your only 16 this is a time for you to get you DL get your 1st car having that crush in school... gossip with girlfriends, fun/ somewhat still innocent party's instead of taking care of 3 + your own children... you just go back to school and forget about this guy...<br>  <br>  good luck to you girlie|`|f9sL3WgQaa	The only "fair" part in this is that you give all your attention to your own kid at 16 and screw all the rest.

qsLhVZd8aa	Why do you need to "gently" tell him anything?  I just tell my husband when I want him to cook and he does it!  We both work full time and sometimes I just want a break from the kitchen.  He has no problem with that.  In fact, just last night I told him it was his turn to cook tonight - no biggie.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	you need to be upfront and honest with your husband about the issues you are having with his lack of help in the kitchen...that's the only way to be...upfront and honest...don't do it disrespectfully but let him know that you need the help and then come to some kind of agreement about when he cooks and you clean or you cook and he cleans...good luck.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Why tip toe around?<br>  Why "gently"?<br>  I think it is crap that you/me/anyone has to tip toe.<br>  <br>  Just say it like it is!<br>  <br>  "You need to start cooking and helping more"|`|KNflGltwaa	Don't cook anymore.

Label each bag for one of the days of the week  Every day when you go to work call him and ask him to take the meal for the day, thaw it out and put it in the oven and ask him to make some rice and open up a can of string beans or whatever vegetable and then you, him and the children can eat a healthy dinner every night.  <br>  <br>  You have to make things easy for men.

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	People bought at a time when housing was at an all time high, basing their decisions on conventional wisdom, which is that housing always goes up or stagnates but doesn't come down.<br>  <br>  Even in the 1970's and again during Carter, when the economy took a hit and interest went through the roof, housing prices remained stable.<br>  <br>  But the bottom line that people must remember now, is that investing in anything is a risky activity and the risk falls to the investor.  Whether you like it or not, buying a home is an investment activity.<br>  <br>  It isn't just housing, btw.  The market has been killed, as well.  If you want to think about people now, don't worry about middle aged people who bought their homes to live in.  Think about the elderly who invested in the market or real estate for their retirements.  They are all still having to work and are in big trouble.<br>  <br>  For many, assuming their mortgage was Fannie Mae, the Obama plan will save them from foreclosure, because banks are required to rewrite loans.  For the rest of us (think investors or people who don't have Fannie Mae loans), we get no help at all.  I'm one of them, btw.  Never missed a payment, not in default on anything, but I'm self employed and my loan is supposed to be paid or refinanced April 1.  No one will loan me the money and it's 2/3 the value of my property, even now.<br>  <br>  My parents are in Florida in an area that started getting hit 2 years ago.  Their entire retirement is in residential real estate as rental properties.  My dad currently has renters squatting and not paying rent because the economy there is so bad.  He is borrowing money every month to stay afloat and both my parents are working at 69 and 70 with health issues.  Banks down there are holding fire sales:  Houses $180k last year for $40k now.<br>  <br>  So, what we have, thanks to the stimulus plan which is designed to do nothing to help taxpayers, but expects taxpayers to foot the bill, is that come April 15th, the government will still want a check and they don't care if I'm living in my car when I write it.|`|AA11593583	If your house is only appraised at 50% of what it was 2-3 years ago then welcome to the wild world of speculation. <br>  <br>  Appraised value and actual worth are two totally different animals. Appraised value is based on size, location, and similar homes sold recently in the surrounding area.<br>  <br>  Actual value is based on what it would really cost to build the house.<br>  <br>  The actual value of a home will come back. But because many homes price was based on supply and demand  they were very over priced.<br>  <br>  Any time you buy anything you are always speculating to a certain extent. Who goes out and buys a house and considers how much of the price is pure speculation? The smart buyer does. <br>  <br>  There are people who went out and bought stocks at Dow 12K on the rise. They thought if we don't get in now we'll miss the boat. Well guess what they already did. Even the people who bought at 12K on the decline thinking it won't go much further down were wrong. <br>  <br>  Here's the secret. Buy low-- Sell high. When is low and when is high? Your guess is as good as mine. <br>  <br>  OBTW Foreclosure is a bad option. It doesn't get you out from under being upside down. You still will owe the difference between what the house sells for and what your note says. And it wrecks your credit.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	The realtors and appraisors had nothing ot do with the economy. When the economy is going downhill and foreclosures are on teh rise and home sales are plummiting it make the value of homes go down.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Greed + a sense of entitlement + stupidity by consumers caused a good amount of problems.  The bottom line is if you bought a house (to live-in, not for an investment) for $360,000 and it now is only worth $180,000, by all rights you should be able to still make the mortgage payment on the $360,000.  The problem is American consumers said "gee, I really like that house, I deserve it but I can't get by it on a traditional fixed loan. Oh, I know..instead of buying something I can afford now I'll "gamble" and make my "home" an investment by taking out some kind of weird interest only loan that will require me to refinance in a few years."  Once you move away from the traditional "fixed" loans of paying for what you can afford over a set number of years, your house shifts to being subject to market conditions and when they go poof, well whose fault is it?<br>  <br>  I mean sure, you can blame banks, the realtors etc. but you got to step back and blame the retards who though they would gamble on their homes.  Any retard should have known that the market / housing goes through peaks and valleys and that the unprecedented growth in housing prices would eventually implode.  Ya, it was probably wrong for realtors to say "Buy now or forever be priced out of a home" but come on, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to look at your own finances and determine what you can or cannot afford. Hell, there is a reason I continued to rent for years even though I was pulling down $95,000.<br>  <br>  There is a reason that interest only loans tended to remain in the providence of the rich (until the late 1990's early 2000's).  They could afford the loss if a property devalued when it was time to refinance or sell their property (a lot of rich folks bought houses like cars..kind of a lease option for them).  Us common folk on the other hand were playing with fire and people should have had the common sense to know it.  If the market conditions become unfavorable, the value of your house drops and you have no equity in it, well either you forclose on the house / sell it (if possible) or you come up with the money.|`|xGshAiXOaa	That surely is the course that most people are choosing to take.  It's the market fluctuating with supply and demand.  Builders kept building and no one was buying so they ended up with a surplus of brand new homes.  As more and more of these homes went up for sale, they effectively lowered the asking price for all other homes around.  Say there's a neighborhood with one empty house in it.  Say they could ask $150,000 for that one house.  Then the builders come in and make it so that there are 20 empty houses for sale in that same neighborhood.  Value drops dramatically, especially if there are only 5 buyers; they could probably get those houses for $80-$90 thousand.  That is what has happened on a massive scale across this country.|`|XmFT7fHnaa	fore closure would make it worst you would still be required to pay the full amount of the mortgage and then you wont have enough to get  another property.

I would rather make payments on a house that will eventually get paid for than rent a place that will never get paid for.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Housing prices falling are not the fault of the appraisers or realtors.  It IS the fault of the banks who convinced people that they could afford a $150,000 house on a $20,000 per year salary.  As those people began to lose their homes to foreclosure, and more people lost their jobs and thus began defaulting on their mortgages, home prices began to fall.  When people are scared to buy a home because their job future is shaky or unstable, home prices fall as a way to attract buyers.  <br>  Letting it go into foreclosure is NOT the only solution, and you should never let a house be foreclosed on if you can still pay the mortgage.  It ruins your credit, and you can pretty much forget about every buying another home.  If your house is worth less than you paid for it, continue to pay your mortgage...housing prices will stabilize and begin to climb once we start pulling out of this recession.  Besides, the only reason you would have to worry about the value of your home is if you were selling it.  Then you would run into trouble with it being worth less unless you have paid down your mortgage considerably.<br>  I bought my house 2 years ago, and if I sold it now, I'd owe the bank money.  So my solution is to stay put, keep paying my mortgage and enjoy my home.|`|IPS3hWweaa	No, you can certainly continue paying your mortgage. It just really sucks that you're basically paying the same mortgage for a house that is now worth a lot less than it was when you got the mortgage.<br>  <br>  It's not the fault of the appraisers or the realtors. What happened was the banks lent out money for mortgages to people with horrible credit and now those people aren't able to pay their mortgage. Once they started to lose their homes, it started a snowball effect on the economy.<br>  <br>  And so, here we are, waiting for a bail out.
7DSuEjUOaa	Absolutely there is a way!!! If you can manage to get his phone number. Simply ask him for his number. Or maybe even if you just want to eat somewhere and catch up. You can't hide or else you have lost your chance long ago. I would say just ask him the next time you see him if he has plans the coming weekend or whenever is best for you. If you can't seem to do this then simply right your number down and hand him it with a note saying text me or call me ect. Like I said before if you hide your lost.

Think of the people who have been single all their lives. <br>  <br>  Find a hobby and stop thinking about finding some sort of dream guy. What are you, 15?|`|kWJkhm3gaa	Just chill, you'll hopefully know when you find him. In the mean time, don't let it get to you. Build strong relationships with your friends so that you'll at least have some emotional support. I don't know how old you are, but at a young age, you shouldn't even be putting these "love relationships" too high on your priority list. Worry mostly about your future, because it is most important. Also, realize that nothing's wrong with you. You can't let the fact that you haven't met your dream guy make you feel bad about yourself. I've never had a girlfriend before, like ever. Most people I tell that to...their eyes pop out and they look at me like there's something wrong with me, lol. I realize that it's just because I'm usually quiet with those I don't know, and I try not to let it get me down. I sometimes feel exactly like you do, and wish that I could just find someone already because I see others that are in relationships, while I stay single through the years. It drives me crazy sometimes, BUT things could always be worse and I have a lot to be thankful for. My point...for now, just find the things in your life that YOU have to be thankful for, and find the good in yourself. I've never had anyone, but I've done some good things on my own, for example: I used to volunteer my time to a rescue squad, I'm taking karate, plus I am now in school to become a doctor, and in all three of these that I just mentioned, I've done and am doing pretty darn well. I got to help save lives before and will now get to help people in the future. I may not be with anyone, but..I'm usually just glad that I dedicated my young life to the things I mentioned instead of girls like most guys do. Think about it, I have also done all of these things on my own, and so I know what I'm capable of. When you're single, it gives you a good chance to learn about yourself. Eventually you may find someone even better than your ideal "dream guy."|`|AA10835302	During your alone time, spend time working on you.  Take a class, volunteer, exercise, get involved in something that empowers you.  The reason you are sitting around stressing about how the last relationship didn't work and why a good one hasn't come along is because you are concentrating on it too hard.  I know we all want the fantasy or at least a decent relationship but if we place all of our happiness "eggs" in the "relationship" basket we stand a chance of living life unfulfilled and crushed.  Fill you life and time with loving and empowering you!  That way, when the perfect or at least decent guy comes along, you'll be strong enough to handle it when the "honeymoon" is over and the real relationship begins.  It isn't all a bed of roses.  Relationships are hard work.  You have to build your strength up for the times when arguments happen and disagreements can't be resolved easily.|`|ysAlWzEvaa	The funny thing about life is that when you put your all into searching for the Mr. Right, you can never find him. What you need to do is stop! Stop searching for that dream guy because at the end of the day you're going to be frustrated with yourself because you can't find the guy who has all the qualities your looking for. You need to relax you mind on finding mr. right and look for mr. right now. For now just date guys for the fun of it, as soon as you find something about them that you can't live with it, leave them. This will be like a learning experience for you at first because you must learn to Not look for the perfect guy...because to be brutally honest...he doesn't exist. For right now, just look for someone who's gonna treat you right because after all you are the most important person to you!

R7b150Iyaa	My fiance (husband in 6 weeks...yay!) and I met when were seniors in High School at a movie theater.  We went to different schools and he was staring across the room at me and my group of friends.  Long story short, we all wound up going to a movie and there weren't enough seats left so me and him had to sit on the floor in the back.  And had nothing to say to each other!  It was the most awkward 2 hours of my life!  Afterwards, my friends and I were leaving and he didn't ask for my number, so I figured I'd never see him again.<br>  Lo and behold, less than 2 weeks later I found out that his friend (who went to my school) tracked down one of my friends and got my number, which he passed on to my now fiance.  We went bowling on our first date, and 8 years later, we're getting married!|`|geJM58L2aa	We met freshman year of high school.  I had a boyfriend who was all trouble.  That day he'd given me 'his' watch to wear because I always picked at it.  I was sitting in study hall, and someone walked up to me and said "hey that's my watch."  I wasn't surprised since my boyfriend was always getting in trouble so I simply handed it over and said "okay."  A couple weeks later, the teacher rearraged the seats and we ended up sitting very close to each other.  We ended up becoming best friends and talking every single day but we never dated through high school.<br>  <br>  My first day of college at our local community college, I saw him again.  We picked up right where we left off even though we hadn't talked all summer.  We started having lunches together, scheduling classes together or so that we'd have breaks at the same time, and sometimes even skipped classes so we could spend time together.  On our first lunch date we went to Buffalo Wild Wings and he tells me all the time that I gave him a look that made him realize I was the one he wanted to be with.  Our relationship was secret for a year - my mom wouldn't allow me to date a black man, and his family is very religious.  After a year of hiding, we decided we couldn't do it anymore.  We told our families we had classes scheduled when we really didn't.  Instead, we were out finding an apartment, getting furniture, and getting it ready.  On September 4 we packed up all of our things, told our families and moved into our townhome. <br>  <br>  We were married October 1, 2008 and I couldn't be happied.  Both of our families have accepted our marriage and we're all very close now.|`|n5NDs9JAaa	My old best friend met this guy off myspace. They wanted to meet, but didn't want to be alone the first time, so they each agreed to bring two friends, so it ended up being 3 guys and 3 girls who had never met each other lol.<br>  So we all met up at the Mall in the food court and the two friends the myspace guy brought were really cute, especially this one guy; so i started flirting with him. But then the other girl friend which we brought, pulled me away and said "that's mine okay?" so i was like whatever, and got with the other guy.<br>  Well so the 6 of us all became decent friends/bfs/gfs and it was all good for about 2 months, when me and my bf broke up, and my friend and her myspace bf broke up lol.<br>  So 2 months after everything ended, I ran into the guy i originally wanted to get with and we were just laughing and only saw each other for like 5 minutes. Well then he started calling me all the time and we started dating, and now, 25 months later we're engaged and we're getting married in April. :)<br>  <br>  If you knew the other details (like how we ran into each other lol) it would seem really ironic, and i think fate definitely played a huge role in us getting together... really it was quite bizarre but too long to type here lol.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I met my fiance at the Light Rail stop.  Light Rail is a type of train, kind of like the subway except above ground.  Anyway, he was at the 16th St. stop here in downtown Denver, and I was going home on the train a little later in the day than I normally did, and I saw him sitting there.  We struck up a conversation, he got off with me at my stop, and the rest is history!  That was exactl 6 1/2 years ago today, and we're getting married in exactly 6 months, on our 7-year anniversary of the day we met.|`|FnskUYpqaa	I met my fiance on the bus (he was the bus driver) He told me he liked my shirt when I looked up at him it was instant attraction. He wouldn't stop looking at me in the rear view mirror. The next time I got on his but I gave him my number on a bus transfer he was so nervous he missed a turn and I couldn't help but giggle :)|`|6r6Laeozaa	I meet my gf on www.plentyoffish.com.  She checked me out.  I sent her a message.  We exchanged messages for about a week.  Then we chatted on msn for about 2 weeks.  I gave her my cell number because I was getting frustrated with my DSL internet.  We chatted on the phone for about a week.<br>  <br>  One day while on the phone with my gf, my dad gave me tickets to Ontario Place (mini amusement park in Toronto Canada).  I asked her out and told her it would be a free date.<br>  <br>  Our first date was on July 7, 2007.  We decided to play mini golf.  The bet was if I win she would have to make me dinner, if she won I would have to kiss her. (win win situation for me lol).  I did try to win but I lost.<br>  So I honored the bet and kissed her.  The rest was history.<br>  <br>  We have been dating now for 1 yr and 8 months.  We both are finishing school.  She is the love of my life.  I'm so happy to have a person like my gf.<br>  <br>  I plan on proposing to my gf on christmas day.|`|5MxylQOuaa	I met my man of 8 years at a Cinco de Mayo Fiesta in the local neighborhood park ON MY 18th BDAY! lol...he was 24 at the time and looking handsome as ever.<br>  <br>  At first, he really wasn't talking much, just busy with his Budweiser, lol, but then we ran into each other the next day, same place since it was a weekend long fiesta. He recognized me, but did not remember we had met already, because of the beers! lol....but he approached me, introduced himself (again), asked for my number (again), and we spent the whole night together having fun.<br>  <br>  We have such a great relationship together and I'm so glad we both went back the next day. What a great birthday present huh?!<br>  <br>  hugs!|`|5545d2a19349ba1665bcc132f6adae6faa	I met my husband at a barbeque. He went with a friend of his and I went with my sister's family.|`|0Mx0Aie3aa	We met in speech class at Penn State Univ - The professor asked that we get into groups  and we were the last ones top pair up-  we started talking and realized we had several other classes together-  we started out as friends, and I dated several other people before I realized I wanted to date him-  He was incredibly quiet about his feelings until we had "the Mcdonald's conversation" as I call it-    late one night we were eating there and basically I gave him an ultimatum- if you want to date tell me know, otherwise we'll just be friends- thankfully he mustered the courage to tell me his true feelings, and we've been together since- 10 yrs married in May|`|iYN6XcATaa	I met my bf [fiancé now] when I was at work. I was actually talkin to 1 of his good friends(tryin to date them) and Jason (my bf) tried to help set us up but when it didn't work out between me and his friend he asked his friend of it wud b ok if he asked me out since we had gotten so close. An since one year ago we've been dating and now we are planning to get married :)|`|2Av3gIqgaa	Awesome question!  <br>  <br>  My fiance and I went to school together starting in 5th grade.  We had all the same friends, but somehow never met.  I remember being on the school bus in 7th grade and someone told me he had a crush on me but that was it.  We never met or anything.<br>  <br>  About 3 years ago, 5 years after high school graduation, I made a myspace profile and found my friend Will on there that I had known since middle school and hadn't talked to since high school.  My friend Jill - yes, their names rhyme - wanted to hook Will up with another friend, Mary.  Mary didn't want to meet Will by herself, so I went with her.  Will brought his roommate, who is now my fiance.<br>  <br>  The first thing I ever said to him was so cheesy, "Hey!  You had a crush on me in 7th grade!!  Do you remember?"<br>  <br>  He said NO!!!  But, whatever.  We started dating after that and we're getting married next Feb.  I tell people that we met BECAUSE of myspace  :)<br>  <br>  And...Will and Jill are both going to be in our wedding!|`|PoBIyZ27aa	My fiance and I met when we were both in kindergarten at a private school. Our teacher had put us in groups of our birthday months and then by the days. His birthday is the day before mine. So we ended up becoming friends. Then we lost touch in 4th grade. He found me on myspace the summer before our Junior year of high school. We started talking and met up at a local festival at our time. About a month later we started dating, 2.5 years later we're engaged, and we'll be married after being together for over 3 years. :)|`|YXRRpodKaa	Honestly?<br>  <br>  I joined a dating website (plentyoffish) I never thought I'd join one let alone date someone from there. He messaged me some generic lines. It was so obvious that he was copy and pasting messages. So I replied with some sarcasm. We ended messaging each other on msn and it was a neat friendship. I'd talk to him about other guys that I had in my life and how much they screwed me over. I saw him as nothing more than a friend online that I felt comfortable enough to confide in. I had no physical attraction towards him at all, it was actually mutual. He'd call randomly and we'd just shoot the ****. One night we got into one of them crazy deep conversations that lasted all night and morning. So the next day we decided to meet up at Chapters. No sparks, nothing. It was what I expected. Then he came over and watched a movie and he never left. After talking so much that following night we realized that we fit together so nicely. Like two missing puzzle pieces. <br>  <br>  A year and half later. We're still together, and expecting a baby boy this spring. FYI, Our families don't even know we met online.|`|6AYA3GWWaa	Blind date.<br>  <br>  I was out with friends one night, and one of them turned to me and asked, "How do you feel about blind dates?  Because I know a guy, and I think you two would click."  I figured I had nothing to lose--at worst, it would give me a good story to tell--so I had her give him my number.<br>  <br>  He called, we had a friendly conversation, and decided to meet up after work for coffee (which neither of us actually drink).  Coffee turned into dinner, dinner turned into dessert, dessert turned into dating, and three years later he proposed.|`|HcboXOmjaa	I met my bf of 2 years at college through my roommate at the time. He called her to meet up at a party and I came along and we kind of hit it off there and started dating about a month later. It was totally unexpected but the best thing that has ever happened to me!|`|884v4VhGaa	Juggling club. There's really nothing more. He had an on-campus co-op so he showed up for meetings when I came back for classes.|`|QJ17P0DOaa	on holidays in greece. we are married now 1yr and 7 mths and have a 7 mth old baby! and i love him dearly.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I met my husband when I was 11 and he was 15!  My family had known some of his relatives all our life, so when he came to visit them, that's when we met.  We saw eachother off and on through the years.  ( He lived in Virginia, and I lived in Texas.)  In September of 2006 he called my dad and asked if he could get to know me.  He came out that October, and we spent a really fun weekend together.  He proposed in February of 2007, and we got married in September of 2007.  We're almost to our year and a half anniversary and we're really happy!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Believe it or not, at a dance club! I wasn't even looking for a bf, just a hot guy to dance with! lol! I saw him, he saw me, we danced all night until 4am. Met up the next weekend, started dating 3 days later. <br>  <br>  Moved in 2.5 months later, got engaged 3 years after we met, will marry 2 years after that in September! :)|`|AA11380378	I met him while I was at work. <br>  <br>  I worked on an office building and he was ther for bussiness looking for an office. I saw him and I was floored! I blushed, looked and him (drooled), smiled, and we looked at each other and we said good morning. I was going to another office. I left the office where i was going to si I could see him again and I did!... so I asked him if he was lost (he wasn't), nor I'm a helpful person with directions LOL! I just needed an excuse to talk to him. So we talked, I "helped him" with "directions" and I was soo preocupied that I was giggling, smiling, drooling too much, coming off as too strong and abruptly ran away and told him that I had to go back to work. So yes, like Cinderella, I ran away. <br>  <br>  Two hours later he shows up at my office, mind you, he didn't know my name or where I worked; the office building was quite large (over 200 offices and dozens of organizations and departments) and he said that he "needed more directions". I was shocked that he found me! It was nearly impossible for him to find me again. (he later confessed that he went office to office looking for me and that he was not going to give up until seing me again). So, we went on a date that night and we have been inseparable ever since. We joked now that I was "stalking him" and that he was "stalking me back".<br>  <br>  We got married last summer. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|2o3BHgCCaa	At the postoffice. I was working behind the counter as a summer job and he brought in the mail for his business everyday.<br>  After 2 weeks he asked me out (said he needed that long to work up the courage)<br>  I said yes and the rest is history.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	My cousin (my matron of honor) is married to my fiance's best friend (the best man).

72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	I think what they spend on their daughters wedding(s), is REALLY NONE of YOUR concern, frankly.  If they choose to pay and pay and pay, that is THEIR BUSINESS, NOT YOURS!  As to you and your fiance's wedding and the limits they have set for the two of you, should be respected and you need not concern yourself about anything like their deep pockets and what you are being gypped out of.  Frankly, in this day and age, I think that expecting parents to foot the bills for kids college, weddings, graduations and parties is just getting to be a bit too much.  Used to be, IF parents could help, they did, if not, the kids found their own way.  Things are different, and EXPECTING money from anyone is a bit nervy!  If you don't like the amount being offered and feel the need to have more of a lavish wedding than is being provided, my suggestion, is to get another job and help pay for it!  This will solve a lot of headaches and problems with you, your in laws and your fiance.  If you are an adult, try stepping up to the plate and paying like any other adult on the planet!  Good luck!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Well, obviously not, they should be paying for their own wedding.<br>  As should you and your fiance!|`|w1necKzYaa	Hell no! they should not have paid for her second one either!|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	Dear one, if you and your fiance aren't able to foot the entire bill yourselves, you are not ready for marriage.<br>  <br>  I suggest you just let her parents do whatever they want with their money and say nothing. It's their money - not yours - and if they want to spend it on her sister, well so be it.<br>  <br>  But you and your fiance - pay for your own wedding. When her folks start to but in - you can then politely tell them that they footed too many weddings already and you and yours intend to do this on your own. That's a polite way of saying "mind your own business"<br>  <br>  Then if they insist on giving you money - tell them to put it towards the down payment on a house - or put it in an education fund for your future children - but you and yours are doing this on your own.<br>  <br>  Does this mean you have a smaller wedding? Well, perhaps - but I suggest a smaller wedding may just lead to a stronger marriage.<br>  <br>  But it's up to you.|`|f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	How much they are willing to spend on your wedding will be up to your fiancee's parents (I assume that you are the groom). There is no law that states that they have to pay anything.<br>  What is wrong with a small wedding?<br>  As for the sister. As stated, it would be up to her parents if they choose to pay for a third wedding for their daughter.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	She is their daughter and they can pay for as many weddings as they see fit. It is their money. Ask them not to  short change you and your fiance just because she has two divorces.|`|AA11226180	Absolutely NOT ! I say they shouldn't have paid for the second one quiet frankly.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Most certainly not... I think it's disgusting that she's made them pay for two already and wants them to pay for a third. The way I see it, the first wedding is fine but anything after that? You're an adult. You've been married and divorced. It's time to start taking care of yourself. If you want a wedding, YOU pay for it.|`|reLPODK9aa	These days is is not uncommon for the bride and groom to pay for their own wedding. If you get help from parents then that is just icing on the cake.|`|r5AbT6tmaa	Probably not. One wedding for one daughter is enough.|`|KHwY8seCaa	be reasonable, they could help pay for some things. but you should deff have alot more!!
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	you have many references to pot and alcohol...<br>  <br>  that might turn some people off...|`|BKr3y30maa	Never have done online dating but I would recommend removing (beer, heineken, and sarcasm) from your keywords.  I think everything else looks great.  You are letting them know you love to laugh and enjoy comedies, so that tells them you have a great sense of humor.  You even show that you like alot of types of music which will draw alot of women's attention. Good luck and hope you start getting some responses!  Hope I helped you out.|`|oMr0S3Wdaa	Pot and alcohol ! you need to change your profile . People don't want to know that you like drugs? that's a turn off, the rest sounds good
ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	for some people its hard to handle a "second" family.. they are so afraid that their kids from their first family will feel as though they are being replaced, that they dont mean as much any more, and sometimes its all in the parents head to begin with so out of guilt of thinking this , they over compensate when their children are concerned and start forgetting that theres other people in their life now that need them as well, and forget to spread their attention through out the house hold to everyone involved..  which tends to make the new wife wonder where her place is in the family..  and if it gets to bad she starts to feel that she's only a marriage of convience , a fixture in her own home, someone there only when he wants her to be there.. and this can cause you to resent not only him, but his children as well..  my best advice to u , is to talk to your husband, let him know how you feel.. and if he takes ur concerns to heart great, if he could careless then u know where u stand, and its up to u whether u chose to be in a relationship where u feel like the 3rd wheel or not.. good luck|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	You are so lucky to have a husband who is a good father.  Most fathers walk out.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can schedule "we" time.  Get a baby sitter and go to dinner or take the kids to the folks house and stay home in a bubble bath.<br>  <br>  Scheduling the time will be a reminder to your husband that you are there too.|`|MRDJu8v3aa	First, are the kids his from a previous marriage? <br>  <br>  I often hear complaint about fathers who do NOT show as much love for their children as the wife expects. You are very lucky because it sounds to me like you have one of the “good guys” :).<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to your husband about your feelings. Keep the conversation positive. Tell him that you think it is great that he cares so much for his children. Take about your relationship with him… what you like and what you do not like. Try not to blame him but look at it as a problem that YOU have and are asking HIM for help in finding a way to solve it. I am not trying to put the blame on you (marital problems are never, ever one sided) just this is the best way to not put him on the defensive ;).|`|Rkik3eUuaa	are those your common kids or just his? if they re your common kids be happy that he is thinking of them. if those re just his kids tell him to keep his thinking about them to himself and pay u attention. u demand respect. he cares about his kids too much - shouldn't have left their mother on the first place|`|t7jiSmjVaa	Get someone to watch the kids. Plan a romantic get away. Just the two of you.|`|djUMvICoaa	One thing is for sure you guys don't have a good line of communication or you could have talked to him about this.  You may have set yourself up for this by letting him have his way with the kid and thinking it was alright.  You let yourself become the second fiddle player by sitting back.  Now he' s used to you in the back and you're trying to get back in the front.  Now it's time to lay this all out in front of him and tell him how hurt you feel.  I have kids by my ex but I never let them overshadow my present mate, I know this relationship needs to be nurtured also.   Some fellows still go with the idea that once the ring is on the finger they don't have to worry about the relationship any more and forget to nurture it.  Others just don't know how.  You may have to help him if you want this relationship to succeed.|`|BDMRXE9taa	i couldn't help but notice that you are very stuck on the idea that it is his kids and my husband. not to be mean but you sound a little selfish. give a little of yourself to his kids and the child becomes partly yours also maybee he feels he has to give more to them because you have not accepted his child as your child in the relationship.we all have to give up part of ourselves to all involved in the relationship to make everyone happy.his kids are your kids when you became a family and your husband is their father.|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Could you get engaged in planing something with his kids.  If he sees you proactive in what interests him most, he may soften up and refresh his interest in you.<br>  <br>  Let me know how this plays out.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|z2TjjnxVaa	You should let him know how you feel. He might not realize that you feel this way at all.
VKMBaz8daa	I would say the best thing for the moment is give your friend some space. You have hurt her and it will take sometime for her to recover from it. The worse thing I would say is push for her to forgive you and try and pick up the friendship where it left off, this could blow up in your face as your friend may feel that it isnt the right time.<br>  <br>  I would re-explain your reasons and say that you still want to remain friends but understand that she may need some space to heal the wound.<br>  <br>  If the friendship is strong enough, it will survive this situation and recover however I feel it needs to be done by your friends pace.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, I think you need to reflect on your insecurities within your relationship with your fella. It is obvious that there is a issue and I think you should spend the time healing your own wounds|`|AA11648899	Well - You and I have quite a different view of friendship.<br>  <br>  In my world - I trust that if my BEST FRIEND - had something that they needed to share (like sleeping with my girlfriend) - that they would share it.<br>  <br>  I also allow for my best friend to have "private things".<br>  <br>  The problem isn't with your BEST FRIEND it's with your PARTNER.  <br>  <br>  To explain the REASONS you've accused her... is meaningless.<br>  <br>  "I thought the reason for NIGHT was SOME PERSON put a HUGE CANOPY over the sky... there are PIN HOLES and that's the stars."<br>  <br>  Is all CRAP...<br>  <br>  Apologize... focus on you being WRONG not WHY you're wrong.<br>  <br>  When you give REASONS... it's like saying "BUT"<br>  <br>  I screwed up - BUT I'm justified...<br>  <br>  NO... you're not justified... LEAVE that out.<br>  <br>  Tell you friend - you screwed up HUGE and leave it there...<br>  Tell her... you really value her friendship...<br>  Tell her... you're really sorry and you'll LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES - in the future to make it up to her.<br>  <br>  And... Dump your partner... K?|`|ewIELhBiaa	accept and move on. You accused your Friend of a pretty harsh thing and further more you believed rumors enough to accuse her. It sounds like you really weren't that great of friends in the first place move on hopefully you will develop better and more trusting relationships in the future.|`|xOX7yMczaa	it should run its course really. I dated my best friends little brother in high school and he STILL wants nothing to do with me, but because i think he liked me all along and i really liked him too but his brother got to me first.. =/ really messed up, i know. BUT look at the hills....laruen and heidi theyre supposedly best friends again after all that time of hating eachother!! id give it a try and apologize and everything to her and see what she says...she might come around sooner or later. but if she doesnt..thats just how its suppose to be. Dont let it worry you too much though, do your own thing to keep your mind off of it :) good luck! <3 isabella =)|`|xarKlp0Oaa	If you value the friendship I would try and talk to her. She is your friend and she is probably just upset that you would even think she would do something like that. All you can do is let things quiet down a little and try talking to her again.|`|XZEaQ4Myaa	accept and move on.|`|zu1DQNxZaa	I would try and explain to her that you may have accused her because of insecurities about your boyfriend. He's betrayed your trust before and so i'm not surprised if you find it hard to trust him fully now. The alcohol was probably a large part of it and im sure your friend can relate to having done or said something before thinking about it properly when she's been drunk too. You had also been hearing rumours, and when you hear them for long enough you start to question if they are true. If i had been accused of something similar i'd be pretty angry and upset at first, its a natural reaction, but hopefully she'll eventually get over it. Explain it all to her, then leave it down to her, she might just need some time to calm down.|`|AA11859312	I think  time heals all, It is real important to remember  men come and go but true friendship is for ever. there are ups and down of course, but that would be a deal breaker for sure. there has to a reason you would even go there, I hope one would learn from our past, trust is real important in any relationship, so just give it time you every heard it said if you love something let it go and if it returns then it was yours, if it don't than it never was. I hope things work out for all of you.|`|kSlxXQcsaa	you should just accept and move on. it might seem hard to even think about doing that at the minute but its obvious that you cant trust your friend or your partner because they have done this type of thing before. Its not as if its the first time he has done anything like this and he may be liable to do it again. be strong and move on in your life. theres better people out their for you. even if it doesnt seem like that at the minute its true......|`|uUAxK6hNaa	I have kind of been in the same situation and i didn't chat to my friend for 6-8 months. But then she apologised for what she did, and i forgave her straight away. I think you should apologise, she definitely will forgive you and carry on back the way you two were. Don't leave it too long best to do it straight away :)|`|OS24ICPRaa	maybe with time she could forgive you....i would let her know how sorry you are and tell her that you will give her space and let her come to you....also point out that its not like you thought of this on your own, you had people telling you things and you had to find out before you just ignored it right?
Z6auiyZkaa	Pura Vida , Make him some Gallo Pinto and all will be good thats stuff is off the hook|`|7113da11ac2041f96cfd274833a1e7f5aa	come on it is 2009 sex on the first date w adults who cares, but of course he is coming back, he wants more. That could be good or bad, good because he likes it, bad because there is no chase|`|4t4U9eFOaa	I think that it is a good sign.  enjoy the moment so you get to make a greatly appreciated meal and enjoy the dessert..what is wrong with that?|`|g9TxgMlwaa	okay.. so your worried that he made you dinner? And not worried about sex on the first date? You've so got your priorities mixed up.. sheesh|`|PWN5rqgxaa	if he got sex the first time of course he wants to come back for more... and a guys gotta eat somewhere...   next time say no sex and see what happens|`|oAv7Mv3raa	So you will have sex with him but you draw the line on making him dinner?|`|pVBH6iCYaa	what's next,  he's gonna make you watch soccer over american football?<br>  <br>  ditch the imported loser.|`|djUMvICoaa	If you only know this guy from emails you don't really know anything about him anything he's said could all be lies to get what he wanted and got from you, sex.  And now he's using you to cook for him, not asking but telling you.  That's not a good sign either, he sounds like a control freak, he'll dominate your life for you.  But if you want to see if he is really true ask him about some of what he ate that he liked and what he liked about it.  Of course he can find some of this on the internet too, so you are going to have to rely on your sense of well being and if you feel like you are being used or not.  Be careful.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	This is a non judgemental point of view! First of all you don't sleep with the guy on the first date, maybe you should have offered to cook in the kitchen first for him. :-)<br>  Work your way up to the sex part. Just go with the flow for now and if he is using you it will become apparent. Ask him to cook the meal the next time at his place. Then suggest going out on the town. <br>  Continue dating and if he seems like a user/loser you will know quickly.|`|72MtoWxRaa	you never sleep with a guy on the first date. Now he is taking rom you everything that he can. Here is what youdo.  instead of cooking for him, tell him you want him to take you out to a nice restaurant for dinner. See what he says. That will show you whcih direction this is going/..|`|1oj4aamaaa	You had sex with him the first time you met, and now you're up in arms about cooking for him?  Are you for real?|`|bO2rzfISaa	Are you going to post every move he makes on here? You already posted your concerns about having sex with him the first time at least twice. Have some confidence in your ability to conduct this relationship properly. What would he be using you for, dinner?|`|OHfZFR31aa	A man should never ask you to cook dinner for him. That should be something you offer to do for him. If he wants to see you again for anything but sex, he should be asking you out for dinner at a restaurant or even offering to cook for you.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	You need to gain a little self-confidence and respect for yourself  and quit having sex with strangers.|`|cGbTJobeaa	He wants to have sex for you again...and not only does he not want to pay for your meal, he wants you to pay for his meal!|`|lIO4uiJmaa	what do you mean - does this mean he's using me - ?  He has already used you, you have sex with a man who only met face to face a few hours before !<br>  <br>  Probably just thinks you are easy and good for casual sex and the occasional free meal.  Sounds very cheeky inviting himself to your house  and for you to cook a meal.  Surely on the second date you should be going to the cinema, out for a meal etc.<br>  <br>  call it a day with this guy and have some more respect for yourself in the future
jh9iPYvXaa	What you do is work on yourself.<br>  <br>  You won't be happy in a relationship until you're happy with yourself. Get to the point where you're happy just being you, then find someone to share your life with. Instead of trying to find someone to "complete you" - that doesn't work.<br>  <br>  Also - read "The Missing Piece meets the Big O".|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	you can sit and think about it or get up and get one|`|FXCoGD44aa	You slap yourself in the face for being "desperate" !!! Being desperate only repels the opposite sex from you. No one wants to be with someone who is dying to have a boyfriend/girlfriend. It's insecure and unattractive.<br>  <br>  Also, you shouldn't get a boyfriend or girlfriend just because you want one. That's not the right reason to date somebody... then you are just using them to fulfill your wants and mend your insecurities. You should date someone because you like them as a person.<br>  <br>  I bet you'd be surprised how much more attention you would get from the opposite sex if you quit your desperate mentality and tried enjoying being single for a while. You will emit an aura that is sexy, independent and confident... and people are naturally attracted to that.|`|Lons8Pzyaa	u dnt need a boyfriend/girlfriend to make u who u are. if u jes make it seem like ur not in need of one den dat makes u look more attractive. independence fa women is a turn on so act and be i-n-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-t. it's turns guys on! trust me, i kno. dnt always flash money to get u noticed doe. guys can be goldiggers jus as well as girls|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i either stay home and think about how lonely and depressed i am, or go out and hit on every girl possible. its hard, bcuz after its been a long time, u try harder and that makes u look desperate|`|k6it06fiaa	I have a single guy friend who feels that way i been trying help him find a girl but its a lot harder then i thought.|`|Fd2qVv4Vaa	it's rough, i know. you sit at home and think about all the people you saw out there that are "happy" and in relationships, and you sometimes cry yourself to sleep. long ago i contemplated how much i valued my life because i felt so alone...not good!<br>  look, being someone that got through the same problems, i have some thoughts that might help.<br>  <br>  dating is an all-in thing. you have to POUR your life into finding that person. Do you want to get into something like that in this point in life? it's complete BS that love comes to you, it doesn't.. At least not the "love" that you're looking for. everyone wants to think that relationships and love are the most important thing, ever. especially when you're emotionally needy.. but love is totally overrated and blown out of proportion in american media.. and many people end up falling into traps because of that..<br>  <br>  if you are irrational and rush things, you'll make huge mistakes, and totally regret it later. you might even commit to something and end up "stuck".<br>  <br>  grass is always greener on the other side.. look, when you finally get over this and have your wonderful relationship, you'll find that it's all about control. at some point you'll need attention, and he/she won't, and in that moment you are completely strung to his/her every whim.. just remember that when you're looking, PAY ATTENTION to what your gut is saying and not just the racing heart in your chest.<br>  <br>  it really helps to have something, like a hobby or your work, that can keep your mind off the person once you begin seeing them, something that really interests you and excites you.. something else that makes you happy to wake up in the morning. otherwise that relationship is all you can think about, and i'm sure there are other inportant things in your life, right? like i said dating is very life-consuming.<br>  <br>  just remember that relationships are NOT the most important thing in your life. you'll find happiness in many, many, many other places as well.|`|AA11811364	Confuscious, the ancient Chinese philosopher once said "girl who pine after boyfriend show shallow level in cranium."

Don't point fingers at anyone else or try to guess at who you think it is, you'll just put someone else in your shoes and transfer the blame. Tell them they're stupid, it's not you, and that you don't really care who it is. If people argue with you say "Yeah... I've got to get back to my life" and walk away. Repeat if necessary. If they don't let it go, these aren't people you want to hang out with and it might be best to find some different friends.|`|gYv1XUwzaa	well if they're accusing u of something, u going off and leavin the group may leave them being more sure its u, coz they could see it as you escapin the truth. stick with them, that way they wil know ur loyal.|`|7u33Zruhaa	Screw what anyone thinks.

AA12160073	Sounds to me like he's trying to play you because your younger and inexperienced.  I'd say drop him and don't worry about what he does or says.  DO NOT CALL/TEXT HIM!!!  Leave him alone and find someone closer to your own age and personality to go out with.  You don't need all of that drama and it's not "normal" for a lady your age to have to deal with.  You want to have fun and a good time, not argue and play soap-opera all of the time.  This guy is insecure and you have a level head.  Find someone who will appreciate you and treat you right.  Godloveya, honey!  You'll be just fine.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Don't worry kiddo.

Just have fun, and don't him manipulate you like he did by forcing you to tell how you feel.  A guy like that has some bad things hiding somewhere.  Did he tell you how he felt?

Tell Paul whats up in your heart.

xGshAiXOaa	First impressions are extremely important.  Dressing like a slob is going to tell people that you are messy, irresponsible, and that you're not a serious individual.  It basically says you lack effort and the desire to be seen as a mature, respectable adult.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Your husband is an idiot, and your right.  My best friend of fifty plus years was the vice president of a bank, and I can tell you as a matter of fact, that the appearance of the person asking for the loan is a major factor.  If you look like your unemployed and living in the back of your car, you will never get a loan.  So tell him to clean up and look presentable, good luck.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I agree with some of the comments about how it's more to do with credit rating and past history etc etc, but as a 'self respecting' man, he should also realize that how he presents himself is important as well.<br>  <br>  Try to imagine a 250lb female walking into a bank wearing tight shorts and a halter top to ask for a loan...<br>  <br>  Sorry I put that image in your mind ;-(|`|0wdEcNk1aa	I think your husband needs to wake up and smell the coffee. When having any type of professional business dealings, one needs to be neat, clean and appropriately dressed in order to be taken seriously. If a person presents themselves in a slovenly and ill-kempt manner it shows that they lack self-respect, thus they probably won't have respect for those they wish to do business with. In your husband's case this means that he probably wouldn't care about paying back the loan, hence no loan.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Sorry but you married a moron. This is simple common sense. If you are seeking a loan, a job, etc from someone then impressions are everything. Perhaps it wouldn't matter, as there are more important factors to consider, but there is no need to risk it. Wearing something more appropriate would definitely not hurt his cause, plus if the decision is on the fence small things can tip it either way.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I tend to agree with you. However some years ago my dad and stepmother went into a Cadillac dealer to buy a car. They had been working in the garden that afternoon and were somewhat dirty. Dad could not get anyone to wait on him. He knew what he wanted and finally walked over to the receptionist and took $20,000 out of my step mom's purse and laid it on the desk. Within seconds he had more help than he could handle. Looks can be deceiving but in hard times banks are going to be less skeptical of someone who's dressed for success.|`|krQiDGCHaa	You're both right.  The bank is going to care about your credit and payment history, not appearance.<br>  <br>  However, he should have enough respect for himself and for the people who are potentially extending him a loan to dress somewhat nicely for a meeting.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Although appearance probably shouldn't matter it MOST certainly DOES> He's being a little irrational. If you wouldn't wear it to a funeral or wedding don't wear it to an interview. Which is basically where he's going. The bank is interviewing him to see if he is a good candidate for the loan and his appearance in worn out clothes could be viewed as disrespectful and misleading.|`|djUMvICoaa	It reminds me of the story reported years ago about this guy who was dressed in bib overalls and came right out of his garden in to do some banking.  He had trouble with the person who was to wait on him, being very indifferent because of his dress.  The next day he came in dressed in his business suit and withdrew the millions he had in that bank and took it elsewhere.  He had had the day off when he went into the bank the first time.  Your hubby's an idiot.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	like usual you are right it is better esp when going for a loan at a bank to dress appropriate  it is just if you work in an office you will do better if you look the part instead of looking like a rag a muffin|`|4JrDGW7Taa	You are absolutely right! The way you appear to the person you want to get a loan from, means a lot in terms of his/her judgment. Yes, may be unfortunately, we are mostly judged by the way we look.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	You are right. Appearance does make a difference. It is not fair, but it's the way the real world works. He needs to dress the part if he wants to play the role. It won't kill him to do it.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	I'm wondering why you aren't mad at him for calling you stupid.  Let him go, looking like a slob, and leave him wondering why he wont get a loan.|`|TZpFcx47aa	I think in that situation, they will just look at his credit worthiness and nothing else. BUT, yep, I feel your pain on this one. My hubby dresses like a blind 89 year old farmer. Awful.|`|AA12160073	You are right!!  A person will make a personal opinion about you in the first 5 seconds of seeing you and you only get ONE CHANCE to make a first impression.<br>  <br>  Your man needs to "tighten it up" especially when asking for a loan or doing business.  Otherwise the bank will see him as a bum.  Unless he's a multimillionaire he can't play the eccentric person when it comes to business or even personal meetings.  You dress nicely and people will look up and listen.  You dress like you don't care about yourself, then they'll think you don't care about anything else, including paying back your loan.  Godloveyahoney.|`|5ace377e3ba7c902d796bbd6c9c815e5aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Although dressing nice and professional is a good idea, I think when it comes down to it the bank is not gonna care what your husband is wearing, they are gonna care about the numbers! Like your credit score, assets, debt, things like that.  They are not allowed to discriminate because someone is wearing a hat.  They aren't gonna see you come in all dressed up and give you a loan because you look nice, I wish life was like that, back in the 50's I would have to agree with you more though.|`|AA10195850	Appearance  does matter, and he knows it does, obviously he has a fairly good job if he wants a loan to buy some land, and he did not get the job by looking like a bum I bet.  Are you sure he really wants the loan, because it sounds like he might be trying to blow the deal before it happens.  Sure a good credit rating is very important in today's world when trying for a loan but so in personal appearance.|`|paV2LdR9aa	I think you're both right. Appearance does matter, but not really in this case - the bank guys are only interested in numbers. Sure, they might look at your husband and think 'what a scruff' but it won't affect the outcome, it's only the numbers that matter.<br>  Appearance does matter though, especially in a relationship. He should make an effort to look good for you if you do for him!|`|72MtoWxRaa	Honestly as appearance makes a good impression, if he has excellent credit then he could walk in there naked and get a loan.  They look at credit, equity, things like that. They do look at appearance but they cant say your denied because your wearing a hat. He should have respect for his appearance and go in there professionally since he will be representing himself.|`|rITfmgksaa	I agree totally going out of the house unkempt makes people think your a slob or a hick. A Clean well kept person looks much more responsible
wia9SXCPaa	I just went through this with my husband.  He was in an affair for 2 1/2 years.  It ended, we are making things work but he is saying things about her in his sleep.  I asked the question on yahoo and my results were about a 50/50 split.  Half the answers said he still loves her and get out because you Speak the truth in your sleep.  The other half said blow it off it means nothing. <br>  <br>  I don't think there is a right answer here, but if you don't want your husband to make a big deal about it then you need to reassure him that he is the love of your life.  Spend a little extra time with him and then try to sleep in a different position as to maybe not say anything.  My husband talks when he sleeps on his back only.  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|djUMvICoaa	As a loving wife I think you have to have a concern of how your husband took it so that he doesn't feel that you are cheating on him.  He may need a little assurance.  I would give him that by if the subject comes up again by telling him how bad a lover he (ex) was or how he (ex) couldn't make you come like hubby does so you don't know why you would have had such a frightful dream.  then take him to the bedroom and show him that you mean it.|`|Mcz3IjNgaa	im sorry but that is hilarious. lol but you should tell your husband that you do not have feelings for your ex because he will take it the wrong way.|`|Z6auiyZkaa	This happens and I wouldnt look too deeply into it and if your husband does then reassure him..|`|2wordCyfaa	Put yourself in your husband's shoe and you will feel the same way. Dont blame him. It can be painful for an able man to be right besides his wife and she is in Alice's wonder land "loving". In this days of porns or naked sex everywhere on pc and tv it can easily happen to anyone.<br>  especially the couple just had sex before she sleep off. other people can attribute it to spiritual. All you need to do is to reassure your man of your total loyalty. It is even better no name was over heard.|`|r3O9XCSBaa	Believe it or not our brains work in mysterious ways. It doesn't matter if you have talked to someone or even thought about someone in a very long time, your brain will bring up old memories. I have had a few dream myself about my ex-fiance even though we have not talked in 3 years. It is completely normal to have dreams like this and unfortunately there is nothing you can do to stop them. But usually it doesn't mean anything. Your brain it still functioning full speed even when we are asleep. <br>  Just tell husband that you love him and he has nothing to worry about.|`|oAv7Mv3raa	I had a dream the other night that I was being attacked by 3 guys naked with cocaine all over their bodies. I never done coke or been with a guy. I chalked it up to a dream that I could not control. I still woke up thinking "What was that all about" Ask him if ever been in control of his dreams. I am sure he has had some messed up sex dreams.|`|U4Rf1rjuaa	Why not "accidently" leave this yahoo answer up on your computer at home so he will see and read it and realize your concernd and that there is nothing to worry about! Think outside the box!|`|Cpwedckvaa	Dreams are just dream...reassure him that you love him and just let it go.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, he's gonna start suspecting that you're seeing him. You should try to do or say something that will ease his fears.|`|xGshAiXOaa	You need to let your husband know that you can not control your dreams.  You are not making the conscious choice to dream of your ex, it just happens.  That doesn't necessarily mean that you would rather have sex with him, or that you would rather still be with him.  The dream could have stemmed from anything: thinking of your ex, seeing him in the store, maybe a specific day that used to be some sort of anniversary for the two of you, etc.  It shouldn't be that big of a deal unless he has some other reason to be suspicious of you.
AA10151168	you just said one thing she didn't do but you say anything..is she always like that?<br>  <br>  maybe she doesn't want to go to the beach.or she has an excuse that she might not tell you.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Your obviously a B*tch. Good luck having no friends with your piss poor attitude.|`|PK498w0Saa	Take the hint - she's obviously not really your friend. To make new, nicer friends, which EVERYONE can do no matter how they think they can't, you can start up something new for yourself which will make you a lot happier. Go to a sports club or some other sort of club (youth club, craft club, french club etc.) which will unite you with people who share your interests. It will help you come out of your shell and you will make real friends. You'll always have something to talk about with these people too. Don't bother chasing after that girl, she won't be any fun in you force her into going out with you, plus she doesn't sound like a very nice person. Good luck making new friends. :)|`|kK5YqBQraa	yeah i have a friend like that. . . she would never come out or go out.<br>  <br>  some people just dont like going out and perfer staying in..simple as that! and it sounds like you really want to be friends with her, since she doesnt want to go to you why dont you go to her!?!<br>  <br>  you could go over to her place and hang...still the same thing if all you want to do is just spend sometime with her.

SNVauR3laa	Sorry, but you cannot. Your husbands ex-wife has the right to do whatever she wants basically. And so does your nephew. You have to realize now that no matter how much you want to be a family, you will never be like a family that isn't blended. We say no to our kids about many things, and then our exes will let them do them anyway. Cell phones, hair dye, you name it. You have no power, so you need to let go of your anger. Also, you need to let your son know that he and your stepson are different people, and won't always get to do the same things, or go to the same places, or have the same friends. I know that one of our daughters has a friend with whom she gets to do a lot of things, but that girl is not friends with our other kids, so they don't get to do those things. This is life, and your son needs to realize this. Our girls are 11, 12 and 13, so I try to remind myself that in seven years, I won't have to deal with the decisions that our exes make so much anymore, but the reality is, they will always be around. Weddings, grandkids. Step families are tough on everyone. Make the best of the situation. Do something fun with your kids that day so that your son is distracted, It doesn't have to be expensive. <br>  <br>  If I were you, my real issue would not be with the party. It would be with your husbands family doing for his kids, and not yours. If they want to take them somewhere without your kids, there is not much you can do, but I wouldn't allow gifts from them in the house. Explain to them what it is doing to your family. If they don't respect that, then any gifts from them will have to stay outside of your home.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	you really cant do anything about it. you just have to deal with it. maybe take your son to the park or something fun this weekend.|`|6cd66b36887ecbb069f11e405495a56baa	As hard as it is you need to understand that there isn't a single thing that you can do to "stop" this.  You need to accept that you can't change what they are doing but you can definitely change how you are reacting.  Your son will feed off of your feelings at this stage of the game so you need to put those leadership skills to good use.  Rise above all of this foolishness and really stop to think, do you want your son to hang out with a 12 year old that is so blatantly disrespectful?  I certainly wouldn't.  Don't make a big deal out of it, come up with reasons (even if you don't completely believe them yourself) and talk with your son.  Don't let him carry the blame of having the child not like him.  I don't know how long your son has been in this lovely cousins life but it could be as easy as not knowing each other well enough.  It could have been hard for the cousin to accept his Uncle's divorce and this is how he is handling it.  This is a tough age to begin with.  I would encourage you to arrange a day that the boys could do something together to see how it goes.  There are so many things that you could do that don't cost a lot and appeal to kids that age.  In the meantime, gather your thoughts and let it be.  Have your son invite a friend over this weekend and find some fun of his own.  I wish you all of the best.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I hate to be the one to burst your bubble but not everything in life is fair.  Not everyone gets along with each other.  You should know this.  <br>  <br>  There were plenty of parties that my siblings went to and my parents never forced anyone to invite extras...you are in the wrong this time IMO.  Children's friendships have nothing to do with favoritism - and everything to do with who they get along with.  <br>  <br>  I am one of 5 kids that grew up in a house that didn't have a lot of money and we learned fast that not everyone gets to have everything they desire...your kids are just learning this lesson too.  Let it be.  Control what you can control and let the rest go.|`|iGIyJOkuaa	I think you need to sit down with your stepson and tell him how bad it makes your son feel. They may not be old enough to fully understand yet but it would be a step in the right direction. You should also talk to your brother in law and tell him how childish it is of him to just go along with this. I also think that you should tell your brother in law that the situation needs to be handled accordingly and that you need to be fair to every child in the situation. You need to be open and honest in order to get your way. Do not let your gaurd down or else it will ruin your family and you will let it eat you up inside. Confront everyone and screw the kids mother, she is just playing little games to make your stepson dislike you. Just try to come at the situation with a different angle. If worst comes to worst, sit down with your son and explain to him that his stepbrother's mother has nothing to do with your family and that you can only control what is in your house and that you're sorry for what is going on. tell him youll take him somewhere else even better on the day of the party!!|`|r2Yo7YRNaa	If I were you just don't butt in and let them do what they want and instead just have your own party or family trip with your son and your own other children. Otheriwise leave your present husband and find someone else who has no responsibilities.

h5ghD3Zxaa	I have a friend like that; one day she is this devout Christian girl  who has morals and the next she is partying it up with alcohol drinking atheists. I think that your friend may feel that the behavior that she exhibits on different people is accepted by them, in which she thinks that she needs to act a certain way in order to "fit in" or like the previous answer suggests, adjust. It is also likely that she feels that her friends are all that she has and wants to keep every last one. It could even be a craving for attention, just wanting the satisfaction of being noticed. But hey, I could be wrong. I do not know your friend well enough to make such assumptions about her, but it gives you something to think about when you talk to her about it. Best of luck!|`|aP9W8IItaa	you should just speak to her and ask her what's going on? and why she is being like that?|`|2j2C44FDaa	I'm like that, I think it is her personality. She is a person that moulds herself to each friend to become the best that they want and she can give. People like her/me are too sensitive to each different person and try not to upset them. Which gets them/me into trouble when there are two of them together. <br>  Don't think she is false, just adjustable.

If he denies he uses the computer, you could take a picture of him on the computer.<br>  Or go to the history of your internet and show him.<br>  I'd talk to him about it, tell him it bothers you ALOT because you're having to deal with y'alls children, but there's only ONE person taking care of the children.<br>  It should be two people.  Not just one.<br>  And if he doesn't stop, put a password on the computer. :]<br>  We had to do that with my brother once.

Good Luck|`|n8Db77zbaa	Put your foot down, he's suppose to be a man, not a boy in his teens constantly on the computer! That is all too much. No need to reason with him or be nice about it otherwise, he won't take you seriously.|`|X3MVUemWaa	I would personally take the computer out but that is just me. Tell him he needs some time with you, the kids and start planning some date nights. Maybe a weekend away? Also invite people over at night, some people to start occupying his time with you and the kids. Get some games going outside or in the living room. Don't let every evening be the same. He will start moving.|`|hlE3nwyGaa	He is way addicted. Try to get him to go do something with you outside. Something he would enjoy (not hunting). Get him away from the computer. From my experience, all gaming addictions die out because the game gets repetitive. It could take from a month to a couple years for him to get over the addiction though so be pro-active in trying to get him away from it. He will get upset and angry and he'll ***** and moan and yell but that's just because he's addicted.

AA10065812	?????<br>  About 10% of custodial fathers still pay child support because his income is greater than hers.  This is quite common in California.  Unfortunately, the reverse is not true for mothers.<br>  <br>  In 1994, a Fresno (CA) sole custodial father of seven had to pay child support to the mother of the children.  He earned $40,000 a year to her $15,000.<br>  <br>  At the same time of Marcia Clark divorced Gordon Clark.  He was a work at home dad earning $40,000 a year compared to her $180,000 a year as the Los Angeles County Prosecutor in the O Simpson case.  She thought that him staying home to care for the kids was an embarrassment, so she took them and hired live in nannies as she worked seven days a week.  He was ordered to pay $21,000 a year in child support and covering part of the cost of the nannies.<br>  <br>  My attorneys were faster than her attorneys. They copied the file before she could request the file be sealed.<br>  <br>  There are no laws in this regard, so it is strictly left to the interpretation of the Judge.  If she's under court supervised visitation, that she pays for, she could be claiming this as an expense that she needs help with.  Or, if she's about to come off supervised visitation, or plans to file to be released from it, she can claim she needs the money to have a proper apartment with bedrooms for the children to stay overnight.<br>  <br>  This is not an area where I can advise you because it's a case by case issue that can go either way depending of the personal views of the judge.  You need a good attorney with extensive child support experience.  Preferably one that has represented a mother wanting child support from the custodial father, and won.  That experience will be useful, just as successful prosecutors can make good criminal attorneys and vice versa.  <br>  <br>  To learn how to interview for a good attorney, go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.

Of course she won't get it. If your dad has primary custody then she has no right to receive child support. As a matter of fact, your father should be filing against her.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	If your address is your Dad's house and you only see your Mom during Supervised weekend visits then NO she will not get any support and may have screwed herself because if Dad isn't getting any support right now he can turn this around and file for support from her.|`|JaNE0HKyaa	No way she only has supervised visitation no judge will give her child support.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	Not likely.|`|f6c49ba95f1fda5a6a6460f1182c4d9daa	If her father has custody of the child and the child lives with him and you have papers to back it up she wont get a dime. Sounds like she is trying to harass you two.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Nope. Whoever is the primary rediential custodian parent receives child support and the only one who can legally deduct the kids on their income tax. Sorry|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Probably not. Generally the parent with primary physical custody gets child support. SHE should be paying HIM. I doubt he'll have to pay her anything.|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	Nope not going to happen. She has no grounds to stand on. WHY would a court give her child support? Unfortunately there is nothing that says that she cannot petition for it.|`|G79hFe5Kaa	Of course not. But he should apply for child support from her, if she's working. She sounds like a loser. Good luck.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	No because she isn't the one with custody.|`|FzFSzilmaa	if she isn't looking after his kids she won't get ANYTHING... :D

kynzqmWgaa	Maybe he is not attracted to you anymore...or maybe he is just not a sexual person...or maybe he realized that you guys rushed into things and is now regretting it.  Whatever the reason is you should ask him.|`|HgVLhCr9aa	Rather than thinking of destroying your marriage and separating your child from their father, consider asking your husband to man up and come in for seconds.  It's reasonable that he would spend himself early (especially if that's his pattern), but if you humble yourself and voice your frustrations in a non-confrontational manner, and speak about your needs and how you want him to fill them, he might just come around.<br>  <br>  Also consider sexual activity when he's not going to be prone to fall asleep afterwards, like during the day or morning.|`|CCFhjtNBaa	So what if you do all the house chores? that means you deserve to the right for good sex? this isn't about you, it's him. Why don't you tell him all this?|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Before you talk to your ex, why not try talking to your husband.  Tell him what your needing.  He most likely has never been told or showed how to proper make love to a woman.  So you have the chance here to teach him the techniques that you need to achieve your goal.  Good luck.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	no, men care about satisfying their woman, sorry you got a dud!|`|OQdPzl15aa	Wow, you've only been married a year and you want to call it quits already???  WAKE UP!  Marriage isn't always easy-peasy and rainbows and butterflies.  You will always have ups and downs, and it's your job (and his) to do what it takes to get through the downs.  That's how marriage stays together; through choice, not through feelings, because the you are not going to be 'in love' or 'in lust' every second of your relationship.  There are probably going to be times that make your relationship look like something straight out of "the shining", and other times that are going to be more incredible than words can describe.<br>  <br>  First of all, don't talk to your ex!  Seriously?!  This isn't his problem.  You need to go to your husband and talk to him.  Find out why he doesn't seem to care.  Perhaps he does care, but maybe he feels inadequate to meet your needs and is insecure or doesn't want to try for fear of more failure.  You guys need to practice, and figure out what each of you likes and needs sexually.  Communicate!! <br>  <br>  Secondly, he isn't going to want please you, if you are not making him feel man enough for the job.  The male ego is very fragile, and you need to make sure he is getting the respect that he deserves.  Men thrive on respect, while women thrive more on love.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you are desirable, but he may feel he's not man-enough for the job because he can't figure out how to give you the "O" on his own.  Help the poor guy out!  Boost his ego and make him feel that you can't do anything without him and let him know he is needed and that you respect his hard work and amazing father skills.  Make him aware that he turns you on in a big way. Give him a confidence boost and talk to him about what he's feeling, and make him aware of what turns you on.  Steer clear for the time being of what turns you off, and just get really excited every time he does something you like.<br>  <br>  Marriage is a choice, and you can choose to practice unconditional love and understanding,...... or you can give up and keep going into a relationship when you feel warm and snuggly, and out once the feelings fade off in a year.<br>  <br>  You have to make it work through understanding, communication, sacrifice, compromise, patience, unselfishness, and unconditional love.<br>  <br>  Your choice.  If you can't handle it, then give up and leave. People don't deserve anything less than your utmost best.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	"Talking" to your ex bf is not the answer here at all.  What you need is some help with your sex life.  He seems to be a selfish lover, which is unfortunate, but did you not know this before you got married?  It should have been addressed then.  Have you even mentioned your dis-satisfaction to him?  Communication is key.  You can try self help stuff (books, videos, etc.), or there are many forms of therapy out there for couples, you should look into them.  All other parts of your relationship seem good, so before just "moving on", try working at the sex part.  And don't use your problem as an excuse to contact your ex....|`|Z6auiyZkaa	Well this depends on the man I have thought men were the opposite to this and liked to please the women they were with, You need to talk to your husband if your against a brick wall maybe look at his stress levels and see is he stressed at work...<br>  <br>  Leave the ex aside hes an ex for a reason and you do have a kid with your husband too ..|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Yeah, I know how you feel - I had an ex who would just lie there and have me do all the hard work.<br>  <br>  Before you do anything else, talk to your husband about it. If he isn't willing to change, consider seeing a sex therapist, or ending the marriage.<br>  <br>  I know sex isn't everything, but if he isn't even willing to attempt to pleasure you, it isn't worth it.|`|w1iHxDL1aa	Please Never 'talk' to your man. It stresses all man out and dooms and discussion to failure. Instead, just be more loving than usual towards him and suggest getting hot and heavy. Whatever the reply is, you can snake in some discussion. =) He has some issues, try to find them out. But Never do the 'Honey, Let's talk' thing. Because it will Always Fail.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	Sure, be a ****. Become an adultress. Or you can "pleasure" yourself.|`|FzFSzilmaa	sounds like you should stay with him, and get a FwB/booty call or ask for an open marriage..<br>  <br>  are you able to get the "O" by yourself???|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Your satisfied you have the choice to stay home or not. That is a satisfaction that most women would love to have.|`|NqbBjS0raa	So you are saying before you got married and after you never had an "O" with him and you still married him? Why is it so important now based on that already known fact in this marriage? I think your criteria for this problem should have be underscored to a decision to see if he could satisfy you to make it to that big "O." Your ex-boyfriend must have had issues that you didn't marry him? So now you put the child through marriage problems and possibly cheating or divorcing him up the road? Desirable doesn't make you a good person or someone who seems to be content with commitment. I guess this marriage should have been routed through a different path but the child has to be subjected to your frustrations and lack of good choices. That is the more serious loss in this whole situation. I think you should communicate more with hubby and see if he can perform better or risk losing you to an earlier castoff or probably a better reason why you didn't marry the previous bf........|`|PfmXPbFpaa	Have you had an orgasm with anyone else? with masturbation?<br>  Is it possible that he just doesn't know *how* to please you?<br>  <br>  I would definitely talk to him.  Tell him how unsatisfied you are. Tell him you want to spice up your love life: play games, roll play, use different toys.  Masturbate for him so that he knows what excites you and it's just possible that could turn him on too. Utilize oral sex for both of you, show him you are willing to try new things.<br>  <br>  Not all men are like that.  <br>  My boyfriend has given me many orgasms *before* allowing himself one, because he knows he's done for a while after that.  <br>  Our love making sessions last for hours, and there is a lot of foreplay involved.  He has even pulled out of me just so he can last longer.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.  You deserve to have an orgasm. <br>  <br>   I am not sure what "talking" refers to, but because it is in quotes, it sounds like you are thinking about cheating.  That would not be a good idea.  It could break up your family. You have a young daughter to think about and as you mentioned, no source of income on your own.  If you still love him, I would try to work it out.  I hope you find some enjoyment in your sex-life.|`|2G1vkdTzaa	He might not be able to. Try to help him along. You have to communicate with him and even show him what you like. Just remember to return the favor every once in a while. Sex is never a reason to end a marriage though. Those most men don't live with you either. There might be something that you don't realize you are doing that is really annoying him to the point that he just isn't interested. Talk to him about it.|`|2c270a1f7cff2e0db35660cd8a291fd2aa	this is indeed a problem. I would certainly be concerned and even comtemplate leaving my husband because if he doesnt care abt satisfying you, you can tell he doesnt really care much abt how you feel. you need to tell him why this important to you, what you want and how frustrating this has been for you... i am really sorry for how you feel but u have every right to feel frustrated and concerned...|`|Ou7j5QxZaa	Christy,<br>  <br>  Men do care about women, and your man should make sure you have an O for every O he has, unfortunately your man - for whetever reason is not doing that part of his job well.<br>  <br>  rather than ending your marriage or having an affair, have you discussed this with him?|`|VaX8Lfc9aa	Do not cheat him or leave him..becasue that is stupit<br>  Better talk to him seriously and tell him all you feel..and tell him and remind him of what you do and that he should make you feel good before he makes him self!<br>  good luck<br>  But dont be stupit to cheat or leave him.|`|ce4DZs0maa	You should try talking to him, let him know how you feel about the situation...If you love him its worth a shot.  Good luck!|`|2OS6mq6Saa	Sloooot|`|pVBH6iCYaa	you wanna be satisfied, get some snickers bar.<br>  <br>  *packed with peanuts, snickers really satisfies|`|zf8gqN2Faa	You need to tell him this.

Do NOT cheat on him, that's never the answer.|`|Mcz3IjNgaa	don't cheat on him just try to stick it out. and find help|`|1NIFJaThaa	It could be his work hours making him really tired and so not so good at pleasing you. I mean men are ready and rearing to go with the snap of a finger, us women have to have the foreplay thing going. We take abit longer to get where we're going. Suggest that he gives you oral, that should be a definite O if he knows how to work it... his tongue that is.<br>  <br>  Another thing, your mindset has alot to do with it as well, its not totally up to him to give you your big O , you have to be in the right place mentally for it to happen. Make the effort one night when the little one is a sleep by taking a bath together, if possible , tease each other abit, get to the point where its too much and you just want him inside, if he takes it from there by stroking you the right way and with really sexy thoughts of your husband there you should be climbing up to your O. If that fails, really just have him go down on you before he comes. Cause if he does before you do, the night is basically done.<br>  <br>  Another thing dont try to  introduce a third party in until you've exhausted all avenues, like talking to your husband, experimenting with him etc. Infidelity isn't good especially if he's a good man all round.|`|AaknZ1RHaa	You took vows for better ot worse...well hopefully this will be all of the worse. Consider yourself very lucky to have a good father for your child and a good provider. <br>  <br>  I would do two things. Lay of the sex or lack off. They are other ways of being intimate. Try flirting with hubby. Date him.<br>  <br>  Second I would have a heart to heart with him and get everything out on the table. Not a big blown out argument, but a real talk. Tell him how this makes you feel.<br>  <br>  Please do not cheat. That isn't the answer and will make things worse.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|MYU46ap5aa	Seems like you married your husband for the wrong reasons and really didn't get the chance to know him, especially since you're contacting an ex.  Not the way to go.  <br>  <br>  Why not try to control the sexual relationship with your husband and make him hold out a little longer.  Try getting on top. Try doing it in other places.  Maybe you have to start first and then let him finish when you're ready.<br>  <br>  But if you believe in the sanctity of marriage you wouldn't end it just because you think you're not satisfied.  Did you ever think that he may feel the same way?|`|TWsxP46Qaa	firstly,stay away from your ex,its not worth the grief involved,and you might end up losing all the other benefits you gain from your husband<br>  <br>  try something a wee bit kinky,tie him to the bed and blindfold him,tease him for as long as you want then get on top and make sure you control him so that you get the orgasm your so desperate for then roll off of him untie him and turn round to go to sleep,i can bet he wont be letting you doze off after all the teasing.<br>  <br>  or get yourself some sort of toy,but dont hide it away use it as part of the foreplay,most of us guys love to see our ladies playing with toys,it'll get both of you so worked up he wont dream of making it a quickie and rolling over to go to sleep<br>  <br>  but most importantly,TALK to him communication is THE most important part of this kind of problem,once he knows how much this bothers you he might change his routine,but what ever you do dont say something hurtful like"its gotten so bad i was gonna go jump my ex"<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|Cpwedckvaa	You may be "desireable to most men" on the surface but that is about how far it goes...COME ON...you are considering "talking" to an ex and yet you talk about your husband like he is a good man...GET OVER IT!

Tell him that you need more and if he cannot figure it out...take care of yourself...teach him what to do <br>  <br>  ADULTERY IS NOT THE ANSWER!|`|1zv5J7VAaa	Talk to him honestly about it.

I dont mean to be rude but he could be cheating on you.|`|xZwfXneYaa	i really believe that you should just try to have a nice conversation with him. especially since there is a child in the picture, just be honest.|`|hCcNwUTVaa	No no no...don't give up on your husband.  Talk to him about it. Communication is rule numero uno in relationships!! You know that...you need to sit down with him and really tell him what is bothering you.  And make sure you tell him that you're not blaming him or putting him at fault for any of it.  Tell him that as a married couple, you're a team, though good and bad, sickness & health, etc. There are MANY MANY women who cannot have "O"s very easily at all...some go even later in life without having one.  But if you try different things, experiment and have patience..and most importantly have fun and RELAX, you'll have one. And you'll be satisfied before you know it.  There are many things online you can find to try different things and see what works for you.  You might even want to consider bringing a toy into bed with you.  That might be a helper.  Just whatever you do, don't ruin anything you have with your husband.  Best of luck!! =)|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Talk to him. It's the only thing you can do. Most people(us women) don't like to tell our man about our sexual needs. Don't go talking to your ex, you are walking in dangerous territory. I know some men when they do the deed just think woman naturally get off at the same time. We know that's not true. Try getting him to focus on you.<br>  Tell him guide him and if that doesn't work ask if he would be willing to see a sex therapist? Communication is the only way to resolve your issues.|`|rDnQ6MNYaa	I don't really see enough information about what has been done to address the issue.  <br>  <br>  You are going to have to sit him down and explain that he is being selfish.  He is going to need to spend some time at sex.  You want to make this a "and if you do that...think of the all this other stuff we can try, experiment and really spice things up with"  You want to make it more of an incentive program.  <br>  <br>  The second thing is...it sounds as if he needs some education on what really turns you on and satisfies you...That means you are going to have to tell him...he isn't taking hints.  Men often struggle in that respect.  <br>  <br>  Finally, he may struggle with his endurance....(he may be overly fast).  There are techniques that he can try to increase his endurance levels...Actually for men his age...sometimes a couple of good rum and diet cokes (watch those carbs and calories) will help with that.  <br>  <br>  Finally, if you have done all that...and things are not working...explore the possibilities of lovers.|`|wuw1ph9jaa	You really need to talk to your husband first.  If he is not receptive or respectful of your needs and wishes then maybe a marriage or sex counselor could help. Intimacy is a very important part of a relationship(marriage) and going out side of the marriage can destroy a family in a heartbeat.  Hopefully you and your husband have a honest relationship and talking about needs and wants is taken to heart.  <br>  <br>  I believe men really do care about pleasing a woman just like a woman cares about pleasing a man.<br>  <br>  I also know that the feeling of not being wanted, respected or desired makes you wonder if the relationship is on the rocks. <br>  <br>  Try talking to your husband, and be honest.  Tell him what you want/need.

wia9SXCPaa	I don't see the problem if they are legally separated.  I personally would not want to get involved with a man that doesn't have the divorce papers in hand because it just gets too complicated.<br>  <br>  If you aren't afraid to get you heart broken and some headache from his wife then feel free.

If he split with her a month or two ago, then I'd say it's too big of a risk for you and he's either rebounding or looking for someone to take care of him.  If they've been separated for awhile (like a year), then I'd say the risk of him running back to her are slim to none.  <br>  <br>  The divorce process can be very expensive and very lengthy.  I know people who are "legally separated" and moving on with their lives and have been stuck in a quagmire of a divorce for 3 years or more.  I know people that have been separated and only legally divorce years later because they want to remarry.  It doesn't mean they've been cheating on their wife for 10 years, they just never finalized the divorce.<br>  <br>  If the guy is over his ex, moved on with his life, and intends to finalize a divorce, there's nothing wrong with it - provided that is what he is truly doing.  <br>  <br>  And that's speaking from experience.  My bf has been "legally separated" for nearly 2 years and is in the process of finalizing his divorce now (we dated casually for about 6 months and have been together for over a year).  His ex is dating and they have their custody and child support arrangements already finalized in the court.  <br>  <br>  This doesn't mean he's "cheating" on his wife because we're together!  You have to be in a relationship with someone to cheat on them.  But if you are seeing someone and do intend to get married, he's going to have to finalize that divorce decree beforehand.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	First of all, see them for who and what they are: needy and vulnerable. By all means give them support and companionship and affection, but recognize that anything further or deeper is a huge risk for both of you. They can’t know which end is up, and at least for a while, everything they do gets filtered through the lens of need, not through health and love. You may enjoy the adoration of temporarily rescuing someone from their pain, and they can be incredibly honest and fun as they explore creating a new independent identity. But don’t mistake that for who they will eventually turn out to be, because they are on a journey of transformation that may or may not include you. Neither of you know who they will be at the other end. Be kind, compassionate and wise enough to give them what they REALLY need, which is usually a true friend, not a lover. And if it should turn out that the two of you really do have a genuine romantic connection, there will plenty of time to explore that in the future. Don’t rob your future relationship of the loving possibilities it may have by prematurely romanticizing your friendship.<br>  In fact 4 out of 5 people who remarry within a year of their divorce end up getting divorced again! So take it slow, heal, feel your feelings and learn from the lessons of your past choices and decisions. In that way when the sun shines again for you, it will be genuine and warm, and you stand a much better chance of creating the love that can last a lifetime, if that’s what your heart truly desires. And if you decide not to partner again, you will have created a meaningful, multi-dimensional and fulfilling life to live.|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Yeah, if he is legally separated... then there is nothing wrong with it. Just make sure that he is actually separated, and not just saying that.|`|LiGWTLpSaa	No.<br>  <br>  Don't date him until he gets the divorced finalized.<br>  <br>  If he really wants to end it with his wife, he would do that.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	If she wants to commit adultery, then yes.|`|RSbn5STjaa	No.  Wait till he's divorced.|`|AA11601031	No.  If you do, sew a red A on your dress.|`|pWneH9yFaa	yeah.. y not.. u can|`|hCJ66msnaa	well there are alot of things to consider in this situation. how long has he been seperated and is it really a legal seperation filed thru the courts or something they just both agreed to. if it is a legal seperation who wanted the seperation him or her? if she is the one that wanted it he may still have unresolved feelings for her in which case he will not give him self comepletely to you which wont be fair to you. if the seperation was his idea than he is probably over her and doesnt stil have feelings for her and if the seperation is legal thru the courts and they've been seperated for over 6 months than id say go for it. it is not cheating even though they are still legally married they arent together there seperated which means they are not obligated to each other in anyway just take it slow and dont push things good luck|`|djUMvICoaa	There's nothing that says you can't but I would think it wiser not to, he may be looking for someone to replace what he is missing and in that case any warm body would do.|`|jxeQWLpWaa	whats legally separated? divorced? if yes then why not? if legally separated means anything else then i guess not...it's just too much headache! don't you think?|`|vXqgje5Taa	NO  I am in a situation like that and have been for three years.Wait until everything is finalized.For your own piece of mind.Believe me.<br>  Good Luck|`|EFg1JG40aa	depends on how long there where seperated im seperated from my wife and have a wounderful girlfriend ive been seperated for 11 years though|`|367a9c4726a4920faa50d01d1c6bba11aa	Yes, he is separated so what the big deal?, If he was married that's what they call getting the milk without buying the cow.|`|55c6bcdec944656754c033c36667ba6baa	Why not? If he and his wife made an agreement that their going to see other people then its fine.

And that the man is honest to both women.|`|2G1vkdTzaa	nope because legally they are still married....|`|PWN5rqgxaa	no make him get the divorce finalzied... otherwise hes just playing around|`|PgSmcsLDaa	Of course why not?

0HUHHzIQaa	Doesn't matter if she lives with her parents -- THEY didn't make this child. HE did. HE has to provide for the child wether he likes it or not.<br>  If HE takes her for visitation, HE WILL have to pay the 17%. Doesn't matter where she lives, or if you guys want to have children of your own, his first obligation is STILL his first child. So if you can't afford another child because of HIS child support, don't have a child, it's simple. Just because you guys want "your family" doesn't erase the first child. <br>  <br>  There is nothing you can do. Don't date a man with "baggage" if you can't handle the baggage and all it entails.|`|FR1SoLteaa	The couts favor women, some free advice, as much as I hate it, leave him. <br>  <br>  He is in a lose lose situation.

It was a very costly endevour for me<br>  <br>  I would strongly advise you make an agreement with him FIRST before you go serving any papers or speaking to a solicitor, because if your husband does contest, it could go on for ever and cost you a fortune<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  x|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	No - in the UK these days the only grounds for divorce is irretrievable breakdown. If you have been separated for two years you can divorce by mutual consent. If either party does not agree then the separation needs to have been for 5 years to divorce without the consent of the other party.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	yes, you can.  Because it does meet the definition of adultery.<br>  <br>  And in response to music_lovin_miss, had you brought any form of proof of his affair to your divorce lawyer, it would have been a lot easier for you to get a divorce on grounds of adultery.|`|AA11449906	If you can cite the date of your separation (with some evidence to support it) you can enter a petition for divorce on the basis of an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage - the minimum two years can then be calculated from the date of your separation rather than the date you seek a divorce.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	You must contact your solicitor, but I believe this is a slippery slope, and what happens when you are separated is still considered marriage in the UK.|`|dJoE8yedaa	Yes, Definitely.
yd2SP7d6aa	I enjoy variety, so while I enjoy the position I can't say it's my preferred position.  The advantage is that you are looking at your wife, you get to admire her beauty more and your hands are free to explore (unlike in the standard missionary position your arms are generally supporting you  and if you are taller than your wife your head isn't in a good position to really view her).  <br>  <br>  The disadvantage (IMO) is that I can have trouble climaxing in the position. It's one thing for it to last longer (got no issues with that) but sometimes I need to flip her back to the missionary position (or doggie) for a good pounding to finish up.  Now talk about to much info...<br>  <br>  Edit:  The woman on top position can also be a nice change-up as the woman takes more of an interest in the love-making session (more dominate for her).  As a guy, I've got no issues generally taking on the more dominate role in sex (missionary, doggie etc.) but I definately like to see my wife get into it.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	i love it. well i like to move around a lot trying different things all the time. but i love ti when girls are on top it gives me time to relax and catch a breather. lol. besides i know that it does stimulate the clit more so i like it even more. i guess it depends on the guy, but the one thing that turns me on even more is when i know that my girl is getting the best pleasure possible. <br>  if you are happy with it why should you stop, but that doesn't mean stop trying out different positions.|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	yeah i like it like that and it also helps the guy *** less often that what he would have been able to when he is on top, so the sex last longer|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	I have never met a man who didn't like it!<br>  <br>  I like it too!<br>  <br>  Although I do have a hard time hitting the right spot.  Can you give me some pointers on that one?|`|PIQeh6kCaa	On top, underneath, from behind, orally, or hanging off the chandelier, it's all good!

Keep it exciting. Standing, the shower, table, and etc etc.<br>  Love is a beautiful thing, it not sex if you love someone. Pleasure each other other ways too. Enjoy it and hope that's mature enough.|`|wia9SXCPaa	KJ is right, it totally depends on the woman.  I am 5' 10" and 160 pounds so it isn't quite a pleasurable for my husband.  He knows I enjoy that position for the same reasons you stated so we compromise.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think it's great with her on top she gets to go to those little areas that I can miss and while she's there it's great to watch her body and I love to play with her nipples which helps even more she says.|`|ZQE61wUZaa	i don't prefer it, its ok but not my favorite, but my guy loves it, so i do it for him|`|tdulyzXXaa	See the song "Laid" by James.|`|88bDvyiwaa	Depends on the woman.

Unfortunately for me, though, my wife prefers me on top, so I don't get her on top as much of the time as I would like.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I agree with you Susan.  It is very enjoyable when my wife is on top and that allows her to time her orgasm with mine.  It allows me the opportunity to squeeze her breast and look into her eyes.  It is one of our favorite positions.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I like it but then again, I like a number of positions.  I prefer to change it up.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	My husband is a big fan of that position!

h5ghD3Zxaa	Well this is a different way of going about getting friends. Like the previous answers, I think that building a friendship with people outside the cyber-world is healthier for you. What if you meet someone on here that you want to meet but cannot because of distance? That would only make you feel worse than you say that you did when you posted this question. I do, however, admire your way of putting yourself out there in order to increase your social network. It is good to make friends from different parts of the world because you can learn many different things about them. Plus, it is always good to have someone new to talk to. <br>  <br>  its_the_iceman@live.com|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Haha, if you don't mind talking to an Aussie, I'd love to talk to someone new...

If not, please do so; she cannot read your mind.|`|TZ1Z2nhhaa	Real Guys lead from the front tnx|`|Ll1wL5rPaa	There is always something that can be done about it. Talk to her and let her know how you feel. Honesty is the best policy. Some girls just expect the guys to make the plans all the time. Sit her down and let her know that it is pushing you away. But if you really do love her then this isn't that big of a deal in the scope of things. However, it looks that you have already given up by saying there is not much you can do about it. If you sit her down and talk to her and she does care enough then she will change. If she doesn't care to change then she does not have as much invested into the relationship as you think.|`|UmzoM1uhaa	Talk to her about it. She may not even realize what she's doing (or not doing). The only way a relationship will work is with communication (among a few other things), but communication is so vital. If you have a problem with her she needs to know about it because she may not realize what she's doing and she certainly isn't going to know how it makes you feel and that you have a problem if she doesn't hear it from you. And if she loves you she will make some adjustments for you. And as for that habit of hers, is she lax or lazy in her daily routine and in other aspects where she has responsibility? This could be a sign of laziness if it persists in other aspects of her life also. Are you starting to see a trend? If not, she may just be busy or have a lot on her mind or who knows what. But the only way you will know is by talking to her about it. And pay attention to her attitude when you do bring it up. And if it's a habit that honestly bothers you, you need to let her know and think about whether you want to accept it because you love her, or move on because you can't accept it. It's a small thing that is very resolvable with a little talk, and if you love her and honestly do want to be with her no matter what, sometimes you have to just accept her little quirks. Good luck!|`|7DSuEjUOaa	I am here to save the day my friend. I too have been in the same situation, but I have resolved the problem. The best thing to do or what i found to do. Sit down with her and ask her. Why does it seem that I am the one always trying to make it where we see each other? Something along this line... I asked my fiance this question and she replied with I am very busy with work and school. So I simply explained that when she does pointless things instead of being with me that's time that we could have spent together. Now if she likes to see you and whatever but the problem is she doesn't like to try and make it happen. Then the best thing to do is let her know. She can't fix what she doesn't know is bothering you. If you bring it up and she gets defensive make her feel special and be kind. Say you just feel this way because of what ever reason it is you have. If you talk to her and are polite. The situation should be resolved and you will notice she begins to make plans. HOWEVER there is a flipside. You on the other hand need to make sure there isn't a reason that she has depended on you to make the plans. Maybe she has made a plan before and it didn't go well. Maybe you didn't have a good time. Or she feels this way about a specific time. Let me know some more and i'll try to assist you in the best way I can.|`|hK5ywg5iaa	Maybe you should try talking to her about it... Ask her what she wants to do, or when she wants to meet up. For example, when you're going out to dinner, ask her where she wants to eat. And if she says she's okay with anything, give her options and let her choose--baby steps. <br>  <br>  It's possible she's just traditional and she doesn't want you to think that she's being too aggressive... :)<br>  <br>  Good luck with that. <br>  <br>  P.S. <br>  If you really love each other, it shouldn't be too hard to talk to her, yeah? ;)|`|48huGW59aa	Do this one thing more and go to her and tell her how you feel and try helping her to make progress in the relationships.  Maybe she is just shy or struggling to get through to you in her kind of way.  All advice i can give you.  Good luck|`|ipsr1SARaa	talk to her about it, who knows she may think that you like making all the plans, ae you sure that she is still into you? That could be the reason that shes not making any plans ie shes kinda drifting away?|`|Ls2lsXo2aa	Suggest taking a "break" and if you really love each other you will get things back the way they once were and if not then you probably weren't supposed to be with her anyway.. it sucks but its reality <br>  Good luck!
cqTOkJSbaa	You are absolutely right to feel this way. Pornography is not ok. It tears relationships apart. I view it just like cheating. So what if it's mental?

Since this is causing you so much distress, and since it is obviously affecting your relationship, this is going to become a serious issue for you both. This isn't about porn, this is about how it makes you feel as a young mother and his wife.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drphil.com/articles/article/54" rel="nofollow">http://www.drphil.com/articles/article/5...</a>|`|iblT1HJpaa	So, do you think that sex is the deal? <br>  No. Because he can have it with you - whenever. <br>  This is the destruction of pornography. Men are made to be visual animals. They take snapshots of everything for use later on. When with you - he's thinking of "them". This is why soft porn is so destructive in a relationship. (WOMEN!!!! Do not allow this!) <br>  He is trying to find affirmation for himself as a man because you don't do it anymore. Even though he seems to be doing all the destruction - you have had your share in this. I'm not saying it's your fault. He's the one that is trying to solve his problem and this is how he's doing it. Of course, it won't work and you are seeing the curse of that situation. <br>  We have a society that says that adultery is bad - porn is ok. It doesn't hurt anybody. Now you know the truth. <br>  Check out your local churches for a men's purity group. Get him into it. Like AA, if he says he doesn't have a problem and won't go - file for a divorce. He does not have you and the baby in mind - only himself. ANd the trouble with porn like all addictions - it will only escalate. Look at the pain you are already in. Want to give it another year or 5? <br>  Time to get rid of the computer. OUT! Do you keep drugs in the house with an addict. Do you give booze to an alcoholic? Get rid of the porn - NOW! OUT! Get a friend to come over and disconnect the thing and take it out. Get rid of the internet so he cannot do this at your house. If you NEED it - Sorry. What do you want to do to support him? Time to set the boundary and you HAVE to do it. <br>  Again, this has nothing to do with you.

QI9zF9Xqaa	honestly yeah some of them and some as a family or friend's but who ever i liked i didn't even know they were my cousin's at later on when we to the weddings or party's, family get together then we found out we were cousin's i mean i am cute and good looking but even though when i knew that some of the cousin's did ask me out <br>  <br>  and i said NO are you kidding me were cousin's and she said one kiss no one will find out and i said still  NO WAY <br>  <br>  i mean come on their almost like your sister how can you do that|`|Ai1uZU3Jaa	wow. im surprised at how narrow minded people can be.<br>  no ive never liked my cousin and i can see how in some cultures it might be frowned upon (however in some cultures its normal)...but genetically, you're distant enough for it to not really be "incest". and cousins have healthy children all the time which kinda prove the point.<br>  <br>  i read some story in a magazine once about cousins who fell in love (but i think at first they didnt know they were related)...but still. i once read a book about 2 cousins that fell in love and it was AMAZING. dont ask me what it was called though, i forgot lol. <br>  <br>  mind u, i think ull get over it eventually, so u shouldnt worry much about it. but while it lasts, just enjoy it and screw what people think lol its not like ur gonna marry him/her.<br>  <br>  oh and u can be like "did u know charles darwin was in love with his cousin?" haha. fact.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	I'm assuming this has nothing to do with incest, because it is in the Friends section.<br>  <br>  Cousins on my mother's side are the most conniving, sly, catty, people ever.<br>  Cousins on my father's side are more down to earth, approachable and generally sweet and friendly.|`|txUhl3MVaa	I think you need to specify in the word "LIKE" . In general I like all of my cousins.  In other cases. when I was young I thought one of my cousins was so handsome and my grandma told me he was my cousin.  Glad I was yound when i found that out.|`|IS4ND9Sjaa	Hell No....That's not good......Yes some of my cousins are good looking but that's it and they are family....i guess you like who you like but really make sure your family tree branches out a lot....and does not go straight up and down.....|`|I5gjOrEzaa	what on the earth can drive a person so crazzy to like a cousin in the sense what you mean???|`|jVFsl9FBaa	No, because that's incest...|`|ReaD6u4paa	yes....i kissed her once...but nothing more...we were both 13|`|0PVOkUtcaa	that is so wierd and pple r not like animals that cant control their feelings.i have a nephew who likes me n i always tell him it wud never work in this lifetime.so.. pliz,find other fantasies that are worth your time.(you only get one life to live)dont mess that up.|`|FE8BFi0Daa	Whatever anyone will tell you ..<br>  Its perfectly normal to crush on your cousin<br>  But - ofcourse nothing can happen<br>  Its not really healthy - people will judge but ignore them|`|AA10902531	long back yes.. my cousin had asked me out and later i dumped him.. then another cousin was interestd n i dumped him aswel.. so cousins can never be good guys..<br>  :D|`|ks2oieV0aa	I like all my cousins, if you mean Like Like.

Whoever said you need to choose one person over another? Won't life be much more rich and enjoyable if you have more than one best friend, more than one person to invite to yours or whatever. It'll be far more fun if everyone hangs out together. I have two best friends, a girl and a boy, and we all go out together and have a brilliant time together.<br>  You don't need to choose.|`|2qgIXb7Zaa	The boy.<br>  Well, you asked.|`|Zd1NnRYbaa	boy.

Just do as you feel and go with what makes you happy.|`|7twY5OIuaa	It's culture shock, this may be a new thing for you and it is perfectly natural. Just talk to a few women and some light dating unless it is really socially repressive in dubai, I know that arranged marriages are big over there so you may be in world of hurt if you cross the cultural norms but otherwise get some cultural familiarity with your new home and balance out your feelings with time, you'll be okay just don't start something you can't finish.|`|nGkCYhfiaa	You can't control who you're attracted to and I don't think there's a problem with this.

Keep her as just a friend, but nothing more, that way what ever she does wont bother you as bad. Find another BFF that will truly be your friend and not stab you in the back like this girl did.

o0JOTzj0aa	Oh grow up!  Learn to spell and use grammar!  If they're pushing you out of their little group then explain to them that you feel sidelined and as you don't want to intrude any longer, you're just going to leave them to it.  Don't accuse them of leaving you out, just tell them how YOU feel...not what THEY DO.  That way, they can't disagree with you, because they're your feelings and they can't be denied.  Tell them you don't feel welcome in their group anymore, and then just forget them, find some new mates and leave them to carry on with their childish behaviour.  The only thing you'll lose from your life by not being mates with them is all the aggro they cause you.|`|TApVoMdAaa	I'm a ninja turtle <----|`|9K8Zksfwaa	youre both wrong. just drop the f.r.i.g.g.i.n jump rope fight ****. youre acting like three year olds.|`|T7ktkYc8aa	2 wrongs don't make a right. just b/c they were being butt holes didn't mean you had to be one too. you guys need to communicate, that's what real friends do when they have problems.|`|n9y5ydnVaa	Well, something like that happend to me in 6th grade... well they obvioulsy aren't good friends so I would make new ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OAYaeW22aa	you were right to say **** off|`|0qspJSt9aa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|CKcfPQPQaa	first of all the ninja turtles man dats so fuckin lame and second wat grade are you guys in really this is some elementary type shyt man get a life get some new friends and change that ninja turtle shyt|`|VJ50g6pfaa	tawk to them clearly...why do they ignore you...n i can feel the feeling to b ignored...u dnt worry..u start ignoring them...|`|AA11682594	good grief yerbutnobutyerbutnobut get a life|`|Lmyz21s4aa	everyone is right. ur frends r expressing who they really are by ditching u.<br>  amberly is expressing that she's two faced.<br>  <br>  if that's who u wanna hang with, ok, its fine. friends can be real dic.k.s. <br>  <br>  really just take a second to think about what you do when you hang around them. i was in 6th grade 3 years ago, and looking back, i was an annoying ASSHOLE. i was nice, but i thought i was funny when i really wasnt. my frends just chuckled to make me feel better, but i kept going on and on.<br>  <br>  ur frends wont see it ur way if u dont explain y ur mad. they might not even understand then, but ur fine.<br>  <br>  THIS IS NOT DRAMA. u'll see drama in highskool.
Lfc9Zav2aa	Not trying to be a jerk but could it be a lust look?
pVnUhYLQaa	Absolutely! If you believe you'll be together forever, why not just BE together for a while?  I would say you should wait until your mid 20's. No sooner than 24. Live a little, get a little older and wiser. If He's not going anywhere, then he's not going anywhere. What's the rush?<br>  <br>  EDIT: The fact that you are asking says that YOU are not sure. That YOU think you may be too young. That says a whole lot more than what any opinion from a stranger does.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	Nope!  I got married at 17, so did 2 of my other friends.  Another friend got married at 19, and another is about to get married and she is also 19.  If you're mature, ready, and in love then go for it!  Another important part of it for me was that my parents agreed.  Because I was so young, we got to know eachother the old fashioned way.  My husband and dad talked to eachother often on the phone, and we weren't allowed to go anywhere by ourselves.  My husband also asked my dad if he could marry me.  It was really neat to have my parents so involved.|`|qexKY00naa	NO way! Age is simply a number! If you feel that you are ready to get married and you know in your heart that this is the person you want to wake up to every morning and choose to love then why not. I would have gotten married when I was your age if had not been for my dependency on my parents through college.<br>  <br>  If you two can be financially independent then more power to you! Plus you have his age on your side, meaning that he probably has things under control<br>  <br>  Congratulations and best of luck to you!|`|zSABr7praa	I was engaged at 18 and married at 20.  My husband is three and a half years older than I am. We started dating when I was a freshman and he was a senior.. no one was shocked or surprised.  The only thing my parents were upset about was that I didn't get my bachelors before we got married, just my associates.. We got pregnant right away, so now it looks like I won't be going back to finish for a year or so, so I would recommend finishing school before you get married, but that certainly isn't too you.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	No, I don't think you'll be too young to get married. In the news the other day, a 9 year old got married ... she had cancer. <br>  But get married for love and commitment rather than convenience, age, money, children, etc. You only get married once ... pick the right person.|`|hoBREUGLaa	There's no such thing as a age that is too young to get married, as long as your ready to take the commitment.|`|cCymTwdcaa	There is no ideal age for any life experience, as calendar age is not as indicative as developmental age. A 18 year old might be ready for what a 40 year old never will be, and vice versa. If you feel that you truly love him--not the doe-eyed type, but the deep, "I love you as much at your worst as I do at your best" kind of love--are friends, have good paying jobs, a place to live or a solid plan for a place to live, transportation, education, etc then you are as ready as anyone can ever be. The fact you ask this question makes me wonder though, if you were certain, you wouldn't care what anyone else had to say, or perhaps your question stems not from doubt but the negative societal view young brides have to contend with. In any case, that is something you will have to sort out for yourself.<br>  By the time of our September wedding, I will have known my fiance' six years, been friends for five years, been together nearly four years, and engaged for nearly two, so it came as no surprise that we got engaged young. I was 18, and he was 22 at the time. When we marry this fall, I will be 20 and he will be almost 24. We have been through the best of times, and the worst of times, yet stand by each other. There are times where I love him, but am running low on like, but I still stand by him, because I know he is the one for me, and what we share is worth the occasional trouble. Just remember the old saying "If you can't handle them at their worst, you don't deserve them at their best." That goes for him as well as you. If in the end yo don't feel ready, tell him, and if he truly loves you, he'll stand by you.|`|QmvYGkNJaa	I am 4 years younger than my fiance. He is 28 and I am 24. We are getting married in July. We've been together for 8 years; since I was 16. <br>  <br>  I think as long as you know you want to be with that person, and you love them, and they love you, then do what you like. But I also think it's better to experience life before settling down. We got engaged when I was 20, and I told him I didn't want to get married until I was at least 23, because I didn't feel ready. Now we've been together so long, I know he's the one for me. <br>  <br>  But hey, as long as you're both sure, then who are we to judge?|`|owpQPYGPaa	Long as you really love each other then i reall dont think there is an age that is too young but i would wait until at least my early to mid twenties and make sure you know exactly what your getting into. my outlook is to date for at least 1-2 years before proposing and then be engaged for at least the same amount of time that way we both know for sure thats what we want. But like i said thats just me everyone is different you just have to go with what feels right for you and not worry about other ppls opinions.|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Nope,your not to young.That is the age i was when i had my 1st baby I been with my husband for 23yrs come july.We have 4 kids now ages 23,22,20&17.Time sure flies and we are still happily married.|`|SXRa4p8Vaa	15-16yrs old is too young to marry so don`t you worry but before doing so think twice cause marriage is suppose to be forever together.|`|AA12382198	.Remember you asked.....<br>  <br>  My personal opinion.......the bride about 27....the groom about 29<br>  <br>  You are way too young.....live a little first.|`|deAyKj2Uaa	no, i got married when i was 20. been together for years.|`|nrt7Bfnqaa	im 20 and am getting married in june 2009 and my fiance is 23 i don't think its too young|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	It concerns me that you are asking this question. It seems to be that you are thinking that you are too young to be married. My personal age I think people should wait to be married is 25. At this age you have lived and experienced a lot more than you would expect from 20-25. Yes it's still very young and there is always more to learn, but you have a better idea of who you are and what you want out of life and what your career goals are. If you love this man, there is no reason not to wait another year or two. Nothing wrong with a long engagement.|`|hizRPh9raa	No offense, but yes...I do. Your fiance has gotten to experience so much more than you. You may end up looking back and regretting not experiencing more time as a single woman. I've been excited about my future wedding for as long as I can remember. But I'm engaged now and I purposely set the wedding date back so we'd be engaged for over a year and a half by the time we actually have the wedding. I'll be 25 when I get married. I got to go through college single and I feel like I didn't miss out on anything. If I got married at 20, I know I would've missed out on a lot. I just met my now-fiance at age 20. Just be careful, and be sure. This is huge! And if you want to wait some more, there's no rush. If he loves you, he'll be there in a couple more years. I would at the very least say wait until after college. if you're not in college, wait until you're 22. So much is going to happen in the next few years...so much growing (mentally, emotionally). I just think you could wait some more.|`|Yb8rJoPJaa	I think as long as you are out of high school and financially stable enough to get married then you should marry the person you love. I hate when people put an age on it. <br>  My grandparents got married at 18 and are still together.<br>  My mom and dad were 20 and 19 respectively when they got married and are still together.<br>  I got engaged at 20 and will be married by 22. <br>  <br>  It all depends on you. Not what other people think. !|`|AA11509996	i dont think in your case the question is if you are too young but rather are you ready or not to get married.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you have some doubts if you have to come on YA! and ask.<br>  <br>  Speak to your fiance about any worries or concerns you might have before the wedding day comes.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have both spoken about crucial issues that might arise.

2fjMrGNFaa	Consult with a lawyer about your husband being a us citizen and you being a german citizen and also if you both just wait 5 years by german law would you automatically be divorced. Has your husband been in the us longer than you? Why have you not became a us citizen? Also ask the lawyer would it be better for you to remain a german citizen because you don't want a divorce anyway.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Where do you live now?  That is where you would get divorced.  If you are still in Germany, call a law office and ask.  If you're military, get in touch with a chaplain.|`|djUMvICoaa	I have never heard of such a law.  If you want to dissolve the marriage you have to go through the court system.  He sounds like he wants he cake and to eat it too.  If you want out call a lawyer.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	No such law in the U.S.  You need to complete a legal procedure and get the signature of a judge to dissolve a marriage in the U.S.  <br>  <br>  Waiting 5 years would result in you still being married 5 years later. Start the paper work if you want a divorce.|`|O6utfwshaa	I have no clue.  I would suggest to contact a preist/chaplin of where you are living now.|`|b1K0Z9yNaa	Where are you living now?

01kEv36Faa	Your situation has to be very difficult.  Being practical, as long as he is not abusive, it is easier to have a spouse if he is supporting you and the child.  Maybe he is scared with the responsibility of the baby.  Try talking to each other and not screaming at each other.  Suggest marriage counseling.  You have to work at marriage sometimes.  But if this fails, and he walks out on you, don't consider it a big loss.  This guys a waste of breathing space whether you love him or not.  Just make sure he pays his share of supporting his child.  Meantime build up your own support network, of family and friends.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You are so much better off without him, he has proven twice that he is incapable of facing up to whatever the issues are like a responsible caring loving adult and you need to take him to court and divorce him and take him for everything he's got, how dare he do that to you esp NOW.|`|bO2rzfISaa	If you're married to a runner, he will always be one. He will run every time things get too hard for him. You will never be able to count on him. All the things you say you want in your posting, you have no way of making him do, because he's gone. He will not be supportive later in life. I know you're really vulnerable right now, and if he reappears to help you, you will let him. When you're back on your feet after the baby comes, keep in mind that he will run again, just when you need him most. Get a job and be independent, even if you don't leave him. You are really on your own here. I'm sorry.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Why are you fighting? Stop! It takes 2 to fight. If you don't start them or you don't respond when he starts then fights do not happen. Call him and ask him to come home and tell him you love him and need him. His unborn baby needs him. He seems very immature to walk out on you at 9 months. Maybe he is not ready to be a dad and was looking for an excuse to leave.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Do only one thing........left your ego and say sorry to him and tell his value in your whole life !! He will definitely come with you !!|`|sowS7KW2aa	first be strong to face this kind of life , if he really dont want any more then let him go , care your child , stand alone is not easy but because this is the cross that u will carry then carry on, God is beside you, for let us pray for all of us , take care  u can make it|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Fighting for your marriage is a good thing and don't let anyone tell you differently.  With saying that, your concerns are definately valid.  Dealing with the emotional aspect of a troubled marriage is difficult enough with-out being pregnant (hormones etc.) but you do need to try to approach your husband in a calm / logical manner and discuss your marriage.  <br>  <br>  First and foremost, you need reassurances from him that he is in this marriage (he wants to be married) and that he wants to be apart of his childs life.  Second, you both need to learn how to handle stress / disagreements in a much different fashion that is currently leading to your fights .  It's not a good thing that he leaves but it doesn't sound like YOU are fighting fair (in arguements) either. Those aren't healthy for a marriage.  Try counseling, either through Pastor / Priest or a therapist if need be.<br>  <br>  If your husband is unable or unwilling to give you these reassurances or doesn't seem interested in working at the marriage than yes you may need to separate / divorce|`|CYcqQb6Caa	i agree with the other two i think that you should learn to live without him no matter how hard it is he will always run when times get rough and he has shown you this twice. it may get hard but you will be better off on your own and so will your kids.|`|6cd66b36887ecbb069f11e405495a56baa	As hard as it is you need to walk away emotionally from him now.  You can do this without him!  You don't need to always wonder what will push him out the door the next time.  Good luck!|`|FzFSzilmaa	you should have thought about the consequences of your actions before the "verbal assaults" started...|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I can't imagine what a selfish prick your husband must be but to walk out on his VERY pregnant wife this close to the baby's arrival is appalling! You are exactly right if he will walk out now, what would ho do if God forbid you got gravely ill or in an accident- and needed someone to take care of you and feed you change you etc.. He would certainly not be reliable then, that's a scary thought. Try to become as independent from him as possible and maybe you will come to realize that you can do this without him!|`|O8TA4tMGaa	My biggest piece of advice to you is something Maya Angelou once said, "When someone shows you who they are, BELIEVE THEM!"<br>  <br>  I was married to a man for 10 years who was physically present but never emotionally available and, in the beginning, I thought that once the finances got better, things would change; he would change.  The truth is he wasn't available for the journey and, no matter what changed about the finances, he never did.  <br>  <br>  Know that you are only responsible for changing yourself.  You cannot change him and if he ran away from the issues of your marriage once and now he's doing it again, what happens the next time things get tough?  Times change and they will alter.  That's what life's about and you need someone who's going to be there for better, for worse.<br>  <br>  I believe in taking those vows seriously too but I also believe in loving yourself enough to teach people how to treat you.  Do you really want your child to grow up seeing a relationship where his/her mother is left by his/her father every time things get rough?<br>  <br>  You deserve better than this.  If he comes back of his own accord and is willing to change, there's opportunity there but you trying to make him come back or begging or pleading for him to return out of sympathy for you and the baby is not the way to go.  He may physically come back but he'll leave again, spiritually, mentally or physically.<br>  <br>  You deserve better.  I know things seem rough right now but if you never settle for less than you deserve, you'll always get the best.  Trust that...|`|RLoilwCNaa	That sucks, but you'll be fine. You can't make him stay and I'll tell you what, it won't get easier, only harder, when the child comes. The first few years are really stressfull. If he can't handle you two fighting now then what's going to happen when money is REALLY tight and the kids are crying and everything seems to be going wrong, which by the way WILL happen. You need a guy that understands that woman go through this kind of stuff and sometimes you just have to put up with it. I really hope it works out for you and your husband, but don't think that this is the end of the world. It may just be the beginning of a better life. I know that's hard to hear right now. Good luck.|`|ovaRPeBYaa	I trully think you have answered your own question here! when you got married you said your vow's under gods eyes correct! well it seems he was not thinking with the right head! wow... shame on him... this is very common for a guy to bail when the heats on! don't allow this guy to see the child or any information on him except for child support and you need to get that cause raising a child in todays world is rougher than when i help raise a child!!!!!!   th way i see things shame on me the first time ! shame on you the second!!!!   CALL STEVE WILCOS|`|rITfmgksaa	the fighting may have been induced by both your hormones and money issues.Lord knows many a couple have fought over the later of the two.<br>   But no man would ever leave a woman while shes pregnant or sick. Only little boys Run while men face up to what life hands them<br>   I Say be happy you found out now while your still young. Go out and find a man and leave the boys to grow up.|`|4KzNasrvaa	He actually walked out on his 9 month pregnant wife?<br>  <br>  All I can say is WOW. Youre correct, if hes running away now, he will continue to run away in the future.<br>  <br>  Learn to live your life without him because you dont need to babysit your baby along with a grown man as well.|`|72MtoWxRaa	My husband left me when my daughter was 6 weeks old. He said that we were not spending enough time together and that my time was all taken by the baby and he is tired of sleepign at night by himself because I was always up with her. Eventually, we worked it out because we were seperated for so long that he realized what he had and what he left. Our daughter is now 8 months old and we are back together and things are ok. The key is communication. Not fighting over what is insignificant because regardless, your always gfoing to fight, its how you handle the fight that counts. That you work through it. If he was so immature to just leave, then what is there for you to be confused about?  When my hsuband did it, I said good ridence and I can do this on my own and I did.  He just recently moved back so I was on my own, unemployed in this horrible economy with an infant buying formula, diapers, etc and i did it. Your a mom now, you will always find a way...|`|hCJ66msnaa	hmm well that is appalling and WOW! if he would walk out on you in a time like this that doesnt say much about him sorry but if he has done it before he will do it again it doesnt sound as though he took the vows as serious as you did it says right in them for better or WORSE! apparently he only wants to be around for the better and seems to want to run when it comes to the WORSE. that is not a man you can depend on. it will be hard and believe me i know im a single woman with 4 kids and its a struggle everyday but somehow i always get thru it. and so will you. you deserve a man who will take things a little more seriously and be willing to work things out not just up and run for the hills when things get tough. i hope you have alot of family and friends to give you support cuz that will help you unfortunately i dont have either so its even tougher for me i know you want him to be there for you but it doesnt seem like he ever will. but even though your not going to be together you could be the bigger person and give him the option to still be there in the delivery room when you have the baby it is a beautiful thing that he has only one opportunity to see and if he denys now he wont get that opportunity back and his answer may give you more insight into what you should do. if he doesnt even want to be there for the once in a lifetime experience of the birth of his child he is definately not the man you may have initially thought and you definately need to move on with your life without  him good luck hope this helps
kynzqmWgaa	Just say, " I like you"...I'm sure she'll say she like you if she is as you described|`|u7Y1SAViaa	Ask her out. You guys might fall in love!|`|9MgHKyb5aa	Ask her out! She will definitly say yes! I texted and talked with my current bf every single day as friends before he asked me out and its going really great! If she knows you like her and is not uncomfortable around you i know she will say yes. Hope this helps and good luck! Don't be nervous! :-D|`|gNaGdJzzaa	well ask her.sometimes it may sound like she likes you but maybe she doesnt...who knows?just ask her and you will get your answer..dont go insane if you get rejected just deal with it she wont be the only girl in this world.theres PLENTY...|`|XGp3oF5baa	Just tell her how you feel. As a girl it is so much better when guys are blunt and honest. Don't expect her to know what you are thinking. If she lets you down it will be ok. You have plenty of time to find other people if it doesn't work out. But she does sound like she likes you. If she didn't she wouldn't be spending as much time with you. <br>  <br>  Girls like guys who are straight forward and honest.<br>  <br>  My husband always told me that when he was in his dating spell the one thing he always told himself was if a girl don't want you, you sure as heck don't want her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, hope it helps.
FpClPD9Uaa	Try to Contact Bill Gates, Warren Buffet or Oprah Winfrey. The economy is hard on everybody and dont be disappointed if you dont get any donation from the Masses, ask the well to do and Rich Kids...Good Luck|`|GkK44x4Raa	I don't know where you live or what is popular in your area, so I can only speak about what is popular around here.  One thing many people do is go to local restaurants, convenience stores etc and set out jars at the cashier's station where people can donate their pocket change.   They usually tape a picture to the jar of the person the money is being raised for and write a short story about why the money is needed.  I know pocket change doesn't sound like alot but if you could get jars in, say, thirty locations and collect 10 or 20 dollars over a month's time at each location, that's going to add up.
JP2SfYnfaa	It could be that he just wanted to sleep alone. I have a hard time sleep all the way through the night when I share a bed with someone. Maybe he just wanted you both to get some rest. Just don't worry about, I am sure it means nothing. Guys aren't big on hidden meanings or anything like that. He most likely just wants to sleep.|`|AA11547559	he just used you for is own satisfaction,and he didn't need you anymore.

Good Luck :)|`|AA12302228	he may have put you on a pedastal<br>  he might not want to put your friendship in jeopardy<br>  it could be love|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you are way to insecure about a guy who you say is just a friend with benefits! he probably does like to sleep alone and if you want a relationship that you can sleep together not just se4x get a boyfriend|`|YhjFiVGyaa	maybe he is starting to treat u like the total booty call u are allowing urself to be. i mean come on, u have to drive 2 hours just to get a piece of a**?|`|DiaXZSwEaa	maybe he just wasnt in the mood and he just wanted u there to have fun and hang out just cuz a guy invites u over doesnt mean he wants sex|`|NgawN7Pcaa	thats weird .<br>  ask him why .|`|u7Y1SAViaa	He is weird... wow.|`|A7QROnjLaa	Maybe he can't get a good sleep if someone else is in his bed disturbing him, I don't mean like sexually, just if he has a particular way he has to sleep which is comfortable to him.

WyCmQBuvaa	I don't know why you didn't ask why she didn't want to be home?? Where does she normally live??  That is the problem.  Who does she live with? <br>  <br>  Apparently she feels comfortable with you and you are great for not pushing her.  She doesn't want to be alone.  What ever it is doesn't have anything to do with the party, it happened before that and she couldn't enjoy herself at the party and left early.<br>  <br>  What does she do when she is at your place?  Watch TV?  Just be alone?   <br>  <br>  Isn't someone where she lives going to miss her?  Does she work?  Go to school?  You know more than you know.|`|75btdWJkaa	Maybe something happened between her and her family. Don't try to pry. It might be serious. Just let her know you're her friend and you'll be there for her if she ever needs it. She'll really appreciate it, and she might even tell you what happened if she really trusts you. If she doesn't, that's ok.

Tell her you two are engaged and want to get married. If she lives 1000 miles away she can't do anything about. If she keeps on asking, tell your fiance to get a new mobile, so she will never text him. If she begs on Facebook, then make his profile secret. So only friends can comment and view his profile.<br>  <br>  Then you and your fiance will live happily ever after! =]
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Yeah yr totally right, these things happens and they mean it when they say it, as if its something good to talk about it like that, how do they think sometimes i really wonder.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Crazy people make normal people do crazy things. I would look for signs of a pattern. How does he treat you? How long have you two been together? After he explained about these 'crazy' relationships, does he try to make you act crazy? It starts off slow and its subtle, but if he's the catalyst, you'll soon know. If he doesn't resolve his past, he may be doomed to repeat it.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	My husband agrees with you. they aren't all crazy.<br>  <br>  For my part, I had at least one ex who was seriously crazy (and now he is in jail for doing a very bad thing). I've caught up with several of the others and they are all good guys, just like when I dated them. I am proud of the choices I made even though they didn't work out for the long haul. I wouldn't belittle any of them by name calling.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think it is a lot of misunderstanding.  The exes think, "I screwed her over or hooked up with her and she thought it was more, so now she's mad."   I think the guy thinks, it's over and she knows it's over, why won't she just go away or keep quiet?|`|qd2Cauvwaa	Makes sense to me, an occasional crazy one or two is understandable but if everyone is then maybe its him.|`|CaY7Nl0Aaa	Maybe he is just trying to make you feel less threatened by them.  Maybe they arent "crazy" just really pretty.
bc1af16c01f9baa9730a6de2c0ca235caa	To say you are being selfish is like saying she's being selfish because she WANTS working that shift not she HAS to work that shift. That's life though, you take what you have to, if you don't have to then don't. <br>  Does she need to work so much, I mean could she take less hours or less days? Why is it only a few hours on the weekends? Why don't you two set certain days were you can spend all day together, or weekends together and not just a few hours here and there.  If there really is only 4 hours a week together  then I think it would be selfish of her to stay on that shift...and if she changes her favorite shift for you then you better make it worth it! Good luck guy, i hope you and your hunny get to spend more time together  :)|`|s4aX6bF6aa	if she's visibly unhappy about switching shifts then the two of you need to sit down and continue to discuss this...don't force the situation...be sympathetic to her wants as you describe your wants...then by being open and honest you can come up with the best solution to fulfill both of your wants.|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	no if anything she should have done it on her own....|`|HRIbmp67aa	yes, it is selfish. i understand your reasons, but your reasons can be put on hold for the time being.  let her finish school.  her goals in school and by working are to the benefit of you both...<br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* no, that is NOT what i'm saying.  if you're a grown up, then i'm sure you can find an amicable solution to YOUR problem.  please don't get pissy with me and assume that i actually have feelings about your situation.  you gotta handle this one on your own.  too bad, that i gave you an answer you didn't like...i didn't know this was "Y!A that you like".|`|iPFUJXvpaa	she works and goes to school , looks like she wants both of you to live better in the future, does she need to work ?.or both should try to get sat & sun off together ,so you can spend all day together ,.|`|gQBqgzJmaa	You need to spend time together to make a relationship work.  If she won't put herself through a little inconvenient for the sake of the relationship, dump her.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	If switching her hours is bothering then you might want to try another approach to spending time together.

If u make her change shes not gonna be happy and prolly be pissier at work and that will come home with her and it will be taken out on you! Wouldnt u rather see her for a few hours happy to see you or more often pissed off about work and everthing else?|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Yeah. It's selfish, even if you think it's coming from a good place. It works out better for her school AND she likes it better? How is that being a team player?<br>  <br>  I work a full-time job that can sometimes include weekends and/or 12 hour shifts. My husband is a bartender. Sometimes we only get one whole day off together - sometimes (like this week) we don't get any days off together. Last weekend we were able to go away together and it was blissful.|`|87yovKYlaa	honestly i understand why she works days. when i worked nights the work was harder, i was always tired and cranky and i hated my husband cause i had to work nights so we would have time for each other...the people on the night shift were unbearable and i hated my husband over it. personally if she loves the shift then leave it be so she don't end up resenting you over it. the reality is if you can't make it work on just a few hours here and there you wont make it work cause in marriage you don't see each other that often once the bills pile up and kids happen, cause after kids you might get a few hours alone together a week for a conversation. you still have your days off planned together? if not then that might be the answer...start planning to have the same days off each week even if you have to go to your managers and specify that you can no longer work on a certain day of the week due to a class you will be taking (he don't have to know the class is a fix the relationship class at home) that way you will at least have a full day together and if lucky 2 each week.|`|aXYiOskmaa	sorry but yea, it's selfish of you. <br>  do you know how long some folks have to wait to get on first shift? and she likes that shift anyway. it's wrong of you to ask her to switch. you have the weekends already.

What would your opionion be of someone wanting to steal your husband/soulmate/provider. Its not a contest, ifs a marriage. Id lose all respect of this person, he may think its funny that your attracted to him, but not funny enough to get some.............that his wife doesnt do for him as much as hed like.

If so, run the other way. A crush is not the same as being in love. "falling in love" is temporary. If you mess with a married man, you will have to deal with the consequences and the lovely feelings you now have will long be gone. If someone is willing to betray his wife over a crush - he's willing to leave you at any second as well. People like that only think of themselves - it's best to stay out of it.|`|7qvaXOFzaa	Well, if he can cheat on his wife and crush on you then I don't think you should bother falling in love with him because look... that's his WIFE if he can cheat on her then later on why won't he cheat on you, yet his relationship with is wife is obviously going to stronger.|`|cn49BbRiaa	He is married and he probably only wants a fling with you.<br>  No married man leaves his wife for another woman.<br>  You deserve a man of your own just ignore his signals.|`|8AqePkCqaa	Don't do it. You will be hurt. Find a way to ask him about the ring. Nothing will ever come of it. They don't leave their wives trust me|`|AA12259102	Move on.There's too many other guys out there to choose from that one belongs to someone else.Respect yourself and your sisters.If he's willing to cheat how great a guy is he anyway.|`|eO0iByzMaa	I would keep well away from that one!

AA11587827	a man or woman should always take care of what is needed in a marriage, when one fails to do so, always remember the old saying, if u dont do what needs to be done at home, someone else will, and most of the time someone else does, and when that happens there is nothing wrong with that either, we only have so much control over what our body wants and needs, and can deny, it for so long, its all part of how we are made up as humans|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You seem to be asking this question only to husbands who are never in the mood.  Since I am frequently in the mood, I clearly do not qualify.  Do you really think that there are a lot of these guys hanging out here in Marriage & Divorce?  Maybe you should ask your husband what he expects you to do - given that you've apparently been married half your life, I'd think it would be an acceptable question to ask.|`|10f62a7507c4a8c5de3a963dfc704e84aa	Well I am usually in the mood. I help with everything around the house. I do spend time with my kids. It doesnt seem to matter when the one you care about doesnt want to be next to you anymore for some reason. This argument can go both ways.

I would certainly go the Doctor route until you know for sure that it's not medical.<br>  <br>  It does sound like you will soon have to make a choice, as unfortunate as that is, unless he's willing to get with the program so to speak.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	This sounds more like a rant.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	maybe you could get a hobby?|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I sense that your in a bad place and need to make a change in your living arrangements.  So why not tell your husband that you have needs and if he does not wish to fulfill them, that you would like to bring someone in that will.  Maybe he will be turned on by the thought of you having sex with another, he may even desire to shut off the TV and watch you and your new lover.  So until you ask, you will never know.  Good luck.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	I've actually experienced a seemingly disinterested man, and the secret to getting some is intiating it yourself.

CF1R0TPvaa	That would be "not me" in the case of the 100% turned on wife.<br>  <br>  In the highly unlikely rare event that she was more interested that I, I would simply write a note to myself "give wife oral every day" and I would proceed to make coffee in the morning, followed by brushing and flossing, then pulling off her panties and giving it to her with my tongue at the breakfast table.<br>  <br>  For some reason, I think I could remember to do that for her, if that was what she wanted.<br>  <br>  So funny to think that she could remember to have the lawn fertilised in spring but she doesn't seem to ever remember how to physically please me.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Definitely not.

FM5gBNe6aa	The colour combination sounds like a lovely idea. I would bear in mind you might not find the right colour browns during July tho. How about caramel colours or somthing lighter.<br>  <br>  I'm getting married in feb and we're using blues and creams - blue compliments many other colours too!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I love blue & brown.  or pink & brown.  if you think a brown dress might be too hot, get short dresses instead of long gowns.  cocktail or tea length is really trendy right now.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Aqua is lovely, but just skip all thoughts of brown. Go with another colour - deep or petal pink, a buttery yellow, or a medium blue.|`|3WQOa4sraa	My colours are bright turquoise, silver and white with lemon yellow hints in the flowers<br>  <br>  the blue and brown work well, its very popular choice, how about the maid of honor have a brown sash around her dress or a brown ribbon on her bouquet to make her stand out more without looking too dark for summer. you can bring more brown colours to the reception<br>  <br>  good luck|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	You said no dark colors, but you want dark brown... I would skip the brown, replace it with something less common and brighter - pale or bright yellow, orange, peach, mango, fuschia, gold - something that's really pretty and summery. I think chocolate brown is way overdone, you're aquamarine is beautiful so why not dress it up with something bright? <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1663aacaf477ab5d8cb4705d60ab324faa	How about a aquamarine/teal with orange and white...those are very pretty, fresh and summer colors!

Also keep in mind that if the groomsmen were black tuxes and the bridesmaids are in brown that may not be a combo of colors you want...Maybe you can incorportate the chocolate contrast in your table linens or centerpieces?|`|o4NarYVoaa	i would do an aqua dress, with maybe a brown sash or bow on it somewhere. that would be super pretty.  <br>  <br>  if you want the MOH to stand out get her a bigger bouquet with a bigger aqua colored bow on it, or get her a pretty dainty accessory for her hair|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	I don't knowabout those colors.  They are kind of wild.  And together not good.  Dull, and not complimenting at all.  July wedding?  Light yellow, pale pink, coral.  They are pretty and light.  YOu have to remember, darker colors make the person feel hotter.|`|34ikhhtMaa	I like your color a lot. I am going to use silver and a tiffany blue.

I think my SIL secretly thinks that I'm the scum of the earth for being able to stay home, but then again, she NEVER had a job until she was almost 30.  People just seem to think it's ok for her because she started having children at 19 (and was married at 17).  <br>  <br>  You just have to learn to ignore the many people who will make remarks on your decision.

Me and my husband have a great relationship and we've talked about children. We are not going to have them until WE are good and ready, d@mn other people opinions, they aren't living our lives! When he is deployed, I will go to school that so I can get a good job so when HE gets out of the military he can have the luxury of being a house husband (though he won't be able to cook as good as me, haha) I realize every day how fortunate I am to be able to do this. I occasionally feel guilty too, but then I come to the conclusion of "phuc other peoples opinions!"

Only when people find themselves in the same situation only then they will understand how you feel and can relate to your situation.

BRJ956twaa	I totally would have done the same. I understand why your sister would be a little upste. But if she had the same problem with the chain then she should be more empathetic about it. I think you dealt with the situation appropriately. You made it clear that you still appreciated the pendant and you were honest so good for you. Not alot of people can be honest and open like that I've realized. <br>  But I am sure she will get over it=) Good luck hun<3|`|ehm3vCYXaa	Sounds like she thought you hated it. You'll have to talk to her about it. She was probably hurt by your reaction...<br>  You should have thanked her for it, and commented about how beautiful you thought it was.|`|ZQ43sWSpaa	just say the chain was beautiful, but was annoying. or just change it back to the annoying chain and try to get used to it lol|`|Zy05Ffu8aa	It don't matter, you can buy a woman coach, kate spade, d & g ... <br>  they'll still find something to be angry about.|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	your an *** hole...no gift for you next year.....jack ***|`|Um9VBhy8aa	you shouldnt have done that...it was s[pecial to her you should have just replaced the chain and not told her|`|u0eTvggDaa	People always say they want the truth, but they seem to never handle the truth.<br>  <br>  no i think you did the right thing, why have something that is difficult, and almost broke? <br>  <br>  i think as long as you still liked the pendant everything should have been fine.<br>  <br>  just try talking to her again about it, and it's not like you threw the other chain away, and you showed no disrespect towards her, or put her down in any way.<br>  <br>  She will get over it in time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i could help!!|`|YVmAKb8Eaa	You shouldn't have said anything. It's rude to criticize a gift.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	first rule when receiving any gift say thank you and do not say anything bad about it. She is your sister so she will get over it|`|r7LONeiSaa	In this case, I would say she shouldn't be angry or take it personal.  The reason you got a new chain was because the initial one wasn't working for you.  This probably just hurt her feelings because she took 'so much' time to find this gift for you.<br>  Although in part of what you said it does almost sound like you said the chain wasn't beautiful either.  I'm assuming that isn't the case.|`|bBxz2UAwaa	Thats all you can she has no reason to be mad. I dont understand what the big deal was if you oculdnt get it on and off why would you get mad and keep it and keep trying to get that dang thing on and off. I dont knwo what i would do but she iwll get over it!!|`|kF9aHWfUaa	You should be polite with others.It doesnt matter if u liked it or not.U can buy what u like with ur own money.|`|paerqxfMaa	Relax - she's the one with issues.  If she didn't like the chain because of the problems of clasping and unclasping, and passed it along to you, why should you go through the hassle.  You've apologized, you've told her that you love the pendant and are wearing the pendant.  That's it.  You're done - she has to come to grips with it.  I've gotten many necklaces, where I loved the pendant but didn't care for the chain - sometimes the chain is too delicate for the pendant and then it breaks and you loose the pendant (maybe you can use this as an excuse for her) - so I always put the pendant on a chain of my choice.

You gave a guy the cold shoulder and he lost interest.<br>  <br>  This is a good life lesson, just learn from it and move on.|`|7sxGW40qaa	OK, he's probably upset because he thinks you don't like him and he feels liek he should just give up.  But if you talk to him, and tell him what's going on, then things should be ok.  You just have to learn how to tlak to him.  It's hard, but you can do it.  <br>  <br>  Just tell yourself you look fine, and try really hard to believe it.  Or take a hairbrush to school with you!|`|gqHy3821aa	I don't blame him, what you did was really mean and probably made him lose all hope and confidence of approaching you about it..<br>  <br>  Now, you are going to have to make the first move. Firstly go up to him and apologise for what you did, then tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  Something like: 'Hey, i'm sorry about the other day when i ignored you. I do really like you i just didn't feel ready to talk about it.'<br>  <br>  Then the conversation will write itself. Since you were so shy, you are going to have to show confidence and approach him to say sorry to him. Good Luck.|`|aKc85y92aa	write a love poem and throw it at his face?|`|gd5XGTakaa	you should assign a day to make your self really beautiful and know for sure that you look perfect and nothing could go wrong so you don't have to think about it... and just talk to him and be like i'm sorry for running away from you blah blah blah and just say i do like you i am just shy and i don't know what to do.. and ask if he still likes me and if he says yes and he doesn't ask you out then you should do it... good luck:) try not to be scared it will all work out|`|ojBvCNViaa	awww.... im in the same situation almost im a little older than you im 17 so i have a lil bit mo experice with guys like my situation is exzaly the same well i could tell u what i did u have to try and overcome your shyness and when you get a chance hangout with him and let him know how u feel about everything and see what he has to say he likes u :) hes just a little shy like u i think he only hasnt said any thing to u b cuz he must have thouht it would have been akward since u know how he fels dose he kno how u feel? i think u should make the frist move and tlk to him and c where it gose  good luck! :)

And just be there for her...<br>  Good luck to both of you<br>  x|`|gF8gTZJxaa	You can't do anything apart from find out what she feels she should do and advise her accordingly, the best thing you can do is speak to someone more mature than you both are if you can be sure it is treated as in confidence.|`|AA11447210	It's not up to you to do anything. She needs to tell her parents and start getting medical attention for her stupidity, er pregnancy.|`|ezT7xruoaa	The first thing she needs to do is talk to an adult she trusts about it. Maybe this can be a GP since her family is not good, as you say. The doctor can advise her on her options, but the worst thing would be if she waited to long to have an abortion and was forced to keep it and didn't want to. <br>  Don't get too involved, and NEVER tell her what you think she should do. This can end up biting you in the a*ss big time! Like you tell her you think she should get an abortion, fast forward a year, she had the baby and now hates you because you "tried to kill her baby". Just tell her to speak to someone but don't say anything more. <br>  <br>  If she's stupid enough not to use contraception when she KNOWS she can get pregnant its her mess, she has to deal with it. Just be there when she needs a shoulder to cry on.|`|f1lpdiNEaa	She needs to see her doctor or family planning clinic to test again to make sure she is pregnant. A family planning clinic can also help her inform her parents which obviously has to happen. Then she can start getting medical treatment and advice about wether she would like to go ahead with the pregnancy or not. All you can do is be there for her, but she got herself into this and will need to grow up pretty quickly from now on!|`|DmN7iCBzaa	I think...as a friend you just have to be there for her, needless to say she's obviously going to be really upset. Just listen to her concerns, make sure she talks and doesn't bottle things up. It's not up to you to fix things like i said all you can do is be there for her, calm her down because her panicing is only going to make her feel worse.|`|6nq1IiqXaa	aww, i hope everything go okay for her, im sure she would probably be a good mum and as long as you stay behind her and support her she will be fine, don't worry what people think because shes only 13, I would definitely tell her parents though if she hasn't already, or even speak to someone at school about it, im sure she will be fine though (: good luck!|`|zWv9Slxpaa	I think she should go and see a nurse or she should tell her parents because this is very serious at her age.|`|9A2qByAUaa	Not much she can do.

N8EB7YkMaa	You really don't have a choice.  I believe you should ask him how he feels about marriage and what his traditional beliefs are.  I think you can ask these questions without it sounding like you are asking him to propose to you.  I would think that if he were interested in marriage, the conversation would prod any inclinations.<br>  Personally, it drives me crazy that people are having babies like crazy these days without being married.  Guess it shows how old I am getting.  (cripes)|`|rlUUaSgqaa	You're in your late 30s.  It's dangerous to put off having kids any longer than you have to.  Is the tradition of having the man propose really more important to you than having your own biological children?  Because that is what you may well be sacrificing by hoping for him to come around.  I would just be direct about wanting to get married soon.  Just ask him how he feels about it, and I'm sure if he has a problem with it, he will let you know.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Since you are the one in charge of other decisions and he rarely takes any initiative maybe he's waiting on you to bring up the idea of marriage. It should have come up from one of you when you were talking about having a baby. I don't think you can force him to propose, and if you could it wouldn't mean much would it? I also don't think he's going to do it on his own accord or he would have done it by now. Looks like the ball is in your court.|`|67c5927fb7113617b07cd375a463e8fcaa	Im in the sort of same situation. Ive been with my partner 4 years. Although, as we are both very stubborn our arguements are more frequent.<br>  <br>  But he doesnt decide anything. I just get ''its up to you'' and he actually gets stressed if he actually has to make a decision. which really gets on my nerves at times.<br>  <br>  Im the same, I want children, within the next year, but I dont want them out of marriage. Ive half jokingly/half seriously said I'll just go and book our wedding and its his choice if he turns up.<br>  Not what I want, and it frustrates me to death he uses money as an excuse. But Im the same, I want it to be his choice as well. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|SxI6y9GWaa	If you are waiting for him to get round to proposing, then you'll probably wait forever because he sounds pretty happy with the status quo and probably thinks you are too.  Men can be so dense sometimes.  When you are discussing having children have you said outright that you'd like to get married first?  Maybe you have to be blunt about it if you ever want it to happen.  I think you are going to have to give him a push.  If you can't do it yourself, get a friend or your mum to tell him outright that he'd better get down on one knee and propose to you pretty damn quickly so that you can start to plan some legitimate children with him because that is what you REALLY want.  He'll probably be surprised and then ask you why you've never told him so.
IZvbv5ONaa	They are all different when it comes to this kind of thing.  Sometimes you gotta let him take a nap and then wake him up with a little 'surprise' and then he is ready to go again.<br>  <br>  Some guys really don't like condoms.  I really don't like them either.<br>  <br>  If that is a big problem for him...possibly try a female condom?<br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  If it is a monogamous relationship, both of you could just go get tested and go on birth control...|`|dfwEtCZXaa	If the problem really is the condom, try getting the bigger ones.|`|094BOoy7aa	I think you wanted sex too soon after the first time, and he didn't know how to answer that.|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	Give him a brake, fro god's sake.|`|FzFSzilmaa	nope, he's messing with you...<br>  <br>  condom has nothing to do with it...<br>  <br>  if it did, he wouldn't be able to go the first time...<br>  [he wants some fun with you sans condom]|`|x7uYAPaSaa	Yes i know i'm not a guy but hay! Maybe you should just do it the once and wait longer before doing it the 2nd time round. But i've never heard of that. If the guy was horny enough he would be able to keep it up i'm sure
NpqAbZqpaa	Can a guy answer?<br>  <br>  If you are determined that you want to have children and the other is determined not to, then no, you shouldn't get married.<br>  <br>  You can't assume that either party will, in time, change their mind.<br>  <br>  Basically you look at the person and ask yourself, do I want this person or my choice of children or not.  The other person has to do the same.  <br>  <br>  It's not about who blinks, first, but really try to understand how much opposition you have and if both are determined to have their own direction, that's not a good match.<br>  <br>  I love being a parent, wouldn't change it for the world, but my best friend and his wife never will, that's a choice they made and should be respected.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	As you get older and mature these are the things you need to start thinking about before settling down. No, I dont think I'd marry given the situation, but there is a chance that perhaps the guy will change his mind somewhere along the line. Guys mature alot later than us girls, so he might say he doesnt want kids, but it might actually take him a few years to admit that hes ready after you do.|`|fqboOITjaa	I don't think I could. I think a marraige would be a bit empty without kids. I know I sound old fashioned here but I love kids and definitely want to have some eventually.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	Yes. At least I'd have a sane husband to talk me out of that nonsense.|`|tGHbrixjaa	Nope. I want to have a child when I'm older, and I don't get why people don't.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	No|`|yte0BzXKaa	I wouldn't.

I couldn't do it...|`|dcd11iUwaa	people change.<br>  a lot of men say they dont want children, but when they look into their baby's face, everything gets thrown out the window and they fall in love.<br>  it doesnt happen everytime, some people just flat out dont, but its worth a try if you really want one :)|`|x3LclBZ0aa	its a conflict of interest and goals. you canmarry that person but im sure it will propose problems during the long run. thats too big of an issue to sweep under the rug.|`|AA11119636	I can definitely marry a WOMAN that refuse to have kids =)|`|AN9PdKmgaa	a women or man who marries someone who does not want children and they do are asking for trouble
8cO6c0Usaa	OMG that is sooo rude..so they basically send you a Save the Date..say Hey! Keep this date open..I want you at my wedding.<br>  then a few months later.....<br>  Ooops! We invited too many people that we can't afford and you are not on the important list so sorry! You can't come!!<br>  How can anyone DO that? that is sooo rude and SUCH poor planning on their part. They MUST have known they could not afford all these people that they sent Save the Dates too. ughhh people aggravate me!<br>  Tacky and RUDE!<br>  I hope you didn't send these people wedding gifts!!!!!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	That is just ridiculous! They should know who they can invite BEFORE sending out save the dates! I have never had this happen to me, but if it did, it would piss me off!|`|wMWfCjBpaa	Sounds annoying. I didn't do save the dates either. I had no idea who I was going to invite anyways. Things change 12 months before the wedding to the time one actually sends out invitations. They did just mess up and I would just leave it at that. So no gift from you is appropriate. A card would be nice but still not necessary.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	this is why I don't like save the date cards.  Just send out the invitations to the people you want to attend.<br>  <br>  if you send out save the date cards, then you better be damn sure you invite everyone you send the cards to.  It's very rude to send a save the date card and then not invite them.|`|AA11380378	Champagne dreams on beer budget. Don't you hate it?<br>  <br>  Some people get caught on the excitement and do not exercise good judgement. I would be mortified with shame. Good planning implies a realistic budget and common sense, but most people assume that parents are going to pour their retirement money into a party for their princess, gimme a break, do people read the news?<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	wow...that is kinda rude.  like, seriously, how do you NOT have that all sorted out before you send them?|`|AA11312653	Thank you for giving me yet another reason to dislike these creepy fridge magnets and other gimmicks. It's nice to get them from my dentist and OB/GYN, but annoying to get them in place of personal correspondence. If you know me well enough that you want to tell me you are getting married, then surely you know me well enough to take pen in hand and send me a personal message instead of the impersonal commercially produced junk. If you had sent me a personal message, you could have simply told me that you had set a date and not mentioned whether or not I should expect an invitation. This would have saved you the awkwardness of explaining that no invitation would be forthcoming. <br>  <br>  IMO the folks who sell "save the date" merchandise are taking advantage of the child in all of us, the child who delights in seeing his name on his toothbrush or pencil. If you're all that crazy about seeing your name printed on junk advertising materials, then become a dentist.|`|0WASp0bHaa	I think save the date cards are rude. It is saying We are not inviting yet, but you better not make any plans for that day. <br>  Not to mention the extra cost-and for what. Any close friend or family member is already going to know the date of your wedding. You send out your invitations 6 weeks before the wedding, that is enough time for anyone else to make plans. <br>  <br>  You were not invited to the wedding, and therefore are under no obligation to send a gift. A "save the date in case I invite you" card does not bring any obligation to respond.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	I read and answered some of your other questions. I would just write off your husbands family and friends (mostly) altogether. They are rude and greedy. Let them be rude and greet alone. There is a big difference in 200 people and 500 people. Sure, I can see inviting like an extra 10 or 20 in that situation, but doubling it is ridiculous. They sounds little on the dumb side too.|`|zmqN0M86aa	Oh well, at least you know now exactly where you stand with them.<br>  <br>  I think STDs are a load of crap anyways.  They're basically useless.  What does a STD do that you can't do yourself by word of mouth or email/letter?  Pure marketing genius, I tell you.  Wish I thought of that one.|`|1TQTw2bnaa	I think it's absolutely tacky. You should send out a minimal amount of STDs - it almost seems like they're gift grubbing this way.|`|vJrlCd0uaa	i'm not popular enough to get invited to people's weddings. I guess you're just better then everyone else. LOL love you|`|uNJirnYoaa	send them an email back saying you got their STD<br>  that'll give them a good laugh|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	That's CRAZY!!<br>  Before my fiance & I setup a budget we came up with a preliminary guest list to figure out just how much it would cost for everyone we really wanted to invite.<br>  <br>  We did send save-the-dates but we were 1,000% sure that every person who was sent a save-the-date would be invited to the wedding.<br>  <br>  I do disagree with the folks who think save-the-dates are rude or inappropriate.  I happen to have 90% of my guestlist coming from out-of-state and before the save-the-dates came out our families were pestering us about hotel prices and locations.  I told everyone that we would send save-the-dates with the necessary info and they were very happy to wait until we could send out that information.<br>  I've heard from some family that they booked their hotel in November 2008 when the save-the-date was sent out and the wedding isn't until 10/31/09!!  Some guests want that info and want to make the arrangements early.  Save the dates are a great thing at times.|`|o4NarYVoaa	that is so rude!<br>  <br>  i f i were you, i would send them an email, just to be snotty and say<br>  <br>  " i am confused, are we invited to your wedding or not? "|`|OvaNVAbZaa	That is SO RUDE! I have never had that happen and can't imagine anyone doing that. I would definitely not send them a gift after being uninvited!
AnHQbZQAaa	THERE / THEIR / THEY'RE<br>  <br>  it's not rocket science|`|KcAehrrKaa	Maybe he already liked you a lot?|`|R6wjTZ63aa	Yeah, i love it when my girlfriend laughs at my jokes, it just makes the mood better. <br>  <br>  So yes, laugh at his jokes. Otherwise he's going to think you don't like him!|`|NoFC9rtKaa	It's a  huge ego boost for guys when they can make their ladies laugh.  I noticed my husband has a great time making me laugh and it puts him in a great mood.  It's definitely one of the best parts of our relationship.|`|mshewx1maa	Yeah, guys love it when girls laugh at their jokes.  Think about it, don't you like it when people laugh at your jokes too?|`|17ded6df7e87d2c7857de488b08712c0aa	yeah it makes guys feel good when he feels that he can entertain you and hold your attention by his comedy.  It makes him feel macho.|`|pdPX1Pt6aa	some times i guess it depends on the joke|`|VVH1KWaaaa	only if its real laughing. fake ones are a turn-off.
aDIPIu7xaa	Kudos to you for being mature and gracious to admit your own weakness.<br>  <br>  We ALL have them.<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to accept is th fact you cannot change your husband.  But I am thinking you already know that, or you would not be asking how you should deal with your impatience.<br>  <br>  This is something you will have to actively work on, I am afraid.  With self patience and time, you WILL master the art of patience with your husband.  Ask God for help overcoming this.  he will strengthen you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you- and happy and healthy marriage to you as well!|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Be grateful that he does them, even if not in your "time frame". My best friend just lost her husband to cancer and she'd give anything to have the 'problem' you have. Count your blessings.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	You will learn by time that u cant change someone.Just luv your husband as he is.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Please don't have any kids.  You will need more patience with them and you don't have any at all.|`|ruczpWrGaa	You just need to remember that you didn't marry him so you could have someone exactly like you do things the way you do.  You probably married him because you love him.  Yes him taking his time and doing things may annoy you but would you really want him to change?  Honestly, he wouldn't be the same man.  So yes it may get on your last nerve but everyone operates in their own way.  Dont worry so much about comparing the 2 of of you.  Enjoy that he is who he is. Heck you might even learn something about stopping to smell the roses from him.  good luck.|`|u0eTvggDaa	Some people just don't see the point in rushing.<br>  <br>  He likes to take his time.<br>  <br>  and you don't<br>  <br>  if you love him, you will work around it.<br>  <br>  easier said than done, i know.<br>  <br>  but if i were you, i would just let him be. atleast he is still getting the errand done.|`|aErUKUvVaa	Hun, I've been dealing with this for 15 years with my wife.  It's crazy.  Sometimes it burns my as*, but after so long I just assume that if she says she'ss be back in an hour, it'll be more like 2 or 3.  If she IS back in one hour, its a bonus!  Chill.  U know what ur dealing with, so don't expect it to change. At least u know what to expect.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I stopped reading at "today i asked him to..."<br>  <br>  He's already your servant.  Now you're b*tching at his servant performance.  Next you're going to be saying he takes too long to ***, you're getting leg cramps, lockjaw, etc.|`|mshewx1maa	Ugh, my husband has his own version of time too.  I think it is just one of those things we have to accept.|`|oR40n3kPaa	Like the old saying.  If you want something done right, then do it yourself.  There has to be a reason why he is taking so long about doing things.  It might be that he needs to just get away and that is his time alone.  Guys as well as girls sometimes just need their space and well you send him out and he uses that time to take for himself.  You need to relax and stop putting him on such a tight leash because if you gave him the freedom he needed then you wouldn't even notice the time that he was gone.  Stop counting minutes and do something productive while he is gone.  Otherwise just do it yourself.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	You're not impatient.. you're straight up bitchy. There is a difference. If you were on a time line and wanted it to be done in 10 minutes, you should've done it yourself. You can't ask somebody for a favor and then get mad at how long it take to fulfill the favor. So, it doesn't seem like your issue is that you're not patient with your husband, so much as it does that you're controlling. <br>  <br>  One of the ways you can resolve a controlling attitude is to realize that the world doesn't revolve around you and everyone don't move to the beat of your drum. Another way  is for you to do all of what you need done by yourself.
QqY8YgGDaa	Yes|`|evEJxv06aa	sometimes they are like that but we can't do anything about it right it's just part of our lifes right.|`|AA11447210	So if you don't care what other people think, why let it bug you enough to post about it?<br>  <br>  Go about your business and let people think what they want to think. In the mean time, work on your typing/spelling skills because they need work and apparently you didn't bother to take advantage of the spell check feature here (easier to take you seriously, when your post is correct). ?|`|sCr2iTczaa	Yes. You shouldn't care what other people think about your relationship because at the end of the day the only people who really knows what is going on in your relationship is your and your bf. So just ignore the haters.|`|ActoZyHraa	Yes aslong as he can put a smile on your face, you seem young just have fun with it ^_^|`|AN9PdKmgaa	that's what its all about if he makes you happy to hell with others opinions anyway the girls are probably jealous cause you are now spending time with him and not them|`|JB8gqDuPaa	If they are going by looks..then u shouldnt care what they think.<br>  But if they know his persoanality and still thinks the same ..then u might wanna rething|`|LLNlyaFaaa	yeah that's exactly what it should you know that's just the way she thinks about everything don't listen to her it doesn't ever really matter what she says or thinks|`|cn49BbRiaa	As long as he treats you right and makes you happy dont worry about what people out there have to say about you. People will always talk cause they are jealouse.|`|NxZl1Qccaa	exactly! you go girl!|`|DIlMYYBQaa	F**k them, as long as you are happy that's all that matters.|`|yte0BzXKaa	You should really listen to Yahoo! when it says you've made a misspelling.|`|LfpfHcMNaa	It's good that you care less what she thinks. GOOD FOR YOU!|`|ZMmhkKiraa	ya!
bFKnx2FHaa	That's the road to a feeling thats called LOVE.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	it means you really care for them|`|Pbsayz4Aaa	it means liking them,,like to hear them,see them ,spend time with them<br>  and wishing nothing wrong should happen to them|`|d5c8a4978056e5924b26ff6790b3553faa	It's a "likable thing". not love, or even i want to be in a relationship with you. "I like you" is an example.|`|lf1TUsyqaa	means you admire them, adore everything little thing they say and do. sweet.|`|7sxGW40qaa	That you want them... like as a bf/gf|`|fecUjSr1aa	WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE ..... !!!!<br>  <br>  that helps?  <]:-)|`|GMgPjVYuaa	i think if u luv some one u have sweet feelings for him/her<br>  in other words u like them|`|7epLNsB5aa	it means being in luuuuuuuuve.|`|3zG0HJxSaa	likin em loads. and thinkin of em in a postive way

He wants u.
XlGjBPBTaa	He won't get the wrong idea about you unless you give him something to think about.  Just be yourself and he can only see the real you.
f0eQ5ILEaa	You're not over reacting at all.<br>  If I were you I would stop communicating with her, I wouldn't even say it to her that I will not talk with you anymore.<br>  Just ignore her and go on with your life.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	hmmmmmmm i dont think it is there job to drive your husband to appointments. and no reason they have to pick you up on the side of the road and become your drivers.  now has your husband given gass money or even paid for a oil change? do they nomraly one drive one week the other the other week?  it isnt there fault your car was totaled if you have inc you should have also put on for a rental car not to seem mean you should never relay on others just yourself if she comes by or wants to go to the er just decline and say you dont feel well or dont feel like going like her husband says to her|`|2aa9e3a40a6033729bc3d34d32ce7346aa	First, do not give or do anything for anybody if you expect it back.... means, give and help without expecting a pay back or gratitude.<br>  <br>  Second, "friends" are just friends, no obligations, etc.... means no ties... the only person you should trust up to 99.99% to be for you always is your husband and family.<br>  <br>  Best friends, do not exist... only in our mind....|`|MKMA9WeQaa	...Hi dear,  i think you over reacted. you didnt have to expect an equal treatment from you friend. like what my DAD usually say "' dont expect, so you dont get diappointed" and i have leaved by this. a freind is a friend because you accepted her the way she is, normally it will hurt when we get this kind of treatment from a friend, but then we make it more painful when we expect same from friends they will disappoint because no one could be trustedd as GOD.<br>  be peaceful dear and  dont let it bother you... go make peace with her, that way you could be changing her for better.<br>   all the best.
0ky4TktEaa	Well the fact is: she IS your ex for a reason. Depending on what you and she broke up over, things may or may not be able to be fixed. <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like she was being honest in saying she's not ready to spend an entire weekend with you just yet. However, she may have gotten a little miffed by the fact that you intended to go spend some time in another city hanging out with friends (which could mean talking to other girls etc). She's aware that you are not committed to her even if you are just seeing if there's reason to try to work things out. In order to try to make you feel what she's feeling, she probably told you the exact same thing. My guess is that there's more to the story than what you know. Whatever she found out may not be bad, but enough to make her a little jealous over.<br>  <br>  You didn't say whether she was claiming to hang out in the same city you are going to or not. If that's the case, she probably wants to let you know she'll be there. If that's not the case, i think it's more a jealousy thing.|`|ReaD6u4paa	i dont know if she still loves you or not but i feel she like to control you.spy on on you.play with your feelings a little bit.if you like dominating females then try your luck again

The old unscented Ben Gay prank!<br>  <br>  They might be giving you a hand job and then rubbing you down with Ben Gay. Have you also been feeling a bit greasy?

lwXGNizGaa	Oh wow, I could never do anything like that.  I can already imagine myself skipping class to lie in bed all day listening to sad music and wondering if she'll ever forgive me and convincing myself that she never could.  Then I would wonder why anyone would even want to and it would downward spiral into me thinking that I was the most worthless person on the planet and the dumbest for losing the best thing that's ever happened to me.  Then I would cry for the first time in 8 years.<br>  <br>  I think I would send an email, text, call, facebook message...etc her how sorry I was and then I would drive two hours to go see her and try and make things better.|`|59DkkvSraa	pretty much like crap. if it was an accident i do whatever i can to do make it better. i appologize and explain it was an accident and then i try and be sweet and tell her everything she wants to hear. if she doesnt forgive you shes a ***** and doesnt deserve to be with anyone because thats kinda what relationships are about is forgiving the one you care about. she may still be mad or upset about what happened to accidently get her feelings hurt but the first step that has to happen is that she forgives the dude|`|WFZB4QnSaa	My bf always says really nasty things when he gets mad... and when he calms down he feels really bad... so bad that he refuses to talk to me again because he cant 'do that to me anymore'<br>  <br>  So I end up havig to fix things...Very mature of him|`|8AAiZGNHaa	i'd feel really bad<br>  <br>  i've done it before but by accident Lol<br>  <br>  **** happens|`|PM9KFwiraa	just make up some bollocks lies about how you care about her and stuff.|`|La4EHNo7aa	when I don't mean it and was an 'accident' i feel crap.

She sounds pretty selfish to me. But hey, what do I know?<br>  <br>  I say tell her if she is willing to "take care of you" when you feel the urge to master bate, you'll be happy to give up your "mistress".<br>  <br>  You are not wrong.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	That's weird. She can't be mad at you if you try to sleep with her and she wont. She has to realize that men need a release and if we're not the ones to help then they do it themselves. My husband probably does it just as much as you and I'm totally cool with it. I think that if I was wanting to have more sex and he chose to masturbate instead having sex with me then I would have a problem but it's her fault that you have to in the first place. And it doesn't mean you'll cheat.|`|AAjMQtzUaa	well to me most men masturbate and i think that if you were going to cheat you would not be wanking all the time so maybe you need to say that to her and she needs to relax and also it shouldnt matter what time of day you do it or when you want it we are all tired and love to watch our shows but come on what is wrong with the woman how can she say no to sex just cause she is tired or watching a show no way i wouldnt...|`|xm0kLvnLaa	You need to show her these Q's and the replies you have had.

AaoLwJJWaa	lmao i like how its just people under 40, like thier too old to fall in love, but yeah i think they are (but both male and females are equally prone to fall in love tho, women just entertain the idea more).  But things like Twilight and "tThe Notebook" make some girls get unrealistic ideas though.....|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I have no idea.  I've met many men (ok, like 20 yr olds) who fell in love at the drop of a hat and wanted to get married.  Of course there are also 40 year olds who would never dream of getting married.  Same for women.  I think everyone loves the idea of love...|`|b3zGfYMpaa	I definatly have to say yes.

Some girls I know think love is fake and BS but some I know, like myself, have been in love several times and fully enjoy it!  Same goes with guys I know.  It all depends on the people you are with all the time.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	absolutely, and there is no age limit on this knowledge.|`|ReaD6u4paa	yes definetly.|`|Txr5PvXgaa	not suggested by the number of dorks who've asked me out <br>  <br>  seems after age 25 guys want to assess your marriage-worthiness on the very first date|`|fqboOITjaa	I used to think that women were more obsessed but I think men reach a certain age they can be obsessed with the idea of being in love........now that's some men not all men of course!|`|gd5XGTakaa	most likely... but guys fall in love to... i'm a strong believer in love<br>  but i would have to say that... guys are more like sex... then love... maybe.... but that is not all of us|`|qDl5Gegbaa	i would have to say yes|`|cFB6f7Khaa	yes but i have a question to ask you

This is ultimately about the disconnect you and your husband have as far as your daughter is concerned.  By him not backing you up in allowing you this small amount of privacy, it shows your daughter that she can easily manipulate situations to get what she wants.|`|m81dfyOYaa	There's no privacy with children in the house, especially toddlers.  When my kids were toddlers one or both of them would sit on the bathroom floor while I was on the toilet. I wasn't comfortable anyway having the two of them outside a closed door. The were lightening fast and as long as it took me to took a potty break they'd be into something. I decided I was better off have my privacy invaded than some kind of mishap or accident in the house.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	I agree with you 100%.  Plus, what is he teaching your daughter?  To be impatient works?  That someone will give you what you want immediately?  Trying posing it to him that way...Say it's time we teach her that she has to wait sometimes when she wants something.  And that we can't always go into rooms we want to, we need to let other people do what they need to do before we can see them, and we don't always get what we want when we want it.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Let your husband know that you are trying to teach your daughter 'boundaries' and respect and that he needs to be on the same page as you.|`|HRIbmp67aa	i think there are alot more things in the world to worry about.  tell your husband not to do that...duh!|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	I don't see the big deal, she is your daughter.  She wants to be with her mommy.  You won't have moments of privacy after having children.  Our bathroom at home is almost a community bathroom, when I am in there my nine year old daughter almost always comes in and chats with me.  It's no big deal.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i think you should be upfront and honest with your husband that you don't like it when he unlocks the door...that you want your privacy for just a couple of minutes and then your daughter can come in...maybe he doesn't know it bothers you so much cuz you haven't told him so.|`|JgvQDjf2aa	Why do you feel the need to hide yourself from your daughter. It's not unhealthy for her to see you, She has all the same bits and pieces and as she grows it gives her the opportunity to ask questions and you to answer.|`|iPFUJXvpaa	how long does it take to change clothes ?does he open it cause you have been in the room for 1-2hrs .?do you invade his privacy ? once you are married privacy hardly exists specially with kids ..|`|jBigEy0Caa	Welcome to motherhood!  My privacy went out the window when I had kids.  If it bothers you that bad, you need to talk to him about it.|`|xvwyv7Gdaa	You have no more privacy!|`|W0KQTXrvaa	you lock your doors in your own home now that's strange|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	Sounds like you need to lock them both out....lol.|`|gQBqgzJmaa	I think you need to talk to him about it.  If it bothers you, he shouldn't do it - it's not a big deal, something that you need to argue right or wrong over.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like he's just being lazy and would rather go against your wishes for privacy than deal with entertaining your daughter for the minute it takes you to get changed.|`|eawDlYHnaa	id just sit and talk to him about how he can't just do that now that you have kids. hes probably not intentionally doing it but if it bothers you, you should bring it up.|`|571936ad53ab66f6abcc2c8a72f73b3faa	WoooooooooW i hope u arnt planning on staying married for long if you are worried about that.

p8eknTQQaa	Hello, I wish you all the best, I would want to know how to solve this, but it is not easy to solve these things quickly.<br>  If you need to talk you may email me and if you need to talk live on a messaging service, that would be good, so send me an email for any support.<br>  Where do you live? if you live in the UK you may phone me if you need to talk to someone else, I know what its like to feel like there is no way out.<br>  I don't know if you have ever tried any sort of meditation, I think little exercises to balance your senses and the two sides of the mind.<br>  <br>  As many calming things as possible.<br>  This world is not easy, the mind and body take many tests, there really are ways to change things, there are miracles out there, sometimes they are so small we don't see them.<br>  <br>  You must feel hope, it takes time to get it back, but it is worth it.<br>  <br>  Understand that we all have learnt to be who we are, that means to me, that we are not solid, we can change the way we think and feel, we are changing all the time, so we can do things, sometimes very small things, that change our whole self.<br>  I really do want the best for you, you must need someone to hold you, the problem is that a lot of people find it hard to see the child inside and they find it hard to see what other people really want, I try to find people that understand closeness and that we hold with in us everything that we have ever been.<br>  Those parts of us deep inside, they need nurturing, they need your warmth.<br>  <br>  Your a wonderful human, sad to hear about your dad, hope inside he understands and one day will open up and see who you are.<br>  He himself is hiding his true self, if he was not hiding the real him, he would have understood, for the deepest part of ourselves understands all.<br>  There for, the more you understand yourself, the more you understand everyone and everything else.<br>  The more you trust yourself, the more you trust others and the more they trust you.<br>  The more strength you see you have, the more strength you will have.<br>  Believe that its possible for you to heal yourself, you may not make changes that you would want or expect, but it is always a good thing to believe in a good thing, something like being confident, the more you tell yourself you are confident, you become confident.<br>  <br>  The things that make you happy, the basic things, with everything removed, with all the pain and all the connections, connections to this world, people, objects, with all of that removed, the basic things that make you happy and feel strong, those are the things you need to surround yourself with, you can then use those things to make other areas of your life happier and more comfortable.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope at least some of what I have said is a help<br>  <br>  You may get in touch with me anytime<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  <br>  Believe me, I care about all the people that are finding life very hard, this is life, we are in it together, it is our joint responsibility to help each other and make this world good.|`|EmuGiGjJaa	It really sucks to feel so down. But grief is a gift from God, so feel it. Only the passage of time is going to help you get over this guy, but you need to work on yourself. Ignore the unsupportive banter from those who don't understand. Try to get some help from a professional. I will have you in my prayers, look up sweetie.|`|Pbsayz4Aaa	its very hurting...<br>  try to firget him ,or attempt to get him back but dont let ur dignity fall ..dont act like a lost baby,,i really cant help you<br>  take care<br>  i will pray|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	Its time to learn from this experience and not repeat it again.  Trying to kill yourself isn't going to get you anywhere and I wouldn't expect your boyfriend to bail you out this time.  You need to figure out where you are and nuture yourself back to health.  But, when you try to kill yourself you are turning people against you, you against you and who have you got at that point?  Nobody.  So, start afresh and do something nice for yourself today.  Hang out with a friend.  Go out for ice cream.  Exercise.  Whatever you like to do, but treat yourself with respect and others will treat you with respect.|`|4e11GJVZaa	There is no straight answer. I know too many people who have gone through similar situations, and some are still going through. You just gotta confide in your friends and count your blessings. You never know what you might lose next.<br>  Never underestimate your friends, they will ALWAYS be there for you.|`|juEMQEtDaa	Well You should try talking to your parents or whoever you live with and just tell them how you feel and how upset and depressed you are.<br>  If you have any brothers or sisters talk to them and ask if they can talk to your parents.<br>  x hope i helped x|`|ZuLjIHgUaa	You guy's heve been together for almost 3 years and no formal break up!. that is not cool. seems too easy for him to do that in my poin of view!<br>  anyway.<br>  Every one feels like that at some point in their lives for some reson or another. You just have to remember your only goal in life is to make you happy. So don’t dwell on the past or worry about the future just live in the moment and do what makes you happy. Try thinking of something you want to do a goal and strive for it you will be suprised at how good it feels. keep your head up I have faith in you.|`|CRsSw0ssaa	Suicide is just Selfishness.|`|KasFZL7laa	aww i'm so sorry.  please spend a lot of time with your friends and try to see a therapist.  if you already see one try to schedule more appointment.  i am deeply sorry for what you are dealing with.  if you want to talk, go to my profile and email me.

I would talk to you as a friend only but what most guys are thinking about is absolutely disgusting when they are way older than you.  <br>  <br>  I have a 17 year old daughter, a 14 year old daughter and a daughter who will be 13 in April. <br>  <br>  I also don't understand guys like that who want to be with someone who is in a totally different generation than what the guys grew up in.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	Sounds like you have a complaint, not a question. if you are 15 and you look like you are 21 (believe me, ive seen some girls who look older, its not impossible) then you should feel flattered, but once you say you are 15, they should back off.|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	Unfortunately fashion is often a little too adult for young girls nowadays and make girls who are 15 seem as if they are older and thereby more available. If you want to avoid that attention, you might like to try to dress a bit younger.|`|zHQVlXd5aa	Maybe you look older so they think they can hit on you or maybe they are just creepy guys.

Older men can easily fool a young girl by offering her a ride or luring them some way to there place ... its common all over the world . That is why ur mom tells you to stay from guys !! listen to her ...|`|skurMIyYaa	Haha,same problem but im twelve and look like im 18. Thats pretty bad. Lol, usall ythe makeup. There is no real reason.. they usally either are pedofile or really think that your beautiful!

Hope it helps. <br>  <br>  <br>  btw ; <br>  www.myspace.com/xxteenagenightmarexx<br>  <br>  :D|`|fKuvMPCiaa	There are some weirdos out there...some guys are into having sex with little kids|`|RuFZABFxaa	Enjoy the attention because it does fade.  Wow I remember my teen girlfriends and now it's like, "Did the earth tilt on its axis or what?"<br>  <br>  Plain and simple - teen girls are hot.

I did I used to be able to get into clubs and buy smokes for my friends.  <br>  <br>  Just don't date them that for sure they are only after one thing if they know how old you are.   Men go after the young ones because they are inexperienced they are easier to manipulate.  Its really sick.  Just be careful.|`|arjadO5daa	Some of them could be pedophiles. Even if you like them don't go and run away with them. It could be extremely dangerous. If you want to date someone, date someone you like AND you know you can trust. Don't be too risky.|`|9scpRClxaa	Girls tend to look older than they are these days.  Age is hard to judge sometimes.  Next time some older guy hits on you, ask him if what he would do if some guy his age hit on his teenage daughter...or if he's pretty good looking, if he has a son about your age...|`|IWzYB44raa	I don't know why men are like that.  It creeps me out too!  Sometimes I wonder if there are any good guys anymore or if they have all been replaced by pervs.  At least you notice it and realize why they are doing it so that you can protect yourself from them.|`|y1uppUHcaa	Men are pigs! Disgusting pigs! All they think about is sex, and for some odd reason teen girls are their fantasy. Something about stripping away a young girls innocene makes them horny. Blahh.|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	see men do hit on 20 year olds.....you probably look older than you are....|`|k9uspUrTaa	Umm I was 16 when I started dating my husband and he is 6 years older than me. Just because a guy that is older than you hits on you doesn't  mean that they necessarily want to have sex with you. Sometimes its actually a good thing to date an older man because they are more mature. But if your being hit on by 50 year olds then yes that is CREEPY! But other than that its not that big of a deal.|`|qnd4UbNYaa	well if you're attractive you can't really blame them. and i really hope for all those guys sake that they are just being nice and complementing you because otherwise they're screwed if someone hears them say something like that. but pretty much if you want a short answer they hit on you probibly cuz you're jailbait :D|`|wfGGIOLJaa	Maybe present yourself in a different way...if you don't want them to look at you, then do something about it.|`|g1955IgRaa	you must be very hott and maybe even look like your 20 but how am i soposed to no lol :P|`|MoK5vTjWaa	Well in all honestly you might look older so they might not know how old you really are, but the 50 year old men..ew. And the same thing happens to me. I work at a gas station and one man used to come in there and be like I'd like to take you on vacation and get you alone. It really creeped me out and pissed my bf off. So just say thank you for the compliment and get out of the situation as soon as possible|`|B6i8ruekaa	It could be from the way that you dress or some small movement you do. There is just a plethora of reasons why they hit on you, most likely that you are a pretty girl. Just back away and let them know somehow that their comments are not appreciated.|`|e5bqqjtmaa	stop being a ho|`|cn04Dmzeaa	If she curves like a woman, has boobs like a woman then she must be a woman and that means for some, fair game and they don't know your 15 unless you're wearing a shirt that says so, and even then you could have gotten that shirt 4 years ago.<br>  It's a matter of you passing as 18 by the way you dress or your style, this is a huge factor because there are so many 15 year olds who dress like 20-25 year olds, some girls develop much faster.<br>  <br>  Another thing is your presentation. If you're wearing tight jeans that outline your figure, low cut shirts, push up bras and short skirts, this presentation is going to cause men to look and notice you and if they feel inclined to do so, comment on it. <br>  It's all about perception.|`|RWKXu3bKaa	i know what you mean it is gross the next time a 30 year old guy asks you out play along then take him to the police and get him arrested hahahahahahaha  lol so try and b carefull next time|`|KqlN0rduaa	i'm 15 but a guy and for real i think they are molesters lol but being honest you sound really sexxiii but yeah i'm at school so i have to lay low=]!!|`|MEN0lnlraa	men hit on everything they see....they don't bother thinking whether or not it's morally acceptable to do so, I worked in a gym,  I should know..|`|4UkyrTKZaa	Well, umm maybe you dress too provacativly and thats what makes them think your older<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090303170124AAaihd4">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|h1EIiq5taa	Hey I have the same problem guys hit on us because they want sex just ignore them I know its hard cos they are very hot but just try and ignore them dont have sex with them|`|VVH1KWaaaa	don't hang around them. and make sure you're dressing your age. if you "look" older and you dress older then they are going to think you ARE older.|`|wcv3aksOaa	It is simple..., you  probably has a very beautiful, attractive body <br>     You are young, but you have a adult body. <br>  For example: Nice butt...and others things... ;)|`|fIvJPtY9aa	Well I had the same problem Just ignore them and if u feel harassed then talk to someone about it like your mother. Your right they only want one thing don't do it
Dkb2ZR3Daa	Communication and honesty is key.<br>  I have been with my fiance for 5 years, and it that 5 years it has included his absence for basic training, AIT training, deployment training, and now deployment/tour in Iraq. <br>  <br>  I wrote to him every day or every chance I could! Even if the letter wasn't long, or I couldn't think of things to say, I would write little things like what I did during the day, what family members were doing, how school was going, work, the weather, just anything I could think of.<br>  I think your girlfriend also needs to be mature enough to understand that you will be VERY busy, and that you aren't ignoring her. I maybe got 10 letters and 3 phone calls the entire time of basic. <br>  <br>  We were very open with expectations and dedicated to our relationship and keeping it.  You both need to be able to trust each other and realize it is stressful on both ends.(Sometimes stress get's the best of you and you take it out on the other person) You need to always be their for each other.. Like your own little personally cheerleading team for each other and try to support each other.|`|74899a0ccf16967b028c8f8857f91af3aa	9.5 weeks away from each other isn't a very long time.  Keep the relationship alive by emailing and talking every day.|`|k9uspUrTaa	if it is meant to be then you guys will find someway to make this relationship works. My husband is a marine so it is hard to be away from someone you love but we have made it work. <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|BjyXKFpRaa	communication call when you can, texting and writing letters|`|r7tWe5dqaa	Well letters can be all you need to keep the relationship going. You can send each other romantic poems or song lyrics. She can sent you care packages(depending on how strict your co is) or photographs. And never overlook the fact that you are able to make phone calls almost every Sunday and sometimes during the week too. If you REALLY want to make it work you can. And training is a good time to look at your relationship and see if you think it is what you want for the long term. If you can't make it through training you will never make it through a deployment. I know this is probably all stuff you have heard before but it's all true.|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	in a letter: Always keep the mood upbeat. No whining and groaning.     and if or when you get the chance to call her (even though those times will be few) ALWAYS be in a  good mood. Dont act depressed or angry for being where you are. It'll hit her hard so thats a no-no :P|`|BNopOIszaa	Keep reminding her how much you care and love her.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	the main thing is you have to have trust if you both do you will see that the time will come you can be together again|`|AA11142539	email and phone calls every day are impossible in basic.<br>  <br>  mail is the best option, but finding time to write when you just want to sleep is gonna be rough.  <br>  <br>  your situation is rough.  dunno how long you've been with her, but I recommend considering marriage as the army is a lot easier on married folk than single soldiers.
dcd11iUwaa	maybe hes just not ready hon.<br>  give him time|`|AN9PdKmgaa	4 months is nothing and be glad he doesn't just rush into things! slow down and let nature take its course|`|V5CRGK86aa	The harsh reality may be that, if you two have been dating for this long and he won't claim you as his girlfriend, he is waiting for someone better to come along. Especially if you two are sexually active. He knows he can come to you whenever he feels, but that's all he's using you for. He is simply waiting for someone better to cross his path. <br>  <br>  Move on honey, and stop wasting your time!|`|pUUyYz4gaa	Touchy situation, especially since he doesn't want to see you sad, but he hasn't committed to you yet...<br>  <br>  I'd give it a little time and space, for now.  Ultimately, he has to tell you either that you two are an item or why the two of you aren't.
FZKFLTyLaa	She's not ready for a committed relationship but it may evolve into one. <br>  Do what you think best based on that sure knowledge
RRmwRLzsaa	haha. <br>  you have to jump on situations like that.<br>  haha.<br>  and im pretty and single.<br>  have been single for awhile...|`|3uZTHLYMaa	It's not always like that<br>  <br>  My 2nd best friend is really beautiful and she hasn't never dated before and she is 17 yrs old<br>  But it's not becuz she can't date but cuz she doenst want it for now,she wants 1st graduate from school ....<br>  <br>  But it is relative...|`|rXIAcL7waa	that's on the contrary... the "10" is rarely in a relationship cause men are so intimidated with her beauty...|`|uHQmgV9oaa	probably because they're pretty???? duhhhh.... y r the fugliest girls always single??? and you can't wait if they're that hot. after she's done with this weeks choice just ask her out.|`|aKc85y92aa	Lmao, don't you like pretty girl?|`|Lsz5Nqw7aa	why put off til tomorrow wat ya can do today?? and obviously the reason pretty girls are never single is because all the other guys can see that she's pretty and they ask her out too!!! pretty straight forward!!!|`|7sxGW40qaa	They are pretty, that's why.  I knwo it sux big ones, but if you want to make a move, then you should do it quickly and without fear.
28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	You know what...you don't need to feel guilty and you don't need to apologize. This guy broke into your email account, which in itself is illegal. He completely invaded your privacy, and he read an email that you sent to your mother. HE needs to apologize.<br>  <br>  About the email itself, don't worry about it. It was an email to your mother, and a private one at that. You were hurt and you stretched the truth. So What. This is what people do when they are hurt, and just broke up with somebody. I can't tell you how many times I've talked crap on an ex to my friends or mother that wasn't necessarily true. Also, all you did was say they were snobs, for christ sake...its not even that bad, which leads me to believe that he is using this to make him feel better about the breakup...he could be feeling guilty about something himself. <br>  <br>  Now for the 'getting him back' part. I'm gonna be a bit blunt here, and I don't want you to take offense...call it tough love ;)<br>  <br>  You are making yourself sound absolutely desperate in this situation. If he broke up with you, he had a reason, and you should not get back with him. I mean, how do you know he didn't meet another girl and cheat on you, and that's why he broke up with you? There's a reason he did this in the first place, and you don't know the reason, so don't rush to think you want to be back with him. Your clinginess and desperateness in this situation will just turn him off if he has been reconsidering the breakup. Its natural to feel this bad after a breakup, but time WILL heal it, I promise. For now, just move on with your life, and be happy. <br>  <br>  You are better than this! Don't let a man bring you down like this, hun. If there is one thing I can leave you with, its a Shirley McClain quote my mom told me when I was younger and hurting over a guy. It basically says that you need to concentrate on taking care of yourself before anybody else. Never look for a boyfriend to complete you, because that's your job.

Don't do something dumb and lose her because she loves you for being you.<br>  <br>  Sit her down and explain that it would make you feel great for her to accept your gifts without paying you back.  The first answerer is right...she doesn't want to be thought of as a gold digger.  I have the same issues with men because I am a single black mother.

The attendants walked before us as couples.|`|sGP6s7uraa	My parents may or may not show, too.  If they do show, they will seat themselves wherever they wish to sit (we're not having a formal wedding where people are ushered to their seats).  I will walk down the aisle alone.  In this situartion, you can break tradition and "etiquette" to suit your needs.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	traditionally, the parents and/or grandparents are escorted to their seats.  then the groom & groomsmen walk to their places at the alter.  the bridesmaids come first, then the ring bearer, the flowergirls, and the last to go down the aisle is the bride.<br>  <br>  not everyone keeps to tradition these days - - so you can really do whatever you want.  My father passed away and I didn't want a stand-in person to give me away so my fiance & I talked and we decided that our procession will be the groomsman & bridesmaid walk up the aisle, the best man & moh walk up the aisle together, then the ringbearers and flowergirls and finally we will walk in together.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Now a days you don't need anyone to walk you down the aisle. I did it by myself, it was fine. My father had past away. Traditionally it was the father "giving you away" to the groom. Going from one household to another. Unless you are close to your brother or an uncle, do this alone. You don't want to just grab someone to do this with you. <br>  The groom and groomsmen are already at the alter, waiting on you. They don't walk down the aisle. <br>  They bridesmaids walk down the aisle one by one, by themselves, ahead of you.<br>  After the ceremony, you and your new groom walk back down together, each bridesmaid takes an arm of a groomsman and follows you out of the sanctuary.|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...<br>  hope that helps!!!|`|CsdJNke9aa	The groomsmen can walk the bridesmaids down the aisle or they can walk down alone. Whichever you choose to do. As you the bride, usually it is the father however in cases like this or when they father has passed away then the Bride usually has someone else of her choice walk her down the aisle, it can be a brother, an uncle a close friend or just about anybody of her choosing.

Traditional or not, it doesn't matter who walks you as long as you enjoy your day.<br>  <br>  When my husband & I were married, his mother couldn't come because she can not fly (she is in Scotland), so we asked a friend of the family if she would be "mom for the day" and step in and take over as my husband's mother during the candle ceremony.|`|ZqK045Svaa	for jewish people, normally the mother and father walk down the isle (that is for both bride and groom)<br>  for others, the father walks the bride down the isle, the groom walks himself down, and the grooms men walk the bridesmaids, and the best man walks the maid of honor,<br>  the mother and father of the groom dont walk down, they are already seated<br>  if you dont have a father to walk you down, normally someone who is a father figure, such as a brother, child hood friend, other family member (ie uncle, cousin, nephew, son) and if you don't want to do it traditionally or none of those are an option for you, somepeople walk down by themselves, some have their mother walk them down too if their father isn't around! also if your very nontradional, i have even seen dogs walk the bride down the isle, lol,<br>  hope i helped|`|1TQTw2bnaa	A lot of traditions, like brides being 'given away', are old-fashioned and thankfully falling out of favor.

In Christian weddings, the men are usually up front waiting for the women to get there. The BMs escort themselves up to the front and then pair up with a groomsman to go back.|`|AA11196473	I went to a wedding where the groom was waiting for the bride outside the church as she arrived.  He escorted her inside followed by the bridesmaids and groomsmen. <br>  <br>  The only difference there was that the "giving away" by the father of the bride took place outside the church but I do not see why you are your fiance cann't walk in together.|`|884v4VhGaa	Traditionally the bride and groom walk down the aisle together. However, a lot of people have the parents walk down with their children. <br>  <br>  The bridesmaids walk down together. Sometimes they walk two-by-two, but often they just walk single file, so there's no-on walking them down.|`|LfpfHcMNaa	The bride walks down the isle, without or without the father|`|OvaNVAbZaa	I can totally relate. I was never close to my Dad (he was verbally abusive when I was growing up) and always wanted my Mom to walk me down the aisle. She died 2 years ago and I'm getting married next year. I don't think my Dad deserves the honor or walking me. I might have my fiance walk me - I look at it as us walking down the path to our new life together. I don't know how I'm going to tell my Dad but he is just going to have to get over it. If my Dad dies before my wedding, I think I will ask my brother-in-law who I am very close to. Do you have a close uncle, cousin, brother-in-law or male friend? On second thought, who says it has to be a male? I think you should do whatever you want because it's your day!!!! Good luck!

Chances are, if you and your partners love each other, you'll both accept this experience happily. As time goes on, it'll inevitably get better.|`|n7swYJHPaa	Well come on now you cant be that much of a virgin you should at least know what happens|`|GJycKc5Laa	well u insert the....never mind then|`|WtTUNC8Naa	So to begin.<br>  <br>  You cannot have too much foreplay. This should take the form of mutual kissing, erotic massaging, exploring each other's bodies, seeing where each of you are sensitive and have erogenous spots. Don't rush. It will be over soon enough as it is.<br>  <br>  All the while as you have foreplay, your womb will be producing the all important moisture that is required. Believe us, the wetter the better. You cannot be too wet for the first time. If you are a bit adventurous, ask you partner to give you cunnilingus, and if you can, give to your partner some fellatio. These are wonderful signs of showing affection.<br>  <br>  Getting into it.<br>  <br>  Make sure after your foreplay (and perhaps fellatio) put on the condom if you haven't already. The partner may make the first move to go directly into the standard missionary position. Bad idea. It is the worst position to lose your virginity. You are not in control, and it will be more painful and you cannot do anything but lay there and take it. Instead, try the girl on top position. Here you are in control. Your vagina has never had anything in it before (like a penis) and it must accommodate it slowly...and it will.<br>  <br>  If you are losing you hymen, you are the one determining the speed and pressure with which it occurs. You will not suffer, and if you are still not wet enough, you can apply some water-based vaginal lubricant (such as K-Y). The deed is soon done, and you can get down to thrusting.<br>  <br>  At first, have your partner move without thrusting, just applying pressure while fully inserted in your vagina. As it begins to feel natural, you can your self start thrusting.<br>  <br>  At this point you can change positions (assuming your partner has lasted) and go onto your back. However, do not settle for the simple missionary position, but tilt your pelvis slightly up, and ask your partner to suspend himself on his arms and not lay on you...this when thrusting will stimulate both your clitoris and G-spot.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of variables here, but lose you virginity as we suggest, and you will have in your mind pleasant memories instead of feeling unfilled, or used.|`|7MdgnPymaa	Yes, be responsible by using protection but most importantly make sure he trully loves you and isn't just using you. Idc what anyone else thinks, Sex without love is pointless.|`|85294ca7b4849e5282e9f017650e63feaa	close ur eyes and fall asleep. dream of something amazing. set an alarm so u don't sleep in too much. lol<br>  <br>  i know that not what u want but its what u get

Uj5kuzoJaa	If you're not sure that it's what you want to do, then you should probably wait until you're sure. I moved in with my bf and we had only been dating for two months. We've been together for almost three years now and we're still going strong. I wanted to move in with him for the same reason you have. My dad didn't like him and was trying to control how often I got to see him. I got tired of it and just left and moved in with him. I didn't even tell my dad that that's what I was doing. I waited until he was at work and packed all my stuff and left a note for him. Looking back, I really regret not talking to him first because he was so furious at me that we didn't talk for four months after I left. Now we're back to being friends again and he actually likes my fiance. Try telling your dad that you need a little more free time with your bf. If you're over 18 then he shouldn't be unreasonable about it. All in all to answer your question, wait until you are 100% sure that that is what you want. I knew what I wanted to do and I had no doubts about it. Btw no matter how mad your parents get at you, they will always let you move back in. You're still their daughter. Hope this helps|`|KasFZL7laa	that is way too soon to be moving in with someone.  don't do it.  just stay with your parents and continue building your relationship with your boyfriend.|`|c1e077ca88966e8fba4354709743a0bfaa	Don't move in.

That way, you might be able to get to know each other better, and become really good friends.|`|El2OyTztaa	Well if he is insecure about his relationship with his girlfriend you might have some semi-violent confrontations unless you can either show you're no threat to him & her, or befriend him through an introduction by her?

MI8WTnL4aa	wow thats weird. Personally if it is worrying you I would tell your boyfriend. Esp as he's a cop. You should keep a diary of this other guys behaviour. If you notice him following you around or he tells you he has been keep a log of it and if he doesn't stop you can take it to the police or your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend maybe on edge for a while and protective of you after you've told him but its better to tell him than keep this to yourself.|`|DlAPD2UNaa	It depends if you don't want your ex to come to any harm and if the stalking was serious or if it was just because he cared about you. If you do tell your boyfriend then you should just try and put it in the nicest way possible so he doesn't take actions. it could be a good idea to tell your boyfriend as maybe your ex could go up to him one day unexpectedly, whereas if you tell him he will be warned and have time to think of what to say to him<br>  xx|`|e3cLhuEMaa	yeah id tell your b/f and id get a restraining order ASAP|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	I THINK YOU X IS MAYBE STALKING YOU BUT IN A MILD CARING WAY, YET HE HAS TO HEAR FROM YOU AND ONLY YOU FIRST THAT ITS OVER, YOU WISHED HAD WORKED OUT BUT YOUR VERY HAPPY NOW AND HE NEEDS TO MOVE ON.

JB2dEJCzaa	yeah i think he loves her he sounds frustrated though like u said he just needs some time 2 think maybe he  needed some space its only normal 4 couples 2 have a break if things get hard
WFZB4QnSaa	I agree with you - I think it is very easy to say to someone oh let it go....<br>  <br>  Right if you love him, how about you give him space, don't bombard him with texts etc... that will push him away...<br>  <br>  Then maybe after a week or so contact him acting cheerful saying you should catch up for old times sake etc.... then when you meet him see how he behaves towards you... if the signals are positive see him again...maybe then mention you would like to start over|`|Qe95LNxYaa	there is a saying it never meant to be|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	leave the poor guy be, you want him now...until the next bad boy comes along.
1FweHEXvaa	Hiya .. thank you for the answer..<br>  <br>  <br>  To be honest with you , this is a life changing and very drastic decision for you to take. IF you are sure he is the one for you and back in his country he can support you and your child only then go to him. otherwise dont leave evrything and go there, Imagine if you go to him and sell everything off here and then 2 months later he dumps you? or when you go to him he doesnt have enough money to support you or feed your son then what?<br>  <br>  you can not risk to live in a world of dreams therefore think about the consequences, Going there if you are definite he can support you for your whole life and is worth going then go to him, However if you know that he wont ever marry you and cannot support you AND your child then dont risk leaving everything and going there. Unless your flat that you have here you rent it out and get the rent pay monthly by direct debit to you in his country. DONT sell your property off though even if you do end up going.<br>  <br>  Talk about it and think properly before you go.<br>  <br>  Think AND plan.  hope that helped x|`|AA12048821	its a big risk...if you want to, go over with your son for a few days and see the place, try to get a feel for it and ask yourself and your son , how you both would like to stay there for the rest of your lives. if you feel its okay and you really love this guy..get married and settle there. but if you still feel confused or have second thoughts dont . <br>  as for coming back here, dont hold your breath..if he' left once because he couldnt afford to live here the chances of his coming back are very remote. unless he can find a suitable job, its a certain that he wont come back.|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	NO!!!!  Do NOT move to Trinidad.  And you want words of advice... my words of advice are that you do everything possible to take care of your son (you didn't say if this boyfriend is his father so I'm assuming not).  You are a MOTHER now and that MUST come first (sorry, but you'll know this is true when he turns 18).  By the way if you don't have enough money to get married, you do NOT have enough money to move to Trinidad.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	well i have recently moved 90miles away from my family and friends due to my fella's job promotion.<br>  even tho i am in the same country i have given up everything to be with him. my job, my friends and my family.<br>  i cant find a job so i have no money unless he gives me it so i cant get a train back home for the day. <br>  i feel trapped and im so alone coz he works full time.<br>  i couldnt imagine going so far away like trinidad coz im cut off here nevermind if i went over there.<br>  <br>  also you need to think of you sons education he will definatly get a better education here. its a long flight for an adult nevermind an 8 year old child. <br>  <br>  if you do go it may not work out so you will need to able to get back here. you will need money for that.<br>  <br>  there is alot of things to consider when a child is involved. <br>  <br>  personally i think that if he can just drop everything and move back like that i wouldnt go. he has already made his mind up and he seems very stubborn. if he wanted to marry you he wouldve took you with him or tryed hard to stay here.|`|vUVxS9Xhaa	Yeah i dont think you should move there...its not like he is saying lets get married is it? <br>  <br>  If he doesnt come back he doesnt come back i think the best thing for you to do would be to attempt to move on or you could try the long distance thing for a while but dont jump up and move.|`|3c16014d856b5c9c247a5aad68823956aa	I know it will be tough on you. Let him go, you keep doing what your doing and take great care of your son. Don't give up your life for this or any man.|`|O5KOwhovaa	T/T is basically a third world country.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't bother moving there.|`|jrdtQi04aa	Do not leave what you have in order to move to Trinidad.  You have no family there, and no place to live, no job.  Nothing.  I wouldnt do it.  You have a child to care for.  You need to stay where you are and take care of your son.  If he loves you, he will come back.  You have no idea what you are going to.  You may be coming out of the frying pan and jumping into the fire.  Sometimes guys can change on you when the situation is different.  However, I must say that I am somewhat of a jaded personality, and I dont give trust that easily.  But  I wouldnt go.
cd0AdJpDaa	hi PJ... I m prathap from India. being an Indian I think i fully understand the modern Indian man.<br>  India and America r extremely different cultures and shock him. <br>  In India even women believe that men r born to dominate them.<br>  sadly, yes I think it will mostly lead to trouble.. Indian and a American see things in a different perspective and its highly likely it will land in trouble<br>  but if both the understand their differences and learn to respect them then there will no domination from the man or any  problem for the woman.<br>  all the best|`|zjpvZ5knaa	Well yes, but hindu's are not bad compared to muslims. Muslims are extremely dominate over women, the reason for that is their religion. Muslims learn from the quran (their holy book) from very early to control the women to keep them in line. Its so extreme, a wife can be hung to death if she is caught at her own HOME without a male supervising her! thats insane right there. As for the relationship, I think it could work out, there just needs to be some boundaries, if he cant take them, then i dont think the relationship would work out well for the woman.|`|1770c7574e98befdabd3d54687581695aa	yes definitely, its natural for a Indian man to be dominate over a woman than a "US" man, that's how MAJORITY of the men are, in my opinion, even in the UK!|`|Vmt7ylcuaa	Good interaction, tolerance and mutual understanding will help a couple manage their days....|`|F3LBgfvwaa	It sounds like trouble.

nvXAfLMCaa	Ok, that was a lot of information! What I would do is get everyone together, at a sleepover or something where everyone can talk to everyone (not behind their backs). idk kinda like what they do at the end of That 70's show. Have everyone express there feelings on what's been happening. Or you could just talk to everyone separetly. Tell them how you feel about whats been going on, hopefully they will apologize, and be there for you. If neither of those work, then get new friends that actually care for you.<br>  good luck sweety!! hope i helped!|`|2I5XqMDzaa	dump the mean friends and stop trying with them. people change in highschool stick to people who r ur REAL FRIENDS
84sEpgEPaa	Did he know he had a daughter? If not then it will be shock for him and of course you should be upset. The implications for you now will affect things. There will always be that financial and emotional attachment to your lives and that will affect you because you might not always have his full attention and you may lose income as a result.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about it and will have to make a very important decision. The problem now is what he is going to do about it. If he decides to try and have contact with the baby then you may feel a little left out and not like him having an attachment elsewhere. On the other hand if he wants nothing to do with the baby then how can you ever respect him and want him as a father for your own children. <br>  It's a catch 22 situation.   Just think very hard about things. I am in your situation and it really is difficult, I often wonder how much easier life would be if I was with someone who did not have a child with someone else. It affects both our financial situation and I often have to come second.|`|AA11841749	If he didn't know he had a child, you can't be upset with him. He has already missed the first 5 years of her life (not his fault), so he will probably bond a lot more with your child when y'all have one. Just be supportive, and good luck with it all.|`|d89qNyb6aa	Yes you are right to be upset.<br>  I wouldn't have kids with this man.He might leave you also.<br>  Or maybe he didn't know about the baby.If this is the case then I would support him through it all.He will be more upset than you.|`|C3sqTngtaa	you can be upset, but if he genuinly didnt have a clue then dont give him a hard time - be supportive, its gunna change his and your life now!|`|5apGkgS9aa	yes you will be upset thats normal reaction but if he really did not know then all you can do is be supportive|`|3YIjKQTEaa	If he didn't know either then I don't think you have a right to be upset. <br>  It's probably more of a shock to him than it is to you. <br>  <br>  If he knew and didn't tell you then yeah baby you can be a little mad.|`|YJA9ojYwaa	If you've been going out with him for over 5 years then be very upset, if not then don't go nuts at him but find out the mother.|`|9EiGOJaWaa	you should be upset but you have to be there|`|JRoaOqEIaa	The only reason you should be upset is if he doesn't care, and never goes to see her... Then you'll know not to have children with him, because he's not a decent father. Please support him and encourage him to visit her, because speaking from personal experience, having no father is like having a missing piece from a jigsaw, and you never feel complete... If he does visit her without hesitasion then pleaase don't be upset with him, just be glad you can truust him, and make some gorgeous babies! =D

Do you really want to drag out a few more months dealing with legal fees and more arguments with your ex.  Be the mature one and tell her that can have whatever she wants (remember these "things" can be replaced) and remind her that things that are still in your possession should be picked up asap.  She sounds bitter and like putting up a fight will keep you in her life.  If your ready to let go then let go of everything easily letting her know that your ready to move on. Believe me once you stay calm and don't put up a fight she will stop.  If you want her still in your life then move forward with attorney fees and court fees to keep the computer and odds and ends that you treasure.  Good luck to you
C1meppOHaa	1. Think it over. Weigh the pros and cons of the situation. When you come face to face with your boyfriend, you need to be prepared for what you are going to say to him. Consider his reaction to the news and what he might say.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Meet with your boyfriend in person. Make sure the location where the break-up is going to take place is in a comfortable setting for the both of you. This will ease nerves and help make it easier to talk.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.Let your boyfriend know you have something important to say once you meet. Make it clear that he needs to listen.<br>  <br>  <br>  4.State your opinion on why you want to break up. This is the most important step. Your boyfriend needs to hear very clearly why you want to break up with him. Speak in well-thought out sentences. You need to show that you know exactly what you want so he won’t doubt your thinking.<br>  <br>  <br>  5.Ask how he feels about the situation. Keep an open mind to his opinions, but don’t lose sight of your own argument. Even though you are breaking up with him, his opinion still counts.<br>  <br>  6.Hold your ground. Once you have broken up, never go back to that relationship. Remember, you broke up with your boyfriend for a reason, so don’t forget it. Don’t be convinced that your boyfriend has changed in such a short period of time, because chances are, he hasn’t.|`|CmS7Sfhaaa	Just be honest with your significant other and tell them you need to sit down and talk.  Let them know how you are truely feeling and the reasons you don't think it is working any more.  Don't physically touch them or try to kiss them at the end.  Maybe a hug...but that is it!!|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Well, know that there is no way you're going to get out of this without either hurting someone and/or making them angry.  But you MUST stay true to yourself and always be honest.  So, set up a time to meet with him/her, make sure s/he knows you have something serious you'd like to talk about, and then when you meet "This is very hard for me, so please be paitient.  I have really enjoyed the time we've spent together and I will always treasure our friendship.   But it's time for  us to break away and end our relationship.  I don't have a specific reason, because it's not about you or anything you've done, it's just that my feelings have changed.  I hope you can understand."   And then... RUN (sorry).  Be prepared for dealing with feelings of sadness or hurt.  If this person scares you in any way then you should be sure there is a friend waiting for you (out of the picture of course).

Either way he might be hurt and questions will raise in his head like why? and this is where you need to give him answer because if you dont he will go crazy, trust. He will want to know why, right? Ok then tell him, tell him that your sorry you just dont feel the same anymore and only you know why? I know it’s difficult to tell the truth but at least you are not lying to him and when it’s over you have a clear conscience. Breaking up is hard to do and telling the truth is hard as well because you dont want to hurt him  but you need to let him know that your intensions are not to hurt him you just need time and space.Tell him how much you value his friendship and would like to continue. Think positive and not negative.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Gail Friend|`|VFdC2wPlaa	Start by taking them somewhere, like out for coffee. If you have been dating for a long time, then you should just tell them in private. Tell them that your sorry but that you don't think it is going to work out anymore. You don't have to give an explanation if you don't want to... but it's up to you. Tell them how your feeling, and that your really sorry. You can also say something that will make them feel better, like you think they are great, but your just not meant to be together.

I hope you are using protection because you can't really believe that you are able to tell if a person has an STD just by looking at them.  No, no, that would be stupid.  In any case, just ask her why she doesn't like the lights on.  If you two are having sex then there's not much else she should be hiding from you.

zM0ag4NLaa	because its fun|`|bDW2BW0Naa	As u have mentioned u might be getting involved into thinking about something and do not want to be disturbed. Kind of your mind is already occupied with something. when sombody talks to you at that moment your reaction might be of irritation type. Probably cause u do not want to get deviated to the new topic.<br>  <br>  Try to calm yourself and get adjusted to the fact and surroundings. There can be plenty of time you could think around when alone. Keep things to the right place. If you have friends share jokes and see if this helps.|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Maybe you don't get alot of attention at home so you try to seek attention at school and because your still kids its easier to get attention. This is probably why easily.|`|ykcgrOBzaa	it's possible|`|PlDiJFi0aa	Because you are mad.<br>  Hahahahahahahhahaha......................
gT74D0Ggaa	No no no. Dildo's work alot better!|`|UTPQ9bLMaa	that is kinda weird...but i don't think tampons would stop diarrhea.  trying finding another type of medicine. or eat a lot of cheese. lol|`|AUa4m0Qgaa	WTF dude. seriously what r u gonna do stick it up ur but? drink lots of liquid and look for another medicine. hahaha ur weird!|`|PzboDDI2aa	dont stick the tampon in there it will find another place to come out|`|SWf2vJN0aa	WTF Mate. LMAO LOLOLOLOLOL. GIVE IT A TRY|`|RmmO10xSaa	LOL|`|VSWl45cKaa	Get someone to bring you Immodium (or a store brand as long as it contains Loperamide HCl) and take it according to the directions.<br>  <br>  Always use 'the right tool for the right job'. Tampons werne't made for that. Immodium will help control it.|`|UgcPxd4maa	Do not put a tampon in your behind. Its very dangerous and poisonous to your body to try and stop that......problem you're having. Just stay home....and near the bathroom!|`|16vMIGPiaa	A cork is not what you need.<br>  Your guts think there's something bad in there and are trying to get it out.<br>  Drink lots of fluids for sure.  Include something like a sports drink that has sugar and electrolytes.|`|XLjSYo67aa	ok um WTF? i dont think so but tampons do really work for a bloody nose! its sounds weird and looks weird but it really does work!!! :) lol|`|RAatxTeSaa	Thats a funny and weird question. no it doesnt. Drink water and juices|`|7SPe4iRbaa	ur a man and u like things up your azz!!!! ha ha
IZvbv5ONaa	He probably doesn't realize he was flirting with you.  He probably enjoys your company and would consider going out with you if he didn't have a girlfriend.  That doesn't mean he is playing games with you.  More likely, it just means he is a nice guy who happens to have a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  It seems like he wouldn't mind being friends with you.  Why don't you just keep acting the same way?  Sometimes it is easier to hang out with the opposite sex when they are taken because there is no tension or pressure to take things any further than just a simple friendship...<br>  <br>  Don't make a big deal out of this.  Either way, it is probably a good thing you make friends with him because he probably has some friends that you might like that aren't taken!
41JhpCRpaa	just leave  her a message say'n thinking about you i am here for you, and just don't bug her, but let here know you are there for her and she will appreciate it!|`|AA11160104	you have to kind of feel her out to see what you think is best, but here is my suggestion: let her know you are there for her, would like to try to help however you can or at least listen if she wants to vent.  make sure she knows you are available if she needs you, but beyond that i wouldn't bug her too much.  I know if I'm not in a good mood I don't want people constantly bugging me about it, that just puts me in a worse mood.  I hope everything works out well soon :)|`|8xPWd35maa	I think that you should probably just drop her an e-mail and give her time to respond.   Don't go too over the top or get mad at her for being mad.   She could be PMSing or maybe there is actually something else going on.   Give her time, she will talk to you when she's feeling better.   Good luck.|`|0myrXJKMaa	Let her cool off. It sounds like even if you did try to do something nice she would not accept it. Leave her alone and let her come to you when she snaps out of it.|`|A7QROnjLaa	Note down which part of the month it is and steer clear of her during that time every month.|`|tT6GMdHiaa	leave her alone for a while then try to cheer her up|`|16vMIGPiaa	No single answer.  Depends on the person.<br>  It may be that she needs some time by herself to sort out her thoughts.  Or, she may do better by talking it out.<br>  The thing is (and it's important you get this) - it is NOT your job to solve her problems.  IF she wants to talk, then listen.  Do not offer opinions, do not fix things.  Ask her what help you can offer before making any suggestions.  Otherwise, get her talking and then pay attention.  It'll be your job to help her clarify what she thinks.  This is called Active Listening.
kbEu9uKyaa	Just write something sweet, tell her what you think about her and that you will miss her lots. My Fiance left for Uni just before last September, but it's ok, we are getting through it and even if we don't see each other, we speak to each other every day. It gets better as time goes on and if she means a lot to you, you will always make that extra bit of effort to speak to her. and I'm sure things will work out for the two of you in the end. Every now and again, we send each other week message just to let each other know what we thinking... thats always good. Also, why don't you show her this, it will show her how much she really means to you as you are willing to tell everyone.<br>  <br>  Hope this help|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you could say good luck at school Ill be here when you get back|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	if you love this girl you would know what to write. it should come naturally.|`|l8yXj7uWaa	just write your emotions ad feelings into it. while writing think about her, how she makes you feel, how shes changed your world.<br>  <br>  put a little secret joke in their that only you two would recognize, make the letter personal.<br>  <br>  put a picture in their of you two together and put a little love poem on the back. that would make the letter even more romantic:)<br>  <br>  good luck!
Z9WqYNR0aa	In most cases he is going out of his way and he is a friend. I would say pay for him or at least half of his room and flight, because you are also paying for the service you are receiving. So paying for half sound good to me.  <br>  <br>  Congrats !|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	tell him to give you a price.  he should do all the legwork and find out what his cost will be to travel, for hotel, for the people he's bringing with him, meals, the fee for your hair etc etc etc.  he should just give you 1 figure to pay.  don't concern yourself with his travel arrangements or you'll drive yourself crazy.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	It's a business transaction, therefore you pay for everything for him- his hair services, flight, and room and board. You want to take him somewhere else, so it's your job to accomodate.Some hair stylist even charge for the time they are missing from working on other clients, ex. $400/day. I doubt he'll do that for you though.  It's not necessary to pay for the others. It's only his services that you need. You do not have to invite him and his family to the wedding unless you want to. It would be nice though since you are pretty much friends with him. My wedding planner goes on cruises and destination weddings often. The couples are required to pay for everything on top of her planning fees  that are business related since she is based in Houston.|`|k3EObSxwaa	Why don't you just do your own hair, I have to assume that you have been doing it for years and no body has complained about how it looked. Beside over half the people at the wedding will not notice it anyway. My wife did her own hair and no one said anything about it, also we have been married over 61 years.
W0KQTXrvaa	when he snores and takes more than half a bed but don't you pass gas too at night?|`|u1uECuFNaa	Well, the gas thing is unavoidable.....<br>  <br>  My husband will get up many times to go use the bathroom. (Lots of water.)<br>  I wake up every time he moves, much less gets up.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	He flops himself on top of me in the middle of the night!  He's 240 pounds and then I cannot breath!  He'll snore too.  Sometimes, when it's really bad, I go sleep on the couch!|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Judging from the number of female versus male responses, apparently you women have lots more to complain about (but then that's not a surprised, is it?) :-) <br>  <br>  Here's my tale of woe (a little more than just in bed, but involves bedtime):  It is usually over an hour from the time we decide to turn out the lights and when she is finally settled in bed for the rest of the night.  She is selectively OCD -- She has a "bedtime ritual" (starting with bathroom stuff that is long and complicated and I won't bore you with), then she gets in bed, puts in her retainer, moisturizes her lips, slathers moisturizer all over her hands up to her wrists, then puts on cotton gloves.  She then ALWAYS decides to go pee one more time (just in case), and will sit there as long as it takes to get even the slightest little tinkle.  Returning to bed, she proceeds to adjust her two pillows and one body-pillow over and over again (usually takes around 10 minutes) until her little nest is just right.  Finally, we can sleep.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	About all that you can do is tell your husband that you don't like it when he sucks on your earlobes. Also tell him that you think that it is gross that he sleeps with no underwear. He doesn't know these things until you tell him. Try buying him pajamas to sleep in so maybe that would help. The gas could be caused from something that he has eaten before going to bed.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	How would wearing underwear keep his gas to himself?  Is he wearing gasproof undies?|`|jBigEy0Caa	Ask him if he wouldn't mind passing his gas in the bathroom.  The only thing that will solve your problems is talking about them.  Who knows maybe he will respect your wishes and then everybody is happy.  My husband wears ear plugs to bed every night, but I'm getting use to it.|`|KmC0K59taa	My husband doesn't do too many annoying things.  I get mad when he doesn't hit the snooze button.  Sometimes he sleeps a mile away and I want to snuggle.  I'm usually the gassy one!|`|fTiXy11caa	He wants to put his face right next to mine and I just hate <br>  his breath on my face, sometimes he has really bad breath, but even when he doesn't I still don't like breathing in my face.|`|M7CdgSNSaa	Hes a major blanket thief. It really sucks in the winter cause I will start having dreams about being cold and not being able to get warm and when I do wake up i realize its because he stole the blankets again.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	Before he gets in bed he sits on the edge and puts anti-fungal on his toenails. It's disgusting...but I want his toes to get better so I don't say anything.|`|JgvQDjf2aa	The passing of gas (more like forcing it out) and always at bed time!|`|zfbjAD0Gaa	lol without underwear? <br>  Uhm sorry, but I thinkg you have to deal with it.|`|874EAxkfaa	before bedtime give your little farter a Beano or Gas-X, that should cut the wind and toxic emissions. also tell him hear, suck this! or put duct tape over that crack, does this help?|`|NB4h4jTyaa	My husband is the first totally sleep compatible man I've ever been with. Our lives aren't perfect, but this is one area that REALLY works.<br>  <br>  Let me give you a tip that might help with the gas situation: Separate blankets. Seriously. Both my husband and I are blanket-stealers, so we started sleeping with our own duvets. The added bonus is there is a much smaller risk of be 'gassed out' by your partner.<br>  <br>  And ladies - if you think we don't pass gas ourselves when we are sound asleep, you're sadly mistaken.|`|eawDlYHnaa	when we first go to bed, he'll rub his feet on mine and i know hes just trying to be sweet but hes got sharp nails and he ALWAYS scratches me. i tell him to clip his nails and he does it but ugh, it just bothers me.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Read.<br>  <br>  My wife and I both enjoy reading, but unfortunately she reads and reads and reads and reads and reads....  at some point i'd just like to talk.  i'd mention sex here, but i'd even settle for talking.|`|USooqQlWaa	He farts and snores really loud.  So it's noisy and it stinks...not the best place for beauty sleep if you know what I mean.|`|Mkn6vYO0aa	Mine does too. But he's not sleeping. He thinks it's funny.But then again, farting is a natural habit.
0HUHHzIQaa	To get more money;<br>  Because they don't really want to get divorced;<br>  Because there is money problems (divorce costs money!);<br>  Because they don't want to be divorced juste yet because they don't want to marry the person they are currently with and that person is being too pushy about it;<br>  Because they are vindictive;<br>  ....<br>  And the list goes on.
jrdtQi04aa	If a man and woman have a lot of sex, then that is great!  As long as both parties are really having a good time.  If sex is all you've got in common, then you dont really have a relationship.  You guys need to do other things, like just talk, take a walk, play games such as chess, or board games or even card games.  You need to find out what other things you have in common other than sex. If it's nothing much, then you probably wont make it other than having great sex.  Umm.....as relationships go on, the sex fades a little, so there has to be more to it than just sex.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	no|`|sCr2iTczaa	Yes it can. If your relationship is based on sex then you have nothing together. A relationship should have more communication then sex. Yea it is good but if you do it more then you talk how will you learn about each other if you just focus on the physicality of the relationship. You have to be emotionally and mentally involved as well as sexually. Also if you date some one and have sex with them right away it could also ruin the relationship, because sex makes you want some one especially if it is good so it blocks out the feelings you could have possibly have had for that person and you end up getting feelings for the person but not real feelings. That's why i advise people to go out for a while before they have sex. Find out how you feel about that person before you have sex. Sex will make you feel lust for a person and people tend to mix up the meanings of love and lust.|`|ysAlWzEvaa	Yes because after a while your relationship will be based completely off sex. Especially if you both don't go hang out, have some kind of intellectual conversations, or even spend sometime together...without sex! But first you need to talk to your bf, tell him that you need to have more than have sex all the time and tell him what interest you'd like to pursue. You have to be careful how you say this because he might think you want to completely stop having sex and he will run (practice what to say b4 you actually talk to him). At the end of this you'll know if he was there for you or the sex. Good luck!|`|AA11638441	well me and my bf been together for about 6 years and im very young and we have sex all the time ( maybe like every other day and like 5 to 6 times, if it good that relationship should not die but if it weak then yea sweetheart it can mess up a relationship.)|`|e9vcseLlaa	If you two are only having sex and nothing else then you clearly dont know eachother very well. Stop for a little while and get to know eachoter better|`|TttbaUqiaa	well really no it can't destroy u relationship|`|ktC9MTExaa	There are alot of good answers here. I am in a similar situation. This came directly from my BF. I want to have sex all the time, I could do it everyday 3 and 4 times a day, like we used to when we first started dating. we have been together for 2 years, had some problems, found out things we dont like about each other, and it didnt seem to matter when we started out having our sex marathons. But now he says, if we do it all the time, it gets boring, we wont appreciate it as much as if we waited sometimes. I never really thought about it that way, but its true because now if we wait a few days, its really more exciting. Also, he has been much happier with me since i opened up sexually and have even watched porn together, dressed up (role playing), ect. Keep it as different each time as possible between the sweet love making as well. Hope my experience helps you.|`|bTBIBTE1aa	Um... Yes it can. You are always going to fight about one wanting it and the other not wanting it. One will always want it when the other is not in the mode. Once in a blue moon you will both be feeling the love and both want sex. If you have sex all the time it gets old and you feel like it is the same old stuff. if you do it every so often it becomes more so-real and feels more like love. Sex is not something that has to be done all the time. Tell the person that you our seeing that we don't need it all the time to be in love.|`|tQ6IxTfwaa	i think no.sex is one reason guys cheat.if u stop having sex with him or reduce on having sex,he might end having sex from outside.he can love you soo much,but just coz one thing is missing and that will then destroy your relationship.im a guy and i will never cheat my girl if im getting everything i need in a relationship.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think if all you do is have sex but you never talk or really get to know each other it can. I think as long as you have a relationship outside of the sex then it can. Hope I helped!|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	Sammie, if you two are happy with frequency of sex then no but if one partner is not happy then there will be a problem.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Nope.  Not possible.  No such thing as too much sex.|`|A7QROnjLaa	Not if it's sex with your guy.|`|FERfSYtzaa	no keep hittin it till the end of time. just kiddin|`|3YIjKQTEaa	I think a lot of times it has the potential to. to much sex can lead to staleness in a relationship. You end up getting bored with it, just going through the motions. <br>  If you keep it different and exciting then I think you can have it as much as you like but as soon as you just begin to do it for the sake of it the spark goes and often that will effect the rest of your relationship.|`|ASev3PTWaa	In a word, no. <br>  If your relationship has been struggling because of your interactions with your significant other, chances are bad sex or stress about sex is just a symptom of a bigger problem. <br>  Make sure you have the space to find out if the problem is with the person and when you spend time with them. <br>  Having a lot of sex is healthy and shows your interest in a person, but don't listen to people when they say it ruins a relationship. The real reasons break-ups occur is conversation over the coffee table. Good luck!|`|EftGgerMaa	To be honest with u.. I'm going through this situation now. <br>  It is bad to have sex all the time. Me and my boyfriend would have sex 10 times every single day for 5 months. Anywhere, anytime.. it didn't matter!!! Now I'm in a situation where he finds himself used to me already. I try new things to try and excite him, but its not the same rush for him as before. Men get tired of the same ***** after awhile. Sad but true. For the past 3 weeks he gets limp while he's inside of me. I try everything and our sex life has really decreased from having sex soo much. I don't know if its because he's cheating, or because he's tired of it.. but it all balls down to the fact that its because we had sex so much. Let the man fien for u. Make him have wet dreams about u. its good to see a man beg for YOUR *****. And when he gets it.. give it to him sooo good hell come running for more. But ur man won't ever do that if u let him have it ALL THE TIME. Sucks but its true. Us females also have to suffer in the process. But maybe in the end it'll all be worth it.|`|7qvaXOFzaa	Yes, it can because sooner or later your boyfriend/husband will only love you for sex. Therefore, you should decrease the amount of times you have sex. A relationship isn't mostly about sex, love is more important!|`|cn49BbRiaa	Im not sure what you mean it depends how you and your partner feels about that. Just remember that sex isnt everything and you wouldnt want to be in a relationship thats based on only great sex.|`|NWTfFEuVaa	It only destroys a relationship if you or the other person wants it more then their partner. Or if one of you guys gets addicted to it then yes, it will destroy a relationship. so YES it can destroy it.|`|r63DBSATaa	Yes. Your relationship isnt about sex, it's about your love. You just do it because you love eachother and feel like it makes you feel good so you want to.|`|Zq3mBuKraa	No such thing, it doesnt exist. You clearly arent having enough sex, or you would know this.|`|SWf2vJN0aa	Maybe, but its a hella good thing while it lasts|`|Fjd3thaxaa	Yeahh..|`|kvN1w0j3aa	What's this "too much sex" you speak of?<br>  <br>  lol|`|vFdpXzjmaa	no|`|5ace377e3ba7c902d796bbd6c9c815e5aa	no as long as it is w/ your partner and consensual
AA11989999	It's a sign that he does not have enough confidence to ask or approach, yet. With young people, that happens a lot. Or he figures you live far apart and only saw each other this once.|`|1dP7Viiuaa	well, you didnt give him a sign that you were interested did you? Why didntyou ask for his number or gave yours to him instead? just do it!|`|Fd2qVv4Vaa	no... he could be shy or distracted. you probably would have to be around him more to "get more hints". strike up some conversation, if it's a social event, that makes it easy.|`|FzFSzilmaa	perhaps you didn't respond the right way for him to know you were interested...<br>  <br>  alternatively, WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE HIM YOUR NUMBER???<br>  <br>  does the man have to do ALL the work???|`|PzboDDI2aa	he is shy you need to make the first move. maybe a complement of his clothing|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	I think he sounds like a typical man yet he sounds like he has something to hide ,he also might be a pervert too since he had the nerve to brush against you .I would not trust too easily despite his attarctive ,smells like a rat to me|`|AA11108018	You must be attractive or he would not  have looked at you.

If there is no signs of a ring being or have been there if there is time to back off  More than likely he was looking for a wham bam thank you ma'am and out the door
1F6KJt0oaa	Wear a blue dress and pumps.  Your hair should probably be up off your neck and if you have the option wear glasses.  Brown purse is probably best.  What should you do?

j0mI8l07aa	Loving your friends does not make you homosexual. It is sad that homophobia is soooo rampant in this country, that a 14 year-old girl would even have to worry about this. You're really really over-thinking it. You're going to get a LOT of confusing feelings at your age, don't make any broad sweeping statements about your life or "stamp" one of society's labels on yourself because of them. They will subside after puberty, and then you'll be able to figure out how you really feel about things.

usvsdELYaa	It really depends I was with someone for 3 years and after breaking up with him realized I had never been more miserable. Then I was single for about a year and I had never been happier. Now, I'm with a new man and very content with what we have and happy being in a relationship. It all depends on the stage of life you are at and what you've gone through in the past. That's my opinion|`|oNh9Av4aaa	well it matters what kind off relationship it is if you have a close relationship i would have rather be in a relationship but if i had a long distance relation ship i would like being single<br>  :D ~Ally|`|MYbRICxqaa	I think when it is time for you to have a man or woman in your life it will happen. You need to enjoy your life now. There should not be any regrets later. I would let a man come to me and stay single.|`|wtVSTuSuaa	Single. You have no ball and chain. You can go out with a different girl every day of the week.
Uj5kuzoJaa	First of all, if you two were only separated for a week, then there is no way to know for sure that the baby isn't your boyfriends. What if you got pregnant the week before? You can't be 100% positive that it's your ex's baby. You have three choices that I can see. <br>  <br>  1) Have an abortion. I do not recommend this at all. It's not the babies fault that mommy screwed up. But hey, realistically it is still an option<br>  <br>  2) Don't tell your boyfriend that the baby might not be his. Let him believe the baby is his and never say a word and have to deal with the guilt. This could be a problem because if your ex looks a lot different than your bf and the baby looks more like your ex, you bf might suspect something. This only works if the two guys look the same<br>  <br>  3) Sit down and tell your boyfriend what happened. Let him know that you slept with another guy when you two were split up, and you don't know if the baby is his or not. Hopefully he's a good guy and will want to stay around regardless of if the baby is his or not. But you never know how guys will react to this information. You can get a paternity test after the baby is born to tell you who the father is. <br>  <br>  I recommend option (3). It will be hard, but at least it will be off your chest. Hopefully your bf will realize that this happened when you two were split up and he won't be too upset. Good luck with whatever choice you make|`|4EWCegiRaa	If you're going to lie to your fiancee (or any man) about whether the child is his or not, you really are the #1bitch.<br>  <br>  My ONLY suggestion:  Be honest and take it from there.|`|KasFZL7laa	abort!  heave ho!|`|uNJirnYoaa	oh they got you drunk huh? <br>  this will teach you not to whore around and be with people like that.<br>  hope you learned a valuable lesson|`|MEN0lnlraa	first of all, if you're sexually active you should be taking the pill, without it no sex,<br>  <br>  second of all, unprotected sex = morning after pill and STD detection test the very next morning<br>  <br>  third, don't freak them out for nothing.

Don't make him think it's his. That is so cruel.  From your typing i can all ready tell you are probably very young and not ready to get married let alone have a baby.

You should see a doctor and they can guesstimate to how long you have been pregnant. You could have just as easily gotten pregnant before the break up, even if you've had a period, as the period thing really is no indicator of whether you are pregnant or not for the first month or so.<br>  Go from there. If it isn't his, tell him. He has every right to know, and you do not want to spend the rest of your life wondering if he would love you or want you if he knew the truth, and you most definitely don't want him to find out by some other means.<br>  Ignore the first jacka$$. No one can get you drunk, so it was one decision that led to another, that you likely wouldn't have made sober, so don't punish the baby for it.|`|LbzQtQb9aa	hey.....first get your self checked to see if you are....then....if you are go talk to that a$$h0l3 and clear it up cause thats some fuck3d up sh!t....some reason i highly doubt its the other dudes...|`|CRsSw0ssaa	Get an abortion, simple as.|`|UQWusO1waa	your a #1 ,for sure.
u0udwkZQaa	You actually look better, but you can never tell unless they're both the best shots showing personality too. Girls usually look better than their BF's because girls take better care, and they are much harder on themselves in terms of their looks. I can tell you the girl I most liked, a female friend was surprised by because she thought I'd be thinking about someone more attractive. All you really need to know is are you his type. When certain things are there, and the right personality, he'll be sending signals, and you can test him for those signals.|`|sCr2iTczaa	I think y'all will be perfect for each other you both look good. i think you look better then him by a little bit just because he isn't my kind of guy, but you two look like you would make a great and cute couple.|`|a2f976a121e06b9ec21ec8d6b8e42edfaa	you look like a snob...and he looks like a 12 year old...you don't need to be in a relationship!|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	You both are cute but you really shouldn't base a relationship on whether or not you look good together as a couple.|`|hjTTW68Haa	Yep Perfect<br>  <br>  P.S.

GFhocHr8aa	You're not overreacting at all. His kids are harming your daughter, and if they continue to do this without being stopped they could end up really hurting her.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could try talking to your boyfriend again at a time when you're both calm. Explain that you don't want to seperate him from his kids, and that you want the household to be peaceful, but that can't happen if your daughter is unsafe. See if the two of you can have a serious talk with his kids about how they need to be gentler with the baby. Make sure they understand that she's too young to "look at them the wrong way" or do anything like that to purposely bother them.<br>  <br>  It also might help for them to have some positive interaction with the baby. After she's fed, rested, and in a happy mood, you could invite them to spend time with you and her. If you are around, you can prevent them from harming her. And if they learn to care for her and enjoy spending time with her, they will be kinder to her.|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	I feel sorry for boyfriend, because he’s caught in the middle here and it’s not a pleasant place to be. <br>  <br>  As parents we deal with our children’s behavior.  We explain things to them, give them guidance and boundaries.  We don’t automatically jump to ‘let’s get rid of them.’  <br>  <br>  I sincerely doubt they are trying to actually hurt her/realize that they can hurt her badly.  They’re simply young and need some guidance.  <br>  <br>  For example, the 8-year-old said "that’s what you do" and in fact, it is what you do.  Explain to her why you do it and that only you can do it.<br>  <br>  The 6-year-old's response was possible a little more troubling, but more than likely just the result of him being **6 years old** and not understanding the possible results of his behavior.  Talk to him.  Don’t be angry (very important), just be firm.  Make it clear that it's not acceptable--explain why!--and tell him if he does it again he’ll be punished.<br>  <br>  Then once you do all that, watch them like hawks to make sure there’s no repeat of this or other behavior that’s unacceptable.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I agree with boyfriend that if it had been your child, your response would have been different.  You would have dealt with it instead of demanding to send him away.|`|fbaKREQuaa	I say you shoule leave because yeah the kids might be doing what yall are doing but they dont understand that they could really hurt your baby and you would not want to wake up in the middle of the night and find his kids in your babys room covering her face with a blanket. so for the safety of her life i would leave until the dad understand tht this is a serious problem and needs to be takin with actions with teahing his kids whats right and whats wrong or else they need to leave the house be go back with there mom
sf41LqFbaa	Hey, great question.  I'd recommend checking out a church that has small groups or youth groups for kids OR even a boys & girls club, YouthFriends, Young Life club, etc.  <br>  <br>  You'll be nervous at first putting yourself out there because you'll be in a new situation -- but in the end it will be worth it.  Also, if you're in a church - you might ask the pastor / youth pastor if they know anyone who would be a good mentor.  Ask the P/YP if they would introduce you sometime.  <br>  <br>  When you get in a group.<br>  <br>  1)  Meet people.  Introuduce yourself.  Show interest in people.<br>  2)  Join in on what people are doing (telling jokes, playing a game, etc).  If you're not comfortable -- just listen to what people are talking about, show interest.<br>  3)  Invite someone - a youth leader or an adult that you respect to come to one of your events (a choir concert, sports game, etc) or share with them something you've done (artwork, webpage, etc).  <br>  <br>  Remembr - relationships take time, they don't happen all at once, be patient, don't worry about ackwardness.  I'm a youth worker and have been for 8 years, and I STILL feel ackward in social situations - but I often have to force myself to meet people, listen and start new frienships.

But I'm supposing you're talking about romantic love right? Well it's great because it conquers all bad things and it nurses, cares, and is quite beautiful.<br>  Love it also something very deep that only two people can share. It's not something that you can acquire just by wanting it, it's given to you as a blessing.<br>  <br>  Friendship on the other hand is something deeper... it's a bond that can't be broken and an invisible force that brings you up.<br>  <br>  So I guess you can think of it like this:<br>  <br>  some you romanticly love: You're one sole reason to live. This is someone that keeps you going and someone you Depend on.<br>  <br>  Your best friend: Your backbone. The person that keeps you upright and confident... and someone you Rely on.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this sorta helped! >_<|`|AA11007184	If you can have both love and friendship in a relationship it makes things even better...for a relationship to work its best to start off with a friendship then work up to love but if you can insinuate the friendship into the relationship or love then you have it made.|`|1770c7574e98befdabd3d54687581695aa	friendship is easy going, BUT loves way toooooo painful!|`|lxfDE9sAaa	Friendship when you don't have love.......but love even when you have both friendship and love|`|GC1xuZlfaa	of course when you have friendship you have love they go together like peanut butter and jelly.|`|pv2Ig8qDaa	both are different both have role in life so both are great in thier on respect|`|7CQplikcaa	Love|`|OFhCTA6Oaa	how about both|`|HUSYrXwraa	only friendship.because love a lie..
OFJFLs2Paa	Oh that is a really hard one! The only thing that I can tell you is you are just going to have to wait till someone flirts with you first. After someone does that you will know what to do. You have to have someone tell you what to do it is already in your mind.
ydKGJ7Nnaa	I think you really do need to be more out going.  Just start yapping with them about whatever is going on (or whatever they are chatting about).  As you talk more and more find out what they like to do out of school . . . . then start hanging out with them.  Before you know it you will have some new buddies|`|r1MImdh3aa	Don't worry about how you're perceived by others. If they think you're shy- too bad for them. Instead, focus on hanging out with people that care about you and accept you for who you are.|`|AA10336377	get new friends!! Face the facts a i had to do!!!! All friends don't last forever!  I had 2 learn the hard way.|`|IVympPe0aa	Ask you friends to maybe speak in English so that you can understand what they are saying and join in on the conversation. You can always talk about school, your love life, the weather, plans for the weekend, etc. Bring up a new scary movie that's coming out, or better yet, ask them if they'd like to come along. Don't fear that they will judge you or think what you've said is stupid.. if they're your friends, they probably WANT you to speak up more! Good luck! :] The easiest way to get to know people is by asking questions about themselves and finding things you have in common!|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Hm... yeah I've grown away from friends... it happens, and it's hard to undo. When you try to undo it, and you push yourselves back together into hanging out and talking, it can be awkward. <br>  You said it yourself, that you "have grown apart" and that's okay. You just need to find new friends. <br>  These 2 girls seem a little disrespectful to you to exclude you from their conversations. Either you could ask them about it or mention it - say that you'd feel less shy if they spoke to you in English because you feel left out, or you could still hang out with them but kind of look for new friends. <br>  <br>  The more you stress about making new friends, the harder it is. Just relax, things will come together for you eventually. ^_^ <br>  <br>  Good luck! ^_^
OFJFLs2Paa	Wow that is crazy! You know that she isn't trying to break up with him for you. She just likes the attention that you and him are giving her so she is trying her best to keep it like that. If I was you I would tell her in person or over the phone that she needs to pick now, because you can't take her playing the both of you just because she can't pick. If she says no then I would dump her if I was you. If she says ok I will do it make sure that she does this before it gets out of hand. Also I would keep a eye on her for awhile if you guys do go back out. Once someone cheats once they most likely will do it again. Another thing is if she really loved you she wouldn't be doing this to you and wouldn't have broke up with you in the first place. So to tell the truth that girl really don't love you, but just likes you. Don't fall for this girls little trap. She has you right where she wants you and loves every minute of it. I really feel bad for you, just because someone that you care about is hurting you by just not telling you the truth. Good Luck I know that you will need it to win her over if that is what you want! Really hope that it all works out! =D

So, be thank ful you are not in anyone else's situation.<br>  <br>  Let your husband deal with HIS mother and family the way HE wants to. Do not interfer with his relationship with his mother. Don't assume he does not care for her conversations.<br>  <br>  Keep out of their matters. Do not nit-pick and nag about his mother when she is HIS responsibility.<br>  <br>  Be patient and respectful to his mother and forgive her when she is out of line or when she complains. <br>  <br>  YOU are literaly taking over HER place. Understand that she feels challanged and shoved aside by you.|`|a6VBZoEKaa	she obviously resents you for taking her son away. maybe she is lonely & grasping at anything she can to get attention from you guys. my mother in law was nuts too. your husband needs to tell her he is a married man now & that he has his own family. that he loves her very much but she has to stop pushing or she will loose both of you & any kids you may have.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Lol- sometimes the only thing you can do with people is love 'em (advice someone gave me long ago)<br>  <br>  Seems to me his mother listened to his baby babble for a number of years- consider this a type of payback<br>  <br>  It would be insanely selfish for him to abandon his mother just because she's a bit difficult- just my opinion
jrdtQi04aa	First, you have to realize that you arent his dad, so most of the discipline will have to come from his mother.  She is torn between the two of you because the child is probably really acting out because he is afraid he will lose his mom to you.  He is holding up every last bit of his three year old power!  There is nothing that they love more than being in total control, and if you two fight because of him, he is loving it.  My son used to do that with me and my husband.  He would be totally miserable, get me and my husband arguing, and then we noticed how happy he was!  That was the end of that!  We outsmarted his little butt!  Kids are amazingly smart, and will use bad behaviour to control adults!  We usually allow them to do this!  Stop noticing his bad behaviour.  Get on a page with your girlfriend of how to work together.  Use time outs and punishments not whoopings.  Whoopings dont really work.  I am not one of those never hit a kid people.  There are times, when that child is in danger, that they are totally neccessary, but I dont think it is cool under most circumstances.  I know, and I havent raised any brats either, and I didnt have kids you couldnt take anywhere, either, but you dont have to hit them to make this work.  You do have to arrange some punishments, and You must ABSOLUTELY MUST, FOLLOW THROUGH!  NO BREAKS, NO HALF STEPPING, YOU MUST FOLLOW THROUGH!  Dont let this kid ruin your relationship.  Talk with your girlfriend about this, and dont argue or finger point.  Talk to her not fight with her.  Advise her that you must work this out, or you have to move out.  This is what this kid wants, dont give in to it.|`|gTjtaG0Faa	Move back out<br>  <br>  <br>  Either marry her and become his dad or find another girl.<br>  <br>  If you fight over the spoiled baby its because she wants to keep spoiling him and does not want your help - should show you the way the wind is blowing.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	if it's not something you can handle then you need to move on.  it's not fair to the kid to have a "father figure" move in and out of his life.  kids need stability.  maybe you and gf can try counseling to figure out how to deal with the kid.  keep in mind the kid may be acting up because of the change in living situation.|`|Txr5PvXgaa	Marco, your relationship was uncomplicated, now it's real so either grow up and learn how to be the boy's loving and patient stepfather or step away all together before he gets attached to you.<br>  <br>  As for discipline, he just needs boundaries, not physical anger, just persistent and consistent reminders to him that you & his mother have behavioral expectations. If you are firm and loving, he will soon learn to respect your boundaries (ex. time out, gives you both space). Good luck.|`|AA11946554	I agree that counseling is best. If she's raised this kid by herself, both the kid and her are used to things being a certain way. As a single mom myself, when my kid was young, the guy I was seeing got along great with him...unless I was there. Then they BOTH turned nto jealous litle brats. We never married and that was PART of it. He didn't even realize he was behaving so childish.<br>  And I do admit, my kid would 'act up' when the three of us were in the same room. Everyone is adjusting...I'm sure the mom (your g/f) is feeling pressure, too.|`|VMoDsdREaa	he's 3 years old, if she can't control his temper and your sick of it then walk away and don;t turn back.|`|GJycKc5Laa	teach him tough love....

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Can you discuss her behavior issues with her parents? Are they aware that she is a Devil at school? Discipline starts in the home, perhaps if they were aware they could set up a reward system for good behavior for her or something like that at home. Then you and her parents would be on the same page with everything, which is a good start. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mvKDbb2uaa	I would talk to other teachers and maybe even the principal of the school about her.  It's tough being a teacher because what you can do to discipline children is very restricted.  They may be able to help you out and/or find an alternative.<br>  <br>  In addition, I would talk to the parents.  The parents may be nice people, but they need to know that their child is disruptive in class and that something needs to be done.  They themselves may be too nice to her and not discipline her at home.  In which case, she hasn't really been properly taught how to interact and what's truly right and wrong.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	I can't figure out why this is in the wedding section.  But anyways...<br>  <br>  I think it's time for the daycare to revise their strategy.  What she is doing is typical toddler behavior, but you need to be able to correct it otherwise she learns that she can get away with it.<br>  <br>  My son has gone through all of those things... and our daycare will put him in time out for it.  Sometimes that means sitting in the time out highchair so he can't get to the other kids.<br>  <br>  It's hard to teach them how to deal with frustrations.  And they do lash out by hitting, biting, and other little tantrums.<br>  <br>  You could ask the parents how they deal with those issues at home and find out how they would like for you to deal with it at daycare.  Perhaps they can create some sort of cooperative effort with you.  If your hands are tied at daycare, maybe they can help out by having rewards and consequences at home.<br>  <br>  Like last week my son was bad at daycare.  So at home, he was not allowed to have his "special gummies".  (those are gummy lifesavers with liquid juice in them).  Now he knows that if we get a good report, he gets the special gummies when he gets home.<br>  <br>  This week, he has been good all week.<br>  <br>  But our daycare is allowed to also put him in time out.  And when he is bad, she has him tell us exactly what he did that was bad.  So he also has to tell us... "I was bad.  I hit Timmy."  So he starts to understand that it was bad and that it doesn't feel good to be bad.  And when he's good, he gets to tell us he was good and what he did that was good.  So he gets praise right away for being good and he knows how good it feels when he's good.|`|AA12259102	I feel your pain I've been there myself.Seems like there is always one who want run the show.Can you just move her from the other children when she's bad.Just say you can't play with that toy you threw for the rest of the day or you can't play with .... because you were mean to them today?Not sure of your works rules.|`|29I8PWrxaa	What is the policy or procedure for handling this type of situation at the daycare where you work?  Can you ask your superior for advice on how to handle this?  I would speak to the child's parents and ask them how to handle it as well.|`|34ikhhtMaa	I might talk to the parents and see if they will sign a waver so that you can put her in timeout. Then talk to the teachers board and see if you can plead your case about needing timeouts to them.

QttAOneaaa	Ok I can't really speak for guys, seeing as I'm a girl. But in my opinion, I think everyone is desperate at some time. I think as much as you want someone to love and understand you, you don't want just anyone. But sometimes you can't get what you want until your really sure of what you want. So sometimes you just get desprate in you attempt to find just someone that really knows you and that you want to give everything to. And if you try enough people, your bound to find that one someone eventually. Maybe I'm overthinking this but thats what I feel like most of the time. If that makes sense...|`|HijnVm1iaa	being desperate on either a guy or girl is unattactive.  But why do you want to be so picky? You never know if the ordinary girl is extrordinary if you don't give her a chance :)|`|AaoLwJJWaa	yeah, i know what u mean, I'm not an ugly loser with no friends or anything like that, but the main reason i'm single is that i have an image of finding the perfect girl.....on the first try(i'd hate to see what i'd become after dating so many girls if i just went out with any "interesting" or hot girl i saw).  It may seems unrealistic, but thats my goal and i'm sticking to it that why i make good friends with girls before going any further, just to check them out. I'm desperate....to find the perfect girl for me.|`|rWQaXqlhaa	im an 18 yo guy who has never had a gf<br>  im what you call DESPERATE

wZtDLjO8aa	Are you talking about me or K?? In our case, hell YES!! We both should be able to take time off. But, I do agree that everyone needs their "alone" time. It's very healthy and normal.|`|FXCoGD44aa	If that's what you and your spouse both want, then by all means go for it. Just make sure you are both clear about what "do whatever I want" really means with each other.<br>  <br>  But I don't think it's a healthy thing to do. Craving space from your spouse spells trouble. And "taking a break" surely isn't going to fix any preexisting problems that you have that may or may not be causing this want of a "break."<br>  <br>  When you stood up in front of your friends and family and vowed your love and devotion to one another and made all the promises you did, I doubt that included, "But every now and then, we get a month off from marriage." It's just not part of the deal.<br>  <br>  If more freedom is what one or both of you are craving, you don't have to split up and run wild for X amount of time to achieve that. A more constructive solution would be to sit down like adults and talk about what each of your respective needs are in this marriage. For example, say you want more time out with your buddies... you can come to an agreement where you do so every Thursday night or something.<br>  <br>  Don't turn away from each other - you will only make the situation worse. If you think it will, then you are in for a real reality check.<br>  <br>  :::ADDITION AFTER YOUR ADDED DETAILS:::<br>  If you're not happy with each other, taking a break isn't suddenly going to make you "happy" with each other again. Figure out the source of your unhappiness, put on your big boy pants and fix it. Maybe you need professional help.<br>  <br>  Or maybe neither one of you were mature enough to be married in the first place. If you want to go off and be single again, then get a divorce.|`|aUTLstpAaa	I think it's normal to want some time to yourself. To think, and see how you feel. But a month sounds way too long.  It sounds more like a seperation.  And the "no questions" asked  part of the agreement makes it sound like you guys would rather be single than married.  If you're contemplating divorce, a trial seperation is a good way to determine how you feel from experiencing time apart.  If you're not contemplating divorce...you need to work on your marriage.  Regardless of your intentions, you need some counseling.|`|AA10766729	If you two agree, then that's certainly your prerogative.<br>  <br>  I however do NOT agree with that scenario, nor would I feel comfortable with my husband suggesting such a thing.  But that's ME, and I understand what marriage is....and it certainly is NOT "taking time off [insert screwing around] with no questions"!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: If you're both unhappy with each other, then start couples therapy rather than "taking a break".  The problems you have will still be there when you get back, only they'll be compounded by trust issues and doubts.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	That's a pretty broad statement; do whatever I want when I want with no questions asked and your wife wants the same privilege You say you are not happy with each other and you both want at least a month off to live the single life why ever come back? Do you really think you will both be happier after this time apart? Get a divorce and live the single lives you both want and be done with a sham of a marriage.|`|KasFZL7laa	if you both agree and think it would be best in order to save the marriage, then yeah.|`|liHpJvVfaa	No I do not agree! If I wanted to be single I would be single. Evidently your not truly in love. I am all about going on vacation or out with your friends without your significant other sometimes. But not meaning you can go out and act like you are single and going home with the opposite sex at the end of the night|`|x3LclBZ0aa	only if u mutually agree on what you can and what you cant do. if its a "no holds barred" type of break then why did u get hitched in the first place? im all for a little break now and then from our partners but not to act like a single woman during that break.<br>  i guess whatever floats YOUR boat. to each his own.|`|gfHutvEFaa	If the two of you are in total agreement whats with asking this question? You want people to pat you on the back and tell you how right it is? Whatever. If you only want to act married 10 months out of the year, you should have stayed single.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	if you both feel the same way. it shouldn't matter what we think. i personally think its a great idea if there are no kids involved. i assume that your children are all grown up and out of the house? just don't stray.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	Hell no...the vows say for better or worse not lets take a no questions break and find a new smuck to ****!|`|H7UphlLCaa	that's dumb. break up if you're not happy with each other.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	Many couples live this type of life. E.g. have the holidays without each other, etc.|`|HRIbmp67aa	what the hell does it matter if whether or not we agree, if the two of you do?|`|CrKox2niaa	No. Marriage is about sticking together through the good times and bad no matter what. I would suggest going to talk with a marriage counselor or someone you can trust. It's okay IMO to have your friends and for her to have hers as well. Go out with your friends once in a while to have fun just you and the guys or your wife goes out with her girl friends. Doing whatever you want for a whole month with no questions? Sounds like maybe you aren't quite ready to be a husband. <br>  <br>  In the end, only you and your wife can decide what's best for the two of you and your marriage. Good luck.|`|yuGW9AlCaa	If that is how you and your spouse want it, that's fine.<br>  <br>  However, I never feel like I need a "break" from my husband.  I never do anything I wouldn't like him to be a part of ...<br>  <br>  He goes away for business for a week or so at the time and I always miss him and we talk every night.<br>  <br>  I just can't see wanting to be apart from him for a month.. I've done it before, for his job, and it sucks.|`|JgvQDjf2aa	It would'nt be my cup of tea but you are both adults and if it is a consented agreement between the two of you have at er. Just be responsible (STDS) so if you decide to get back together which there's a chance you won't you have protected yourself and her, and vice versa.|`|N8EB7YkMaa	No, I absolutely do not agree, but if the two of you choose to do so, it is strictly your business.|`|kjgonYlgaa	That's a crock, if that's what you belive than you need a divorce, but from the sounds of it you think a divorce would be too inconvenient!|`|4kaVChO4aa	Doesn't sound to morally sound.

Uj5kuzoJaa	I've dealt with this same problem. In time it disappears and the problem solves itself. Where does he see her the most often? Does he work with her, or go to school with her. If he does either one of those, he can embarrass her by going to someone in charge, like a boss or principle, and reporting sexual harassment. It'll embarrass her and most likely make her finally back off. I know how frustrating this is and how more than anything in the world you'd like to go down there and knock her out, but it's not worth it.|`|c1e077ca88966e8fba4354709743a0bfaa	Better yet, you should hit on her.<br>  <br>  Hear me out, you and your boyfriend go to her together and tell her she and get with him, but only if she gets with you first. This should freak her out enough that she runs away screaming. Or she could say yes, and that would be cool too.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  For a more traditional approach, get one of your boyfriends guy friends to play interference. Find a way to infer that if she gets close to his friend she might have a chance with him and let the guy lead her away.|`|ActoZyHraa	Its not the only situation... ~.~ but move away... or tell her off|`|rk2LknI7aa	sometimes it is the only way to deal wit dis ****<br>  but i understand ur anger but id call her names and **** and get her so mad till she hits u first((and let her)) then beat the HELL out of her..<br>  option 2- get a younger friend to beat her up!<br>  3- if u want be straight up wit her and tell her if she needs to stop<br>  4 or ur bf can tell her to back off and every time she trys to talk to him tell him to be rude as hell and just ignore her!|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	Fighting won't solve anything, but it will show your bf that you are stupid enough to do just about anything to keep him.  And he'll be able to play that for all it's worth.  You'll end up nothing more than his lapdog.<br>  <br>  You'd be better off using sarcasm to make her look like an idiot, and broadcast loud and clear that you can't believe she's trying to take a guy that is already attached.|`|O86ieLjPaa	Shut up and don't do anything,<br>  <br>  You're an adult...start acting like one.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	Be the adult, fighting is never the answer. I've been in your situation before... and its not worth it. I never fought the girl... but i def. used my words. Show that you are smarter more mature than she is. I mean im a mom, so fighting isnt an option with me... it doesnt solve anything<br>  <br>  Anyways you just let her know that she is trying to mess with someone's man (your man), and that she needs to back off. There are plenty of other guys out there for her, so why is your man so special to her? Tell her to back the #$%@ off. Plain and simple. There really isnt any other way to solve this unless you are going to fight her. Your boyfriend just has to say the same thing, she needs to back up... if she keeps harassing him or you, then contact the police and get a restraining order.
7eIFZxLAaa	that is all a form of cheating and i would not tolerate any of it you deserve better!!|`|JIhj7w7Zaa	-Giving ur ex girlfriend a hug./ no<br>  -Letting a girl sit in ur lap./ questionable<br>  -Telling other girls they're hot./no<br>  -Calling other girls at night and talking to them like they're ur girlfriend./yes<br>  -Calling other girls sweetheart, baby, sweet pea, etc./ no<br>  -Getting drunk with a girl & then making out. /yes<br>  <br>  and the last bit, its okay to talk to and text exes as long as its just a friends, but but the way he laughs at you and makes you feel bad, he knows exactly what he is doing, aand dont even bother with him.<br>  hes a complete and utter waste of space, let the ex have him back|`|KFuyBR8qaa	I would consider most of those cheating, dont treat other girls the same as your girlfriend.

Yes that cheating. I had an abusive ex who I didn't get to see very often and after not seeing him for about a week I went to go visit him (this was during high school). He was stayed home from school that day because he had a doctors appointment because he was going to have his tonsils removed. When I went to hug him he kind of blew me off and said "I miss *such and such girls name*, I didn't get to see her today at school, she said she was going to make me a card, she was flirting with me the other day in *blah blah blah class* and was bending over to show me her thong"....I though "what the hell?" he hadn't seen me for days and now he misses her??? I knew he was cheating on me at that point but I was so emotionally involved that I became a shell in an bad relationship and he had all control over me and treated me like crap (he was bipolar). Sounds like you're getting in the same thing. Dump him for your own good. It will hurt a lot at first but make sure your friends are there to support you and keep you from going back. You are probably very emotionally involved but he is destroying you bit by bit by doing this to you and its not fair to you. Dump him....buy a ton of Ben and Jerry's....Sit with your friends and talk about what a jerk he was....and then realize how much better than him you are and go find yourself a REAL man!|`|HMFR1I01aa	that's bs, this is not how a boyfriend should treat his girl...all of these stuff that you just listed above are very uncool.

It's relationship poison.  Either you believe he's treating you decently or you don't.  If he isn't then dump his scurvy butt.  If he's just gregarious and has a lot of gal pals, some of them close, then it's your job to get over your demand that he amputate his social connections just to be with you.|`|sCr2iTczaa	First of all it is cheating to call another girl baby and talk to her like she is your gf, and second of all after getting into a fight with his own gf he gets on the phone with another girl in front of her... or you i suppose. That boy needs to be kicked to the curb that is messed up. How could you let some one treat you like this. you deserve so much better then that honey. You need to let him go.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	I consider all these "DISRESPECTFUL', If a guy or girl do these intentionally or without consideration to their significant others feelings then you should not be in a relationship with that person. These are some of the worst kind of cheating.|`|cMksTuRhaa	Getting drunk and making out would be cheating, all the others are just flirting.  Yes, I'd be mad about about the phone convo.  Dump him.

It's obvious he's still talking to his ex and is probably cheating on you if he's doing all of these things.<br>  <br>  Hug: No, but it depends on how he does it.<br>  Sit: Not cheating, just being a jerk.<br>  Hot: No.<br>  Calling at night: No. But it depends on what they're talking about.

Talk to her if she says straight up that she is then either she is cold hearted or she actually cared enough to tell you instead of keep hurting you.now if you break it up just bc some one else told you that then you will never know if she was or not until you see what she does after the fact if not then that is a risk that you'll have to take.         Good Luck!|`|k9uspUrTaa	let me just say being cheated on SUCKS. So you have to make a decision and you might want to talk to this girl about how you feel about what she did.

HBV9GGXDaa	In Catholicism, Marriage is a sacrament.  As such, you are required to be informed of the sacarment you are receiving before you take your marraige vows.<br>  <br>  Precana is the Catholic Church's marriage education class.  It is run by married Catholic couples who have been married for more than 20 years.  They will give you a real life glimps into the troubles, challenges, joys and tactics for creating and sustaining a happy marriage.<br>  <br>  What is usually involved is that you fill out a questionnaire that forces you both to examine your reasons for the marriage.  Then, you will meet either once a week for four weeks for about 60 minutes with 3 other engaged couples - or - you can do it all in one Saturday at any archdiocese along with hundreds of other couples.  The sessions go from boring to hilarious to thoughtful throughout.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	You do not have to become Catholic to be married in the Catholic church. Only one person has to be of the practicing faith. You will be taking a long questionaire, which churches of all denominations offer, that sees how you each feel about sensitive subjects that all married couples will run into. Then the pre-martial classes will help you to live the life of a Catholic in a marriage: finance, family planning, creed, etc. It helps a lot. There's nothing to be nervous about. It truly helps to get things out in the open. My fiance is Catholic and I'm not. After learning everything, I might just become one. It's a beautiful faith. Church history was a big flag for me. Anyways, congrats! You will be getting married in the house of the Lord as all Sacraments are done. God asks us to do things like baptism, holy communion, holy days in his house, so marriage is a big one as well. Remember, the first miracle done by Jesus was performed at a wedding. He turned water into wine.|`|QieRAMLkaa	ahh welcome to my world!<br>  Pre-cana is basically pre marital counceling.<br>  At my church there are a series of weekly classes basically telling you how to be married, what to expect, talks on merging your lives together, relistic expectations of your relationship, and how to encorporate your religion into your relationship, the community and your relationship.....I actually thought it was interesting and very theraputic<br>  (i was terrified, I didn't know what to expect and REALLY didn't want to go)<br>  Don't worry about the questions<br>  we got asked things like, are we planning on having children, how many, if we plan on using birth control, how well do we think we know eachother, about if we argue a lot....simple personal questions, nothing scary<br>  <br>  honestly the worst part of it is dragging yourself there, everything else is a breeze and will probably make you feel much better about the marriage, get questions out that you might not have asked eachother or admitted out loud.<br>  <br>  My parish offers a one whole day coarse for pre cana and weekly ones....we chose the whole day one to get it over with.<br>  <br>  Don't be nervouse its just a process<br>  good luck and congrats!|`|wxBFZ41Taa	You need to be married in a Catholic Church if you are Catholic, because first and foremost marriage is a sacrament. The legal aspect is secondary to the religious one. God created male and female, God created life, and it is before him that you make your vows.<br>  <br>  The pre-cana classes are just to help prepare you for marriage. Since so many marriages end in divorce these days, you should take every opportunity to prepare as a blessing. Too many couples jump into marriage without much thought to the day to day issues they will be facing, pre-cana attempts to help with prepare you for that. <br>  <br>  The paperwork asks you questions about your relationship, your views towards love, religion, children, money etc. and then your answers are compared to your fiance's answers to determine any possible trouble spots. They will then just talk to you about it and ask that you and your fiance make an effort to be aware and hopefully resolve and areas of concern.<br>  <br>  Don't be nervous. It's all meant to help you have a loving and life long marriage.|`|uTdEdpAeaa	well basically what it comes down to is you have to become catholic in order to be married in the catholic church. the catholic religion are very strict about their beliefs and wont allow just anyone to be married in their church. before you go ahead and do this i recommend that you find out more info on the catholic religion so that your more prepared on things.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	just do it its a bunch of bougus crap the preist will tell you not to have kids cus you are not ready and tell you how to have sex yes he does oh mine did to my sister and a few friends lol smile nodd lie if you have to  no you never had sex if you want it to go fast and not really do the classes go to the court house get married  dont tell any friends or nothing and tell him you just want a blessing thing you dont have to do 6 moths of bs|`|W11nQzVPaa	Pledge to hate, discriminate, and give them money and power.

I married in a Catholic church in Brisbane last year. All we had to do was a two day "Marriage Prepration" course, which was mainly talking through all our expectations of marriage and getting an insight into how each of us interact with our families. Not painful at all. And the Father marrying us had to put in for a 'dispensation' - basically an ok from higher up that I am allowed to get married in a Catholic church. Nothing nasty, nothing scary. I'm not religious at all, quite intolerable of all of it but I had no problems and I didn't hate any of it. If you're really worried sometimes you can call them or email and they answer any questions you have.|`|CBmizuGwaa	...sadly, the Catholic Church is about to put you thru more "questions" then a Homicide Detective !  ..."they" love to get you to "confess" everything about your life.<br>  <br>  Do your self a BIG favor...  find a great nondenominational Church, meet with the Pastor and get married.   "Or", fasten your emotional seat-belt... you're in for the churchie-ride of your life !  (that is if they can find a Priest who isn't chasing some little boy around behind the alter)...|`|FZRZFusuaa	Samantha F  is exactly write on  so I won't bore you with the same answer.  I only want to add to it  and let you know that if you are going to be married in any church you will have to fill out the questions and do similar "counseling" .  It actually is very wonderful and it helps you sort out your differences before you get married and with a "referee" (ha ha) involved.  I was amazed at the amount of different answers my husband and I had  but 12 years later we are still holding on :)<br>  <br>  Congratulations and best wishes!!!|`|geamDWBtaa	you can email me but why do you want to get married in a catholic church, i don't have nothing against catholics but like the other guy said you have to do a lot just to have them Marie you, is that your religion, if it is not then go to a different church.......My wife grew up catholic and we were going to get married in a Cath. church but i said nope..........i grew up baptist and im not going to give my life story to them.........so hey good luck...........|`|wKfP840raa	Well, is either of you Catholic? I am marring a catholic man, and the only thing , and I am not Catholic,we had to do was fill out some paperwork, like our names, b-day, address, phone number, our parents names, our maid of honor, and best man, are we legally able to be married ( in other words have you been married before) do we promise to raise our children (if any) in the catholic religion. That was it. I was told that I would have to answer a ton of questions about why I wanna marry him, do I believe in god, blah, blah, blah...but no, I didn't.  As for Pre-Cana...I have no Idea. sorry.
UJdg5zRkaa	It could be due to any new medications he may be taking, but I agree.. clear your minds and let it be natural|`|16vMIGPiaa	Stress<br>  Fatigue<br>  Poor diet<br>  Medication<br>  <br>  If he's young and otherwise healthy, don't worry about it too much.  Back up, slow down, help him get his mind on the present.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is, most guys don't realize that 3/4 of sex is between our ears.  We spend so much time 'itchy' when we're young (because of testosterone) that we don't understand intimacy begins with what we're thinking.  It can end that way, too...|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	You both are trying too hard instead of letting it come naturally|`|CO02h77iaa	could also be performance anxiety. Some men go through it and it really sucks. Its frustrating and it can lead to other issues in the bedroom. However, he just needs to relax. If it is performance anxiety, you may need to talk to him to help him. Talk dirty. If you already do, get dirtier.

jGKGlxAuaa	Guys are not complicated. He is not part of you group, and you are having worlds collide. It is how you rationalize yourself. You are making things more difficult that need to be. Listen to your inner voice, not a group that expects a social cookie cutter.|`|POHWTDPRaa	This is actually not at all complicated. He probably likes you. If the feeling is mutual go ahead and ask him out. If not, just be flattered he likes you. Ignore his friends. They are just your average teenage male idiots. No, it is not weird that he is 15 and has never dated anyone. No one has at that age. They just think they have.|`|X6TfoE1Paa	more details and i'll be happy to answer... whats so complicated with him?
FFCrkfEMaa	In person: tell him what you said, nothing has really changed based by textes, in fact, this kind of helped your position on your befriending him.|`|r63DBSATaa	YOU TELL THAT BOY YOU LIED. YOU LOVE HIM.<br>  <br>  Now, you two can run off and get married. Sounds simple, right? It is.

OFJFLs2Paa	The thing to find out is to have someone ask him about it. If you don't have anyway of doing that then write him a letter and see if he will write back. Also another thing that you can do is just try and talk to him and see if he gives something back to you. Like a reaction that he likes you. I don't know you can take your pick there is many ways and things that you can do to find out this information. Well Good Luck and I hope that he likes you! =D
lwXGNizGaa	You cannot.  Please do not even think about talking to your son like that.  Imagine you were your son's age and your father came up and to you and started telling you how to please a woman.  Now, maybe he did this and that's why you don't think it would be the scariest thing ever but trust me, your son is better off doing things this way.  No one wants to think about their dad having sex.|`|qg11igznaa	Um, doesn't this sound a little off to you? You're son has a picture book of men performing sexual acts with other men. Then, you find that your son has sexually oriented emails from other men. He won't bring his girlfriend home perhaps because she's not a girl at all. Have you ever considered that your son might be gay? I don't mean to offend you or your son, but perhaps you should consider that he is not 100% heterosexual. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, rummaging through your son's room and email is a gross breach of privacy. Maybe he's hiding something that he isn't ready to tell you. Give him time to come around. Moreover, I can guarantee he'll be both embarrassed and offended that you went through his things.
DbVOtAIBaa	Having sex with him is not going to help your situation at all. Its just going to worsen it at the most.... So, STOP IT !!<br>  Secondly if he really loved you, he would of never left you. Now he is just using you. Your just being very easy for him. He is getting what he wants very easily.<br>  Its pretty obvious he wont say that he hates you cause that way he wont get sex.<br>  He doesn't love you and is using you. Your just going to get more messed up. It will be better to get out of this as early as possible. Move on with your life. You'll surely find someone more deserving than him.<br>  <br>  Regards from India.|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	that depends if you just want the sex, then keep seeing him, if you want more, move on.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Stop having sex with him. OMG. What is wrong with girls nowadays. You are not together, so stop doing him. Why do you thinkyou still have feelings for him? You are still emotionally connected to him, and physically by having sex with him. Sex is not the most important thing in the world. If you two cant live without it then just keep on doing it as you are. I think you need to get a little more self respect for yourself and realize you do not have to have sex to live. There are two obvious choices here, keep doing it and feel like crap bc he doesnt want you ( and IMO is just using you for sex cuz he knwos he can) or stop it! Just stop it! That will help you get over him!!!! Get some self respect please, live life for you, not for him, stop living in the past, do something for yourself. Utilize your time better, feel better about yourself and maybe you can find a new, better bf, but just dont make it all about sex.|`|4EWCegiRaa	If he loved you, he'd be with you so obviously him saying "I love you" means nothing.  ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.  And since his action is sleeping with you, I think it's pretty safe to say that he's just saying whatever it takes to sleep with you.<br>  <br>  You should stop sleeping with him.  If he loves you (which he doesn't), he'll keep spending time with you.  If he doesn't love you, he'll stop spending time with you because you're not putting out.<br>  <br>  ---> I know you're afraid that he'll stop spending time with you since you love him but this isn't fair or healthy for you.  You have to have some self respect!|`|mn1HnoGNaa	My grandmother always told me that a man won't buy the cow if he can get the milk for free!!! I wish you the best in this situation!

You don't know this man well enough to be talking about marriage.  You admit you have just wanted to be married for years but you NEVER profess any love for this man.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you wait until you meet someone and fall in love before you contemplate marriage.  You see, what you are doing is putting the cart before the horse.  You want marriage more than you want the person!  You need to seek quality, compatibility, love, respect, commonality, and shared life goals and when you find these then consider marriage.|`|A94u2In8aa	You love him right?Isn't that good enough?You're marrying this guy.Its natural that you would do these things to be with him.Once you get married and start you're life with him you'll realize that these things dont matter and that it was all worth it.<br>  <br>  Did i go a little overboard with the cheesiness?I honestly feel that way though.

You will save yourself a lot of heartache later on in life.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	It sounds like you don't really love him or know him. If you're having this many doubts don't do it.

I am sure it would be pretty easy to find someone better in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  Don't talk to him.  He is a waste of time.
NuUdCz0Laa	As a retired police officer, I find your question interesting.  We all understand the risk of the job, but we fail to realize the effect it causes on our love ones.  The divorce rates are high for this profession, and a lot of it is due to the stresses that the spouses feel.  I think if you could become friends with some of the other police officers wives, it would allow you to talk with others that have the same fears and concerns.  It really is a close knit family and others will not understand what your going through.  So search out some fellow officers wives and lean on each other.  Good luck.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	This gives you very good reasons for concern. When he is home, celebrate your togetherness. Try to focus on what you have together. not every police officer is going to get hurt in the line of duty. Learn to live in the moment with each other. Think positive. Optimistic people live happier lives, if only for the moment.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	What helps a lot of people is to talk, talk, talk.  The vast majority of days, police are in no danger at all.  Even on the days they face danger, they are trained to minimize it in numerous ways, such as by calling for backup, by using proper restraints on those they arrest, and so forth.  Your husband completely understands how he minimizes risk - you need to hear about it so that you'll know he's relatively safe most of the time.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	My brother is a SWAT sergeant here in Vegas. He's on the northtown force- The Nasty Boys. His wife has worried about him for 20 some odd years, but she says you live life one day at a time and enjoy each day to the fullest. Plus, with all the modern equipment and up to date training that police officers receive these days, fewer of them are being injured or killed on the job. Still, it is a risky business, so you have to learn to live with the fact that one day he may not be coming home from work. It takes nerves of steel and a strong faith. Good luck.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	You knew he had a dangerous job when you got involved.  You just have to accept that anything could happen in the line of work he is in.  Find yourself an outlet of something you enjoy doing, perhaps this will help you.|`|zRtOplYtaa	must coppers dont do much except for sit around<br>  its the community officers that get involved in the issues|`|dAsrWr3Maa	Ask to do a ride-a-long with him or another female officer.  That will give u an idea on what he actually does the 12 hrs he's on shift.  Needless to say being a Police Officer is a dangerous job, some days just consists of taking Incident Reports and Traffic Stops (although they can turn nasty in a split second). Hes a trained professional, never let him go to work angry with you and never be angry at him when he leaves for work!  <br>  The other comment was right about divorce rates!  Law Enforcement is one of the highest!  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Mkn6vYO0aa	Not really. It's natural to feel like that. I've got friends going into the army and the navy and I can never stop thinking about how hurt they can possibly get. Just kiss him and say i love you everyday before he leaves for work so that you know that was the last thing you said and did if (god forbid) anything happened to him.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Police work is always something to be worried about.  Unless you don't love your husband you will always worry.  You can always find a police officer wives club if there are none in your area then form one of your own you will be shocked to find out your not the only one that is worried.|`|Rc7v5qsDaa	I understand how hard that can be on you.. You love someone so much and their job is dangerous.You worry..But if the worrying is taking away from living and enjoying.. It is too much. Be proud you have a husband who is willing to help others.. Just tell him you love him everyday and how proud of him you are.. We all worry!|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Keep reminding yourself that your husband is highly trained professional unlike you or I who wouldn't have the first clue on how to handle situations he may or may not get involved in.|`|Js3cLOrFaa	Yu get good pension if he die on yob.......|`|H7UphlLCaa	i dunno, my husband wants to do that too :(  meh.
x2w1JbHyaa	You should run to him and tell him how you feel!!! IT is Obviously true love if you still think about him after all this time!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!<br>  <br>  PS Don't take no for an answer!!
QEEweJUaaa	YEAH ITS A GOOD OMEN!|`|qRM0r7eVaa	I wouldnt go out with anyone who gives you a percentage based on how much she likes you...but hey thats just me.|`|094BOoy7aa	She does not like you when you are drinking.  Some people change. I know I do!  She is concerned about going out with you because does not want to deal with the "drunk" you.|`|U2tx9gDHaa	Yeah it is a good sign but shes not gonna put up with you boozing so if youre prepared to keep off the drink then go for it.|`|UDpcEqTbaa	its a good sign, if you really want her than stop drinking cuz i bet you she's not gonna put up with ur drinking and she'll leave you nd u'll regret it..u never knw wat u got till its gone
r6L6uNMuaa	go to clubs or bars there are a lot of nice places here in houston!<br>  youll find great things to do also like rock climbing, hiking and stuff join a club organization or church also, or a singles club there are many here lots of people to meet!<br>  or just go play some pool and you can meet random guys that will become your friends!!<br>  I hope this helps!
zlp9jxjaaa	Somewhere right in between really.<br>  I like to know there's muscles in there but I think a "soft" appearance is nice. I don't want a girl like one of those wrestler chicks. :p|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	shoulder and triceps muscles are a turn off for me.

F9Ll7oLJaa	you want solution go to a good astrologer and pay fees  do not waste your time here|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Start studying palmistry books and depend on that|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Your married life will suck.

Both fire signs...passionate but could get a little fiery at times. Good luck!
65ojSBXgaa	There might be something going on. Know that when a person have a baby daddy or momma that person will always be there because of their kid till that child turns 18 you will always see that kids dad for a while. But for him to stay for an hour? That sounds very strange I know if I had you (example) and I had a kid with someone else I wouldnt want that fool to stay for an hour he better take my kid and bounce! you feel me? because I know its over and I split because I dont want him. It's rare to see a kids mom and dad be just friends 99% the parents cant stand each other but in this case I think she might still have feelings for him, but dont take my word for it. Ask yourself can you trust her? Do you know she loves you? Do you think she respects you? All these things you need to know in order to make it work. Another thing is did you ever spoke to her about her real feelings? Ask her if she still has something for this dude and to be honest dont just settle for BS ok! Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Gail Friend ( this was my two cents)|`|16vMIGPiaa	You talk with her and ask her what's up.<br>  She is going to be in relationship with her child's father for the next 18 years if he's a resonsible and honorable man.  If you and she get together, you'll have to get used to the idea that you are a co-parent with him and work something out.
AA11292270	This may seem strange to you, but the reason he breaks up with you every time he relapses is because his friends in AA are telling him to.  "No relationships in the first year of sobriety" is the rule.  So is "your family and friends can't understand you like we can, so you need to cut them off and spend all your time with us."<br>  <br>  I have been sober for over ten years now, and I still cringe at the dreadful things, just like this, that I saw happen in AA.  My heart goes out to you.<br>  <br>  As far as getting back together...your breakup only lasted two weeks last time, so he'll probably change his mind.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, you might want to educate yourself about AA and alternative programs.|`|UgcPxd4maa	All I am going to tell you is be there for him. This is an important step in fully recovering from his addiction. You need to prepare yourself though. You might get back together, and you may not. It just depends on how he is feeling during his recovery process. He needs to figure things out and get his mind right. So, just do what you can by being there for him, but do not pressure him with any relationship questions. He most likely doesn't know, and can't figure out, what he wants/need right now. Good luck to both of you!
0myrXJKMaa	Tell him that if he doesnt leave you alone, you are going to be forced to take proper action. Meaning you go to the school counselor or principal and tell them whats going on. You need to be firm with him when you say LEAVE ME ALONE. Do not even accept his letters! If he texts you, do not answer him. Obviously you are going to tell him no to the prom. Do not even agknowledge this dude. If you ignore him, maybe he will get the picture. If you keep talking to him and accepting his letters he is getting mixed signals.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	what he is doing is not only freaky but illegal tell him 1 more time clearly to leave you alone if he doesn't show the letters and tell the story to the school your parents whoever can help he is a stalker|`|JkTGq2BJaa	2 words<br>   Restraining order.|`|5aoAcXDGaa	go out with me instead and tell him that u have a bf :P<br>  <br>  Im always a good excuse to keep them weird guy out :D ;-)|`|cn49BbRiaa	You need to cut off all communicatons from him.|`|094BOoy7aa	Exactly! I agree with your friend up there! Great answer
IZvbv5ONaa	Just the fact that this random guy was hitting on you seems kind of odd.  Did he know you were waiting for someone?  It seems like he was just trying to cause problems...It SEEMS that way.<br>  <br>  Second, sometimes it is pretty shocking to see a person you like, 'flirting' with someone else.  Although, he should also be able to take things into perspective and not act like an a**hole.<br>  <br>  Try to talk to Jonathan.  If he refuses to understand or he is still mad at you.  I wouldn't waste too much time on it.  He will come back eventually.  Just give it time.<br>  <br>  Next time this happens to you.  Pretend to be busy doing something (ie. get on the phone, do homework) and tell him you would rather not talk right now.  Don't worry about being rude, since he was already being rude to you with his unwelcome advances.
IZvbv5ONaa	Threats and/or carrying out threats of assault is a crime.  Call the police.<br>  <br>   You could try and let your ex know this and just give him a heads up.  Don't yell and be very clear and controlled.  Clearly explain to him that he is not together anymore and that you will have to call the police if he keeps threatening you or your friend.  If he does not, then you have no other choice.<br>  <br>  How long are you going to let him do this for?<br>  <br>  Preferably get some audio or video of your ex making these threats in case this ever goes to court...
k9uspUrTaa	He is your EX boyfriend you can't worry about what he says. Your relationship with him is over. Maybe you should tell him that?
M2rZw2KXaa	just be charming but not over the top. to much is a turn off. show you care :)|`|g5pZhzeoaa	Confidence!! Just look happy and like you know how to have a fun time.

How the heck did that happen? Don't answer. Does he have a girlfriend? Hey, don't do that again!

You should be careful if he's wanting to have sex but you've never done anything like kissing or something.

72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	First thought is, STAY IN SCHOOL!  Your spelling is not good enough to leave school yet!  As to the lying MIL, well, she might get to be a problem, and even though people will say you are marrying HIM, you will end up having to deal with her at important family functions, once you are married.  She will be there at Easter, Christmas, Hanukkah and so on.  Its always difficult trying to deal with people who are not forthright and honest.  I might try by being that way with her.  Like when you see her next and she says how pretty the ring is, say to her "I heard you didn't like it, but I don't understand why you told me how much you liked it, if you really didn't!  I would much prefer you be HONEST with me, even if I don't like the answer!"  Then be a bog girl and be prepared to hear it honestly from her.  Don't run to Dan and cry when she says something she honestly feels.  But don't expect that tiger to change her stripe either, chances are, she is used to saying EXACTLY what she thinks BEHIND your back.  Learn how to cope and deal with it, because she will be his Mother FOREVER!  You on the other hand, can grow weary of it and not be his wife for life.  So I would learn either how to deal with it, or how to ignore it.  Good luck and CONGRATULATIONS!|`|QieRAMLkaa	I know your in love and you two could have been together for years and years but take my advice and wait a little bit longer for the wedding, maybe 2 years, enjoy your engagement.  Wedding planning is super stressfull  (just look at the amount of questions people post on here!)  and your graduating school soon which is stressful.  Make sure it really is right.<br>  I was engaged at your age and it was DISASTEROUS   (as are 90 percent of the people I knew who had gotten engaged between 17-21)   I thought I knew the boy I was marrying and, well lets just say he grew up to be a very different man than I anticipated.  And I had been dating him for 3 years before being engaged, I KNEW who he was....growing up changes people.  You want different things now than you will in a year, two years, five years.<br>  <br>  Im engaged again to a different man now, im in my mid 20s, and things are right this time<br>  <br>  As for his mother.  Ignor her, people tell white lies not to hurt people's feelings thinking its what they want to hear instead of the truth, at least its just little things like that.<br>  I do wish you good luck, but hope that you do wait a year or two for marriage|`|sGP6s7uraa	Mothin-in-LAW.  I would wait until you're graduated before having to deal with her issues.  By then, she should feel better about the situation.|`|di6p10Ifaa	Honey I am in the same boat. I have a question. Is he an only child or the baby or something?? My fiance is the only child and wow am I having some serious issue with his mom. She is like trying to hang on to him as hard as she can. When we told her that we need some privacy, she just bursts into his house when she wants, she started bawling and talking about suicide and how we just don't want her in our lives and how everything would be much better if she was just gone. Then she started having some kind of a seizure, honestly I think it was all b.s. His mom is just having attachment issues. Most likely you will always have problems with her if you don't stand up to her in a kind and firm manner.<br>  <br>  "Speak softly but carry a big stick." Teddy Roosevelt.<br>  <br>  Try to avoid confrontation, you don't want that. Let her know how much you love her, but assure her that she does not need to feel like she can't be 100% honest with you. Stick firm to your ground and don't let her run over you and treat you like you are naive and she can get away with doing this. I wish you the best, I know this is hard, my future mother in law is so controlling and dramatic but I just stick firm on my ground. Mother in laws can be tricky. Best wishes and congrats.
TCpWVW4Raa	You need to meet him a ton more, people can be different around them and you need to really see how he when you're physically around him and not just over the phone|`|YJA9ojYwaa	You need to meet up with him alot more if you want him to propose. Chances are he is already got a girlfriend or even married!!|`|1686558f3523295a23a1c80d4e95f0f4aa	You need to step back and get him to call you.  If you are the one calling all the time, it is time for you to feel needed and wanted.  If you don't call him for a while, he will pick up the phone.  And if he doesn't, then you do not need to marry him.... Good luck.
pVnUhYLQaa	Call him Mister [last name] or Sir. I go as far as Daddy and Master, but some might think that's too far.<br>  <br>  Experiment with some bondage; handcuffs, rope, blindfolds etc...<br>  <br>  Call yourself dirty names; i.e. "I'm your dirty wh0re sir" or "I've been a bad little sl*t Mister"<br>  <br>  Hot hot hot.<br>  <br>  Remember if you're going to go deeper into BDSM, educate yourself on it, discuss it with him before hand, know your soft and hard limits and make sure he knows them, have a safe word (When you're in a roll play or fantasy scenario "no" can be part of the "game"/scene. A safe word would be a word that you wouldn't ordinarily say during sex; i.e. Tangerine or Armageddon). When the safe word is said, all play stops.<br>  <br>  It can be a lot of fun.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Marie, you could try roll playing some fantasies, if you want to take it up a level, you can dress the part of the roll play.

HfAwFxktaa	Your boyfriend is too worried about you (a protective type of boyfriend). And to tell you the truth we are always worried when you girls dont inform us where you go. Always inform your boyfriend where you go because there is an ego for us men that it might be possible to be an outcome of a negative idea. Ask him what are the things he hates that you oftenly do, vice versa. and then try to change. maybe he will change. It is all about fairness, trust and loyalty. Love is all about understanding, if he/she accepts your worst then he/she deserves you the best.|`|kENdoYaUaa	That's definitely insecurity and immaturity. But it's certainly not proof that he's cheating. It sounds to me like he let his emotions get ahead of him as far as his feelings for you are concerned. <br>  Even though his behavior is damaging, you should be careful not to blame him for it until you've talked about it with him. If he doesn't show any sign of admitting the problem or wanting to correct it, then it's a dead end.|`|GSea2APraa	he sounds insecure. my boyfriend was the same way for awhile i have a lot of guy friends and whenever i would get a text from them or bring them up he would get a little stiff and angry. he got over it eventually because he realized that i wouldn't cheat on him, but it was a pain for awhile. it didn't mean he was cheating on me because i knew he wasn't. if your boyfriend starts blaming you for things that you didn't do that might mean that he is cheating just because he is paranoid so he'll blame you for what he's doing. its not always the case though so don't jump to conclusions and hurt him.|`|094BOoy7aa	He does sound insecure.  What is he doing huh?  They usually get distant when they are cheating-and/or controlling demanding.|`|V7iDTULQaa	He is either cheating on you.<br>  <br>  Way too possesive<br>  <br>  <br>  OR he is paranoid.<br>  <br>  He's not a drug addict is he?<br>  <br>  Get rid of him.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	so your bf is insecure and does not trust you<br>  he is not cheating on you by the sound of it, he is just scared you will cheat on him|`|quPY9x7qaa	i've found that if someone acts like they think you are cheating they are the one that's either doing it already or considering it|`|KzmrWzOJaa	Sounds possessive.|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	HE IS NOT ONLY INSECURE BUT IS CONTROLLING AND IT WILL ONLY  ESCALATE IN TIME, ASIDE THE FACT HES ALWAYS MAD THEREFORE ITS NOT A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

NTUr0t3haa	If you suspected that your sister would feel you're trespassing into her private life and into her friendships, then yes.<br>  <br>  Update: This is not really about the man, it's about you and your sister.
OFJFLs2Paa	Well try and find out some how if she likes you still if she don't like you still then I think it would be best to leave it alone. It really don't matter with us girls we will still go for someone that we did like if we were single. So you don't have nothing to worry about at all. Good Luck and I hope that she likes you. If she don't like you, just know that there is a lot of people in this world that you can have. =D
yyvMOwQjaa	It's called PMS!! Cut her some slack she could be stressed or something major is happening in her life and she doesn't know how to tell you.

Piano is for all ages, not only for kids. I'm 17, and I've been playing piano all my life.

OZ955jRuaa	If it was me, I would probably say that you're not there, but you may like him again in the future...<br>  <br>  See, ignoring a guy because he doesn't like you back is trying to move on, knowing that you still like him or are afraid of liking him again. You know that you are completely over him, not halfway there like you are right now, when you are able to talk to him like nothing has happened. <br>  <br>  In his case, I think he liked being in a friendship with you and misses you. Give him a chance! How would you like it if that happened to you?|`|H84n72Nlaa	honestly... give up.|`|wfGGIOLJaa	He obviously doesn't know what he wants....leave it alone.

She can find someone else to turn to for support.  Hopefully someone she hasn't bad-mouthed.|`|SxI6y9GWaa	Sounds like she's reaping what she's sown.  She was horrible about you and didn't mind you suffering so why should you feel obliged to 'be there' for her?  Stop feeling guilty about it.

You are hurting and I don't see her giving you the caring treatment.|`|ZjJj1tluaa	just ignore the ***** if she did you wrong then there is no reason for you to comfort her just go on with your life and let the ***** be there is an old saying " Those who talk **** about other people, get the **** in return"|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	IMO I dont think you need to care for her. For one, she isnt that good a friend to you obviously, if she is talking smack behind your back. You are right, she should have said something to your face if she had something to say. So point one, she doesnt care. So you shouldnt. Besides, it would be faulty 'caring' on your part anyways. You shouldnt lower yourself to her level. You would be doing basically the same thing to her. You dont care but your faking it? I would rather have someone NOT care for me, or take care of me, if they dont mean it sincerely. Be better than that. Tell her flat out you know what she said, and that you dont appreciate it. Yeah women need to vent, but in the appropriate way. She can talk to another friend about it. Friend being key word.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	If she betrayed you then you have no reason to be there for her.  She can't expect you to be there after she stabbed you in the back.<br>  <br>  I say either talk it out until you are satisfied, or walk away.|`|MorbsRp5aa	start to care and if you cant do that just fake|`|RdnVoxrjaa	Dont push yourself just to be nice.. You obviously have a good heart.. and you deserve a friendship with the same responce.. we all go through good and bad times.. she messed up her chance to actually have you there on her bad times.. i think you should just let it be and live your life with true friends.. not with ones that just make you feel guilty for not being there if you aint.. even if you dont want to.. always follow your senses.. who knows maybe you will talk to her and be there for her.. but do it for you! just to calm down that bothering inside of you.. the rest.. it shouldnt really matter. :)|`|s2Aq96pIaa	ok, here it is. <br>  <br>  Ask yourself this. Are you ready to grow up and have a real life. I can't stand people who talk behind your back. and you feel like you havnt done anything wrong. However to consider to go back and comfort someone that needs comfort after something like that is so big of you.<br>  However after your comfort mode consider some real friends whom arent going to talk behind your back. And tell that person/ persons why you are ending your relationship if youd like to. sometimes this will pull your true friends.maybe not that second or that day.Or just stop communicating with them. Sound like you are very smart and have plans to further your education. So No need to cry about the past and i hope your education takes you to the moon. <br>  Hoever i reverse this on you if you are at fault and and writing this makes you just as guilty as talking behind her back. So anyways <br>  good luck.

XgZGJWFBaa	Surely if you have had mediation as well as advise from the police to stop cotact between your child and her father due to the harrassment etc you would be able to have that all docomented in your favour.<br>  Unfortunitly there are too many people that use these allergations to prevent the other parent from seeing the child resulting in making it more difficult for a person who really needs help to keep their child safe. All parents need to remember that at the end of the day its not his right to see his child nor is it your right to prevent the child from seeing him, at the end of the day its the childs right to know both its parents, and i am sure you are aware that is all the family courts care about is the rights of the child.<br>  I would reckomend that you show the family courts that you are willing and encouraging a relationship between your daughter and her father, as family courts do not look favourably on parents that try to prevent this, but just insist that you have concerns for the safety of the child and want visitation between the two to occour at a contact center where a third party who is an employee of the center will supervise the visitation between the two ensuring your child will be safe, and this way no contact between you and him will need to occour if you fear your own safety as well. If he has a tendency of having a short temper etc he will not be able to continue this act up and eventually show his true colours, and being at a contact center with a neutral third party that works there as a witness of his conduct.<br>  I also reckomend that you try not to stress about the situation to much as he may decide to claim your unable to look after yourself let alone your child, people do say and do nausty things when children are involved.<br>  I wish you all the best|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	What do you want us to tell you?

You're both of legal age, so there's no age related moral issue I can see. <br>  <br>  But the big age difference does ask for trouble.  For instance, when she's 65, he'll be 79.  If it's just dating, I'd say - don't ask for trouble, don't start.  <br>  <br>  Also, unless the guy is particularly attractive, or the gal is particularly unattractive, I'd wonder why a 28 year old would be interested in a 42 year old.  Is there money involved?  Caution may be indicated.|`|PeI5rpK1aa	Yea. Think about it. If you you had a daughter, would you feel comfortable with them dating someone so much older. And anyway, how can you possibly have anything in common.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	Yes, that is to big an age gap.

But I have to question getting married in the first place.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Wrong in what sense ?<br>  If you ask me then yes its wrong because you should get out of a marriage if you can share your partner with another person. So first of all I think its wrong to stay in a relationship where there is no respect for one another, you could be married to anyone and still have these feelings so its obvious you have not found your soul mate.<br>  If you are asking if its wrong legally then I dont think there is a law against what you do behind closed doors providing there is no money exchanged for deeds done.<br>  I am so glad I am marrying a man that loves me beyond sex.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Its up to the two in the marriage. I personally do NOT agree with it. If you want to sleep with other people, why get married. A marriage is supposed to be a sacred vow between two people. Not 3, or 4, or more. Anyways, its up to the two people married, if they can agree on it, and make it work, I guess thats their deal. I personally LOVE my fiance, and plan to make him my husband. Two words there, LOVE and MY. He is mine, not for anyone else to touch or be touched by. It makes me want to barf thinking of another woman touching him, orbeing touched by him. Same goes for me, I do not want another man ( or woman) touching me at all. Id o not want to touch anyone else. I love him and he loves me. Period.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	No, if both of you feel the same way about it.

k0BF9M0Haa	My goodness girl, well I suppose you can do one of two things...<br>  <br>  1) Subtly hint that you like him back and get him to start TALKING on the phone instead. You can use the jealous factor to your advantage but definitly don't push it or else you'll drive him away.<br>  <br>  2) Grow a backbone and ask him out yourself! It's obvious he likes you and he's just probably unsure and afraid that he'll get rejected.. being in the Navy and all. So use your guts and ask him out. :]<br>  <br>  Don't fret over it too much... I honestly can't say that he likes you because I'm no expert, but take a risk and see where it goes. It might lead to something good and whether you get rejected or not it's an experience that you're gonna have to go through right?<br>  <br>  Anywho, hope this helped!

I am sorry, I wasn't trying to be mean.|`|zUZRPmYAaa	I think he has other woman on the side, you deserve much better. I know its hard, but why live like that?|`|jWYGcNQ8aa	enough, concentrate on yourself, work out, makeover, church even school,etc upgrade yourself do something... stop worrying about him and if he love You .get into something new. get those negative energy out, punch it out at the gym or paint in splashes. just stop worrying. i know its better said than done but you have kids if he don't need you those kids do and i bet someone else might too.if you start worrying and end up depressed you will be useless to everyone in question but honestly be good to yourself first then things should fall in place.

eXzUJbQJaa	I can, even though you have had bad past experiences with men, doesn't mean all guys are like that, Im deffo NOT like that at all, so you should trust him, but you have the right to be a bit cautious but don't let him know--maybe,|`|QqY8YgGDaa	If you two are ideal partners ,any one will be happy to help you to marry. Hence you start to note down  the good qualities ,bad qualities, hobbies of your lover .Similarly ,you should also make a list of your good qualities ,bad qualities, hobbies .You can even use private detectives to observe the good ,bad qualities of your lover .If you are interested ,you can also begin to  read palmistry books to find out the secrets of your lover, even though palmistry is not 100% scientific, you can use it as a tool ,just like police use different tools to open the mouth of criminal!<br>  --You know that you can get still more information from the people who answered here ,by writing e mail messages to them through this section by clicking in their profile|`|82A8E4yzaa	I think....you need to stop worrying and go with the flow....take it step my step..even tell him and talk to him about your trust issues..he should understand , this will help.<br>  <br>  Also give it about 4 weeks...if you still feel like this and have talked to him and still nothing ..i think you should end it...its better for you and him..you may need time on your own..just to be you..instead of all these bf's..<br>  <br>  I have been there..and guys have cheated on me..i am not single and just love it..

That way, if you were ever a bit edgy round him, he'd fully understand why. He'll also like that you've been honest with him, so that brings you closer, making it easier to trust. He sounds sweet, give it a go.|`|zRtOplYtaa	just give him a chance<br>  the 3 mottos in life<br>  live love & laugh|`|eGC2VWzjaa	Go with therapy. It's important to realize that he is not one of the people who did something bad to you, but while you do see that you are not willing to accept it or just can't deal with it. Self esteem issues aside, you will get to the point where you actively look for something to hold against him, like going through his phone, email, wanting to know where he is all the time. Even though it is your trust issue, you will make it difficult for him to trust you and you will sabotage your relationship. A trained therapist could work wonders.|`|7ILeAcQtaa	i think we are to good at looking back at our past  bad experiences and using them over and over in the future<br>  <br>  i think you need to start a fresh no matter how you treat this person if they are going to be horrible and cheat on you, not trusting them is not going to make them stop it if they are going to cheat they will.<br>  <br>  you need to open up to this person and enjoy your new relationship if it lasts then great if not then move on to the next until you find the right man|`|eTYfa49Baa	I have had this same issue... my ex cheated on me with my best friend, got her pregnant, and now they are together.... lol. my current boyfriend is the best thing but i have a hard time trusting him. be open with the other person, and be honest. tell them that it is going to take you a while, and to bare with you! they should understand and will be more patient with you when you get upset about things with trust.|`|jLdLCMtWaa	if you really like this person you need to sit back  and find sometime for you an him and tell him about some of the thing that happened in the past that hurt you so maybe he can work with you but at the same time it is good men out here and maybe he's the one you said that he is lovely keep you head up he may be the one good luck.|`|bet4Cugjaa	Explain to him your situation.<br>  By the way he responds you'll be able to tell if you can trust him.
m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, congrats on wanting your marriage blessed.  You can do it any way you want and you should do it the way that is comfortable for you and your husband.  I personally would arrive and walk together.  You are already legally married.  But you can also be more traditional too.  Bottom line is...this is something wonderful and spiritual that you two are doing for yourselves.  So you plan it the way you want it.  Invite who you want, come in as you wish, and just enjoy the experience.  Good luck!|`|NB4h4jTyaa	You do it however you want to do it.

You dug your hole.............|`|b3zGfYMpaa	7 weeks pregnant with her boyfriend or what? <br>  Ok the bottom line is..the damage is already done. Hurting your sister is inevitable, at some point shes going to find out mise well stop while your ahead. The worst way your sister could find out is from someone else. I'd tell her now or its only going to be worse later or the longer you continue the affair.|`|qPuC39Wkaa	First question to you is: Why did you go do a thing like that? What's done is done.  You have to tell her and suffer the consequences.  Do you and this guy love each other? Are you willing to lose your sister's trust? You have to ask yourself these questions.  Let her know...  That's the only logical answer.|`|TnSB6rpeaa	uh...well it's a little late for that you slept with her boyfriend. She is going to find out. The best thing to do now is break it off NOW!!!!!!!!!!!! And also i would tell her what has happened before she finds out through the pregnancy.|`|1ZgV0AbGaa	too little too late!!|`|2qDxhtTfaa	Oh god. That wasn't a very smart thing to do. You just HAVE to tell her, and yes she will be very hurt. Tell her ASap
gqHy3821aa	Umm i don't know why that is. Maybe you are giving off a just friends vibe. Get more flirty and since you know guys and talk to them you won't have to look for a guy. Just get more friendly and flirty with them.|`|mOayTJDmaa	Changing your style of clothes or hair might help.  I can't say though because I don't know what you look like.|`|clAnRWIMaa	Hate to be the one to answer, but maybe you're not as hot.  If you want an honest answer, put a pic of you and your friend on your profile or 360. I'll tell ya honestly why, but only if you really wanna know.
74899a0ccf16967b028c8f8857f91af3aa	It's ok to think about the good times.  You should consider this two year relationship as an experience, not a mistake.  Your feelings of freedom and happiness after the breakup is normal.  That's your body telling you that you made the right decision (kinda like a gut feeling).  Also, I wouldn't let her insecurities and obsessiveness stop you from being happy.  No one should have to deal with that on a daily basis.  From my experience, most people who start off as insecure and obsessive don't change with any amount of counseling.  I think you should move on and find someone with less baggage/issues.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Just remember all the bad things and move on.|`|fqboOITjaa	Well you're reminiscing about the good times, were the bad times something you remember too? <br>  <br>  Maybe you're idealising the relationship now that you're out of it, grass is always greener type of thing. <br>  <br>  I know some people can be insecure when their insecurities start to take over your own life then you have to take action and I personally think you did the right think breaking up with her. If you got back together now do you think she would be any different?|`|f5c840d7deb2bdbef3fa8b152ae928adaa	You'll probably feel like that for a while.  Even though it was you that ended it, that still doesn't mean you don't care about her.  You were together for 2 years and you can't just switch off those feelings overnight.  She was a big part of your life and you won't be able to just forget.  It will get easier, keep yourself busy and even though you had good times together just remind yourself why you weren't right for each other.|`|WFZB4QnSaa	Maybe because as time goes on... the bad memories fade and all you are left with are the good memories... thats all you think now that you see her|`|6nq1IiqXaa	move on.|`|RlgGkQjqaa	Was she always like that? Did you try and talk about it first? if after two years of her insecurities that you couldnt sort it out and try and communicate your frustrations, you may not have loved her as much as you thought, its always the same once you dont have something you miss it. thinking about the good times is good, its all experience ready for your next relationship, write down your likes and dislikes of your ex, what you enjoyed, what you would like from a relationship, it will get easier if you are certain there is no going back, you must have had feelings for her they dont just go away, you are young, and if it was getting to intense you may need to just date girls and not long term you will be fine i know how you must be feeling, but every choice you make is the right one good luck hope that helped
UDENYO4raa	Isn't that crazy??? <br>  <br>  I know you miss him, but I'm sure you'll have plenty more relationships. Heartbreak stinks, but no one ever died from it, and you will get through it.. I promise..<br>  <br>  You definately should just move on.. I've heard crazy stories about men who have been MARRIED and just woke up out of bed one day and decided that they just didn't want to be with her anymore.. Crazy, huh? <br>  <br>  We'll never understand men, and they'll never understand us... Just grab a big bag of Reeses and some good munchie food, and have a girls night... It will definately help.|`|E5rhAaLGaa	OoH Mii GaWdd II DOn't knoW !!|`|rmbUuqlRaa	Because you are obviously not smart enough for him.|`|qPuC39Wkaa	I went through the same thing.  I simply gave him what he wanted and that was space.  No call, text, no nothing.  I missed him like hell.  I felt horrible. He finally called me after a while and now we are dating each other again but only as friends.  But it's a start.  So you might try to be absent out of his life and let him miss you too.|`|UDpcEqTbaa	idk, guys are hard 2 understand. idk wat 2 say cuz i dnt knw ur situation. if u hurt him tell him all ur feelings bout him nd how much u care. if he jus left then move on, it'll be hard. jus delete everythng that reminds him of u nd keep ur mind busy so u dnt hve a lot of time to think out him|`|W6evzbxBaa	Learn to speak English...

Just be yourself, and be nice.  Maybe she will not settle for just anything, because she doesnt have to.  Maybe this girl want something that is real, not just some guy who is cute and used to having a lot of girlfriends.  Maybe you have to work to get her attention.|`|UjZlmagEaa	This girl seems brilliant.<br>  I'm sure you're attractive, but maybe you're immature.

You can't really force her or try to pressure her to do it. <br>  <br>  My advice is to back off and let her decide for herself. Pressuring her might produce a negative result.|`|TLim2pBTaa	You should just stay cool and not contact her for a while. Maybe then she'll realize what she lost and want to get back with you. But the more you're around her and pressuring her the less she'll want to be with you.|`|w2pttJfeaa	Sounds like she's playing games, ignore her for awhile and MOVE ON WITH YOUR OWN LIFE!!

I was told, if I lover her let her go, which I did.  You can't change the past, and there is no real answer for this. If she doesn't want to get back with you, it's not gonna happen, no matter what you do.  What I did to get over a girl I loved was to sleep with as many women as possible. I know, what it sounds like, but it worked.|`|LCCVCHmWaa	dude I feel so bad for you I was in the same situation I had this girl that i loved and she broke up with me and I wanted her back so bad but she kept saying no.but then I found the love of my life and lets just say im going to go buy a ring next week. but man i wish you good luck.ask her why she doesnt want to date again see if she feels the same way u feel. good luck.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	Just try to turn the table on her example just stop trying and brush her and see how the tables turn.|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Move on, it's not worth your time to get hung up on someone for so long that doesn't want to be with you.|`|W6evzbxBaa	Good luck my friend.|`|sxNVjm4daa	tr|`|tqMaqdzXaa	Your ex for whatever reason has lost interest in you or did not love you as much as you loved her. Its hard to accept but if she does not want to work things out there is nothing you can do. You must first learn to love yourself before anything else; you do not need someone else to love you to be happy. come to realize who you are and you will find it much easier to get over her, or she may want you back. Don't try to make her jealous; playing head games will not work. Leave her alone, even ignore her if you have to, to realize your self worth.|`|0xCwNEazaa	Your ex will always love you no matter what but sometimes people need a little space.  They need time to themselves.  Just give her what she wants and if she really care about you she would want to get back with you.  And remember don't beg that can be very annoying.  Just give her time to herself.  You both will always be friends, just repect her wishes...   You can do it, I know you can.|`|SbH0CQYqaa	give her some space and dont crowd her. she wants to be left alone so give her want she wants. try to make her happy. if the relationship doesnt work out, then its not meant to be. just let it be. you cant make someone love you back.|`|BNopOIszaa	I think you should just move on because if she doesnt answer the questions then she obviously dont want to get back with you,, but there is a possiblity that she could be playing hard to get... Theres alot of reasons why she would be asking like this..|`|RUC9m81paa	I would say that your gf does want to get back with you because of the signs she shows of jealousy with the girl but she probley has something that she has in her mind that she doesn't feel comfroble telling you|`|ZQ43sWSpaa	go out with the girl who wants to go out with you, give the grl a chance.|`|geamDWBtaa	move on to the next girl, find someone better...........|`|KFuyBR8qaa	Dont act needy, she's probably just testing you though. Its hard to tell. Give yourself some time to be single or date someone else. If she wants to come back to you after then, give it some thought then decide. And dont lie, just be honest. Because if she is trying to get with you in the future and sees that you lied about being with another girl she'll definately not want to get back with you. <br>  If it doesn't work theres many fish in the sea, trust me. You deserve to be happy not to wait around for some girl who is blowing you off and then comes to care when you try to move on. <br>  Good luck.|`|b2o39q6aaa	give her some time, she will come around eventually.<br>  dont act desperate,girls hate that unless they are the desperate type to. but dont try to make her jealous either cause that might make her lose interest in you. of course she will ask questions like who she is, since she did that i know she still has feelings for you.

Uj5kuzoJaa	Try to build a relationship with her first. Don't try to force her into talking about anything she's not ready to talk about. Take her out, have fun. Then have some serious time with her. Just be there for her when she wants to talk about things. Let her get to it in her own time. All you can do is care for her and let her know that you're always going to be there for her. Once she starts feeling more comfortable with you, she'll probably start opening up to you. Just give it time|`|n2cUQuUHaa	i know what she is going through having gone through it myself, but frankly its moe of a personal problem then something you can do. if you want to ty adn help you should tell her that you feel like shes shutting you out and ask if theres anyway you can help her   but give her time to figure out how to help herself alos

dFHsAXDMaa	life lesson for you to learn here one date better guys and secondly never rely on someone else to do something you can do yourself if you try...dump him and the next guy you date... see how he treats his mother.. if he is good to his mother or sisters he will be good to you.<br>  <br>  A valuable lesson my mother taught me...|`|BzH7l27oaa	You keep meeting jerks like this and let them do you favors.  If you ended up giving him money anyway you should've done it without him all together and borrowed or rented a vehicle to go to the dump.<br>  <br>  edit: btw, if you ask your town hall there is usually one day every now and then that you are allowed to put large items to be dumped out for the garbage mento take.  And it's around the spring time actually I think.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	Many people OFFER to do favors for people, but there is a covert agenda that they want something in return.  Generally, it is a good idea to offer something minimal as a token of gratitude.  In this case I might have offered to buy/make lunch or dinner or since this is a b/f type guy you could give a massage or ...?  The thing is, these might be things you would do ANYWAY, so it's not that much trouble.<br>  If a friend came over to help me with their vehicle, loading it up and taking their time, I would definitely offer some gas money and to pay for the cost of the dump.  Not to be taken advantage of, I think for most vehicles that you might do this sort of project with, $3 per 10 miles is a fair ballpark number.  You shouldn't have to fill his tank from empty if it's 15 miles round-trip.  The premise here is that the favor he is doing is donating his time and vehicle to your cause, not that he is going to pay all the costs incurred by the project.  It's one thing to install someone's home entertainment system for them, TV, Stereo, surround sound, &c.... It's quite another to buy AND install one or even paying for the materials needed (speaker wire, mounting screws, &c.)<br>  My GUESS is this guy envisioned he would show up w/ truck and trailer, load it, go to dump, unload it.  You would pay for the dump fees and maybe offer some gas money (idk how far he drove?)  You didn't have cash for the dump so he starts thinking "Did she expect ME to pay to get rid of HER trash?  Is it not enough that I'm using my truck and giving her free labor?"   So he made it clear that he would LOAN you the money, but by then he was already irritated at the thought that maybe you were trying to take advantage of his generosity.<br>  <br>  Bottom line<br>   For him: let him know that if it's too much trouble to do something, he shouldn't volunteer himself for it.<br>  <br>  For you: When someone does a favor for you, it should generally cost them no more than time and perhaps some resources they already have like using their truck, cherry picker, airless painting equipment, spot welder, DVD burner, sewing machine, &c.  It fosters good relations to offer to purchase or replace any materials needed or used: blank DVDs, fuel, fabric, paint, &c.|`|41m8ihqmaa	Honestly, If I just met a girl who I liked, I wouldn't complain about helping her out, the first impression should be a great impression, complaining to go out of your way isn't the best impression, plus Im in the military and know you gotta just bite your tongue, stuff happens, you get behind, things dont go as planned, don't take it out on someone else its life, be a good guy and help her out, yet in my case that has back fired just recently but its another story, but yeah if he likes you, he should of did it for you not to impress you but to show you he would do it later on down the road|`|RlgGkQjqaa	I have read your question twice and what i see is that you are seeing a guy, romantically? or perhaps romantically soon? that he was offering to help you and you paid him, maybe he was expecting a little bit extra for the time he lost? therefore not much of an offer of help. I assume you thanked him? i assume you helped him load the truck, he sounds stressy to me as you should never do something for someone and then moan about the inconvenience. Get someone else to help next time. I dont think you are missing the point, ask him why he is so grieved, im at a loss to figure out his problem, i think it is just his problem.|`|qDl5Gegbaa	Don't let him offer anymore. Make it a point that his offers are from that, an offer. and moree like a guilt trip that you don't feel like dealing with. He's a grown a s s man and if it was that big of a problem instead of whining about it, he would have stated the fact that he would love to help you but can't afford to get behind on his job. <br>  <br>  I agree with the first answer, you might as well have just done it by yourself. "caused him greif" lol come on....you need to find yourself a real man who will either actually help you or one who will be straightforward with you.
6YbxTlDCaa	you are doing the right thing...exactly the right thing. you are just lonely right now. Now is the time to spread your wings a little and put yourself into situations where you can meet new people and make new friends. Get some girl friends who will support you.<br>  <br>  How is it that he has a father who  depends on him and still he carries on so? This guy know what he needs to do, but so far neither his dad, you, nor your daughter are worth it to him.<br>  Sure, you are sad right now, but isn't a little sadness now better than years of it later? Cut your losses. What you are doing now is taking care of your daughter and yourself....you are doing what you have to do...What is right. If he stops contacting you, let it fade away. If he does make contact, and you don't have the strength to end this permanently, do not allow him back until he has been in a program for a while...at least 3 months..and is committed to it. simple as that. You are a very wise person.|`|AA11606978	If I were you I would work with this man to try and cure his addiction through counseling before I totally give up on the relationship. Good luck. He seems like a great caring guy and I would not give up on him that easily.|`|fa8183d4d1f41fdeb07e31f785231f24aa	I am so sorry that you have to go through this. Even though this is extremely difficult you have made the right decision and you need to stick to it. Addicts are not in there right frame of mind or they would not be addicts. It would not be fair to you or him to continue this relationship until he addresses his problem with alcoholism. Don't look at this as good bye look at it as see you later. Let him know that you love him too much to see him slowly kill himself and you want a true future with him and only sobriety will achieve this. Stay strong and good luck.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Form a group of people of same problem ,it solves|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you are doing just what i did and it is the best thing for your son also.

As long as you're happy then that's what count.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If you are both happy and satisfied then  its enough, some people need it all the time but others are happy with even less than once a week.<br>  Providing you are in harmony with this it will work and if this is your sex life and its great once a week then yes you do have a great sex life.|`|T1R6UZDOaa	I have a few married friends and they have sex 10 or more times a week.  One of my friends has sex before she goes to work, her husband meets her for lunch and they have sex and then they have sex before they go to bed.  It just all depends on the person.  Personally I wouldn't mind having sex 3 times a day when I get married.|`|KIKUBbT6aa	Actually you probably have sex as a married couple more often than most married couples.  Be glad!<br>  Most married couples only have sex a few times a year if that these days.<br>  Keep up the great times!!|`|Pwg8IUbTaa	NO! Once a day might be better !|`|x851kjHuaa	im not married but its all up to you on your sex life|`|h2ZDRpmDaa	The quanity doesn't matter. Just quality. If you two are happy and content with that then it's perfect! However if either one of you wants it a little more then maybe you could try a little more. but if you're both satisfied with it then there's no reason why it shouldn't be good enough. Different couples have different sex drives.
AA10797214	How do you deal with difficult people in your life?  I need to say. not well at all. Everything I do, I am or I have is open to negative criticism, it never stops, it has been going on for  a very long time, and whatever feelings I have had are dead form being trampled on. I have learned that this is a illness, and know that I need to forgive, and I do, however any change that is to come needs to come from this difficult person. It may never come, however I need to go on with my life as best as I know how.|`|AA10336377	these are the type of people that you define as haters! You do NOTHING about them, if you tried to fit in they would talk about you. If you tried to stick up for yourself they would talk about you. The only thing I can tell you to do is BE YOURSELF. People are going to talk about you until the day you die and some might still talk after you are dead. So walk in with a bad attitude as to say im the **** and you just jealous of me and you'll get over it real quick. When they notice that you don't give a damn what they say then they will leave you alone but they can talk but don't let them put their hands on you. GOOD LUCK|`|waNV7zsyaa	Maybe you can try to point out things about them you like. Compliment them on something you like about them, or something they have.
wbZp6ZcPaa	It feels a lot of different ways. But mostly it's wonderful. Being married  comes with his awesome feeling that you know this person and you will be together no matter what forever. Some days it's frustrating as hell but 99% of the time its the best thing ever. Just remember to enjoy each other and always let each other know they are loved.|`|TJrRPIFLaa	Liberating.  I love being this close to my husband.  We have a tight bond.|`|AA12259102	Been married 36 years.It keeps evolving after so many years you slowly move to a point where that person is actually part of you.I don't know a better way to describe it,sorry.You know what the other is thinking,you accept the things about them that annoy you.You know you have someone in your corner no matter what.You share so much with that one person over the years that loosing that part of yourself would be as hard to adjust to as loosing an arm or a leg.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	If you have been dating and living together for a while it's like that.  The relationship stays the same but now it's a legal partnership.  You shouldn't be nervous at all the piece of paper doesn't change a thing if you already have a great relationship|`|1579428bda539e226ffd4d9e6dd16c85aa	My experience was not good. Make absolutely sure it is the right person. Don't expect them to change, and especially don't expect their problems to go away. Once you have kids it gets much more complicated. Good luck.|`|ljyuS5Ubaa	I love it!!! You feel closer than ever!!
1Z0Lmrk1aa	It's probably nothing, but his behavior is weird. Has he treated you this badly before? Asking you to wait outside is like treating you like a second class citizen and most people don't go back for a root canal that soon after a cleaning or other appointment. At least i sure don't. One thing for sure, you should never have left mad and you should have told him you were insulted. Maybe he thought there was a chance this other gal would see you and that's why he asked you to wait in the car? You need to talk to him honey.|`|b75bba675dda73187aeb83430b085b44aa	Well remember to always trust your gut feeling.  I'd guess he's trying to act single to the hygentist.|`|k19eSFNKaa	maybe he didn't want you to see him freaking out! or he's going for that lady.... well hope I helped:)
hdTztmKDaa	I know you said guys, but I just want to help. If your wife is cheating then she doesnt really love you. I don't believe in those kind of "mistakes". Thats a bunch of bullshit. You need to move on and find the woman that deserves you. And dont punish women in the future for her mistakes. I promise we"re not all alike. Just be calm and sain. Dont do anything stupid to get yourself in trouble. Shes not worth it.|`|PEHo8g48aa	If you have prof of what she had done, leave! You can do better or worse on your own. Find yourself a place, waite until she is gone to work or just out and move all your things out. Leave a note of what you know that she had done where she could find it. Let her do what she felt that she could do, silence is it's own vengeance.|`|NWTfFEuVaa	Divorce the woman. Revenge is dumb. What are you going to do, cheat on her and hurt her like she hurt you? Sorry fella, but chances are that if she's cheating on you then she doesn't care what you do or don't do or who you have sex with or who you don't have sex with. Just divorce her.|`|4kaVChO4aa	haha...NO to cheaters...you'll look like a pathetic loser, unless you don't give an F and you wanna make her look like a jerk. First of all, i am married, and i've been cheated on by a girl i was in love with, not my wife. I would seek vengeance. i did it, and i don't regret an f'n thing...cuz F her. i'd get with someone she knows...or just get another girlfriend and drop it on her one day. don't even act upset...that'll hurt her and she will want you back, but F her you don't need her. she does it once she'll do it again. trust me dude, i've been there, i'm a morally sound human being...but sometimes you gotta save face. and when you tell her i wanna divorce i found someone else. she might even throw that sh-t in ur face..."i did too". just say..."no sh=t". so then you get her feeling guilty, sad, and wantin you back cuz u cheated and found someone else.|`|j0mI8l07aa	If she's cheating but she hasn't left you then she's obviously the type who wants to "have her cake, and eat it too".<br>  Secure some form of evidence that she's cheating before you spring the divorce on her. That way she won't get a dime.|`|wfGGIOLJaa	If by vengence, you mean cheating on her in return, then that makes you no better than her. Confront her and then take in her story and then make a decision.|`|oR40n3kPaa	Have sex with her and spooge inside of her and give her a scare telling her that you are HIV+.   That will bring her back to reality when she realizes that not only is she cheating on you but playing with your health..|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Teach her the biggest lesson you can ever teach her.  Divorce her and make her realize that she lost the best thing she will EVER have.|`|edOwd4Vdaa	First frim a womens view if she cheated you must had done something to make her do it and if you love her it should not have matter where she cheated or not just take her back and forgive and forget|`|Mkn6vYO0aa	Dump her|`|571936ad53ab66f6abcc2c8a72f73b3faa	cheat back and make sure she finds out about it|`|LLeQyWGcaa	without question, i would get rid of her. i would tell her if you want to go out and have fun, go ahead but you are not going to do it married to me.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Make a Doctors appt for her so she can can checked for STD's and then, make an appt for yourself with a lawyer.<br>  <br>  The best revenge is to be happy, in spite of her cheating.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Well the best, good, logic action for me would be, Ignore here, loose contact with her and let her die wondering why the heck did u do that, after some while she will know and by then try to move on and give yr love to someone that deserves u and yr love.<br>  <br>  She is not worth anything vengeance here, believe me she is not worth it a tiny bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|mBXu5G5saa	Two wrongs will never make a right, so instead of cheating back, i say you talk to her about, if she continues, leave her.

Ease into the relaionship with this guy, I think you may have something here. But also keep your friend at arm's length. She can be dangerous. But dont hate her. She feels like the loser and needs a little understanding from you.|`|9rjq5aDHaa	well first of all...you need a new friend. you can't surround your self with people who are just going to play you like that. it's not fair to you. it's just going to hurt in the long run. you need to find friends who will be there for you and want the best for you. <br>  <br>  peace|`|geamDWBtaa	if that were my friend i would be pissed, tell her to f off and then try to see if he really likes you, if he does go for him.

Say you're out at  your friend's house on a Saturday and decide to smoke some weed.  Unfortunately it is illegal, so that is something to be considered.  I wouldn't do it myself, nor have I done it.

It's safest to smoke out of a water bong, because the water evaporates the tar that's in the weed.<br>  <br>  4. It is known to stop cancer, before it ever occurs<br>  <br>  (if no one believes me read the Cannibible 3)<br>  <br>  5. because it's weed! it just makes you feel really good, and then makes you pig out like an hour later.<br>  <br>  6. weed is not addicting, i guess it can be if you get addicted to things easy, but i kept A's and B's in school, was in soccer, and on the dance teams.<br>  <br>  so no it's not a bad choice, just be careful to not get caught!<br>  <br>  Hope i could help!!

There are far too many freaky people out here- some of them couples, most of them safe- who would give my husband oral simply to have a good time. So, to have to pay for it seems ridiculous to me. <br>  <br>  It will take some research on your part, but if you want to get involved, get on the internet and find the swing scene in your area. There are many couples out here just like you, who want to experience adventure and variety WITHOUT having a fear that your relationship is automatically doomed by adding in that extra element.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	He's your husband!

In addition, He may want this type of adventure more than what you are willing to give him in the future. This can become a real problem! <br>  <br>  My advice...get yourself a wig, some f-me-pumps, and some sexy lingerie and take care of your man yourself! If she takes care of him for you, he may realize he does not want you or need you anymore. <br>  <br>  The last thing you want to be compared to sexually speaking is to a whore. The next time you are intimate he will be thinking of her, not you. <br>  <br>  Think twice before doing this, as it can cause major marital problems down the line. Some fantasies are best left to remaining in your head, instead of watching someone else give it to your man.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	I think if this is something you really want to do, going to a place like the bunny ranch is your best option, then at least the girl is a pro and not someone you know, which could lead to awkward relationships later, and the girl is tested for disease.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	The Bunny Ranch is ok from what I've heard, but check out the web site for the Chicken Ranch in Pahrump, outside Vegas (where I live).

It's a great first date, it can last for twenty minutes or four hours.  <br>  <br>  Don't ask him over for dinner at your place, that's a big commitment for a first date with someone that you don't know that well.<br>  <br>  The real key is just to work up the nerve and do it.  Remember the worst case scenario is he'll say no.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.|`|ysAlWzEvaa	That's cute. Well you need to take up some time of your own like your neighbor did. While he's there casually (be very cute while you're doing this) ask him if he'd like to come over for dinner, go to the movies, go out for dinner sometime...whatever you decide.You might want to do it soon just in case your neighbor got the hotts for him too. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nogoUTDXaa	If you were going to do it anyway and the only reason you didn't is because your neighbour was talking to him I don't know why you're asking!|`|7sxGW40qaa	Leave a letter in your mailbox, make it big and red, put his name on it, and ask him that way!!
7e4jxj3Daa	I'm tall and I've asked myself the same question since I too like petite girls.|`|EHMCgFCHaa	im 6' 2 and i love short girls, i love leaning my head down and having her lean her head up when we kiss<br>  <br>  and its fun to pick them up and hold her while your kissing<br>  <br>  idk im not very huge, 6' 2 150 lbs... but when i see a short little girl its like hmmm, idk what it is, small = good with girls<br>  <br>  i also have like no fat what so ever, so when i look in the mirror i see myself as a small guy, even tho im taller then the majority of the guys
7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	More than a perfect date, it sounds like both of you really need to sit down and discuss things.<br>  <br>  If he's the stay at home type, and you are the on-the-go type, you are not going to both be happy.  Take it from a home-body, guys that enjoy the quiet and simple things at home will not find happiness going out.  And you won't be happy staying in all the time.  The comprise will be you going out without him, and then he'll worry that you may meet guys.<br>  <br>  Try working out your issues first, instead of just hoping it will all work out.  Just the simple fact that you can't agree on the type of wedding you will have speaks volumes.<br>  <br>  Work out your problems, and then decide if you are really ready.  Right now, you are a high percentage change of divorce within 5 years.  Be smart.  TALK!|`|SIdhw9hlaa	i personally think you guys should stop seeing each other<br>  <br>  #1 you guys fight over little things<br>  #2 you got back many times...science shows 1+1 will always equal two..which meaning that if you guys keep dating you wiill just keep breaking up..<br>  #3 this seems to be stressing you out?|`|OYGGdSLcaa	watch along came polly together over a nice Italian meal, all the while cuddling up to him, he'll get the hint.|`|vl8ND1qVaa	well first off two different personality's is always awesome too. that's how i am very out-going and my boyfriend is quieter. but we mesh just fine. we don't fight though. but dang you guys are in a pickle. maybe its a sign that you guys are rushing the marriage. you need to think long and hard about it. I mean you two will be together for a long long time and in that time there is no breaking up or leaving. whatever you guys do like that. love is very rare to find and i know you two would go above and beyond for each other but you need to think it through. if he is IF'y now then how will marriage be ?...you should not try hard to win him back if he really loves you that much. dont plan the whole date out. just go wit it. have a fun nite relax talk. see a movie or something. do something that you two like. dont have a re-run of your first nite then things will not go farther. you two need to explore new things with each other i mean you two may get married and from there on you will need to learn how to experience new things with your partner. you can do what you want to do to "win" him back. but i would do something different. i mean your first date was fun the first time i dont think seconds would be any more fun then the first time. well i hope i  helped ya out.

CYwha8Baaa	HMMMM.... you only live once buddy... and honestly do what feels good to you<br>  <br>  I mean what really feels good to you who do you like being around more, who do you think about more, who do you see yourself with down the road?<br>  <br>  YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE< and everything happens for a reason, it helps define you as a person... every action, to every decision
WMrNa3Doaa	Invite one of your girlfriends with you and put on a show for him.  All men love girl on girl action.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Tease him a bit ;)  Strut your stuff in your new lingerie (or old or nothing...whatever).|`|QicYS91eaa	Wow, that's what she wants on her wedding night, to hook up with her girlfriend. What you want to do it just make it special. Go to the "bathroom" and come out wearing something really sexy. Try new stuff. Go all out.|`|o4NarYVoaa	give him a super sexy lap dance.  wear some lingere with a sexy robe and some thigh highs..some sexy high heels...<br>  <br>  dance and take it off one by one..strip and lap dance for him...guys LOVE that!!!!!!!|`|1579428bda539e226ffd4d9e6dd16c85aa	Make sure you don't drink too much!|`|ysbmM3Tcaa	Buy a strap on. Trust me, he'll NEVER forget that.
JEm4cqEKaa	Prove to him that you are responsible enough to have it. Do extra things around the house. Obviously he took it away because of something you did or didnt do.|`|sIwtp0bGaa	Think about why he took it away from you. Then try and show him that you can prove him wrong about that and that you are responsible.|`|P74VqtVhaa	he took it away because he doesnt trust you obviously.<br>  show him that you are responsible and an adult, do things for him. this doesnt mean flattering him all the time. <br>  Do things that you dont think about yourself when ou do them.<br>  then chat to him and tell him that its been 3 months and you realise why he took it away, and since then youve been trying to be more responsible, and offer him further proof. dont ask for it back, say i was wondering whenabouts youd be willing to return it.<br>  good luck xxxxxx
kARTX2OAaa	ok 1st.. please understand that kissing sum1 is a very personal thing, so no matter how much advice you get, ur gonna have to master it on your own. 2nd every guy has different likes and dis-likes so every guy you kiss will like it differently. <br>  So just be natural and let it happen, ul enjoy it more, if you are thinking about how ur kissing and what to do next while ur kissing ul enjoy it less.. So shut ur brain, kiss and enjoy..<br>  <br>  BUT.. since you asked this question, ill tell you about some things that guys generally* like or dislike...<br>  <br>  1) Make sure your lips arent dry.. its horrible to have dry chappy <br>  2) Make sure ur breath smells good<br>     ok now some serious tips<br>  3) DONT bite his lips<br>  4) Be soft and gentle<br>  5) Use some tongue... JUST some...|`|wav24Tquaa	my boyfriend and I had this conversation before and he told me he likes it if I suck on his lip and he doesn't like it if I stick my tongue fully in his mouth. he likes when I just kinda lick his lips i suppose........ but all guys are different! Just avoid being like "a washing machine" and too sloppy! <br>  <br>  sarah x x x
AA10835302	You are kind of right, it's the guys' job to initiate the conversation, girls don't want to seem desperate (and I add) or skanky.  In this society it's been well accepted that girls who come on to guys are for the most part loose and/or easy so most girls don't want to put themselves out there like that.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	they don't approach guys because most society still teaches it is the guys place to do that also fear of rejection and shyness play a part. It could also be they just interested|`|2S2onP86aa	I'm not going to compliment myself and say that I am attractive. But surely, I can get any guy that I give him attention - any person you give your attention to, they'll be ineterest anyway -<br>  But I think girls don't approach guys as much as guys approach girls because it's just a guy thing (girls do approach guys sometimes, but I know we're talking about the majority here) and maybe they don't want to seem too desperate. I don't know. Anyone is afraid of rejection, it is not a great thing. Whether it's a girl or a guy. But maybe the guy handles it more. The girl maybe cherish her dignity more - or her dignity breaks faster. But guy has their ego too. It's just complicated I must stay. <br>  <br>  Don't bother yourself anyway - approach the girl you like. If she rejected you, so what. You are a guy and can handle it. No? <br>  <br>  Cheers|`|k19eSFNKaa	well, like sometimes we're afraid that he won't say anything and then we would blush. And sometimes if girls just want to start a friendly conversation guys tend to take it the wrong way and freak out. I personally love talking to guys randomly, it's just what I do. Well yeah, hope I helped|`|hypytNy2aa	Girls want to be pursued by Guys and know that they are lovely and worth authentic love|`|wfGGIOLJaa	No. Because society has put it in women's heads that it's the GUY that asks the Girl. That it's more traditional.
AA12164862	he's using you big time, aren't you better than that?|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	He's just using you and it doesn't sound like he has any feelings towards you other than easy sex.  I'm sorry to be so harsh, but I had a 'friend' just like that.  The worse part was when we were alone he would always tell me how much he cared about me and stuff.  Then soon as a pretty girl walked by he would shove me out of the way.  He was a loser and I dropped him like a bad habit.  I met someone great, who treated me with respect, and now we're married.  There are much better guys out there who will treat you the way you deserve.  Friends with benifits at such a young age is not a good idea because someone always gets hurt.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you have a problem and that's that you allow this guy to use you its convenient and familiar to him he also probably knows how much you care for him and that makes it easy to use you. He is not doing you any favors girl move on and find someone who wants a relationship with you|`|mTwn8p79aa	Congratulations, you're not good enough to be his girlfriend but you're giving it away for nothing.<br>  <br>  There's some harsh truth, huh?  Get as far away from this guy as possible.  To treat a woman like that for such a long time is unconscionable.  He'll never have real feelings for you, it's not just time to move on, it's long past time to move on.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	Get another friend with benefits. This guy is a loser.  Plus, you need to expand your horizons a little. It's never good to just sleep with one guy.|`|qRM0r7eVaa	maybe it would be best if you stopped the whole friends with benefits thing and try and find a new guy to have a proper relationship with he sounds like he's messing you about.|`|ysAlWzEvaa	You are living in La La Land right now because this boy is using you for sex! Yea i know its hard to hear but its soo true. What you need to do is to be up front with him about how you feel about the whole thing. But you must be willing to sacrifice the relationship you have with him now, meaning, if he doesn't want to be ur bf then you need to completely put a chain around the va-jay-jay, when it comes to him. Tell him that if he's gonna continue have sex with you it's gonna be as bf n gf, and you won't want it any other way. If it ends up that you two don't get together, offer that you still want a friendship without sex. You must completely detach yourself from him emotionally, if this is the case or you're going to end up getting burned. Start looking into other guys and hang around them for awhile, see how he reacts to you being with someone else. Right now he only thinks of you as a FWB but its possible if he starts seeing you with other guys he'll think more about you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|WP78rUU5aa	Considering he took your virginity there will be extra strong feelings there as if he was your boyfriend. But he is not worth your time. All he is doing is using you when it is convenient for him...dont be a toy for him because you deserve respect. You never know what you got til its gone. When he calls act busy and once he realizes that you wont be there at the snap of his finger he may change it up. Good luck.|`|RIooDZ8zaa	say ***** im not gonig to be ur back up hoe and we're either just gonna be friends or a couplr not a back up. u need to see that i can never be in a good relationship wwith him if ur guys are doing this frineds with benifets crap. cut it out and either move on and just stay friend or get together as a couple|`|6YbxTlDCaa	sad truth is, he is an  "amazing" jerk who has been using you all this time. You are a fool to allow it. To him you are not worthy...only to ^**** as you say. You really and truely need to dump his!^%$!.|`|cn49BbRiaa	you need to cut him off and find a man of your own one who will respect you and love you. Its obvious he dosent have any intensions of only being with you. He is only hurting you.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Tell him everything, like everything.  Tell him how you feel.  Point out that he apparently can't keep himself away from you, and you want to move things forward.   Good luck!|`|O4EstCSFaa	dAyUM<br>  HEs jUStS USiNG yU <br>  hE ONly wANtS yU SOMEtiMES<br>  tHAtS NOt gOOD.<br>  i bEt yOURE wORtH MORE<br>  SO MOVE ON ANd let hIM gO...|`|THwVItleaa	Well  it is perfectly normal not to forget your first love. The fact that he has your virginity can be even harder to forget about him.When i was in school i dated a guy at like age 15-20  it was no benefit thing we were together.We recently broke it off. what i mean by telling you this  is sometimes your first love can be your best friend and you never know it until your relationship comes crashing down....but in all means , you should never start a benefit thing unless you know for a fact that it will not go no further.        Good Luck!|`|5duHq5jkaa	Honey.. I hate to say it but he is using you. You are there when he wants you but he is not there for you. Been there and done that sweetie and it never turns out. Sorry.
ENWrHP3Raa	Frustrate yes. Upset no. I have an 18 month old duaghter so I have been pregnant and all that before but I am sure she will be able to help. And I am sure if she means enough they will come to deal with it and honestly be happy with it. DO NOT ask them to leave the wedding because the choice to have a baby is just as important as the choice to get married. If they throw them out it will be like saying you are stupid for getting pregnant which would ruin friendships like mad. I can already see it going wrong. Also sounds like they could be a little Dependant on the bridal party. I know BM and MOH are suppose to help but mainly family is to help out and BM and MOH are truly there more for support than anything. So just go with the flow and tell them not to stress so much. Everything will work in their favor. Tell them enjoy their wedding instead of stressing out over two people out of how many that will make their wedding amazing.<br>  Hope it helps!|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Just because your brother and SIL are getting married DOESN'T mean that everyone around them has to put their lives on hold.  <br>  <br>  MOH - she'll have a 3 month old by the time the wedding rolls along.  So what?  It happens.  I had 2 BMs that had 3 month olds by the time my wedding came around.  Were they any less helpful?  Absolutely not.  Was I mad at them?  No and why should I be.<br>  <br>  BM - it's a bit selfish of your brother and SIL to treat her as if she's done something wrong and in a way punish her.  It is not that easy to get pregnant, so they should be happy for her.  She shouldn't have to put her whole entire life on hold because of this wedding.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is it sounds as if your brother and SIL expected people's lives to revolve around them and the whole entire bridal party will help them immensely through the whole process.  Here's a news flash - THE BRIDAL PARTY IS NOT REALLY OBLIGATED TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN SHOW UP.  Your brother and SIL should never have assumed that the bridal party was going to want to be that involved to begin with.  All this happens often and it's not a big deal.  You work around it.  If they choose to ask the two BMs to leave the wedding, the only thing they'll accomplish is making themselves look bad and selfish and losing friends.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Wow. I still cannot believe the number of people who get upset that a bm is pregnant! Why can't they be happy for them, especially if they have had so much trouble getting pregnant! <br>  <br>  I have a bridesmaid (my fsil) who will be 8 months pregnant at our wedding and I couldn't be happier!! They too had trouble, and when we heard the news, we were ecstatic! Why should they plan their lives around someone else's wedding? The bride and groom need to get over themselves and realize that the world does not revolve around them!|`|hkwBR1moaa	Tell your SIL and bro to get over themselves and be happy that 2 of their best friends are going to have babies!  Asking them to step down because they're pregnant is rude and I would be insulted.  It may even ruin friendships.|`|29I8PWrxaa	A few brides have asked similar questions on here ... but somehow I never understand how a bride could expect a friend or family member to put off their own dream of starting a family just because they are getting married.  Would this friend have asked the bride to just change the date of the wedding?  I don't think so.  A good friend would just be happy for the pregnant friend rather than being upset with her for getting pregnant.  The bride and groom can still get married, whether this friend is pregnant or not.  So what's the problem?  If they don't want her as a bridesmaid or the pregnant woman doesn't think she can handle it, then they can tell her it's fine if she steps down.  But if she's only six months pregnant by the time of the wedding then I think she should be fine as long as she doesn't have to travel far for the wedding.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	It is completely self absorbed to think that just because you are getting married that people should put their lives on hold. Your brother and SIL need to realize that even though this is a huge deal to them it doesn't dictate others lives and they need to be happy for their friend. There is plenty for a pregnant woman to do to help out, putting together invitations, programs. wedding favors, baskets. Anything like that can be done by a pregnant woman even on bed rest. All they have to do is ask. Asking them to leave the wedding is a TERRIBLE choice. Even considering it is completely disgusting in my opinion. It's like saying "you are my friend until you do something for yourself and not me and then I hate you." Your brother and SIL need to grow the heck up!!!!!!|`|FnskUYpqaa	I agree with the other people on here saying you can't expect people to pause their life because your sil and bro are getting married. That's really silly of them. They either want them in the wedding pregnant and all or they don't. I don't understand what the problem is one would have delivered by them so what's the big deal? The other is happy to be in it even if she's pregnant. .|`|o4NarYVoaa	Ok, work on your grammer.<br>  <br>  Then, tell the brideZILLA that she is being absurd. She should be happy for her friends being pregnant. That is very selfish.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Frankly, I think your SIL and brother are being very small-minded and selfish.  Why on earth should their bridesmaids' pregnancies have anything to do with their wedding?  I have heard this so many times- a bride being like, "What's her stupid miracle of life compared to MY BIG DAY!!!!"  And what's with this new attitude that the MOH and bridesmaids need to "contribute" to the wedding?  Back in the day, the bridal party was just a group of the closest friends of the bride and groom, and their primary "duty" was to stand up there with their best friend and support them during the ceremony.  Now all of a sudden, we've got these nutty bridezillas treating their bridesmaids like hired hands, making them put together dozens of favors, expecting them to throw these elaborate showers and bachelorette parties, basically getting angry if they don't all put their lives on hold for the wedding.  And now your SIL has the audacity to say she wishes her bridesmaid had at least waited to get pregnant until after her wedding.  Honestly, I think your SIL needs a bit of a reality check- nobody cares about her wedding nearly as much as she does, and she needs to get off her high horse.|`|2Av3gIqgaa	Yeah. I would definitely have to agree with most people on here that your brother and SIL will just have to get over themselves.  I'm going to have TWO girls who are trying to get knocked up before my wedding and I couldn't be happier.  Children ROCK and your brother and sister in law are just being stupid.  <br>  <br>  There are still some things that they can do to help even though they are preggers.  They can be one the phone helping the bride and groom make appointments.  They RSVP number can be them and they can be in charge of keeping track of who is coming and who is not.  That is definitely a job for someone who can't really do much physically and it will take a HUGE load off of the bride and groom.<br>  <br>  I wish your brother and sister in law luck in your wedding and I hope that their negative attitude doesn't put undue stress on their wedding party, especially the BM who has had a difficult pregnancy already.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	they are going to have to rely on family and other friends to help out with wedding stuff...<br>  if it gets too much for the BM and MOH then she can gently ask them...if this will be too much for them and shdoesn'tnt want to inconvenience them in any way and if they feel like its too much its ok to step down..like make them feel they have the freedom to leave but need to let her know asap..this will be the best i think because she needs people that available and can be helpful with the wedding...<br>  she doesn't doesnt want to be dealing with them having issues later on...remember theres lots of hormones involved..so to avoid problems she should have a talk with them and explain the situation...<br>  she has to make sure they understand that its not personal but it will be for their own sake..both the bride and BMs/ and their frienship...<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope you can help them...|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Okay, like everyone else is saying, tell her to get over it. You can't expect people to plan their life around someone elses wedding. It's your day, not your week or month. <br>  <br>  Having said that, how big is the wedding? If it's less than 100, then frankly, that many bridemaids are unnessicary as helpers. You can always recruit the mothers, or other friends to help if the bridesmaids are unable.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	Oh geez.  Let's prioritize a bit, shall we?<br>  <br>  Hmmm.. what's more important:  Bringing life into this world and starting a new family?  Or having picture-perfect bridemaids with flat tummies and no bun in the oven walk down the aisle?<br>  <br>  You're right.  Hard call.<br>  <br>  How dare they decide to start their family without consulting you for permission first?  Go ahead and go through with your plans of giving the pregnant bridemaids the boot.  Then hop on your broomstick and fly away.|`|z9st8cLvaa	You can't ever ask people to put their lives on hold for a wedding, so I hope your brother and SIL don't really hold it against this BM for getting pregnant.  Encourage your bro and SIL to be happy for their friends!<br>  <br>  If your SIL wants to have a heart to heart with the BM, all that should be said is, "I know how difficult your pregnancy was last year, so if you don't feel up to being a BM, please know that I will completely support your decision.  No hurt feelings."  This is NOT a punishment for the BM; this is a courtesy to her.  If she insists that she's up to it, just let it go.  Why ruin a good friendship (because that's exactly what would happen if you kick her out)?<br>  <br>  Bottom line, they will just have to make do with the 2 remaining bridesmaids.  It won't be as hard as they think it will be.|`|m1Ps0Etiaa	I know a wedding is a very important thing in a couples life (recently married in oct) but so is a baby.  Like I said I just got married and now my friend is getting married this upcoming sept and my wife and I are both in the wedding.  We are trying for a baby and when the bride to be found this out she called my wife and flipped out on her.  My wife was upset of course and I told her that our friends knew we wanted to have a baby and they asked us anyway.  I also told her that we shouldn't have to put our life on hold just to make the bride to be happy especially when she knew we wanted to have a baby as soon as we could.  Unfortunately we had a miscarriage in december and we decided recently that we are going to keep trying and what happens happens.  My suggestion to your brother and his wife to be is to let them stay in the wedding for now but have a back up plan just in case.  I know it sounds like more work but this way they don't upset their friends and also have a plan in case they can't be in the wedding last minute.  Hope this helps, sorry so long.|`|v0NBi2j8aa	Oh geez! Ok I can understand the though of being upset for a moment, but get over it. Getting pregnant is natural and beautiful. It's a new life joining our world. So she'll have pregnant girls in her wedding party there's alot of pretty dresses to be sized to their needs. <br>  Now crying babies at the ceremony or reception...that's a differen story. The only kids I'm having at my wedding are in the wedding party and I have already let it be known that all kids are leaving by 8pm so the adults can enjoy themselves, (night wedding), and my wedding is more than a year away. Did she set rules or guidelines? Maybe she should before it's too late as far as No kids at the wedding but the pregnant issue, get over it. Other family members and friends can help out also, using teenagers as ushers is always good too. Wish them good luck!
QTiTDz4yaa	Old habits are hard for a guy to break.  Don't take it too personal he probably felt like a heal when it slipped out.  How long was he married to her?  Odds are..it was just a psychological slip from old habit.  Don't read so much into it.  Does he say he still loves her?  If not then stop second guessing and quit being so vulnerable.  Have a little confidence.  There must be some REAL reasons that he is not with HER and is with YOU.  Reflect on THAT.|`|ohOANFjFaa	I did that once with my ex girlfriend.  I had ZERO feelings for my ex, and I did love my girlfriend at the time.  I'm not saying that he doesn't still have feelings for his ex wife, but a slip of the tongue doesn't mean that he does.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	more than likely it may mean nothing. old habits are hard to get rid of sometime. My ex-wife called me her ex-husbands name a time or too. the first time i got mad(which was stupid) and the second time i just called her my ex-wifes name. an eye for an eye|`|m4T0IT0yaa	What were the circumstances?  Were you arguing?  I hope not being intimate.  Was it general conversation?  In any case, I wouldn't worry too much.  I sometimes call my man by my son's name and sometimes I call my son by my man's name.  It's not a huge deal.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	YES be careful. <br>  My ex called me his ex's name (while we were still together)<br>  <br>  Turns out the ****** was cheating with her. <br>  Won't look past that again.|`|I814g6ZBaa	It means he slipped up.  Don't beat him to death over it, Sweetie.|`|mBXu5G5saa	you are setlling for less! Tell him do not let it happen again|`|krQiDGCHaa	My husband only did that once, and it was before we were married.  We were fighting and he goes "Oh WHATEVER Jess."  LOL.<br>  <br>  I didn't really mind too much, I mean, we were fighting.  Not like we were having sex. :)<br>  <br>  Honestly, the only time it would really bother me is if he called me her name during sex, or during some affectionate/happy time like telling me he loves me.<br>  <br>  It's just a slip.  I call my husband "honey" almost all the time.  So often, in fact, that I've been on the phone with my mother or brother multiple times and have called them "honey."  LOL  Sometimes it just happens.<br>  <br>  If it was a 1 time thing I wouldn't worry too much about it.  If it continues to happen, tell him how you feel and ask him how he feels about her.|`|KmC0K59taa	My husband has done this at least twice.  Once when we were first together in a store.  He hollered the wrong name at me across the store to get my attention (not on purpose).  The second time was when I was pregnant and we were fighting.  There may have been a third time while fighting.  It hasn't happened it a long time.<br>  <br>  I used to worry that he still had feelings for her.  I don't think that anymore.  I got on here too and people's answers really helped me.  Lots of ppl call their current spouse by their ex's name.  It really doesn't mean he still has feelings for her.  It's just a glitch in the brain.  I found with my husband, that we had the same arguments that he had with her.  So it was easy for him to call me the wrong name.  They were together 6 years and we had been together less than two.  The passing of time makes a huge difference.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Don′t worry!..it happens lots of times..it could mean many others feelings but love. When they have kids they call kids by the others kids names..Sometimes men got confused with one relationship, imagine when they′ve been in more than one,,you just have to roll your eyes up and sigh.  Forgive his confused mind anyways.,He loves you because hi′s with you..It′s not a big deal..it happens, more than once I can tell,,,believe me..|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Ouch. that's a tough one. It depends honey. When you're used to being with one person for a long time, it's natural that the name would slip out, especially if they haven't been apart for long. I've had many dealings with the ex wife thing....and to be honest, none of it was good. Depends on how long you two have been together...and as for the wishing she would die thing....they all say that babe.|`|etKzA9lKaa	Could be a slip of the tongue. Give him the benefit of the doubt for now, you cant do anything anyway , its not like you can get into his head. But hes obviously thinking abt her name subconsciously.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	No, it does not mean that. He called that name for years, and now just that name came onto his tongue. Do not worry, even laugh at it.|`|H7UphlLCaa	don't take it too seriously unless it happens a lot..|`|zRtOplYtaa	talk 2 him<br>  ask him y he said it!?|`|KSK22vHUaa	Hahaha my name IS my husband's ex's name... interesting story there.<br>  <br>  Uhm, "so he says" means you don't trust him.  She's his ex.  You have to be secure enough in your relationship to deal with that.  If you think he still has feelings for her, talk to him like a grown up.  But asking strangers what it means is NOT a good communication tool.<br>  <br>  If you're freaking out about something like this, he probably HAS to say he wishes she'd die to calm you down.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	it doesn't necessarily mean anything...it was probably a slip of the tongue...i have miscalled my husband by my ex-husband's name and vice versa...it doesn't mean i still have feelings for my ex-husband...it was more like something brought up a memory from the past and i inadvertantly called my husband by my ex-husband's name.|`|kNscpF4Faa	How long have you been seeing each other?  It depends if your relationship is still new..He could slip..only because he spent so long with her and did things with her and so It is in his brain..It happens...It is a problem if you are 5 years into your own relationship and he does it..<br>  I had this ex- boyfriend of 6 years and our first week going out he called me by his ex's name..But he never did it again and freakishly would make sure to call me by my name or say my name way to often for comfort..until I called him on it, then he chilled.|`|ve1vK7KLaa	Brit, I was married to my 1st wife for 24 years.  I am now married to a princess (15 yrs)   Just recently I called her buy my Ex's name.  I was disttracted and in a real hurry.  For an instant my wife looked hurt, but then we both laughed.  Neither of us believe that it is possible NOT to do that ONCE.   Anything over once, ouch!|`|afFUs27kaa	everyone does it i bet if you have kids youll call them the wrong names or if you have brothers and sisters your parents will go "katthy, ann Rebecca!" eveyone says the wrong name from time to time. as long as it wasnt whilst in the sack and he was reaching the peak your fine|`|eawDlYHnaa	ive done it before but its only because my hubby said something that really annoyed me and i accidentally said my ex's name. i think its because my ex must have annoyed me the same way and i naturally just said it.<br>  <br>  dont worry though, its honestly not that big of a deal!|`|N4ORX2fZaa	Don't worry about it.  That is one of those things that is out of habit.  Not likely an emotional response.  Especially if you did something that annoyed him or made him feel good.  These things happen during the extreme feeling of either pleasure or anger.  Totally Normal.|`|uHQmgV9oaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... I'm sorry but that is funny as shi* lol just get over it it's nothing.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	he will always have feelings for her. she is his ex wife...at one point in time she was the apple of his eye. but now he is with u...dnt worry about the past. u r his future!!!!!|`|RyYV3aXlaa	your the rebound girl......|`|Y1bed2FJaa	u probably did the same thing she did when u 2 were doing what ever it is u did 2 make him say it|`|sxNVjm4daa	ds|`|PA7kYyAxaa	i did that once...it was a slip|`|w45YyDhEaa	get over it.|`|naI5hGjHaa	it was a mistake, just get over it|`|AA11263354	Its hard to answer this without more details.  How long have you been together?  How long ago did they get divorced?  How long where they together?  These are all things that make a difference.  If they where together for a long time and just recently got divorced and you 2 haven't been together long, then I have to say he did it out of habit.  I wouldn't jump to him having feelings for her still untill you sit down and have a serious talk with him.  Don't be demanding and don't be angry-else he may not tell you the truth.  Sit down calmly and just ask him to tell you the honest truth.  It is going to be a bit normal for him to possibly still have some kind of feelings for her still, that is part of dating someone who has been divorced.  I'm really sorry if this answer sounded rude or mean, I just want you to realize the possibilities.  Good luck to you.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Could be that she is still on his mind.  Depending on how long they have divorced and how long you have been with him. If they just got divorced and you came into the picture during that divorce period then you have to expect residue from the previous relationship and maybe even realize that your are just a rebound gf.  Which is never good.  So think about these factors and think about how much more time you want to waste while sitting on the sidelines for your bf to bounce back from this divorce.|`|32P7VxUlaa	It doesn't mean he still likes her.  Ever accidently call someone your mom or dad?  I have.  It doesn't mean you think of the person as your mom or dad.  One of my ex gfs dumped me, because I called her by her sisters' name.  Her name was sierra, and her sisters' was felicia...  I screwed everything up just by doing that once.  Let him know, and tell him to try not to do it any more.  You have to comunicate when you are in a relationship.|`|b4az9Zudaa	Brit, I love my husband. He is the love of my life and I wouldn'tt be with anyone else in the world. But every once in a while, I find myself almost calling him my ex's name. When it happens I am not even thinking about my ex (which i deplore). I think it just has to do with the fact that it is the name I said for so long, even if I have been with my husband for years. So dont worry, he is with you now. Unless you find out he is talking to her behind ur back, it was just a slip of the tongue. Im sure it startled him as much as it did you.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	It happens, and usually it doesn't mean anything. Just so you know, though - people always have 'feelings' for their ex. Even someone who professes to hate their ex still has feelings - otherwise, why would you care enough to hate them?<br>  <br>  Our exes were special to all of us in their time. They will always be in our minds. It doesn't mean we want to go back to them - it just is.|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	oh geez, thats not good.  Im the grudgful type so id hold it against him and milk it for what its worth :(<br>  My husband did the same thing and i was really hurt. He picked up on that and scared him so bad he hasnt done it since. haha But they were together for a couple years so i would imagine its still something hes trying to forget....|`|f3pu5FAFaa	give it a chance - he may of made one hell of a mistake . depending how long he was with her  he may of did it to alot of people. I call my brother my husbands name for some reason ( they both start with m)<br>  people make mistakes forgive and forget , but if he does it again throw some thing at him lol|`|CsdJNke9aa	Although I know this upset you, it was probably just a mistake and you are reading to much into it. How long were they married? How long have they been apart? If he was with her for awhile and the this is somewhat recent breakup then let it slide. He's not with her anymore, he's with you|`|qUbJbu64aa	wow, that sucks, i would have a long talk with him. Or i would dump him, it all depends how long you too have been dating. I am sorry. that really sucks.|`|AA12400513	That's no big deal. Forget it and grow up. Either laugh it off or forget it. The more you make an issue of it the bigger the issue will get.|`|qrGLcTh4aa	Were you having sex at the time??  <br>  If not don't worry. He was with her for a long period of time he's used to saying her name.|`|Pefo9BEEaa	Use the force.|`|qu0Hmjklaa	If it happens many times then that is something to get mad about.|`|GtalVPNjaa	it means nothing. Don't make it into something deep.|`|93OcaHsxaa	Maybe your husband was just reflecting on the past, don't read too much into it.

Ujxrpoonaa	Get the Carmen Electra strip tease workout video and it teaches you sexy, easy moves to put an entire routine together. I learned it in a day. Not sure if you have Comcast cable or not, but I have free ON DEMAND and you can get that video free under sports and fitness. Otherwise, google it to see where you can buy it at. I think it's only $14.99 in stores. Its worth it though, you get to look sexy, have fun, and get a work out at the same time! Have fun!!|`|7sxGW40qaa	Google it!! Or youtube it you want... but idk how well that would work.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	I'm pretty sure taking off your clothes will make that happen.

5M0FBU89aa	It depends.<br>  <br>  If you're in a no-fault state, the courts won't look at this.  I personally think this is a mistake, given all the chances for STD's and destruction they cause.<br>  <br>  If you have "proof" (like a cell phone record, an email, etc.) you should show it to a lawyer, if you go that far.<br>  <br>  My experience is that lawyer's (even divorce lawyers) are a pretty "tight knit" bunch - they know each other, they've worked with each other before (usually).   And they want to know whether or not they are defending the "correct party" - whether you're the plaintiff or not.<br>  <br>  On choosing a lawyer:<br>  The best ones  are sympathetic, and are very good listeners, and should help you psychologically through the process... almost like a therapist.  REALLY good ones (I know it sounds strange), after a consultation will be able to tell you if you should try and work it out or not.  Just my experience with a really good one.<br>  <br>  Personally, I feel very sad for you.   My father cheated on my mother and their marriage never recovered and everyone suffered for the next 15 years.      <br>  <br>  I hope you either work past it or if you decide to work it out, you're successful in whatever repair work you  do.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	in the courts eyes, i don't think they even care why people are getting a divorce. the attorneys on the other hand might use that for bargaining chips.|`|N4ORX2fZaa	The court may take your request more seriously because it shows that you took time to think about it and didn't make a rash decision.  It's always better to work it out if you can.  I know it hurts but if it isn't habitual and you love him, give him another shot.  If it doesn't work after that, run girl run!|`|AA12400513	Make sure your finances are in order and you have a getaway plan in case he does it again. If you file for divorce you need to get your finances in order. If he cheated once, he may do it again. The court doesn't care about the time-line.
cB2VGhLgaa	I'm really quiet too and I tend to have the same problem. It's like if I'm not loud and obnoxious like a lot of other people, they don't value what I say when I do talk. It gets really annoying. I guess if people making snide remarks to you to your face is bullying, but them ignoring you is probably something you can fix. If you have friends, they must like you somewhat, but when your quiet and all of a sudden you talk a lot, it might throw them off. Try to slowly be more involved in conversations. Give your input on what they are talking about and then slowly start to include yourself more. This way, they won't find it so odd that you suddenly started to talk a lot. And when you do talk, be assertive. Don't let them ignore you.|`|J6ZoyB9iaa	be confident in yourself.<br>  <br>  people can tell when you're not confident.<br>  <br>  if you don't take yourself seriously, how do you expect others to.|`|SLR5xFLjaa	i am 13 too. look people do the same thing to me i do feel bad.but one thing that i am learning is to be confident in myself. if people have a problem with you that is their lost of a good person. but have confidence and believe in yourself.|`|f1Zhqlsaaa	you know dude everyones different i suppose!|`|H1chCcVLaa	I think it is not about you, it is about them. I think you and your friends have 'chemistry issues. Probably you say something at the wrong time or at the wrong place too. <br>  <br>  You need to know how to jive in conversation based on the subject matter. I was guilty myself especially when I start to add on something to conversation when I was younger. I have learned that people are people and I will start making conversation to someone who has good chemistry with me. Friends can smell your insecurities and if they know that you are weak, shy whatever, then take you for granted. Instead be a good listener by asking questions pertaining to the conversations. You can add bit by bit your opinions or things you have to say in as the conversations start to build up. Your tone, body language, word and content should be friendly yet moderate. Dont come up with something strong as if you attack them or being smart. Hopefully they will realize that you are a good listener and they will open up more to you that lead to better conversations in the future.<br>  <br>  Or try find the right people/group who share the same ideas, belief and comfortable being around you. Thus, the conversation will come easily and naturally.

(and vice versa) i don't mean to scare you, but it DOES happen. <br>  <br>  and i have to admit, him turning off the voice chat when you aren't around is a bit fishy.. BUT it's possible that he is only being polite and doesn't want to make you have to hear him and his friends talking. <br>  <br>  my boyfriend plays WoW and there's some girl in his guild that he talks to all the time. yesterday when he signed on she automatically started talking to him and he told me that "she likes him" i asked him if he flirts with her and he said "yes" and i asked him if he talks bad about me to her and again, he said "yes" naturally i got upset by this but he started laughing telling me he was only kidding. (which i don't entirely believe lol) then with me sitting right there he typed "i hate my gf" to her. he was only joking but it still upset me. she never really said anything to that so i guess that was good lol. (my boyfriend is playing WoW right now and it upsets me how he can spend hours on this  game talking to her and spend so little time with me, but we do live together and talk all day so i guess that makes up for some of it.)<br>  <br>  anyways.. my point is, i understand where you are coming from. but guys (my guy especially) love to make their girlfriends jealous and they love teasing us! and if he does a little flirting, don't be offended. some guys are just like that. it doesn't mean he is going to leave you for her or anything, he's just having fun. and the girl on his game probably knows he has a girlfriend and probably knows that he isn't being serious when he flirts. <br>  <br>  i'm not worried about my boyfriend and i don't think you should be either. =)|`|nMWtEmEFaa	Online games are social games. They make you interact with other people to make playing more fun, and to advance even further in the game. Especially in a game like WoW where you need to have a bunch of people in your party to do a raid. Because of this, you have no choice but to interact with people.<br>  <br>  The fact that he also talks to them on the microphone shows me that he knows what he's doing. Trying to do a difficult thing on a game, while typing to someone else gives you a huge possibility that you can die on your character while typing (I have done this numerous times). So the best solution would be to talk on the microphone with everyone to make playing easier and raise your chances of not dying.<br>  <br>  Also, just because it's a girl character, does not mean that it's actually a girl. It's sexist to say, but more guys play games than girls. Even if she were a girl, that does not mean he's suddenly cheating on you because he's talking to her. Can't he have any friends without you thinking he's cheating?<br>  <br>  When you see him talking to 'her' outside of the game, constantly, and hiding the fact that he talked to her from you - then you can be suspicious. Right now, you have nothing to be suspicious about.<br>  <br>  Also, yes you can be cheated on online. It's called emotional cheating. The way someone intimately talks to someone else that is not their partner, telling them things they wouldn't even tell you, and telling them they love them and stuff. That's definitely cheating, just not in a physical sense.<br>  <br>  If you're really concerned about this though, you have to talk it out with him. Get some kind of compromise going on. Like, him not talking as often with that person anymore, or out right avoid that person.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember that people online ARE real people, regardless of what your boyfriend might think.|`|EHMCgFCHaa	hes prolly just ******* around with his friends.... my friends sometimes make hot looking chars and ill **** with them saying perverted stuff to the char acting like its a guy<br>  <br>  i have a gf and am 20....<br>  <br>  its just fun to mess with your friends like that i guess<br>  <br>  the majoritiy of females that play wow WONT use voice chat, so he has really no way of knowing if its a male or female unless its his friend... and if its his friend... its prolly all a joke<br>  <br>  i did met the love of my life through one of my online wow friends though.... it was his cus<br>  <br>  amazing how things work out, i guess<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  ask him about it before you make any hard decisions, if your still not sure, bring it up again... then decide.... dont dwell on it though|`|IUQBvODuaa	A girl playing WoW.

But, we were scared after watching a special on TV talking about couples with fertility issues. We changed our minds and decided to try sooner so that if we had any problems, we could treat it sooner. We stopped birth control, and I got pregnant 2 months after we got married.|`|V5CRGK86aa	My fiance and I are getting married this September, and the discussion has come up. We both feel we should wait a year AT LEAST so we can enjoy newlywed life for a while, and get settled as man and wife :)|`|tqFdbFPNaa	It depends on how old you are.? i would say after a few months being married then try it.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I'm having kids on the 12th of never|`|hkwBR1moaa	We're going to try immediatly!<br>  <br>  Edit:  Why an I getting thumbs down.

We're ready and have been together for 7 years.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	we are waiting MINIMUM of a year.  we figure thats long enough to get our feet wet with marraige itself, and to make sure all our finances are in order, and so we know what its like to file taxes as a couple, rather than individuals.<br>  <br>    im thinking its going to be more like 2 years after, so we have a bit more money saved, but im not even going to THINK of babys till at least one year after|`|3SSVBJAqaa	We decided we aren't having children. If we do decide to have them down the line, we are adopting. Why bring in another child when so many need homes already?<br>  <br>  Thumbs down for adoption again? Wow.

If you ever have children, I am completely sure they are going to turn out to be selfish little brats and may they throw you into a cheap nursing home for your cruelty!!!!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	We've been married for 2.5 years, together for 4+ years, we're still not trying to have kids.

I was 31 when we got married so I don't have a lot of time (down syndrome and other birth defect risks start going up exponentially at 35), but we still wanted a few years to enjoy being married and travel.  We wanted to make sure we had fully adjusted to being married before we started our family, especially since we got married older and were both a little more set in our ways of independent, single living.<br>  <br>  Unless there is some biological reason to rush it, I think 3-4 years is a good minimum time to wait.  But to each his own.  I have a couple friends who had their first child by their 1 year anniversary.  My husband and I are enjoying our freedom and independence and are also saving up money and paying down our house so when we do have kids I can leave the work force to be home with them without causing financial hardship to our family.  Its important to us both to not have to put our kids in daycare.|`|AA10784932	We are getting married in September, I'd really like to start trying as soon as possible. But future hubby wants to wait a couple years. I'm 22 now, so as long as we have them before im 25 i'll be happy. He wants to wait because we like to go out and have fun and our friends just had a baby and they are always trying to find a baby sitter so they can hang out w/ us. We'd rather get our "younger"days out of the way to give our children our full undivided attention.Not saying you can't have fun when you have kids, I just dont think its fair to the child if you're always taking them to a baby sitter almost every weekend. We are also trying to buy a house this year, so money will be a little tight to start off with.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	We're going to wait a bit. Right now we're living in a studio condo. Which is fine for the two of us, but it's not the right type of home to raise a kid in because it's a very small space (the child would have no bedroom, no room to play, etc). We're going to wait until the housing market turns around so we can sell the place and get a house. After that we'll start talking about kids.|`|zmqN0M86aa	Right away.  We might as well.  We're at home a lot, I'm getting bored and will need something to do.  We're turning into old farts...boo.<br>  (jk, not really)<br>  <br>  Seriously, we've been together for several years already, we're closing on our 1st house in a few hours (yay!) and we live very comfortably.  If now is not a good time to have a baby, then I don't know what is.  Besides I don't want to be an old parent.  I don't want to be in a walker by the time my kids leave the house.|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	We got married in July 08, and we are buying a house sometime in the next few months, and the way we see it, we won't start trying to invite a little one into our family until we have the house done to our liking...so, I'd imagine we'll start this winter, or in very early 2010. <br>  <br>  We just wanted time to be just us, to save some money and have a nice home to welcome a baby into. I guess we're a bit more traditional that way.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	We have been married for 7 months and don't want kids.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously thumbs down because we choose not to have children?

Sheesh.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	My husband and I got married 11/1/08 and found out I was pregnant a month later.

I think we'd like to take a little break from major life events for a couple years after this, LOL.  I think we'll probably start actively trying for a baby in about 2-3 years, but if a little "unexpected blessing" were to occur before that, we'd certainly be thrilled!|`|FnskUYpqaa	We will wait about 1 year before we start trying.

We are both young and don't want to have a child until we can afford it and give it the attention it deserves.|`|ACecbVghaa	Maybe two or three years. We are not in a rush to have children but we do want them eventually. Spending some time together as a married couple without children is important to us, we have a lot of traveling to do together first.|`|ads40ROCaa	My parents waited 5 years after they were married to try and conceive.<br>  My boyfriend and I have discussed waiting at least 1 if not 2 years before trying for children just to spend time together as a couple if we get married.|`|0a3ecde4cde9a9d580733f222785f56caa	We're waiting a few years.

If she is still bothering you change your number.  <br>  Guy what made you talk about the "dumb" one? anyhow if you like this new girl tell her that you said that because she is still a friend you said you liked her but she in not a love interest just someone you cared as a friend.  Hope it works but guy, don't fall so fast for the girls or you will make the same mistake again and again--falling for girls all the time.  <br>  Remember that you were there for her and she is the one that pushed you away.  .  .|`|ReaD6u4paa	sta away fom that gil.she is stupid.let her ruin her life.i dont think she can be saved.but you can avoid a disgusting life.just stay avway from her|`|5LyhDC8waa	first of all don't even think about getting with that crazy chick.. because she sounds like she is immature and just likes attention let her deal with her problems cause she might get you involve you in them and that's not what you need and yes you should not told her from you like the ''dumb one'' just when you get a chance to talk to her be like  don't know what i was thinking i don't like her, but i don't wanna talk about her no more its not my problem its her world not mines.|`|UZKGEXB1aa	i changed my number for a similar situation a few months ago...best thing i've ever done. out of sight out of mind. No you def didn't hurt your chances you can turn it around to become an advantage. it depends on what you want from the nice girl. i'm assuming you want to atleast start dating. tell her soon that you've been seeing girls in the wrong way and have become attracted to the deviant female. in the long run it's not what you want. sure you will want to party alot in you coming years but being with a girl like that is going to throw everything in your life in a downward spiral. be honest with the new chick when the time is right...if you don't have the balls to talk to her, write her a letter/e-mail|`|qrtHvCk4aa	Ok first of all you need to realize that this whole crowd is bad news. If this girl had any respect for herself then she wouldn't be doing the things that she is doing. She probably needs to get some help because it sounds like she is looking for love in all of the wrong places and I don't mean love as in boyfriend girlfriend thing. I mean love from parents, friends period. I don't think you need to see her cousin either because I think you just need to leave the whole bunch behind. Getting over her maybe hard but she isn't good for you and she obviously isn't your friend if she is talking crap about you. Just get out while you still can, I know you really care about your friend but if she wants to have this dudes baby then she is crazy especially at such a young age, I had a friend similar to this and she couldn't be helped when we tried she just thought that we were out to get her. Now she is a 20 year old with 3 kids and another one on the way. She can't accept help from anyone till she is willing to admit that she needs it, till then you are the enemy. sorry bud
Uj5kuzoJaa	Yes you should stop talking to the other girl. She apparently does not like you otherwise she would have left the other guy to go with you. Also she sounds like a ho and it's time to move on.<br>  <br>  No you haven't ruined your chances with the other girl you like. Stop talking about the other girl when you're around the one you like. Start asking her things about herself and be interested in her. Ask her if she wants to go to the movies. Just because you liked her friend at first, doesn't mean that she might not like you. What if she has the same feelings for you. Just try to talk to her about it. Good luck|`|Midbg5BJaa	Get rid of number 1.<br>  <br>  Number 2 will come round in time...|`|gLqX7TG0aa	both of you <br>  are too young for any of what you're sayin|`|Z14qGsOuaa	Dude drop #1 like shes a hot tater!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  #2: It wasnt the smartest thing to do calling her "the dumb one" maybe she will forgive you and come around
AA11227341	I guess your friends did not real know you therefore it is their choice to accept your truth or not since there is not much you can do.  Sad thing is that gamma is not a true friend and has taken the ones you thought were.  Let them see you as you are and if they see you being truthful  they will make the choice.  Sorry. but life sometimes make no sense.  Peace out.

AA11662302	No, you are not wrong. Your husband is your partner in life and he is supposed to help you in a problem. Just like you are supposed to help him. Sit him down and express your feelings and how you would never do that to his loved ones. If he has love for you, he should respect your mother. We are all going through hard times right now.

Regardless of his reason, he is not screwing her over. She has your sister and herself to thank for that.

Since she is in a bind, she cannot be so picky as to who helps her. To me, it's justifiable that you're upset but don't overreact. Your mom is the only one who got herself into this, but your husband isn't obliged to lift a finger though.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Why does anyone buy a house in this economy? Prices are cheap.

Wv592rOqaa	To some degree you can a "living will" - this type of will should tell people how you want your affairs handled in case you die esp. if it happens suddenly.  <br>  <br>  The Living Will - discusses things like how you want to be buried or your request to be cremated - even down to the details of your dress and hair etc., - A Last Will and Testament - is a bit tricky, and most states recommend that you at least have a lawyer review it (which is costly).  However, if you make a Last Will and Testament and are in sound mind - it can be honoured - but if someone comes out of the woodwork and contests it - then the piano or money you left to Aunt Sophie can be tied up in world of probate courts for years.  Your LW&T grants your personal possessions to the people you want to give it to - and usually, there is 2 people you can trust left to take care of your estates (no matter how large or small).  <br>  <br>  My great great grandfather did his own will - but he discussed it with everyone while he was of sound mind and in reasonable good health - therefore there were no problems - yet, because people can make claims for many years after your demise.  You do not need to buy a will online, just simply write down clearly ... stating "This is my Last Will & Testatment, your name, address and that you are of sound mine, when writing it - and any Wills before it should be not be honoured.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest you have at least 2 people witness your Last Will & Testament and 1 certified notary notarized their signatures.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	You can in some states although it is advised to have one done by a legal professional. You can buy kits for not much more than $10 online. In AZ you can write it out on a piece of paper and it doesn't even have to be notarized (I was advised of this yesterday by my life insurance agent). While it isn't advisable it's nice to know you could do it right away.|`|ZtCyxfpfaa	Local libraries offer free will kits.

Good luck with this.
AA10325474	id say nothing. they simply have to the face the facts...maybe iam wrong, being heartbroken simply means feeling stupid and a lil used. u love somebody but arent loved yourself...that makes them feel stupid and insecure, and they feel sorry for themselves for a while. u cant change anything, u just can go on and make the best of it, have some fun...whats the alternative?|`|WvOvoxLxaa	There really isn't much you can do but listen to them talk.

So if I were you I would just try to limit the occasions in which you can talk to them if you are finding it that draining, or you could just stick it out and be there properly for them then they will be so much more grateful for you in the first place.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  You could try and get them to talk to each other and maybe they will be able to help each other get through it.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	Listen to what they have to say.  Sometimes people just need to vent their sorrows.  I know this can be hard for you, because you take in a part of it and feel it.  <br>  <br>  It's also not too healthy to sit and dwell on what you don't have.  A good idea might be to try and cheer them up.  Tell them you don't like to see them so sad and want to do something to make them happy.  Get them involved in something fun, be it going to the park, wrestling, playing a sport, shopping or learning magic tricks or juggling.  I'm sure you can come up with a dozen or so good ideas, and that's what friends are really for;  helping us back on our feet when we are down!|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Take them out and have fun. They cant dwell on this forever, so why sit around and mope with them? I'd give myself a few days to feel bad, but after that you need to bounce back and at least try to keep your mind off things. Give them that oppotunity because you could only hear about it for so long and than its just annoying.|`|9163f6723559c34dd8054736b04c9f39aa	The best thing you can do for you friends is to listen.

Not sure what to tell you but if you have decided to have sex (that is your choice and there will be repercussion for this trust me once you break it off you will understand) tell your mother to understand that you are no longer a child and that you enjoy having sex (it will make her cry and feel like she failed God and you too) and tell her to put you on the pill so I hope you know that I do not support your choice because teen age pregos, are on the increase and kids having kids make no sense so get on the pill or a reliable form of  protection but condoms are not 100 safe and the "pull out method" does not work.   It is your choice but what happens now is up to you to make life as you want it to be.  <br>  Tell your mom I said that she needs to consider putting you on the pill so she will not become a grandmother so young.    .|`|GwwY1BGQaa	oh dang! that is horrible my dad has seen some pretty sexual texts before to. I usually play it off like I am confused on what they are talking about because if my parents only knew the truth they would be so mad!<br>  <br>  hope your mom does not find out.....<br>  and i think that if you play the innocent thing it might work?|`|34ATWKEdaa	it happened to me when i was 17, the only thing i did i say i'm sorry and i promise i won't do it Again<br>  and my lil sister told my mom if she can give my phone back because she is the one who can make peace in the house, she asked for the second chance........|`|qrtHvCk4aa	Ok I have been in you shoes before and it took me hitting rock bottom before I realized how great my parents really are.  I know this isn't what you want ot hear but you need to come clean with your mom. Telling her before she finds out from your phone or some other way is the best way to keep yourself getting in more trouble. I know its going to be tough but its the best thing to do, and by you coming clean your mother will have a little more respect for you for being truthful without her having to find out. Not to mention that you need to apologize to your mother for the embarrassment it was to her that she had to found out all of this stuff from your friends father. it may not seem like its embarrassing to her but it looks poorly on your mothers parenting skills that your friends father is the one who brought it to her. Think about this before you just shrug me off as being a goody good. Because trust me I am almost 24 and I have been there and now I wish I could go back and not have hurt my parents as much as I did.
GvkakIo1aa	No matter what the case , when you approach it , just state.As much as I love you -then say it. This way she knows ,its because you love her and are worried about your marriage. This can be difficult thou. When  I myself pushed away from my husband , was due to lack of affection. Yes, it can be in any forms like complements, touch feeling unloved by your partner. Hey, this is a worry . It makes you look towards another direction for the emptiness  to be filled. Luckily , I never went that far on doing it. Just noticed it myself ,when I to was approached by this with my husband. Kids can be a factor , work , friends alot of things going around in your life. This causes us to not realize we are lacking on our own lives.Especially our partners. I for one thing was approached , in the neck of tim. Just make sure you do it soon. Best of luck to you.If she loves you she will listen. Don't take no for an answer, this way she knows your doing it because you love her.|`|Tnp6krzzaa	right comin from a girls point of veiw in this, ive had the exact same problem myself, women want to try and have their own space when they see you, she probably does love you. But if you be too Affectionate it can push her away give her some space when you are around eachother. when she relises that you arent as affectionate to her it will make her think "why doesnt he want to kiss me?" she will come to you. when it comes to having sex aswell dont come onto her let her come to you. <br>  i relationships like that make you worried and a bit down.<br>  i really do hope it works out for you (:<br>  all the best hope this helps you (:|`|N8EB7YkMaa	Been there, am there.  Something isn't working for her and it is probably something in day to day life and not sexual.  It isn't something "small" either, it is something substantial to her.  She may feel let down by something or disregarded in somethings, whatever it is, for me when that happened I lost the ability to be affectionate with him.  My sexual feelings are directly linked to my emotional ones, my security in my relationship.  It may not be that way with all women but is definitely that way with me.  I need to feel "right"  on the inside to act right on the outside, to be vulnerable or intimate.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Depending on what you say or do when you show affection. If your showing affection by hugging her and grabbing her breast at the same time that's not affection to a woman.  No matter the kind of affection you give her you still need to talk to her that's the only way of finding out whats up.|`|1686558f3523295a23a1c80d4e95f0f4aa	Well, that is tough.  She could just be lazy, it's true.  After time that does happen.  Or, it could be your worst fear....  You should talk to her, but be ready for whatever she has to say.  Listen, don't over react, and don't talk about it in the bedroom.  Find some other alone time to talk about it when you can both be honest and open.  Good luck.|`|FKMKQbqPaa	ask dude!  ask before it goes any further.  if you feel your mate growing distant it may already be too late.  four weeks ago after struggling thru sex i asked my wife if we were okay.  man, i wasnt ready for that answer.  now we're staring in the face of divorce.  i felt her growing away for a long time.  i didnt act and it has cost me everything.|`|BUET39wmaa	don't point fingers.<br>  just tell her how her actions make you feel.<br>  explain that when you signed up for marriage this is not the way you wanted things to be.<br>  you want to be happy and this situation is not a happy one and you need to resolve this or else you will have a choice to make.<br>  <br>  she needs her cage rattled but don't do it out of anger.  have compassion and patience and be honest with her.|`|an1EMiFkaa	I am going to try and put this as nice as I can. I am in your wife's shoes. And unfortunately it might not be fixable. I know in my case it isnt. If you feel she doesnt love you anymore then Im sorry she probably doesnt. Once a person falls out of love it is very difficult to get it back, if not impossible. <br>  My advice to you is to talk to her. Sit down and tell her how you feel and you can judge her reaction. At least you will know for sure.|`|Wv592rOqaa	COMMUNICATION - the key and major reason why a relationship will continue or end.  <br>  <br>  "Honey, we have a problem and "WE" need to talk about it.  If you think one of you will blow up - then write down the words you need like a movie script and stick to it.  - If the conversation gets heated, you be the man and blame everything on yourself - and suggest you stop and go for a walk until you cool down.  <br>  <br>  People complain that their spouses do not want to be affectionate, but if you have used harsh words or said mean things to your spouse - that can hurt emotionally as much as punching her in the face.  If you have a history of using language that might have "pushed her away" - tell her you need to change and you are working on it because you love her enough to change - and then "just do it" - <br>  <br>  If she does not come around then suggest counseling and if this does not work - you have a serious problem and need to address it!|`|AA11132696	Yes dude she loves you.Women lovee affection but some times you guys are too much.it bothers sometimes all the time on top of us you know maybe you should tone down give her lots of kisses  and hugss but let the woman breath dont sex too much.We really hate that men are too pusshy for sex and that gets ANY woman in this world pissed off.BIG TIME.I am sure she loves you.Give her lots of hugs and kises mmmmmmmmm we love that .Sex only 3 times a month you will see her reaction.Things will improve .I know I am a woman .I am that way too.Calm down those hormones buddy calm downnnn.otheriwse you will lose her for sure.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	If she is coming around her monthly time, just back off, nothing personal, it's just that some women don't want to be bothered at that time. Or, try not showing her any affection but still be nice and see if she starts to question you about why you are not touching her, I'll bet she will snap out of it.|`|c3f0288f0795ae4a646f8c1bb917d015aa	Cut the money off and watch how fast she comes around!<br>  I'm serious, don't pay the bills this month, block credit cards, checking account, etc, etc.<br>  See if she doesn't get the hint then.|`|vVh7ex7daa	Well it is true, the only way you will know is if you talk to her. Don't get mad or demand answers from her but tell her that it is definitely a problem. Be firm so that she knows you aren't just going to be brushed away and that you need to know whats going on. It isn't really fair for her to brush you off and not even tell you what is up with her. Maybe she has lost her sex drive somewhat? Do you have children? If you can't face talking to her just yet then i suggest making a bit more effort. I know that you feel she is the one with the problem but atleast when you do confront her she can't blame you in any way if you go above and beyond to make her feel better. Make a fuss of her, run her a bath or buy her some chocolates or give her a massage and make sure she knows you love her. Give her alot of affection and if she doesn't have any of it then just come clean and tell her how you feel.|`|Ls93X4ufaa	People go through stages of feelings. Maybe she's feeling disconnected from you emotionally. Maybe she feels like the only time you show her affection is when you want sex. Try to give her some non-sexual attention, outside of the bedroom. I'm sure your relationship is just going through some changes, just remain confident that she still loves you until she says otherwise. Good luck to you!|`|cbn16s58aa	To be able to give proper advice, more info is needed.  Has anything changed in her life?  Career, family, finance?  Does she have any new friends?  Have you changed anything about you?  Are you the same person she was interested in when you met her?  People grow and change and sometimes you can't do anything about it.  You need to sit and talk to her and LISTEN to her.  Tell her what you are feeling and thinking and ask her the same about her.  You must talk to understand each other.  When the talking stops, so does the romance.|`|6a56c836d361c3eb479fddc9e9cb02e1aa	Ok... do this love dare for me...<br>  <br>  ask her to tell you three things that you do that bother her.  Do not get defensive or hurt feelings by it.  Simply listen to her and try to change those things.  <br>  <br>  My husband did this and he found out that simply walking by me and grabbing my chest is NOT a turn on.  I told him and great hug and kiss on the cheek is sexier than grabbing me while I am cooking or washing dishes.  Show some respect for her as a person.  Simple...<br>  try it and see...|`|zNn9VfRyaa	ask her how she feels. ur  married to her. so ask ur wife how she feels about everything. remember even if she is distant ya'll r in it together|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Sounds like it's time for a romantic weekend getaway. Soon.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Talk to her. It's the only way to figure out what is up.|`|29hcn9JRaa	Im not a marital counselor or a therapist, however I do have personal experience when it comes to women and love, as I am a woman, I have been in love before, and have grown out of love to many times. When I begin to lose interest in a man or a relationship, one of the first things that I notice is that my once excited desire to see my boyfriend has slowly decreased, no longer am I counting the hours till I see him, no longer am I looking forward to getting together, and I also start making excuses to not see him, in other words I say to him, I have to work late, or I have a meeting to go to, or I have other plans, basically he is no longer as important as he once was. Also another huge red-flag signal is the sudden lose of physical touch, I find that hugging and kissing comes to a slow halt, that once long powerful hug or embrace has now turned into a quick, short, pat on the back, kinda like, here's your hug, now get out of here. Also the lack of communication begins to come to a close, no longer is it fun to sit up till all hours of the night talking about family, friends, or work to my guy, suddenly it goes from long talks, to, who left the cap off the tooth paste? And the biggest sign that your wife may no longer be in love with you is, drum-roll please-  Intuition, if you feel it in your gut, if your heart is telling you something is wrong, if you really feel as if she no longer is not in love with you, chances are, you are right. However this doesn't spell the end, it doesn't mean she doesn't love you or respect you, it simply means she is no longer in love with you in a romantic kinda way, so even if you merely have love and respect, it is better then nothing. My advise is to work with what you have, stop stressing over what you don't have. Also not all two women are alike, your wife may be the type who likes things simple? She may not like being overwhelmed? She may be the type who doesn't like drama, so keep things simple. Simple and working with what you have is my suggestion for your marriage that may be a little rocky may not be perfect, is a bit different, but certainly not on the verge of divorce. So hang in their. Penelope
0JB4eb6raa	You asked Would most guys have a problem with it.  Yes, most guys would. I think a guys first thought about the other guy is the way guys think. Most guys know how other guys think. And they are right so much of the time that you may as well just say they are right. Don't even bother with a percentage. If I were a girl and I am not saying either way but I would want someone of the opposite sex to be my roommate. I think a woman would mostly think..just for getting along better reasons and other stuff too. I think a guys thoughts would first be... I could get some, I could meet other girls, maybe she'll forget one day and walk out of the bathroom nude. In the mean time...and depending on your relationship with your boyfriend and what ever your and your roommates rules of the place are..invite your boyfriend over often and other stuff helps like, if your home and he knows it, answer the phone. I think it's a good thing. You know that stuff already yeah? Oh and if you talk a lot about your roommate and your really not into him like you are with your boyfriend. Don't talk about him when your with your boyfriend. Even though you know that your boyfriend has to try to keep remembering that you do not think about your roommate the way ...what ever .. you'll work it out|`|G1mqf2Lsaa	Ive had a guy roommate since I moved out of my parents place years back..<br>  A few of the more insecure guys would somewhat question it at first but then after having them around my place a lot with my roommate around, they would get over it and realize that we are strictly just friends. It also helps that my roommate and I have known each other for years and have never once had a sexual moment together.<br>  I wouldn't worry about this being a problem because the only men that will make it a problem are the insecure ones that aren't worth your time. If you have a good thing working out with your roommate, i wouldn't move out just because you fear men might have an issue.|`|2c4oLCOqaa	would you like it if your boyfriend had a girl roommate?<br>  <br>  I'd get your own place or have a girl roommate<br>  may help out a bit|`|gF8gTZJxaa	I would say yes in both cases.|`|Q6iXC4Ojaa	I'm sure at first its hard to deal with  but if you just started talking with him it shouldn't be a big deal.|`|uBssj3Znaa	I lived with a guy roommate for a while and let me tell you that I never saw my boyfriend more.

gRXy66dOaa	There's no way to know for sure if a guy likes you unless you ask him (and even then he could get shy and say no!) so here are a few tips to help you work out if he likes you.<br>  <br>  Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. <br>  <br>  Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually. <br>  <br>  Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company. <br>  <br>  Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else. <br>  <br>  Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. <br>  <br>  Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you. <br>  <br>  Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well. <br>  <br>  Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. <br>  <br>  Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?|`|C23ufcJJaa	so is this about man candy #1 or man candy #2? hmm... or is it the short mexican guy? well anyways if he does look at you when you talk to someone else i think he might like you.

GvkakIo1aa	Obviously , she is interested in you in some sort of a way. Just because she has guy friends doesn't mean she isn't interested . When I was in school and younger , I had alot of male friends. That doesn't mean anything. In my opinion , a girl that is sought out by guys is a friendship way is good. Meaning she is different than other girls. That's what makes a girl unique in a males point of view. Hey, in my opinion, if this girl goes out of her way for you to notice her in so many hi's why not ask her out. What do you have to lose? nothing in my opinion. Careful, if you wait to long she might not want to say hi in the future. best of luck. You do catch her eye no matter what anyone says. Have a great day.|`|0haWIfVMaa	Sounds rightly so, girls treat boys like that when they are interested, and don't shy away because she has guy friends.|`|yTNk4b7Raa	Firstly well done.<br>  This is the first question from a boy, asking if a girl likes him in months. Thank god there are still decent boys out there! LOL.<br>  anyway, i think she likes you.<br>  I just think she is too scared to make the next move, just talk to her about it.
i9orREV5aa	I'm just brainstorming so here's some food for thought. How long was she dating this guy? It doesn't sound like she's really super broken up about it so maybe the risk of a rebound relationship isn't as high.<br>  <br>  I think you should ask her out. Why wait for someone else to jump in first? Maybe go for something casual during the day (instead of dinner & movie for example). If she says yes but keeps talking about her ex throughout the date then she's still pining for him and I'd cut and run.|`|qTTLALyeaa	You hit the nail on the head every girl is different.

5wdPKphVaa	I say it's not 1996 anymore...everyone and their mother is on the internet. The chances of you meeting a weirdo in real life are just as high. At least I know if someone is online, they can afford a computer and internet access. And most likely you've talked quite a bit and gotten to know them before you meet-------That's more than you usually know about someone you meet in a bar or on the street. So I don't see what the big deal is.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	sorry to hear you have encountered some maniacs from dating in person. i usually can sniff the crazy ones out and wont get near them. You cant compare the past with the present (or the future). Kids (for the most part) are much smarter than kids were in the 90's. And everything online has changed. Now you can find just about anything you want to know on google, wikipedia or youtube. So if you want to date somebody online, go for it. And stay away from those crazy people. You can usually tell who's crazy or not by signs.|`|nMWtEmEFaa	There's no difference, other than people might be able to lie easier about appearances and stuff. But you can easily find this out yourself if you're willing to do the whole webcam/microphone thing.<br>  <br>  I've met my best friend on the internet. She stayed a week at my home. I've met my boyfriend on the internet, he stayed for 2 months at my home, then on our second meeting we were together for 5 months etc.<br>  <br>  There's really nothing different about meeting people online. I actually encourage people to meet people online, as you can easily find someone with the same interests as you. If you just meet people based on location, you'll have a difficult time trying to find people who you have any interests with.<br>  <br>  People who say that everyone you meet online is a 40 year old pervert who will kill you are just paranoid. They don't realize that a lot of people - millions of people - use the internet for every day purposes. Online predators are also predators offline, so your chances don't really 'increase' of meeting someone online who wants to harm you.<br>  <br>  Your chances increase of finding someone you have something in common with, that's all.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	just be careful and meet in a local crowded place...like the mall.<br>  <br>  i didnt look but i did meet my bf online...it jsut kinda happened...a friend of a friend of a friend type thing...and we connected through myspace.  talked for a long time, and eventually met.<br>  <br>  we have been dating for almost 4 years now...<br>  <br>  i dont think it matters how you met...its more of how you treat eachother after.  just be careful and thats all...<br>  <br>  i babysit for families that i meeet online and i meet them prior to babysitting with their children so that we can both make sure both parties are legit.  no pictures of phone calls are legit...so...keep that in mind|`|Mkq466xdaa	im actually surprised at how acceptable this has become in certain places these days. your right though that your just as likly to run into a maniac on the street. no matter what there will always be people who are against this, but it seems more people have been coming around to it lately. me, personally i dont think its wrong but its not right at the same time either. its hard to explain. like if i met someone i think i would be open to it but at the sametime be very skeptical and very unsure if this person is being honest with me or not.|`|mVgY2I2Zaa	Desperado.<br>  What happened to good 'ol days when you just hopped outside and met someone.<br>  The internet is to perverts, wackos, pedophiles what a lamp is to moths and other flyin bugs|`|XkidpdPWaa	I believe it's rape waiting to happen.|`|vkuyvIjOaa	online they can tell you that they are some one their not. and in person you get to see first hand who they really are.|`|jrdtQi04aa	I dont think I would trust meeting someone online.

But there are some things that could be dangerous online.|`|3F4nCjyEaa	you cant trust anyone!|`|GKmJM70Qaa	ya i would still be cautious....make sure u meet in a public place incase things go wrong.....but then this is coming from someone who flew to a different country to meet someone online|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I agree there are maniacs on and off the internet. The thing about the internet is that people lie more and it's so much easier to deceive. Some people do it all the time because they enjoy it. I've heard stories about people having online relationships and the person on the other end would keep making excuses not to meet them in person...and it would turn out that he's having online relationships with a dozen other women too, or that he was totally different from how he made her believe he was, and very convincing.<br>  <br>  BUT I think it's certainly possible to meet great people on the internet. If I were single that would actually be the first place I would look. You can even get to know a person better than you would face to face sometimes, because some of us are less guarded when we're typing, more open. The thing is you just have to take everything they say with a grain of salt, and not believe the person completely until you get to know them in real life.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I don't have a problem as long as you do it safely.

Good friends don't have to talk abut something everytime they hang out !! ... just being with them is cool enough or doing stuff with them is what i do . U always get something to talk abut if u r really close .... but if both of u r hiding stuff from each other things can get a little boring !|`|lTlwrqJDaa	Well it depend on thinking.b'coz  being together means sum times it become closer and sum times  far away.|`|Ct2U6Wvwaa	Some times we may get bored of our friend because of many reasons.It may his over talkative nature or because silence of the part of friend or it may be because he is too dull|`|OxuxGboVaa	yeh ! it happens sometimes ! try getting some1 else in yr group .. or hang out with other friend ! ... just dont make her seem that she is being replaced ...<br>  otherwise u'll just loose her ! <br>  so just hang out with other of yr friends ! have sleep overs ! .. or do something new !|`|AA11898255	yeah sometimes! well i have 3 ppl in my group but it still gets boring sumtimes! *_*
R2YvUudQaa	its not true love if its at that young age...|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Its infatuation you dont know what real love is until you are older sorry.|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	Since love is a chemical imbalance in the brain; yes you could. The real question is if it is something that will last. Your hormones will change drastically throughout puberty and as a result you will likely fall in and out of love several times before age 20.|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	yeah, and also possible to get pregnant too. think about it|`|gLqX7TG0aa	they call it PUPPY LOVE
43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Nope, it just means they want kids.  Yes, they are probably having a lot of sex, but that's not what they want you to hear.  If they did, they would be braging about great sex.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Young couples, yes, older couples, no. Couples who are really serious have sex during the fertile times. Some will abstain 1-2 weeks so that the volume of their ejaculation is larger.|`|BUET39wmaa	i don't know about everyday but it does mean having sex?????!!!!!|`|u1uECuFNaa	No, not really.<br>  It means no protection to me....and lots of charting.|`|FewhKlx9aa	No it just means they are trying as they say and want a family.The fact that you think that sex happens everyday is wrong because there are only certain days of the month that she can be fertile.It gets boring trying on certain days and marking the calender,it's no longer spontaneous|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Not really, because if they are truly trying to have children, they know that sex everyday lessens the chances.  It most likely means that they are charting temperatures and holding off sex a few days before ovulation.|`|MDWaPmXsaa	Of course I know this is not always the case,  but the vision that usually comes to mind for me is that of the woman taking her temperature all the time and bugging her husband.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I think this day and age it's assumed people who cohabitate are having sex almost every day if not every day. Saying you're trying to have kids simply means you're doing it without birth control.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	It might mean that they are only having sex two or three times a month with the help of an ovulation kit.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Not necessarily, it just means cream pie galore.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Pretty much?|`|z2bejpm1aa	yep, they get it on all day and all night|`|BwXpvbxKaa	No it actually means that she is taking her temperature and calling him on the sport at her highest peek so probably they are doing it at the right time and when is not, they are holding back...........orrrrrrrrrrrr they are just showing off for having a great sex life......are you? LMAO|`|jBigEy0Caa	It usually means you are not doing anything to prevent having kids.  Some people who are having a hard time getting pregnant may be trying a little harder than others.  Like others have said every day does not allow for a high sperm count and doesn't work as well.|`|krQiDGCHaa	My husband and I have been trying to have a baby for 2 years.<br>  <br>  When people ask if we're still trying to have a baby, my husband looks at them and goes "Yeah, we f*ck"<br>  <br>  LMAO|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Why does it matter.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	it might be.  or maybe they're trying to have kids.  why read more into it than that?|`|XnIdLz9xaa	yes|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Nope, just means they are trying to get pregnant. You don't have to have sex every day to get pregnant. And you can have sex every day and not get pregnant.|`|Sn72zeBhaa	Not likely.  Though that would be fun!  Counts for men increase if they are not having sex everyday, and there are only a couple days that are most likely to get you pregnant.  <br>  Trying to have kids is almost worse, having sex becomes about timing, and temperatures, and calendars, and then it can still sometimes not happen right away.<br>  <br>  Of course, for some who do not worry about how long it takes to conceive "trying to have kids" could just simply mean "not using protection anymore"
DozD8lTGaa	Hmm, i wouldn't call that emotionally abusive myself. but, some people might. he used you though and he has f*cked your head up, so he is messing with your emotions...<br>  <br>  you should try and control them better though and learn how to stop giving into him so easy... what he called you was starred out but, i am guessing it wasn't nice! and that is a part of emotional abuse.<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope i helped and good luck on sorting it out and getting over him :) x|`|QhT9MjEoaa	No it wasn't. He just wasn't ready.|`|NqlWkqm9aa	No you're just acting like a little girl. Grow up. What did he do that was so 'emotionally abusive'?

I wouldn't want to be any other person besides myself...|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	I feel like I'm the only one being totally honest with myself.  I like myself, and I hate myself.  It just depends on when you catch me.<br>  <br>  The fact is, there are days when I wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and wonder what I'm doing with my life.  I hate my job, I hate my looks, I hate my place in the world, I hate just about everything I see looking back at me.<br>  <br>  Other times, I look in the mirror, and I am filled with confidence.  I don't over analyze my flaws, and I am truly proud of what I do and what I've accomplished.  I know that these are emotions that everyone deals with.  The trick is to let the good outweigh the bad.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Yeah I like myself.<br>  <br>  I'm funny, and charming. I'm a sweet person (the sweetest, so says my boyfriend)<br>  <br>  I'm a good sister and a great aunt and a fantastic girlfriend. <br>  <br>  I'm a solid worker and I feel like I'm really doing all I can to just be a good, fun person.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	You dont have to like everything about yourself, but to some degree we all should.

OuQizrQ6aa	It's okay to be whoever you want to be. It is when someone puts up a false front that it is not okay. People see right through it. Are you doing it because you're trying to attract younger girls or because it's who you really are? Be yourself, and never let others' opinions of you influence your decisions. <br>  <br>  It's true that most of the people who dress emo are a good bit younger than you. Does that make it not okay? I'm 23 and I still watch cartoons and play with my pet turtles. I buy yo-yos and remote control cars. On a rainy day last week I actually had a boat race in the gutter with my co-workers (most of whom are over 30). I don't care if anyone judges me as immature for these things, because they are a part of who I am. <br>  <br>  I once read this on the back of a box of herbal tea: "When I was a child I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man I took that child outside and had him shot." I'm not really sure what it means, but it's always stuck with me.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|l3MED8Itaa	im 20 and i like guys like that. they are easier to get along with and usually want girls for their mind and not their body.|`|KX5ALUzWaa	Lol...<br>  Dress how you want to dress!

I dunno. No and yes. You can't just say do girls like guys like this? Because all girls are different and have differents tastes me and my best friend hav different tastes. I like emo boys, but she would never even think of dating one(with a few exceptions) though sometimes we do agree on guys. So I don't know. As for the too old thing. Nah.. Dress how you want to dress and find a girl that likes you for however you dress and however you act. Don't try to change.|`|gO9tl2uhaa	The fact that you want that you feel old at 24 shows a lot to us.<br>  <br>  You cannot enjoy the present. My guess is you didn't get to enjoy a certain period (18-22) at its fullest and now you can't look in front of you. You can't enjoy the present you keep looking back at the past. You also want to forget that society "decided" that at your age, you must begin the rest of your life. <br>  <br>  While you're lying to yourself and it isn't good for you, it isn't dangerous for anyone but yourself. So I say go ahead. A lot of people feel or have felt like you.<br>  <br>   You have an identity crisis and until you do what you want, you won't realize who you truly are - you won't stop looking behind. One of my moto in life is it's always better to regret something you did than regretting for not trying. I doubt you have much to loose anyway (no pun intended)<br>  <br>  The only thing I'd like to add is that you're staying in the same track. You're staying in our society's track, but you're just gonna take a few steps back. Who said you had to stay in our society's track? You figure out what I mean. In time, you will|`|uhjVEzlXaa	I would say its ok for you to keep your style but you have to be aware that with every year you will be maturing and you will eventually have to change your style but i would advice you to slowly move out of it and see how you feel.<br>  <br>  Also i think there is a big gap between 24 years and 18. Six years is quite a lot you should consider looking for girls that are between 20 and 22.<br>  Good Luck

Of course, if you are either still dependent on others financially, that may be difficult. The thing is, you didn't mention really why your family thinks this guy and his family are no good, but if you can truely say that they are wrong, then you only have to decide if you want to fight your family (not physically) to continue the relationship.

But I'm sorry, it isn't a funny situation and I'll try to help.<br>  <br>  I know it can be difficult, as you have to choose between him and your family. If you tell your family how you really feel about him, then they may start to come around, I am surprised that they would be annoyed at you dating someone who went so low but came back and has become so successful. I find it quite admirable. <br>  <br>  If your family still refuse to compromise, then you can call things off with him if your family comes first, or if you are really serious about him, tell them that you are going to choose him. They may come around to your feelings then, however, you have to be very careful because if they call your bluff, and you don't stay with this guy for long, you could end up losing him and your family and be left with no-one.<br>  <br>  Basically, you just have to weigh up which party (him or your family) means more to you, and for what reasons. I would personally always choose family, but if they were as hostile as yours seem to be, then I would be a little scared and maybe not so remorseful for leaving them for another love. Keep all this in mind. I hope it all works out for you.<br>  <br>  Kind regards.
I6dIkhbOaa	I am a little confused because you said girlfriend and then boyfriend, so I'll just say SO (significant other). Anyway, if your SO said that about staying there, it was probably a mixture of two things:<br>  <br>  1) He/she was having an amazing time and was feeling like it would be great if those moments could last forever and gave an imaginative illustration of how that might look<br>  <br>  2) He/she was feeling/thinking like they could be with you forever and put it out there for a reaction.<br>  <br>  Just because someone says something like that, it does not mean they are looking for a proposal next week or even next month. I rushed into a relationship (engaged after just a couple of months) and although we have lasted almost 12 years (almost 11 married) it has been a very, very hard road. Marriage is hard enough when you deeply know someone, get premarital counseling, plan how many or if you will have kids, divide responsibility, run finances, etc. but if there is none of that and you just rush in based on soft fuzzy, lovey feelings, you could grow to regret it. My advice to you is that if you are truly in love, let it grow, give it time to do so. If you still feel this way 5-6 months from now start to talk about making a plan, get premarital counseling, make sure you have the BIG questions answered before committing for a lifetime. If you are going to be with her forever, then what is a few more months to make sure?? Hope to have helped.  ;)|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Freak out. Definite freak out.<br>  <br>  Even if you are dating him to see if you're compatible for marriage, don't say something as indirect as that. Most men really dislike mind games.<br>  <br>  And when you're ready to say something like that directly, say it when you're completely sure, not just because you're having thoughts.|`|kxAMOZAuaa	Hold off a while.. play it safe.|`|HaHPnNp3aa	I'm not a guy I'm a chick but I would hold off till I was sure and new what I wanted...|`|nMWtEmEFaa	My boyfriend went into a relationship with me with the thought that this was PERMANENT, forever. Or at least do everything in our power to make this last as long as possible.<br>  <br>  So basically we already agreed to marry each other once we became boyfriend and girlfriend.<br>  <br>  My point is, every guy is different. Some would love to stay together forever, some are unsure of the future and would freak out about permanent commitment. Some are just 'whatever' and don't really care. I can't tell you if your guy would be happy, or unhappy - as you know him best.<br>  <br>  Do the right thing, just talk to him about it. Talk about your futures, talk about wanting it to be permanent. If he agrees, then that's great, if he disagrees, at least you know you're not on the same page and should re-think your relationship with him.

But something is telling you to be reserve with him,  and not to e-mail him, and it's that same little bell of self preservation in our self that we women often ignore, and then afterwards say,  we knew we shouldn't have called him, or done this or done that.....right? <br>  <br>  Keep the advantage at this point, and let him "believe" that you have moved on w/o him, and your life is so full that you let the day past w/o remembering his special day.  Perception is huge to men, and they love the mystic of women even if you are not in a current relationship with them. Lastly, wait until your birthday comes up, and see if he will try to communicate to you an Happy Birthday greeting first, if he was the cause of the break-up.  Have one of your girl or guy friends just to e-mail him a month before your birthday, and casually ask him when is the last time he has heard from you, in order yo put you on his mind a month before.  If he doesn't call, or email you on your special day, you'll know just how much he cares to remember your birthday, and you'll be glad, or either dissappointed depending on the decision you make on whether you choose to  e-mail him, to wish him an Happy Birthday, thus letting him know you were thinking about him.  He very well could be in another relationship with someone else.....right?  On the other hand, if he was a "good guy" it will not matter if you call him, if you broke up with him......right? <br>  <br>  Always take special care of yourself all the time, for everything, especially your most precious possession you have, your heart, that often guides your mind and all your actions. In playing the game of life that is really played in relatiionships, always play to win, and not the person that is experiencing the lost when you played it so beautifully, and fair with him, giving him your all.|`|0TuWYaneaa	If your not talking then leave it alone.You sound like your still interested,but that don't mean he is.If he's still interested it may push him away,like rubbing salt in a wound.If you are you may want to wait until its no occasion to communicate with him.Just go over and say I'd like to talk,would you? If he says no then you know its over,but you never know until you try.|`|knXnjnSmaa	It's up to you, don't know the details of who broke it off. But I suppose that if he was your fiance at one time then you two had a special relationship and I don't see anything wrong with acknowledging his special day. Just send him a short casual email with a birthday wish. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11783622	Nope.<br>  <br>  Move on.  He has.|`|N8EB7YkMaa	No, you should not.|`|aErUKUvVaa	Cut ur losses and move on.  Hes your EX fiance.....|`|ODYrypwaaa	no!|`|f5cf5ncYaa	No, not if he changed his number. Well... maybe. If he doesn't like to talk to you, don't push it, but if you both still are friends or acquaintances, then I would.|`|YBwJvDUEaa	Leave him alone. If he changed his number then apparently he didn't want to talk to you.|`|srcV5iAMaa	Yes you should just to be nice in general, unless you to just have a horrible history then its totally up to you.|`|Js3cLOrFaa	What's with you women that can never let go of the past????<br>  <br>  I bet he has a new lady now and all you REALLY want to do is cause drama and trouble.<br>  <br>  BUTT OUT.  HE IS NOT YOURS ANYMORE!|`|32uLNYX1aa	it all depends on ur history- did he change the number bcuz  he want no contact with u? or did u leave the relationship on bad terms? if any of these question resulted in a yes then let it go- he may consider it lightweight stalking|`|0Kp7SI5oaa	thats a hell no. move on my dear. im sure hell have a happy birthday anyway since he changed his number and all.|`|lFyaETJBaa	He is your ex for a reason.. and he changed his number. You need to let him go.
dFHsAXDMaa	when you figure women out let the rest of the men in the world in on what makes us tick... Hell I am a woman and I do not understand most women really.... I see so many women  I know spend more time being mad at the person they are with over something ridiculous than appreciating and loving them.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	women love to make you feel like "the bad guy". I have no clue why this is. Ive been with women who denied even the obvious of things and then when their friends pointed it out, they said "oh i was joking or something like that". I cant tell you why some do this. Build your confidence up and pick your battles. if its not that big of deal, either say sorry or dont. Dont say one thing then do another. Stick with your decision and dont try to win every battle. Some times people like to test you in relationships just to see how easy you are. <br>  <br>  Tell her to move on with her complaint and schedule another date. If shes still whining about it, just say "call me when you have a date" and leave it at that.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	You pick bad girls. Find a better one.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	If she is breaking planes, she might be a terrorist.  Kidding and spelling errors aside, you don't have too many details in this question, which leaves a lot of room for speculation on how each of you "broke plans".   There are some acceptable ways to cancel a previous engagement with someone, and then there are some questionable ones.  Example of how "breaking plans" could cause a lot of grief:<br>  <br>  You and g/f decide to go to Thailand for a month vacation.  You purchase two RT tickets to Bangkok on your credit card three weeks in advance.  She then tells you four days before the flight that she doesn't want to go anymore.  <br>  <br>  Small amount of grief.<br>  You call your g/f in the morning and ask if she wants to go to see the latest film that evening.  She agrees and you tell her you will come by after work (7p).  She calls you while you are at work to tell you she forgot she told her friend she would watch her kids tonight and has to cancel. <br>  <br>  Put it in perspective and maybe have a conversation with your g/f.  Without placing blame and resorting to name calling or dredging the past, let her know you are frustrated and that you will make an effort in the future not to make plans with her unless you are fairly certain you can keep the commitment.  Ask her to do the same.  Do not make plans flippantly and without thought, and just cancel for trivial reasons.  This makes the other person whom you made plans with feel unimportant.|`|CEqYjcBeaa	One thing you must quickly learn with woman is that there are alot of things are double standards from a womans perspective. There are ALOT of things that are acceptable for a woman to do that a man cannot do without being given grief for. You have only begun to scratch the surface my man.|`|AA11841294	your not the bad guy!!! She's the bad one!!! how is it that she gets mad when u break a plan but its okay when she do it? I don't get it.... She needs to cool it and u need to tell her that!!! either that or find a new g/f...|`|Pk6iFi3yaa	You're not the bad one. She is for acting that way. You did the samething she's doing. I think you should tell her to take a chill pill becuause she does the samething. or get a new girlfriend|`|Wqt8ItvIaa	sometimes thats just how it is. make it up to her with a cool suprise like taking her somewhere she'd like alot and you'll be good|`|34ATWKEdaa	i think it just a misunderstanding between you and your girlfriend. you ain't bad guy|`|GKmJM70Qaa	dude, u aint the bad guy....but maybe u should ask her y its ok for her to do that and not for you to.

cNk4I6qfaa	lol..<br>  No idea|`|AA10287830	You don't want to call women bad names because you are a good and decent guy.  You still have respect for women and that's very healthy.  Don't ever change!|`|ezT7xruoaa	why are you even wondering about this crap? just accept that you have respect for yourself and others and don't call them bad names, and get on with your life. seriously, your wording this as if it was a problem!|`|vtafeEIJaa	If I am a woman ?|`|b3zGfYMpaa	I think you have a great mentality. Your right too many people throw around those trashy names and while no girl I think likes to be called or labeled such.. still you'll have the ones who will call eachother it. Its rather hypocritical. Calling yourself or someone else names like that constantly, I think shows little self-value and it also looks like you have a self-esteem issue in which you must degrade others to make yourself feel better. Thats lack of maturity and reflects badly on yourself rather than the person your talking about. This my friend, is probably why you have the view on this that you do and I congratulate you for that. It takes some many years to come to that self-actualization. No matter how bad I've been treated or no matter how bad I felt about mistakes I've made I'd never degrade myself in that way even if everyone else thought so.|`|xGr2QYWDaa	The way I see it, it you are comfortable calling eachother names like that it's okay and acceptable, it is not taken as an insult, unless you don't like the other person, then it is used as an insult. <br>  <br>  Just like in Spanish, you hear it all the time 'Way'....everyone uses this name to address eachother and in no way is it offensive unless the other person doesn't like to kid around with you or doesn't like you or you don't like them.  It's a matter of speech and in no way implies that you are a b*tch or ho or whatever.<br>  <br>  Maybe you're just a very respectable and proper guy, and that's good but around some people, you have to chill or you may feel out of place.<br>  <br>  Most people will agree with me that these words are very common and for the most part are not used to intentionally hurt someone's reputation or to spread rumors, or to hurt someone's feelings.

And how can this woman be 18 AND over?  She can't be two ages.  She can be 18 OR over, but not 18 AND over.<br>  <br>  Are you just a bit confused?|`|W0XoDxJraa	Great!<br>  But for gods sake make sure you keep the receipt and don't leave it around anywhere loose for her to "find"... she may get the wrong end of the stick!<br>  I'd love that...she'd feel more confident if she knew she was wearing something that obviously turns yuo on...because you chose it out!|`|AA11447210	I wouldn't mind it at all.

ACecbVghaa	It's never too soon to look. Once you find The Dress, you'll know it. You'll get the dress in a bag, you can keep it in the bag in the closet, just wrap the dress in a sheet in the bag and put a handtowel in the bag at the bottom to keep the dress fresh and prevent moisture. If you keep it in the bag, he'll never see it. Or, keep it in a girlfriend's closet or at your mom's if you think he'll snoop.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	6-9 months. Seriously, I thought that was way too far in advance, but for all the alterations you want and things that have to be done, including ordering the correct size, you will need that amount of time. I got engaged mid Jan., started looking for one soon after, had to order it by end of Jan to have it in on time. I'm getting married in June.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I found out about this the hard way... and didnt know it can take from 4 to 6 months to order a dress..once you get it...depending on the fitting you will need 4-6 weeks for alterations..and go for a final try before you can take your dress out of the store..<br>  I would say 8-9 months before the wedding gives you enough time to look around and find accesories shoes etc..<br>  <br>  I had to rush order my dress (cost $200 extra) because I didnt start looking..good thing you asked this now...<br>  <br>  so now you know..you should sart looking..you might find THE dress on your first visit to the store...thats how i found my dress...:)<br>  <br>  congratulations!|`|wPL4VrPSaa	3-4 mths|`|rpVQpJA7aa	You are fine to start looking now, then you can look at more places! Make sure you take pictures so that you remember them all. Typically they say to order your dress about 4-5 months before the wedding in order to allow time for alterations (BUT it depends on the designer). Some designers dresses take a long time to come in. I would just ask them everywhere you go. You could leave the dress at the store. They will do that, otherwise store it at a relative's house, or your maid of honors house|`|tqFdbFPNaa	At least six months. You can look now if you want. It never hurts. You just might find the perfect gown and at a perfect price. Shoppiing is fun anyways. You can keep it anywhere. Some bridal salons do let you store it at their location. Some charge and some don't. I would just keep it at a close friend's, like your MOH, or your parent's. As long as you keep it bagged you'll be fine. Our family has a dry cleaner and most of the time brides only bring in their dress when they have dirt on them from the bridal shoot or the day of the wedding.<br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|o7lAXurcaa	Order it six months before. I just ordered mine and the store i bought it from keeps it there until the day of the wedding, so I am very lucky with that. I wouldn't want to bring it home anyway, if anyone knows you have it. They will be asking you to show it to them, it will get dirty. So the longer you wait the better, just 6 months should be the max. Good luck and congrats|`|o4NarYVoaa	it is NEVER to soon to look!  i would think the store could keep it for you, but you might be better off leaving it with a parent or maybe your maid of honor, so nothing can happen.  the store has no emotional attachment to you or care for you...so what if it gets "misplaced" before your wedding, then its to late to get a new dress.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	At least six months. You can look now if you want. It never hurts. You just might find the perfect gown and at a perfect price. Shoppiing is fun anyways. I got mine in January and my wedding isn't until next January. I got the dress for only $325 and it's worth $1100. You can keep it anywhere. Some bridal salons do let you store it at their location. Some charge and some don't. I would just keep it at a close friend's, like your MOH, or your parent's. As long as you keep it bagged you'll be fine. Our family has a dry cleaner and most of the time brides only bring in their dress when they have dirt on them from the bridal shoot or the day of the wedding.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I started looking right when I got engaged (we got married six months later). I went to try on dresses 10 weeks before the wedding (it often takes 6 weeks for your dress to come in if ordered and then you need time in case it needs altered). I think ten weeks is a good time frame because it is less time to gain or lose weight (which all brides do) and less time to store it. I stored mine in the bag it came in at my mom's in her spare room where my hubby wasn't often found. About a week before the wedding I took it to get steamed and then hung it from the ceiling in there so as not to create any wrinkles. Congratulations, and remember to stop and look around throughout your day, it goes by so fast.
dalNxu8zaa	lol its true not everyone is taking seems like ur just looking in the wrong places|`|IOXJdCvSaa	The truth is that its not a ton of crap<br>  <br>  You gotta get out there in the world<br>  <br>  You cant find a girl to connect with in a club doggy, trust me<br>  <br>  Go to a library or a barnes and nobles or starbucks and strike up conversations|`|97e85b6fd730d5a0150fb9caefff2677aa	try untraditional places like the library or supermarket ?<br>  try taking up some other courses ?
qrtHvCk4aa	Let your friends know that you will still be there friends, but don't rub it in to the them that you are so much smarter then them. Just let them know that you are skipping a grade and that you still want to be there friends. If you tell them in a way that you are saying that you are so much smarter than them they yes they will be upset with you, but be casual about it. Hope this helps|`|qUbJbu64aa	they wont they will be happy for you that you got to skip. That is good that you get to do that, you should be happy for your self :)<br>  GOOD JOB|`|GZtdISjNaa	Oh come on, they'll only be mad if you ditch them.|`|NAXf31scaa	if there mad ignore them theyll get over it if there ur true frends they wood understand|`|1Rxcqggoaa	They shouldn't care if you skip a grade. It's really not your fault. If they are mad at you, the only reason they are is because they are jealous and they don't want you to make some older friends. I think that you should relax and talk to your friends about this; the sooner the better. You want to be the first person to tell them. If you aren't, then the chance of them getting mad is much, much higher.<br>  <br>  ---->Krissy?|`|WyCmQBuvaa	My friends were all dumb ax&^es and we are still friends 10 years ater graduating high school.  You aren't on a higher level socially.  You are on a higher level academically.  You might find yourself "socially challenged" with other freshmen.<br>  <br>  Your friends will be your friends if they are your friends in the first place.  The only reason that they will "terrorize" you is if you allow them to.  <br>  <br>  If you tell them you are socially higher than them, then that will work too.  Why are you hiding it?  They know you are smart and this should be something to be admired and proud of.  They should be happy for you.|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	damn your smart!<br>  do whats best for you and your carreer.<br>  if they are really your friends, they will encouarage you to go and do better for yourself, just let them know your not gonna forget about them. And make sure you tell them now because there gonna be more upset later.<br>  good luckk!
29I8PWrxaa	Whether it is tacky or not depends on your culture or where you live.  Some people would find it tacky while others would not.  Depends on whether it is acceptable in your family and friends circle or not.  If they have a sense of humour about it then "Money Money Money Money" could be funny, but others may take offense to it.  I won't call a dollar dance tacky because I've never seen one and am having a Stag and Doe which is kind of similar since it is meant to raise money for the bride and groom. Stag and Doe parties are common in my area, but others on here have told me it's tacky - which I disagree with.  People on here also think it's tacky to have a cash bar as opposed to open.  I think what is considered tacky totally depends on what is socially acceptable in your circle and if you've been to other weddings with a dollar dance, then I think it's safe to assume that it's accepted in your area.|`|QFCYfJ0caa	In my FH culture as the couple comes into the reception the family throws money on them. I thought it was weird / different the first  time i saw it, however in his family if you do not do it you are weird. I think it is cute that you want to do money, money, money. However I can see how some people would find it rude while others would find it funny adn i would err on the side of caution and advise you not to play that song. We are doing a song that is traditionally played in his culture so my family gets the point.|`|AA11312653	If you are from a culture where "The Money Dance" is traditional, then you already know what the traditional music is, already know how to fold paper money into flowers, bows, birds, and other whimsical shapes for this tradition. Your guests, being from the same culture, come prepared for the money dance and would be disappointed if they didn't have this opportunity to show off the clever folded money creations.<br>  <br>  If you are asking questions about what a money dance is and how to do it, then you obviously are not from such a culture. People invite GUESTS to their wedding party because they are so overjoyed at the event that they wish to share that joy with people they care about. To then "shake down" your guests for their pocket money cast doubt on the motive for giving the party. Did you invite these people because you care about them? Or in hopes of picking their pockets?<br>  <br>  I have been a guest and I have been a bride. In neither situation did I consider it acceptable to solicit cash during the festivities EXCEPT when at least one member is from a culture where there actually is a centuries old tradition of The Money Dance.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I think it's hilarious!  I'm personally planning on having the Beatles song "Money (that's what I want)" playing during our dollar dance.  Look, everyone knows that a dollar dance is kind of a tacky tradition, but it's tacky in a fun way!!  If people are going to get all uppity over shelling out a dollar for the privilege of dancing with the bride, then they need to chill.  It's obviously more of a fun way to make sure you dance with every guest than a cash grab.  Honestly, people need to lighten up!|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	you could do it a little differently, like have a "tip jar" placed in the middle of the dance floor, for just the one or two songs. Have everyone dance at the same time.<br>  You and your fiance should bust some moves and get "tips"<br>  play "Mony, Mony" by Billy Idol and make it really fun. Maybe then it won't seem tacky.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I didn't do the money dance. It can get really embarrassing if no one is coming to dance with you and besides in this economy I don't think it is fair to ask people for more money on top of the gift they already gave you.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	Hey I live in Az too!  lol<br>  <br>  I think it sounds fun.  I've read that its tacky a lot too, but weddings are expensive and people can use all the help they can get.   I think if the guests invited have a good sense of humor they will enjoy that song.  haha|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I didn't know what a dollar dance really was and reading Allis response, the whole thing sounds REALLY tacky. If you are going to do it, then do a tacky song, because no matter what its going to be that way.|`|ACecbVghaa	A Dallar Dance is tacky to start with so why stop there? Just hand your bills out to the guests and have them pay them right at the table...|`|o4NarYVoaa	um yes, very tacky!<br>  <br>  im pretty sure its supposed to be a slow dance kinda thing, so that would be redic|`|bSjbVxO2aa	Tacky song! <br>  <br>  Have a nice song playing while you have the money dance. <br>  <br>  The "money dance" originated as a custom in Poland, and is a popular tradition found celebrated in the weddings of today. It takes place sometime after the first dance and is usually announced by the DJ. It is customary for the best man to begin dancing with the bride, pinning money onto her gown or putting it into a satin bag carried by the bride, especially for the money dance.  A newer rendition of this money dance includes bridesmaids and other ladies dancing with the groom, pinning money on his lapel.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it is tacky, but seems they do it at every wedding.<br>  <br>  Added: Yes, I have been a bride, we did not do the money dance. Yes, I have been to weddings where they did it. <br>  <br>  It's like asking for more, I guess. We already brought a present to the wedding, now we have to make sure we have cash to give too?|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	it's tacky to have a dollar dance at all. isn't it enough that people pay for shower gifts AND wedding gifts for you?  and travel, hotel, new clothes, time off work, etc?  how much do you want greedy?|`|hkwBR1moaa	Here's my opinion.  Mone Dances are quite a common thing around where I'm from.  People expect it and don't think it's rude.  The people on here who do think it is rude, may not be from an area or culture where it's common.  My fiance and I are having one.  We really had to sit down and think about this because he lives in another area and it's not a common thing.  So we didn't know whether his family would think it's inappropriate.  We decided on having one because in my city and with my family, it's expected and I think it's kind of fun.  <br>  Playing Money Money Money is not tacky if your guests know it';s a money dance and know that giving money is expected.  I say go for it!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	oh wow, that is tacky.<br>  <br>   it is rude to ask for money for a wedding in any form.  the only time the dollar dance is acceptable is if you are from a culture that practices it as part of your cultural heritige.  the dollar dance is not traditionally american.<br>  <br>  if your not from a culture that does it then it seems like a shakedown, especially with that song playing. it makes it seem like all you care about is the money|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Most people find the dollar dance to be tacky anyways...<br>  <br>  ADDED:  Speaking as a Bride and a Guest.<br>  <br>  I did not want it at my wedding.  But a few guests talked the DJ into suprising us with it.  It's NOT a tradition in my family, but it IS a tradition in my hubby's family.  I felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable the entire time.<br>  <br>  As a guest, I NEVER participate.  I already bought a nice gift.|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	I don't think the dollar dance is tacky because i understand that for some cultures it is actually tradition.  If you think your guest have a good sense of humor then definitely have it if not go for another song. <br>  good luck and congratulations|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	it depends on what kind of sense of humor your guests have.<br>  <br>  it could be really funny or it could be very tacky and offensive.
H7UphlLCaa	she isn't used to being single after being with you for 2 years.  she'll probably keep all the loveyness up for a while until she finds other guys to date and fill the void. then she'll quit talking to you all together.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Well, first what do you want?  Do you want her back full time as your full time girlfriend?  Not just a friend with benefits?  If that's the case, start now by being honest.  You said you two lied to each other in the past.  Tell her, "Look, I'm being honest with you when I say I want you back.  I know we both lied in the past but I'm changing that for my own sake.  I think we could be good together again but I need honesty from you now as to what you want."  You're going to have to put your heart on your sleeve one more time.  But at least you'll know the answer and then you can either work on it together or you can move on knowing you've learned your lesson.|`|29hcn9JRaa	This isn't a relationship that is friends with benefits, versus more so a relationship that is based on convenience and familiarity, many people tend to get this mixed up. If you define what a friend is, it is not someone who you have sex with, don't know about you, but I don't have sex with my friends? Moving onto the term benefits, benefits is when you are getting more from something then you expected, kinda like a bonus prize, so if you want to call getting sex a benefit, then so be it. I am not a marital therapist, nor a couples counselor, however I do have years of experience in relationships, and have endured many so called friends with benefits relationships, and it took me many years to understand that by me calling it a friends with benefits was just me trying to justify my actions, and it was just me trying to hang onto what little was left of a failing relationship. Truth of the matter, you are both trying to hang onto what is left over, it is kinda like comparing fresh homemade pizza that you can eat hot out of the oven, to cold pizza that has been sitting in your fridge for a week or two? At one time the pizza was fresh and tasted great, however after a few weeks you look at that cold left over pizza and think, should I eat it? It looks edible and may still be good, many people would throw it out, however you don't want to waste what was at one time a good thing, so you eat it, and while it still has some taste to it, and while it isn't going to kill ya, it simply isn't the same. It will never again be the same for you, it can't be, as you both have basically ran this relationship into the ground, so my advise is, you cant move forward by continuing to step back, so stop stepping back and let this girl go.|`|AA11783622	You both must just Luuuuuvvvveeeee pain... <br>  <br>  This kind of stuff is like picking at at wound that is trying to form a scab, but you both just love  to bleed.<br>  <br>  Hon, move on.

3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I have never heard of a wedding watch. If you were in agreement, then that would be one thing, but it seems like you shelved your feelings in an effort to spare his. You had a huge communication problem right from the get go, and that may have been one of the factors that doomed your marriage from the start(aside from the apparent infidelity you mention). You hiding what you felt in order to make him feel better. You put yourself on the back burner. I think at this point I would be glad I only wasted 5 more years on him. He is or will be someone else's problem now....Hind sight is always 20/20. At the time you just thought maybe you were acting too traditional so you kept your mouth shut, now  you see that it was a warning of what was to come. Now you know to better trust your judgment and to not sacrifice something you deem important to spare others...|`|7a2e4d4207a92f423c9e8649aceaf762aa	Of course it was a warning sign, that should have told you that he did not want anyone to know that he was married. His your ex, so move on but don't make the same mistakes you did with your ex, learn from this and be a smarter women.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Nobody knows that a rolex symbolizes marriage, but they definitely know that a wedding band does.  Yes, I think this definitely was a warning sign and a very clear one.  He wasn't ready to "announce to the world" that he was married.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	if i was gonna go to a sleezy bar after work to pick up some skanky ho, i'd defiantly want the Rolex.  <br>  do i need to be more clear here?|`|L2W8CdOMaa	I dont think the whole wedding watch and band thing was significant... Some men just have preferences. But you should request your money back.|`|BUET39wmaa	who gives a $hit about what he did now?  you are rid of him for obvious reasons.|`|8txWayVnaa	A wedding watch?  I don't think so.  Yes a Rolex is a status symbol--a symbol of wealth.  A wedding ring is a status symbol also--a symbol that a person is MARRIED.
oQcDZI9Daa	When you've had the exclusivity conversation.<br>  When you both agree that you will not see other people.<br>  <br>  Some guys will make it clear that you two are in a relationship, but others are harder to read.  So if you're with one of those guys who just assumes you're together, you might want to ask.  It would be horrible to think someone is your boyfriend (and even telling friends) and then finding out that he's dating other girls.<br>  <br>  Luckily for me, my boyfriend asked me, "So, we're making this official, right?" on our very first date (I've known him for years) and now we're happily together and getting married this summer.  :]|`|ofYuuTdZaa	-when u come over to his place, meet his parents and ur introduced as THE GIRLFRIEND.<br>  -when all his friends know ur his girl, and when u meet him he says this is my girlfriend instead of sayin this is a friend or just sayin ur name!<br>  -he likes to take u with wherever he goes<br>  --------then it should be pretty official!<br>  <br>  + ofcourse all the sweet and cute stuff guys should do when u have a relationship, already read some good ones here!|`|zqd71kflaa	Depending on the guy and what kind of girl you are. If you have slept with him. More then likely you are Official. Or you are always to gather, He tels you every where he goes, what he is doing. Most of the time you can just tell. You don't really need to have the talk. And in most cases if you need to ask. More then likely you are not.|`|7epLNsB5aa	when he asks to do it in your boo boo.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	When he marries you.  <br>  Up until then, the common thing is for boys (not men) to tell you what he wants you to know.|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	Well from what I've seen it doesn't just magically happen...usually "the talk" occurs. Other things could be when he introduces you as his girlfriend to his friends and family. That is the biggest indicator.

T5xhSEK2aa	Wow, that sounds exactly like what I went through a few years back. Hmm.. I didn't like what I did in the end and so I'll advise you according to what I regret not doing. <br>  <br>  Tell him that you only see him as a friend. However, because you've been friends for so long already, you are willing to give you two a try. So you'll have like a one week trial relationship. And by the end of it, trust me, you both will have different opinions from currently. <br>  <br>  If you still feel that you can only see him as a friend, then just say that you wish to just be just friends and keep in contact, because you can always say that at least you gave him a chance and that you actually tried. (:<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|AA11576516	Well to start off there is nothing wrong with two good friends going out together but before you agree to go out with him just tell him that you don't have feelings for him except as friends, that should save his feelings and give you both a chance to make sure of your feelings.

YOu going to ask him out on a date and pay for it?  Try just talking to him, and acting like a girl.  dont be all bold and come up to him like that.  You will scare the boy away.|`|3yWAyps4aa	no just shy away and never talk to him, by the way its this not dis.<br>  what age are you?

f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	yes it is possible to share too much.<br>  <br>  your GF is either very young and inexperienced, very immature, or very selfish.<br>  <br>  Relationships are not about emotional dumping at all. and yes there is an appropriate time to discuss certain things.  You don't discuss your sex life in public in ear shot of others or at dinner with your folks.  You don't discuss your problems in the bedroom in the bedroom.  You don't create a scene in public that embarrasses your partner.<br>  <br>  Women process things by talking them out.  it helps us to sort our emotions and thoughts on a subject so we can think clearly about what is going on.  Is this what she is doing?<br>  <br>  Or is she afraid of silence and she is just filling space (man that's really annoying).<br>  <br>  It's time for you to do an emotional dump then and find out what's going on with her and to let her know that she is overwhelming you.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	A relationship revolves around communication.

He knew that I wanted to wait until I was 16 and was fine with this, because he loves and respects me. I made sure that I was 100% ready before sex, and until I knew that he was the right person. For me this meant going out with him for a year before sex, for you this could mean anything. Don't set a time limit, just wait until it feels right and you are both ready to take this step further. How ever long it is, although this sounds cheesy, it's true, he will wait if he loves you. Hope this helps :)|`|xjv02joXaa	Statistics show that it is the best to wat until you are married. That way a commitment is being made. Trust me...we are all human, this may seem like fun now but it will come back and bite you in the but. Eventually when you do get married, deep down inside you'll wish that both you and your partner would have saved yourselves.

I believe when you have sex early in a relationship that is what the relationship is really based on sex even though it doesn't seem like it. you should always wait a couple months or more just so you can see how you feel about that person and that way the feelings will be more emotional than physical.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	i've been with my fiancee for four years and haven't had sex.  <br>  <br>  no one else can tell you when is a good time.  you have to decide for yourself, and only you and your partner can determine when the right time is.<br>  <br>  of course, all of this information assumes that you're of legal age and ready to accept the responsibility of parenthood if you should become pregnant.<br>  <br>  if you're underage, I'd recommend waiting.|`|dalNxu8zaa	its just really up to u on how long u wait...<br>  for me this guy and me are going to date once i get to texas and i already told him that i dont want to do it within two weeks of us dating cuz i want to know for sure that he is the one for me i want to wait 3-4 cuz that means we have been together awhile and i will be his longests relationship at 4 months....|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	When you are old enough and able to handle the potential consequences.
e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	When I like someone and I'm really into her, she will be on my mind constantly. Wondering what she's doing, if she's okay and if she thinks of me too.  Sure, you will be on his mind if you shared a "magical night".  He's gonna want more of it.  Just be careful you don't get addicted to the feeling.  Watch your moods before you get preoccupied and obsess about it.  Getting too attached could ruin it.|`|nogoUTDXaa	It depends on the individual person.<br>  <br>  At the moment I'm completely in love with a girl and I think about her all the time. I wish it didn't consume so much of my thoughts but I can't help it. <br>  <br>  I'm not even sure she likes me "in that way" but even if she did I doubt she'd think about me as much as I think about her. I really do get quite obsessive.<br>  <br>  So yeah it works both ways as my own experience shows but don't naturally assume that he thinks about you just as much/more than you think about him because it doesn't mean it's the case. Some people are less obsessive and can be completely in love and not have it drastically effect their lives and what they think about like with some of us.|`|65ojSBXgaa	I dont see why not.

rpVQpJA7aa	Honestly I think that you would have a difficult time properly serving customers with a bridal dress on. You need to be able to help THEM get into their dresses, etc. I think they would be confused and feel awkward if you were in a dress. You need to express these concerns to her!|`|03555ca7c8d3dbff23aa5b5369e97e7baa	First check into your local labor  laws before you tell her you would prefer to dress like a bloke.  Secondly remember that most of your clients coming into the shop are people with traditional views about marriage (man and woman) I would assume.   <br>  <br>  My opinion is that it would be disarming to walk in and see a sales clerk in a wedding dress, I would not take the business seriously.  <br>  <br>  Why dont you suggest that everyone dress as professionally vs themed.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, I like slacks and a top much better than dresses too.|`|1Na7uSiXaa	No wearing the dress that the bride might want to buy might lose you a sale.  I would instead wear a nice pants suit.  It will make you feel better and you would sell more dresses for her because you will feel better. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|qrORzq3Aaa	oooh thats a toughie<br>  <br>  good luck with that lol x|`|BUET39wmaa	it's just a job. it's not your personal identity.<br>  you are obviously a girl and I think customers may be a little put off if you were dressed as a man?|`|B1GjfOUdaa	I think I might just be looking for a new employer.|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	Frankly, I don't see how a salesperson working in a wedding shop (bridal store here in the States) wearing a wedding dress can put customers in any more of a wedding spirit than the customer is already in (unless you have never seen a bridezilla).<br>  <br>  Wedding dresses are expensive and I fail to see the reason your employer would risk that expense to have you wear one, plus most wedding gowns are huge; it would look like the store is full of marshmaloows.<br>  <br>  Instead of wearing blokey (I assume it would be like a tuxedo) outfit, my personal favorite was always a simple pantsuit so you can move around the brides, assorted family members, piles of poofy dresses and piles of bridal magazines. <br>  <br>  Your employer can sack (fire) you, maybe, if wearing clothes from the store was part of the employment, or if your preferred style is not as classic or neat.|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	i would ask- tell her girls trying on dresses don't want to see other girls in dresses. (esp. if you look better than they do) A B2B wants to feel special like she is the ONLY bride. <br>  Having you dress up will only take away from her experience.<br>  Dressing up as a groom however, could be a help. Posing and telling her how great she will look... see? (stand with her in the mirror, offer your arm, etc) It could also give her ideas on what she might want her groom to look like/wear, helping you sell more items other than the dress. I would also think wearing a wedding gown yourself could hinder you physically from helping her and could possibly end up ruining dresses.|`|3WQOa4sraa	just explain this point<br>  <br>  customers (bride to be) will already be in the wedding spirit, they are in a round full of gowns.<br>  <br>  it would be difficult to move about freely and help the bride changing in the dressing room etc <br>  <br>  personally if the staff in a bridal store were running around in bridal wear I would honestly be put of and it comes across as desperate <br>  <br>  you should just wear a comfortable business smart suit or clothing, maybe you could model jewelery (necklaces, bracelets, broach) or a small tiara etc but not a gown.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Roosh - you have issues with serving out stereotypes.  Pathetic.
39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	gee, and you think that having 3 kids with someone else might not have something to do with the intimacy issues?<br>  <br>  i'm going to say this once and for all.  star signs have nothing to do with anything.  seriously.  he has an emotional handicap that prevents him from opening up to you.<br>  <br>  of course he's holding back.  you are the mother of 3 kids with someone else.  maybe he's afraid you don't want more.  maybe he wishes they were his, who knows.  the point is, it's natural for him to be withdrawn for a while.  give him a chance to get comfortable with the situation again.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Your zodiac signs don't have anything to do with it. There are a couple of reasons he isn't opening up. One is that you dumped him for another guy. The other is that he is a man. Expressing feelings is more of a woman and child thing. The fact that grown men don't generally do it isn't wrong or bad. It isn't something that needs to change. Live with it or don't but you it isn't fair or reasonable of you to think you can make him spill his guts.
pcLOOgyqaa	it depends on what kind of stress. sometimes stress is useful also u r to chanelise this energy in the positive direction and this will help u in improving ur performance.|`|cB2VGhLgaa	It depends on the situation. Sometimes situations can be so overwhelming we don't know what to do and we freak out. If your in a stressful situation, take a minute to yourself and breathe. Think about what's going on in the stressful situation and calmly and reasonably think of a solution.|`|N4ZAzxdMaa	Staying calm is necessary in stressful situations. Whether you are at home or in public, keeping your head about you while you're under stress will prevent you and others from being injured or getting into trouble. This may not be easy by any stretch, but your ability to take control of a situation and keep control will work to your advantage.|`|LJDiSCCNaa	I think of if what is happening will matter in 10 years. If it does, what will be the aspects that I will have to deal with?<br>  <br>  Most of the time we stress ourselves out over things that don't even exist yet, things that have only a possibility.

DWwv3v9Raa	Yes my ex cheated on me several times, I was young & thought no one else would want me so I continued to accept if for the entire relationship that lasted 8yrs. <br>  <br>  After we broke up she tried to get back with me but, we lost contact for about 20yrs. She looked me up b/c I'm on the same job I was on when we broke up and after 20+ years she wanted to get back together. She said she was young and foolish and didn't realize what a good thing she had and her life has been miserable.<br>  <br>  My current partner has never cheated and we,ve been together for 20+ years. I would never cheat on my partner because I know how hurt you feel when it's done to you.|`|W5CLaQgWaa	1) If they cheat once they will do again and again.<br>  2) If you are not man or woman enough for them; then why would they want to be with you?<br>  3) In this day and age there is no telling what they can bring back!|`|GA8uInKDaa	Yeah. I did. But i did not trust him and i was paranoid|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	No, I haven't and I never would.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	I've never cheated, but have been a victim of cheating many of times. In the past, I never took back the cheater. I think you really need to think things through like whether you can ever trust the person again and believe that they wont do it again. I agree with your video that people make mistakes and forgiving isnt always easy, but its an ability I wish among everyone. If you love the person and truly believe in your heart that you can forgive than I think you've given yourself enough reason to think that the person is infact worthy of another chance. I wouldnt cheat, but hypothetically speaking, if the role reversed would you want and deserve another chance? Think of it that way in terms of the cheater.|`|7ce29aaaa2e67395ec835e75e3a79530aa	yes, and I will never do it again!

Err.. NO.|`|AA11447210	No, none. If you can't be honest about it then you shouldn't do it. It's something only selfish people without a conscience do.|`|Z51fjE2Raa	No one has a good enough excuse for cheating.<br>  <br>  I think for revenge you should break up first... and then cause havoc.<br>  <br>  But keeping yourself in a rotten relationship is not going to do you or your partner any goodness.<br>  <br>  It tears up families, ruins future possible relationships, and when children find out about their parents histories it hurts them. It hurts them incredibly- personal experience.<br>  <br>  I think the difference between animals and people is 'conscience and awareness' - People should know the morals on the debate of cheating... and we should be able to control our instincts- otherwise I think it is pretty fair to call that person an animal.|`|AA10517807	none, unless you don't like whoever you are dating,<br>  or you are trying to get back at your boyfriend/girlfriend and you are trying to get back at them i guess that could be an excuse but  why will you resource to that ?<br>  why ?|`|dalNxu8zaa	there are no good reason for cheating at all...<br>  its never right and in the end it hurts everyone|`|7ce29aaaa2e67395ec835e75e3a79530aa	no!|`|8Vz9JF7paa	prob not exactly answering the question but to put another spin on it... what I find funny is that we as a society generally think that in a relationship cheating is the worst thing you can do... I just think its funny that we need to be in an exclusive relationship and the world will end if someone cheats... I guess im curious as to why we have to have only one person... why not be in a relationship with a few people? lol <br>  <br>  I just don't know why its such a big deal... I guess as humans its human nature to want to find that "one" person... me ill be happy if I go through life be happy within myself and I really don't feel the urge to find that "one" person.. as much as I love my girlfriend and I want to be with her... i don't see her "completing" me or being my other half... i think I have come to the conclusion that we as humans feel the need to have a life partner because we need a witness to our lives...I mean if we die and no one was there to share our lives what do we count??? did we matter at all??... If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" <br>  <br>  ok totally off track but my short answer to your question is.... no its not ok if your partner believes your exclusive because your being deceptive... not ok :) lol|`|VlOPAGE6aa	I don't think there is any justifiable excuse for cheatin cos wat is wrong is wrong, no excuse can make it look or seem right
gRXy66dOaa	Its really easy to talk to guys. Heres are some tips.<br>  <br>  Smile. Smiling is contagious. <br>  <br>  Approach him. Don't run up to him...just casually get closer to him and be friendly. Start out with a simple greeting. <br>  <br>  Take a deep breath before you talk to him. Seems pointless, but it does help calm the nerves! <br>  <br>  Joke and be fun, but don't try too hard, or you'll make a fool out of yourself. Just act like he's your friend. <br>  <br>  Don't act weird and laugh at everything the guy says (nobody likes that). <br>  <br>  Make eye contact. Sure, it may be scary, but this will help him know how you feel. Make sure you are smiling while you do it, and do not do it for too long. It's not a staring contest. Just a quick look. <br>  <br>  Be nice to him; guys don't like it if you are mean. Be pleasant and don't pick at him. <br>  <br>  Be yourself.Don't pretend to be someone you are not for the guy. <br>  If you are out with a group, make sure you also talk to your other friends. He may find it uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  He should do some of the chasing too...guys enjoy a challenge, so don't make it too easy to be with you, but don't make it too hard. Just... casual. <br>  <br>  Remember, you are an awesome girl, who will make an awesome guy be proud being with you. If you are rejected, do not be upset, just move on. <br>  <br>  Try asking him if he knows someone you do know. It's a simple thing, and fairly easy to do if you sum up the courage. Try to bend it into a light conversation, but don't make it to obvious. If he seems uninterested, back off. <br>  <br>  Think about what you want to say to him before you talk to him, practice your expressions and sentences to mold it into a friendly manner. <br>  <br>  Gently brush his arm or something while passing, not too hard but just like it was an accident, it'll get him thinking. Try brushing off pretend fuzz or picking off a pretend hair, make him comfortable with contact gradually. <br>  <br>  Try to laugh cute, (most guys love it when girls giggle and laugh cute). But remember not to laugh at everything and anything he says. It'll annoy him <br>  <br>  Don't annoy him. It is a possible way that he won't want to talk to you anymore

hv6pZkb8aa	This sounds like a story in a book i read today on yahoo answers!  Anyway the ending turned out to be that the two girls were actually the same girl but one was the good one and the other an evil cyborg sent by the evil lord of the dark skies above to destroy the earth and part of the moon.  Well the conclusion was very dramatic, but unfortunately i had a page load error and then i had to restart windows (by no means is this an attack on the windows operating system, I personally believe it is the best one in the contiguous 48 states) so I didn't get to finish the story.  But here is my advice to you, i think that is the 3rd most evil thing anyone could say behind, "you're gonna wear that" and "you're parents are dead, big deal".  Now here is the part that you have been waiting for (if you have read this long it really is a miracle) what should you do.  Well I guess i have a question, do you know where this person lives? If you do then i think that you need to sign them up for a bunch of junk mail. They will become inundated with mail and won't be able to leave their house because they will be sorting through all of it.  If you don't know where this person lives i would starting asking around to find out.  Try the postman, he is creepy like that.  If you have not figured out this is meant to be a humorous response to a serious question about the intricacies of friendship then i have failed my country and must return to my home planet of Senegal.  Dear lord, i hope no one is still reading this.|`|AA11227341	not sure what is going on with sammy--a  sex thing or drug use or an older guy but to just sit there and see her get hurt is not what friends do.

" are you ready to make the right choice and be free of the hurt?" and ask her if she would like to see the school counselor.  but don't just sit there,  Have you ever heard this  a friend in need is a friend in deed?

She cares too much about you to let you throw things away, opportunities, a future, hard work.  So she keeps on you.  You have no life because she is preparing you for life.

fdnghXGXaa	Only you know the real answer in what to do in your situation.  Anyone can give advice but in the end it's your mental stability and happiness that counts. Does she have trust issues with you?  If so why? Being in a relationship with someone that has trust issues can be hard and challenging...the real question is can you continue to be with someone who has those attributes?  Also, what does “kind of” mean? Either you are tired of the situation or you are not, again only you know the real answer.  When keeping it real with “your self” there is no need to seek the advice of others.  I wish you well and hope this works out in your favor.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	You went out of your way to help her out and that's how she shows you gratitude?

OFJFLs2Paa	Well the thing that you need to do here is go with him to them things and show them girls that he is all yours and they can't have him! If you don't do that then they will try and get with him and flirt with him and you know how guys are they can't help themselves when girls do that to them. They think that they are a big shot and they don't need you. If you can't go with him to them things and you know deep down that he is doing something with them then most likely he is. So don't let him do this to you, you are going to have to move on if you don't want to move on then the only thing that I can say is you are going to be upset the rest of your life just because you don't want to go with him. Also if he is not wanting you to go with him for whatever reason then that means that he is trying to hide something from you and you need to find out what that something is. Good Luck and I hope that he is not trying to cheat on you or anything like. That and I am sorry if I was rude in my answer or something that I said to you made you a little upset. Have a nice day! =D

AA11958479	He is not that much younger than you. The age difference only matters in cases of legalities otherwise age isnt a problem. <br>  <br>  It can be a problem if you make it one by your expectations. I wouldnt expect a certain level of maturity or anything. you should never enter a relationship with expectations of how someone should behave or act.|`|c87f27f0437532e03040d093f68f1231aa	I don't think that age difference should be a big deal when you know how to deal with it... if you have the same interest and can hold a good conversation then its worth a shot.. keep in mind that you have probably experienced things he hasn't and if it becomes a long term relationship you have to deal with some things he still needs to mature in..... overall getting to know him doesn't hurt|`|zGZe0mt8aa	i don't have any experience about dating younger guy  but if you really like him you can just be his friend or wait maybe you will upset him if you ask him to be your bf.<br>  it doesn't matter you can just keep in touch and we don't know about yesterday, maybe he has a crush on you too.<br>  good like.|`|9uI3hvGdaa	I don't think it's a big deal if you just want to go out and have some fun.  If you're looking to get married, then yes, he's too young.  Go out, have fun, enjoy each other's company.  You'll know soon enough if the age difference it too much.  Just take it slow.|`|7FRbSpt5aa	aww thats cute<br>  but it sounds werid when you say the ages but thats because for many years its always shown or said men are older women are younger<br>  i dont think that shoul dmatter cause after all if your enjoying your time with him and hes enjoying his time with you whats the number of age really matter<br>  right?|`|pHUsumU7aa	just do it and quit pondering. it'll be good for you and him. If it doesn't work out, then it was just a fling. It's to better to love and lost, than never loved at all right?<br>  at least give it a chance.|`|PVsKQAVEaa	remember this, AGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LOVE. allot of people may give you excuses on why its not right, but as long as there is LOVE then it shouldent matter.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	At your age, 5 years is not a big thing.  Now when your 65, 5 years is a big difference.  But then again, that could be a good thing because he could go get your walker.<br>  Now, didn't that sound stupid - 5 years is nothing at any age.  But I do agree, it sucks you can't go out and have drinks but you can stay in and have drinks.

(i was just a zit faced fraternity clown at the time).   so after a while,  she talked about how she's gonna support me through the school, marriage etc etc..  mind you, i was 19 going on 'Animal house'.  i dumped her for some big breasted airhead.|`|utTClFauaa	I think 5 years is a big difference only because we're so young.  Each year makes a huge difference in maturity levels. If he is mature beyond his years and it fits what you're looking for, but expect for a lot of people (including your friends) to not think too highly of it.<br>  <br>  I'm currently dating a guy that's one year younger than me (I'm 18) and it's not too bad. But because he's the younger GUY, a lot of his friends think it's kind of weird.<br>  <br>  Whatever the case, I think you shouldn't care what other people think and if he's a great guy, go for it!|`|wGMabky2aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  I hope my answer makes sence. I think in the end it is your choice wether to persue or not, but keep in mind a couple of factors. 1st of all he is younger which means he is maturing slower than you...he is 18 and just got out of high school, he is still in that age where partying and flirting and going with girls is important and a big part of his life. He is at the age where he just wants to have fun, since he is only 18. Also since he is maturing slower than you (because men mature slower than women) plus add the age difference, you have a dilema. What you think might be a mature and adult relationship for him its just another high school crush...just take in consideration that if you do date this guy, it will be a lot of work, because he is going to need alot of growing up to do, and ask yourself if you are willing to be the "mommy" during that! <br>  <br>  hope that helps!<br>  <br>  Ana|`|8j7FCEOraa	Maybe, I mean he Just got out of highschool for goodness sake.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	yes and it was great|`|krQiDGCHaa	My husband and I have a 5 year age difference.  I'm younger than him, but I don't really see what the age difference matters any.<br>  <br>  If you're in love, you're in love.  That's all their is to it.  I see nothing wrong with you being older than him.  Think, when you're 55 and he's 50 it won't see like such a big difference at all, will it?<br>  <br>  Good luck with him. :)|`|7a2e4d4207a92f423c9e8649aceaf762aa	There is only a 5 year difference, i would date him if i were you, and who cares what people think as long as both of you are happy with it.|`|9163f6723559c34dd8054736b04c9f39aa	I've never dated a younger guy but I've always dated older women.  4 years may seem like a lot right now but as you both get older it matters less.|`|OfBG0jNjaa	When I was 20 I dated a girl who was 28.  So, no.
mVgY2I2Zaa	hey! no one can judge you, even if they do, you shouldn't care.<br>  ja, go for it|`|HaHPnNp3aa	Depends on how comfortable you are with it. So do you ever go to the bar and have an occasional drink? That would be the only diffrence I see is he can't buy alcohol and you can. You both are adults as long as you see it that way and are comfortable with him being 18 then go for it. If you see it not working or you feel uncomfortable about it then just be friends...|`|fecUjSr1aa	if you don't mind (i'm a guy) ...<br>  <br>  a lot of young guys fancy an older woman (girl - whatever) there's something that a young man finds very attractive. older ones are more mature, find sexy, find alluring .. its like a magnetic pull. <br>  <br>  so if age doesn't bother you and your friends, his friends are ok with it .. age is just a number .. <br>  <br>  good luck, girl ..|`|DozD8lTGaa	Well he is 18... he's an adult. depends on how young he looks though. but, it's not a big age gap. i could understand if he was 17.<br>  <br>  it doesn't matter what people think as long as you both have feelings for each other :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i hope i helped. x|`|dw440Lylaa	What's the problem?<br>  <br>  Few would freak if HE were 23 and you were 18, so why is the reverse somehow wrong?<br>  <br>  I've dated older women, is that the same as dating younger guys?<br>  <br>  <br>  Go for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|BO4XrMPAaa	boo, boys are already wayy more immature than girls.<br>  its not going to go very well|`|6aaCfPJiaa	nope|`|FgdJpfiVaa	nope|`|hbpIWYuzaa	no the age difference is not to much, he's grown and your grown if you;ll decide to be together that you'll choice and nobody else's and if anybody have a problem tell them to mind there own Business|`|n9Uu7l44aa	girl, younger guys do not know what they want yet and considering the fact that he's still a teenager makes it 10x's worse. he's only gonna be with you prob bkuz you can support him and he prob likes the fact that you are older but other than being in a long term relationship i really dont think it'll work. he's prob gonna cheat within the 1st month... thats just my opinion.|`|QttAOneaaa	There is absolutly never a reason you shouldn't pursue someone you might have a chance with. so what if hes a little younger? What if he turned out to be the perfect guy? Do you really want to give that up just because of a mere 5 age difference?? I think that you should definitly go for it! Good luck :)|`|32uLNYX1aa	i say if you like him that much go for it_ u never know what u could be missing- you mold him with your life experience on how to be the man you want him to be. The age shouldn't be a problem- when ur a 100 he will be 95 what the difference? ur both old by then|`|s2Aq96pIaa	You call that a difference in age. No problems. dont worry about it.<br>  keep with him if you love him|`|2G8n0q15aa	Yeah i'm dating one right now and the sex homegirl is banging!|`|Lc9KCnkoaa	i dont think so now but when you get older..just think|`|GYnmDVflaa	find someone ur own age hunny|`|qDKZhrqRaa	Oh yeah, definitely too young (you'll find out the hard way porbable, just like one of my girls thats a friend did, and I told her the same thing as you, she just had to learn the hard way). Let it be known, most people under the age of 23 have little experience dealing with relationships and others emotions effectively. In addition, Females mentalities of the same age for instance 21female, and 21male are more developed (or mature) by a few more years. This is way women traditionally, and innately go after mean older than they are (usually3-5 years older than they are).|`|xiV6THQDaa	Girl, do what makes YOU happy. Don't worry about what others will think. If you think he'll treat you right and he's mature enough, go for it. Look at Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore..that's just one example. You'll never know if it can work out until you try it...and it's legal so go for it. Might have problems if you two wanna go to certain places 21 and over....hehe...but whatever, you do what YOU want to do.|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, Why not?  Who do you have to answer to?<br>  If you get on well the small age gap shouldn't make any difference!<br>  Why not go with the flow, it's not illegal, so just go for it, what's the worst thing that can happen?<br>  My Mother was 4 years older than my Dad they were together for over 50 years until he died.  So just go for it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|BUET39wmaa	do what you want but PLEASE don't go and get married or something stupid|`|ns1F0p8Laa	I've never really been the type to date younger guys but the guy I am with now is less maturer then my daughter so in other words less in age doesn't make a person immature.  I am only 21 years old and I am more mature then most of my aunts.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	I've never dated a younger guy, but I know of woman that did. It didn't work out for them because as you say the age difference is to great. If he was older and knew what he wanted, then it wouldn't be so bad, but he really hasn't had a chance to live. He's not even old enough to buy his own beer.  I say talk and have a friendship, you never have to many friends.|`|abx5VNsOaa	You could be letting an opportunity of a lifetime slip through fingers based on a stupid notion that older women can't go out with younger men.If it makes you happy,it can't be all bad!!<br>  Not actually gone out with anyone younger than me , i would not rule it out.|`|AA11502346	Since you guys are both legal adults, then why not go for it?|`|pJ7icz0taa	Yes, I dated a guy for 6 years 2 years younger  and OMG  as it went on he became so immature and he wanted a Mommy.  Now 5 years old is way too young.. you have nothing in common and all he will learn from you is about sex. Then you wonder why he will dump you later on for some young girl that he has been seeing behind your back.<br>  See I was smart and finally dumped my guy because he was a kid and he thought he had a hottie.  What a waste he was.  Stop it NOW>  You sound like the school teacher hitting on a young kid.
JIhj7w7Zaa	dont do anything with either, if they are best friends then someone will definitely get hurt, is it really worth it<br>  and you will never be able to go back to how it was
bhNaTYjOaa	Both|`|lrul1Yyjaa	unfortunately, this is a long term training issue.<br>  I think you may have let him get away with too much for too long.<br>  <br>  but, it's never too late to teach an old dog new tricks. And in dog training every action carries a reward.<br>  For example, you want him to go shopping with you? take him shopping, and when you get back prepare a nice lunch for him.<br>  <br>  Next time he will associate shopping with that rewarding feeling.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you never know, it may just work.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Peace, one love.|`|Yz981zO6aa	Go and relax and drink a pint with him...he is away working all week and you two need some time together. Perhaps if you share his recreational activity, he will be more likely to share yours. And...find some things to do with yourself during the week besides housework. There must be something, and you do have the internet as you are on it right now. Good luck!!|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Aww I understand how you feel.  Your hubby is away all week and you only see him when he comes home and you just want a bit of attention.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately he has been working away and all he wants to do is to get back into his own home, couch and bed.  <br>  <br>  Compromise together.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	No, you are being totally reasonable.  A husband and wife should spend at least one night a week together at least. Perhaps you can compromise: Let him have Saturday for him, and spend Sunday as a couple.|`|noZurTOJaa	I agree with phil|`|GhZQGu9Maa	This sounds like a simple lack of interest and appreciation.  Men are like children and need to be praised for the smallest things if you want their good behavior to continue.  I know this can be ridiculous and annoying.  Make a list of the things he does that you appreciate and tell him at least one a day.  Sometimes to get a man to pay attention you have to grab his head and scream into his ear, but you must do it in a womanly way.  Change everything at once and without warning.  With proper planning, change the furniture arrangement around the entire house (even buy and sell furniture), your clothing, his clothing, your hairstyle, use new scents around the house, fix different meals than usual. You may need several weeks to plan this and recruit friends.  This would be a nice time to invite your family up.  They can help you!  Make sure you are gone when he gets home.  Stay out for hours.  Take in a movie, have your own pint at the pub!  Really enjoy yourself.  See if you can join a thai chi fan dancing class, or something interesting to you.  Join a club that will have you out at least once a week.  Meet him unexpectedly at the pub one night and live it up with him!  When he asks about all of these changes, simply laugh and tell him he's boring.  Leave it at that.  Refuse to engage any further.  Just walk away with a smile on your face, or change the subject.  Don't make yourself out to be the victim in this situation any more.  He doesn't respond to that.  The second time he asks, laugh and tell him you're getting so bored with him, you had to create your own fun.  Leave it at that.  Let him think about it.  The third time he asks, is when you plead your case!  You do this in a way that is strong and matter of fact.  Here is where you tell him what you expect of him.  You are the WIFE and the wife has some power in the situation!|`|crxbob5jaa	You are not thick and are not stupid. But you are definitely in a major rut!!! <br>  <br>  Maybe you should find some interests of your own and not depend on him for your entertainment. Cause you certainly aren't being considered by him. Volunteer at the library, hospital, local school or wherever. You'll meet other ladies that you will enjoy getting to know. And you will have interests that you enjoy. Or take lessons at the neighborhood center or college. Art lessons, photography lessons, fitness classes, writing classes, etc. Whatever interests you would bring you in touch with other people who have similar interests. And it would allow you activities and time away from home. Get involved!<br>  <br>  I have a friend whose husband flies in on Friday and out again Sunday. She's learned to take her entertainment into her own hands. She's become so busy with her life that her husband now has to ask for her to clean her schedule for a few hours together when he's home. It's rather amusing to me, and makes him appreciate her more.|`|sT0PImpcaa	You are what you are and maybe you are a little bit thick. You have mention it is life style problem so improve the life style a little bit by bit. You don't spend washing ironing and cooking just for him unless you don't eat or wear. During shopping, try shop together with him on what interest him, show him you care for him and are always interested and enjoying shopping with him. Stop fed up or he will be fed up as well. Pint with him and dry him, enjoy...|`|3ff395df049a38e5a87dc25da62f5a63aa	Are you kidding me?!?!<br>  <br>  What exactly does he expect you to be grateful for? its not the 1940's any more and women don't have to be "grateful" for a man just because he keeps a roof over your head!!! (I was with a man who thought that because he'd never been unfaithful to me and because he'd never hit me, that I should just be grateful. And, yes although he'd never done either of those things, he'd also never bothered to be grateful for all that i'd done for him: cooking, cleaning, keeping a lovely home, being emotionally supportive whenever he needed it, being nice to me or loving in ANY way.)<br>  <br>  Until one day recently I thought; Hang on a minute! What the hell am I wasting my time with this ungrateful pig for? And who the hell does he think he is expecting me to be grateful? Grateful for what? Not much, I can tell you!  So I left him.  Now this may not be an option for you, but what I can tell you is that it was the change that I needed in order to get more out of life. And i'm sorry, but I don't remember sigining up to be treated as a doormat at any point, do you? Yeah when you marry someone you agree to take them for better or for worse. But that deosn't mean that thats a free ticket to get treated like s**t your whle married life is it?<br>  <br>  Please don't put yourself down. You're not thick. A person is never thick becasue they have the goodness in their heart to be good to  someone else. And nor are they greedy for wanting some companionship. Its basic human nature for goodness sakes!!  (if we were meant to be solitary creatures, we wouldn't be blessed with the ability to communicate, would we, and we'd be able to breed like amoebas, rather than needing two parties?!)<br>  <br>  In my situation, once I'd left him, it took him a couple of months, but once he realised he'd lost me, it broke his heart, and I had all the tears and begging from him; "i'm so sorry. I can't beleive I never knew how lucky I was to have you. If only I could turn the clocks back...blah blah blah..." But I know for certain if I'd have stayed with him, he'd have never felt like that. Coz we were together for long enough so he had plenty of time to realize it while we were together!!! Its his loss, not mine.<br>  <br>  Now I realise that leaving might not be an option for you, because for many women its not. But please just consider this: You only get one shot at life. There's no second go. So Do you really want to spend your only chance bleeding yoursefl dry for someone who treats you like crap, & doesn't appreciate your efforts or your love? We all deserve happiness regardless of our personal situation and if he's making you unhappy then somethings got to give, hasn't it?<br>  <br>  If you ask me, it him who needs to be grateful, because if he was my husband I'd have left his sorry ungrateful **** for dust to fend for himself. He sounds like a complete pig. Why would you sacrifice yoursefl for someone like that? A beer swilling, grunting, selfish arrogant pig of a man. Even if he was the richest man in the world who provided you with every material luxuury in the universe you still don't have to be grateful for that. Money or a roof over your head means nothing and it certainly can't buy you happiness. I've been much much happier in a loving but financially poor relationship. When there is love, there is happiness, and happiness can get you through anything. when there isn't happiness, you could be surrounded by the most gorgeous things and it doesn't matter at all. So ask youresefl, why are you staying in this relationship? There is always another corner to turn. There is always another door to open. And, most importantly, THERE ARE OTHER MEN OUT THERE!! Men who genuinely Are nice and loving and won't treat you like muck. (Sure, they're a lot harder to find, but... Personally I'd rather live the rest of my life alone and happy than in a loveless relationship with an ungrateful and arrogant man who makes me feel so worthless. And thats exactly what I am doing. I'm so much happier not getting stressed/hurt over his constant put-downs and neglect) <br>  <br>  I wish you well. And please don't put yoursefl down any more. He's making you feel worthless. And the more he hears you saying stuff like "Am I thick or just plain stupid?"  the more he's going to treat you like that. Then you'll end up believing it.<br>  <br>  Lots of Love X|`|6HfscsALaa	HI Boudicca<br>  I do not believe that you are thick or stupid. It is obvious that your hubby misinterpreted what you said to him and saw it as an attack against him. Men usually take delight in working and providing for their families. It is an ego boost for them.<br>  Try sitting him down and apologize for possibly hurting his feelings. Tell him you appreciate him working so hard to support you. Then explain to him how you feel being at home all the time without much social interaction. Tell him that you need him to help you by taking you out. Men love to feel needed. Try this and see if it helps.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	You are not thick or stupid. Neither are you asking too much of him.<br>  What is the point of the two of you being married if you do nothing together?<br>  Get on his case until he makes an effort to spend time with you. If he doesn't then it might be time for you to find someone who will.|`|n7uoE9wmaa	Hmm, maybe you should think about a trial separation; you need a life of your own away from this selfish guy|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	It may have come as a bit of a shock to him and the abuse was just overreaction, give him a bit of time to mull it over, than ask him if you can spend an evening discussing it, ask him to think about it in the meantime so you can debate the pros and cons openly and come to a joint decision.|`|C3sqTngtaa	Guilt trip love you need to be firm and stand your ground! men are creatures of habit, god 4bid you wanna "change" them in anyway - you are perfectly in your right to want a partner that you can talk to, after all a relationship entails half and half!|`|AA10889612	Sounds more to that this; am I right? And does he ever take you out? Do you have a sex life? Hum thought not! More to the point does he have a sex life?|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	No, i don't think you're thick or stupid at all!<br>  <br>  It's obviously a difficult situation and when both of you have differing viewpoints, i can see exactly why you've come to blows.<br>  <br>  I know this is going to sound like a bit daft, but i think you need to make a time to sit down and talk, approaching things completely differently than you have before.<br>  <br>  Try to see things from each other point of view. Come to a compromise, says he comes shopping every other week, or even does it himself one week a month while you stay at home and read the paper (good luck with that!)<br>  <br>  I can see exactly why you are annoyed, but if you've got to sit down and talk it out calmly together, asking him what's really bothering him about it, and telling him calmly why it bothers you.<br>  <br>  If you don;t , it's only going to become a bigger problem for both of you<br>  <br>  Good luck dearie!<br>  x
FewhKlx9aa	1 reason men have affairs,wives aren't there for them.You have to keep your guy#1 in the relationship and this trip is like a minnie honeymoon.If the grandparents are willing to do what you say is keeping you behind then let them have them for the 5 days.What a great 40th party the two of you willl have and rekindle your romance that I'm sure has been put on the back burner with the kids . So go, have fun and don't feel guilty and don't worry about the kids they'll be fine.|`|BUET39wmaa	Listen.<br>  He is YOUR HUSBAND.  You have to stop feeling guilty about devoting some quality time to your marriage.  That is just as important as being there for your kids.  It's 2 days!!!  It will have NO affect on your kids in the long run and will have wonderful impact on your marriage.<br>  <br>  It's called investment.  He wants you there so you should make every effort to go.  Enjoy him!|`|bb95ecc88ba64fa50d71af69b4d4425eaa	Accept it, go! You have to trust your parents/in-laws. Make a list of your kids activities and explain clearly to them so that they won't miss their lessons. You should feel great & happy, bcos from here you let me know that you have a great & loving husband. Don't disappoint him. Hands in hands & start your journey happily enjoying the few days, exploring another new world outside your family home. (Temporary forget about household chores & kids - after all its just a few days.) When enjoy, feel free to enjoy! Good luck!|`|xQnkYyocaa	You sound like you need to get away for a couple of days too. Considering it sounds like you run you @ss off every day. It would be good for your children to have a break from their little hectic lives of school, practice, and games. I think it would be good for everyone if you had your "little" vacation. Go for it, and have fun!!|`|WD77MQqJaa	I would go. If you do not want to DUMP the kids on grandparents  Pay them. They will cost you less than a babysitter and you know you can trust them. Anyway you go about it I suggest you go I have a felling you would regret not going later. Go and have fun you kids will be fine.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Go, silly girl!!
eTYfa49Baa	I think that everyone in their life has gone through something where they think that life will just not go on without this person..... I feel like time is the only thing that wil heal things, and it will heal everything. you will always think about that someone, but you will be ok with it, and you will be stronger because of it!!! Eventually you will find that special someone who will make you feel like the best thing in the world, if someone ever gives you more heartache then happiness, its not worth it!|`|utNz9hv3aa	Sometimes I feel like I have, but life goes on and the thought that there will oneday be someone out there who loves me as much as I do them out there.|`|AA11447210	No. The human heart is pretty touch actually. Every relationship we're in helps us learn...learn about ourselves, learn about relationships, learn about people. <br>  <br>  There's no need for 1 person's behavior toward us to cause us to shut out everyone else (there are nearly 7 billion people on the planet). It's no fun to get hurt, but imnsho it's well worth the positives/joy when love does find it's way to us.<br>  <br>  I'll take the risk. I've been hurt before...I got over it and moved on. Not fun, but every relationship in the future has been better because of what I learned in the past.

H7UphlLCaa	if the doctor is a man, yes.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I think that is an unfair statement, it is just not doctors or men that fall into the world of affairs and cheating.  Just because he is around hot sexy nurses that want only to make their patients feel good, does not mean that he wants to assist them in their needs.  Now the security guy, now that is a different story.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I don't believe so.|`|krQiDGCHaa	There are also many sexy secretaries in offices.<br>  <br>  I don't think a profession makes someone more inclined to cheat.  I think their personality, their love and devotion to their spouse, their morals, and how seriously they took their vows determine whether or not they'll cheat.|`|IvMPh09baa	doctors, lawyers, fireman, policemen, all types of professions appeal to cheaters...|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Not all but it is known that they do.  Well, they have the money and all women are turned on by money.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Too much Lifetime on Sundays, apparently.|`|Z6auiyZkaa	I think there is a certain ego attached to being a doctor and i do think extreme admiration can make someone feel infalable and i say this from experience.<br>  <br>  But i dont think its just doctors i  think its professional ppl in general who are lead by ego who are inclined to cheat. Either way if its u thats with a doctor I do think that ur uneasy about this and why ??|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	no it's not true at all, nurses are no sexier than anyone else. Stop watching too many silly tv programmes.

wRHhpanmaa	lok your friend is looking out for you, and perhaps you should look more into his advice. He is right about your husband partying and putting you on a shelf and taking you down when he needs you for a moment. The reason he is  being so distant is perhaps he wants you as more than a friend. Perhaps he wants you for himself. Ultimately you have to make a decision. You are in this life to make ONE person happy, and that is you. if you are not happy, then you are going to have one miserable life. (well unless you have children you have to make them happy too) and think about if he is right. Can you see yourself down the road in thirty years with kids and your husband still doing things behind your back. Your friend just wants you see you happy, and is perhaps tired of seeing this guy walk all over you. think about all your husband did to you, and think about if going through his partying for the next thirty years is going to make you happy.|`|aErUKUvVaa	Cuz ur not listening to him.  Thats why he "ranted" on you. He tried to wake you up, and all you are worried about is "the other guy" instead of ur husband.  PAY ATTENTION - it doesnt cost anything.....|`|9tTeBy6waa	Are you happy with your marriage? I think your friend likes you, and doesn't wanna watch your hubby take advantage of you. Back off. Leave him be for a while. You also need to evaluate you situation and kick your man to the curb. No person should be in an unhappy marriage. Grow some balls and kick him out, or maybe you could attempt to spend more time with hubby by going out with him. Then you know what he's doing and you're not worried. You hubby is very disrespectful by going out all the time and acting like he is a single man. If that's what he want's give it to him, and keep the house. if that behavior continues from your hubby, I see you in 30 years married to your best friend.<br>  Good Luck Hun!|`|BwcySP8jaa	If he is doing anything gul it will come to the light what ever done in the  dark come to the light an it sound like that's the problem but you do the same he keep it up leave his ***. Most likely it be another female in the picture cuss when man are messing around other female makes them act that way. an again follow him put don't let him no you are that another way of catch in those warms cheating.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Seems that your friend is tired of his good friend get treated like crap.  He probably has been all ears sitting and letting you vent over and over again being the shoulder to cry on.  You friend kept doing this in hopes that one day you would wake up and blow up and tell your husband something.  Your friend is done being the guy on the sideline waiting for you to do something to end the misery that your going thru.  The comment "last I check your husband was name" that his way of telling you that maybe its your husband that you should be hounding and not him. He probably feels that with all this effort that your putting into getting him to talk to you should be put towards getting your husband ot understand how you feel.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Men are hard to read sometimes. They say 2 sentences and we are supposed to get a paragraph out of it. He cares about you, this much I know, I'm thinking he even loves you, maybe not in a romantic way but loves you as a friend and person and he wants the best for you. I think he's fed up with your naivety and the way you allow yourself to be disrespected. He's keeping his distance allowing you to think over the situation and maybe get a backbone where your husband is concerned.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	People should not interfere in other people's marriage..it only leads to trouble...|`|JaNE0HKyaa	He cares for you and don't want your hubby treating you like **** any more wake up he is the man for you.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	he might not have the patience...just like i couldnt read this long as letter|`|AA11208683	this guy sounds like he cares about you a lot and he knows that you are most likely going to get hurt someday... your husband kind of needs to grow up and realize that he is married right now and that his own needs are more important than yours. you need to sit down and talk to your husband, if he thinks he can walk all over you like this you marriage is not going to last. i think your guy friend was right he put you on a shelf and whenever he wants you he gets you, and its not fair to you. i think your friend cares about you a lot and maybe you should listen to him... i hope things get better for you... good luck!|`|LNSiLxlBaa	I think it's a combination of him being in love with you, and the friend part of him being tired of hearing you bit*h about stuff that you know will never change and you continue to put up with it. It's hard to listen to someone complain and trying to get answers out of people when they know deep down what the deal is. But with him, it sounds mostly like he loves you and is tired of seeing your husband take advantage of you.
0p9wHjSWaa	Either he is indeed lonely, or his feelings never subsided.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	Simply, he has dated other girls out there and realize that he should have never dumped the previous girl.|`|QPN0B5Dsaa	he tried to stay away from her for a while,, he might even have tried to get in other relations, but what made him gat back to her is bec he is in love wz her, her cant see anyone but her and when he tried to live away from her he couldnt <br>  <br>  my advice to her........ make it work and dont lose such a guy who truely loves u <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|iS94TGdxaa	r u perhaps this girl?  mayb he couldnt get another girl--- girls love 2 view their BF as a prize package that every girl wants- but in reality their gf's r the only ones who actually like them. i worked with these girls who think their bf's r the greatest..and all the other girls at work who seen him them- r repulsed. but if he can really get lot of chicks--then he just likes u|`|hZWKe1oVaa	if it's you brown sugar maybe it's because you are very pretty.And i mean that with respect|`|wqL84O8Naa	cuz he doesn't do alone well and he thinks shes a sucker enough to agree to it|`|z8s4bK6Yaa	me + my boyfriend dated for 6mths back in... 2006/07 then broke up and we recently got back together, so I guess if you still like/have started to like that person again, it's fine to relight the flame :D<br>  hope this helps :P
QK7ssy2Xaa	Wow this sounds like something I was in with my ex. It really is hard to move on especially if the feelings are still there so I feel for you. I'm not going to say move on cuz I didn't and it is really hard especially since you go to the same school. I would just wait it out a little longer. See what she does with this guy. If she still continues to talk to you and him, then I would just tell her point blank how you feel and that you can't keep doing this. Give her an ultimatum and just tell her to chose or else you'll just have to move on. She can't keep stringing you along like this. This isn't fair to you to keep getting hurt. I do know how hard it must be to see her with another guy. I understand. If she doesn't come around, you have to start moving on with your life. Stay single for a while and just hang out with your best friends and family. Enjoy life. You're too young to be caught up in a love triangle. In the end, everything happens for a reason. It takes time to heal. Good luck. It was meant to be she'll come back.|`|VSiMrZkOaa	You just need to move on, sounds like shes just playing games!|`|JXtQHQ6kaa	yr story hurts u know tel her that u love her and to leave the guy just make her to understand i think she wil b ok|`|1uGQmbE0aa	you are to her wat we call a "rebound." trust me, you don't want to be that guy. many people are in ur shoes right now, but the best thing for u to do, is to leave her alone and get to know other people.if she is the right one for u, u will find each other in the future.letting go to someone that u love the most is hard, but u need to realize what is best for u. she is just drama in ur life and right now at this age, u should be focusing on other things.<br>  GOOD LUCK! :)|`|23F70N1Raa	I think that you are with in your right to still want to be with her and to want to work things out.  However, I do not think that you should be doing these things while she is with someone else.  The point is... if you are willing to be "the other guy" she may think that you are ok with this behavior and do the same to you.<br>  <br>  Here is the thing, be open and honest with her.  Tell her you love her and want to be with her.  Then tell her that you can not do the things you do while she is with the other guy.  Either she will break up with him... or not and this will give you the answer you need.  Unfortunatlly it is a lousy option, but at the same time, you deserve to be the ONLY man in her life.  Stand up for yourself, and others will respect you.|`|MgkI35fTaa	Wow man thats some weird *** relationship...ok so wait it out see what happens because if you continue to do what you are doing right know and her new BF finds out better put your boots on son cause your going to war. anyways tell her that your here for her and see what happens next but if you two are still very good friends well thats cool i guess.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	look forward not back.. going backward hardly ever usually never works... she is your ex for a reason she touch your life for a year and two month... you can continue to care about her but need to let her go....and move on to that woman who is absolutely everything you want and deserve in life someone who loves you for exactly who you are...learn from this relationship and use what you learned in next one. good luck|`|jrdtQi04aa	Dont let this chick abuse you anymore.  She knows that you love her, and if she broke up with you, why cant she just break up with this other guy.  She wants to have all of you dangling on  a string.  Go out with someone else, and quit walking her to class, and staying with her after school.  Find someone else.  There are more girls out there, leave that girl alone.  When she gets tired of playing, she may come back to you, but beware, she could do the same thing to you again if you let her.  She's playing games.  Enjoy your life, and find someone who wants you, not everyone.|`|y1dgfN9Xaa	she sounds dum and confused and is probably not that good for u. try ur best to move on. thats all u can do is keep on pushing|`|1dx2AxQJaa	Kill him..<br>  <br>  No, but seriously, she's not worth it.|`|JA6apGVFaa	you should break up with her. if she really wanted to be with you she would break up with the guyshes with right now and get back with you. if you break up with her shell realize that she cant have both of you guys. so if she doesnt break up with the guy then shes not worth a second more of your time. if over a year doesnt phase her then she doesnt really love you like she says she does.<br>  you can totally find someone way better that will love you for who you are and not be with you and someone else at the same time. thats just wrong. it seems to me that theres something wrong with her. like she strives for attention so she needs to have guys around her at all times. she aculaay sounds like one of my friends...i know how those kind of girls are and there really not the best girls to choose as your girlfriends...<br>  hope i helped just a lil!<br>  =^.^=|`|SVwljA6maa	im so sorry for hearing you story. i say tell her how you feel that you want her for you and only you.. that you dont want to share her lips what so ever. tell her that shes the world to you. and if she plans to break with her bf for you well give it time and if she does do it ( break up w/ he ) hold her tight and dont let go love her way more... but if she takes her sweet liitle time in breaking up with him that means she's not takeing you seariosly.. she's only playing with you and useing u as a BOOTIECALL<3|`|a122b01b1756aff821e49bd8aa9c60d0aa	I think you need to tell her to make a choice between the two of you.  She's not being fair to either of you guys.  Sounds like she's got him as a back up, in case the two of you can't work things out.  If she chooses him, at least you know how she really felt about you.|`|sX9a0Cc7aa	The best advice that i can think of is to make sure that she really loves you. There is a big difference between saying it and really meaning it, take it from me.....i had dated my ex for about ten months he would say that he loved me but i felt like there was something missing in those words. Later to find out that he was a big jerk and wanted to use me for his long awaited pleasures. There was no love at all to make matters worse he proposed to me an i was gullible enough to take it. He could care less if we were married it was the other thing that he wanted the most. I am not telling u that u have the same problem but there is a big difference between love and just infatuation.|`|xK4ETCxtaa	To me (not knowing your whole situation) it looks like she doesn't know what she wants. She knows she likes you but she also likes him.  She doesn't want to lose you or him while she's figuring it out. I was with this girl and we would go out for a while and then she would break it off... but she still called and we hung out.  She never knew what she wanted. This went on for about 7 years and I tryed so hard to make it work because I really loved her but in the end I couldn't wait anymore.  Like I said  I've been thru this and everyone's situtation is different and it doesn't mean it won't work out but I would be careful because she may still realy like you or she may not want to be "your boyfriend" so she can date other people without gilt. If your situation is like mine then she had me available whenever she wanted and she knew I wasn't going anywhere. She had control and if I had to do it again, I wouldn't let her have it. I wouldn't destroy your friendship but I would back off a little and let her figure it out. Change the momentum. Don't put her first if she's not putting you first. I would let her go, forget about both of them. If it works out in the future then fine but if not then take it as a learning lesson for your next relationship. There are always plenty of good women. Always my friend. I've been with a few girls since then and I don't know how old you are but here's some advise and it works at any age. Never ever let a person know that they have 100% control of a relationship. It should never be one sided. It starts from day 1. It's important to comprmise but stand up for what you want and if she's not willing to give in then she's not worth being around. Stop taking so much crap! Do something for yourself! Once your confident and can make yourself happy women will always be around. They love this mental crap!|`|ssK4oJi9aa	it is unrealistic to think that the objective of dating at your tender age is to form lifelong partnerships. it is a time of experimentation, learning, and growing, it's time to move on and learn some more. the time will come some years hence when it will seem natural to both partners that a lifelong partnership is the answer and then just flow with it and make those commitments. don't look for that now. just be a surfer dude and learn about love and mating. you've got a long road ahead.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Sounds like she is just keeping you around as a back-up guy. She doesnt love you if she does this to you. Move on, she obviously did.|`|8uMXFWgyaa	If you value ur mental helth u'll walk away from that.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Holy high school drama.<br>  <br>  Okay, so you loved a girl you dated for 2 months?  Interesting.<br>  <br>  You continue to pine fo rher when she dumped you and got another guy?  Lovely.<br>  <br>  You really don't know what to do?  RUN.<br>  <br>  She dumped you.  She doesn't want you.  She's DATING ANOTHER BOY.  She may say she wants to dump him, but she hasn't has she?  She's got lots of excuses, doesn't she?  She just wants your attention, kiddo.  She's not interested in you in any other way.<br>  <br>  You'll seem pathetic if you allow this to continue.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	It sounds like she's playing the both of you. She's stringing along the both of you guys, and the both of you are allowing her to do so. <br>  <br>  She moved on very quickly after breaking up with you, which may indicate that she was actually breaking up with you FOR this other guy. She's currently carrying on a relationship with him, but you allow her to use you for emotional support and physical closeness whenever she desires. When she is with her current boyfriend, she's getting the same out of him, whenever it is convenient for her.<br>  <br>  Sure, it's all well and good that she's telling you she wants to break up with this other bloke, but if she hasn't done it, chances are she doesn't intend to. Why would she, when she gets what she wants out of you either way?<br>  <br>  On the flip side, why would you want to be with a girl who jumped into a relationship so quickly after ending yours, and proceeds to be emotionally unfaithful to this new guy as well? She doesn't sound like a very honest person, and is probably not worth your time.<br>  <br>  I would recommend distancing yourself from this girl. It's hard to get over a relationship with someone if that person is in your life every day. Spend some time apart with her and get and outside view of what's really going on here. You may find that you will no longer want what you thought you did.|`|q791er1naa	Its high school.<br>  This is the story of high school, and teenage puppy love. (Please dont be offended by that term.)<br>  This is the nature of her age, and its typical of a teenage girl to act like this.  She isnt commited to anyone!<br>  Enjoy being in high school..start dating other people and see if she likes how that feels. Im sure she will get upset, and if you are lucky, she'll ditch the other guy.<br>  But honestly, try to enjoy yourself...When I was in high school I got so wound up by all that stuff and now, about 8 years later I realize how trivial it all seems. At the time it felt like it was the end of the world.<br>  YOU HAVE SO MUCH TIME AHEAD OF YOU!!
Fkl6gV8Qaa	No need to split it up at all. You could also ask all of your guys' friends to sit on "the brides side". If you have ushers just have them alternate seating. If not people will just sit where they want and if you are close enough to some of his family you could just tell them to pass the word on that because your family will not be there it would be great if they sat on both sides.|`|AA10351134	Having bride's sides and groom's sides is optional.

If one side becomes fuller than the other, they will redirect traffic.|`|mesqZ1mUaa	If you are having ushers or groomsmen do the seating, tell them just to seat people evenly from the front to the back. If a guest specifically requests to sit on a particular side, that can be done. But from my experience with weddings, there are a lot of people who are friends of the couple who really don't have a preference as to which side they sit on.|`|Wdl9SA9jaa	Tell your ushers not to ask guests "bride or grooms side" Instead, just have the ushers seat alternate sides, having them fill in both sides evenly. This is what I am doing for my wedding since my family is much smaller than my H2B family.|`|btNUf7rcaa	Just don't have any seat designations and have people sit wherever they want. If you have an usher, tell him/her to tell people that there are no sides and they can sit where they please.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I just wouldn't have a brides side and grooms side, just have the usher fill up the pews alternating from the left side to the right side|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	Really close friends maybe?<br>  Or get the husband's family to spread out on both sides.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Have open seating.  If you have ushers, have them seat people on both sides equally.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	instead of having a bride's side and groom's side, tell your ushers or groomsmen to seat people evenly between both sides of the aisle.|`|BUET39wmaa	yes just don't have them sit on any side but fill up the whole front.<br>  end of story
F3LBgfvwaa	I don't get it either. People are so strange. They can't really tell that you are a virgin when they say that, they say that to people who aren't virgins too. Our society, especially young people, have some strange ideas regarding sex and virginity. *shrug* I try not to dwell on it too much.<br>  <br>  Oh! If people get on your case about it, remind them that 1 in 4 Americans has an STD. That might shut them up.|`|iTUugOTLaa	Well, it's interesting you know? Girl virgins --> good, male virgins--> bad..

41m8ihqmaa	Well for me first impression is the give or take, and depending were you meet them, In Buffalo, NY I meet people downtown at a bar or club or a weekend house party, plus when you drink, kicks up the flirting game a whole lot. But if like its a friend of yours you just noticed is single and you thought was attractive Id set up some kind of date or just hang out with them, talk and be flirty, you know hint at you like them, but say its some you know at work or something, I try to say theres a big event like people going out somewhere that way it doesn't seem like your 1 on 1 to not be obvious, but kinda talk to them and make them notice ya a little being flirty. Like when I go out with a girl, I try to be casual, movies, dinner, a night walk around Niagara Falls (sounds homo, but def a brownie point for the walk), Plus New York is cold, hence the girl can cuddle into you while walking, I usually get a nice dress shirt, always buy a new one for first date, nice ironed jeans, white sneakers or dress shoes, I wear a ball cap too, put the earings in, and thats a first date outfit. Basically its eye contact and showing interest and being flirty, not faking im listening but being interactive with what they talk about. but sometimes it isn't enough, some girls are hard to read if you ask me, I like the girl to show shes into me as well, being kinda flirty, maybe moving closer to me at dinner or at the movie, not going to lie love when a girl makes me eat something, shows shes a little demanding, I like a girl to take a little control. makes me know shes into me. Sorry if I may be going off topic, trying to pick out key points of my dates, even tho the last girl I went out with, was great, all this blew up in my face, took my money and ran. Dont be that girl lol, also a really big jaw dropper is when the girl goes tanning and gets all drop dead gorgeous, cause then its hard to look away, then it intimadates me, cause then Im like wow am I really on a date with her, that also makes eye contact hard for me, because I start losing focus looking into her eyes, and not paying attention, idk if Im helping just throwing some things that work for me and get me|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	I have to remind myself I'm married.  Dammit.  ;-)|`|pVnUhYLQaa	I would talk to her and ask her for her number. I'm straight forward, if I liked you, it wouldn't be a mystery, you would know it.|`|QulgGg5kaa	I'm gay but most of my guy friends will start acting tough, smiling have plenty of eye contact with the girl, not speak to you for the second he sees her, if he his single check her out etc i hope ihelped u
nMWtEmEFaa	Be bold, and just ask him "Do you want to be my boyfriend?"<br>  <br>  You're never going to get an answer if you don't ask.<br>  <br>  Just ask him to be your boyfriend. Don't take anything other than yes or no as an answer, to avoid him trying to escape answering the question.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Keep your cool! If things aren't going good now, what can you expect if he becomes your boyfriend?|`|XyMNsz0Baa	okay. here's what you do cha-chee. Go to your local supermarket. I will be there wearing a trench coat and with a shaved head. However, I have a boil on my head so I'll be wearing a cap. Moreover, you will go to the cashier and say where is the meat aisle? Then you will walk to the aisle and then I'll be there buying one half pound of grade A ground pork. you will come up behind me and say, "That's a lot of meat." And I will turn around and do what my step dad used to do to me. <br>  <br>  Hope al is well.<br>  <br>  BoyspLeAse|`|6FrN15ozaa	Just ask him where you guys stand, and if you don't like the answer then it's time to move on.|`|RAPO3PAMaa	Well either he's shy or he doesn't want to be your boyfriend like that.|`|FgdJpfiVaa	it looks like hes distancing himself......<br>  so ya probablility? <br>  MOVE ON
dw440Lylaa	It must be wonderful to be as wonderful as you.............<br>  <br>  Somehow you equate "slim" and "beautiful".....sorry, physical attractiveness is simply a bonus, it's who someone is that makes them beautiful.  Why don't you visit Somoa.........I'm sure you'll appreciate what they see as beautiful women  there......<br>  <br>  So you don't appreciate fat chicks.  There are over 150 million females in the United States............how many slim women do you need?  You might consider some therapy, you seem to be projecting your problem with weight on American females as a group.<br>  <br>  Your "question' seems more of a rant than a question.  I have no problem with you marrying a foreign woman.....while your at it, learn her language, and live in her county.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|1HfLkTrdaa	No, you really DON'T "get it."  <br>  <br>  This is really all your own size prejudice talking here...and none of it is based in any sort of fact.  What right have to you to judge or put anyone down? Why don't you post your picture so we can see if YOU measure up or not?<br>  <br>  There are plenty of overweight MEN out there, why don't you say something about THEM?  Why are you singling out only the women...and only American women at that?<br>  <br>  Methinks we have a young man scorned here....<br>  <br>  Besides, there are women from all countries who are overweight/obese.  Even the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) can prove this, so stop believing the hype designed to sell diet books and fitness programs to insecure Americans.<br>  <br>  If someone is overweight and happy, it's really none of your business anyway.  The only reasons you say what you say is because you're just not happy with yourself.  People who aren't happy with themselves have to tear someone down in an effort to build themselves up.  Why don't you try cleaning up your own backyard before nagging someone else about theirs?<br>  <br>  Sizist, sexist and emotionally immature...what a combination, huh?|`|fkYBRWp6aa	Maybe, it is because American women are tolerant toward each other at weight. Plus their measures of weight are easy. In the USA, unlike in my country (Japan), Miley Cyrus will never be considered a fat bastard.|`|AA10780277	all americans are fat cause they like to eat fast food every day and dont care about themselves.
9zVZREW0aa	The best thing to do is to be direct with this young lady. Let her know how you feel; be as honest as possible. It is much better to talk to her about your feelings than your homeboys. If she is as great as you say she is, then she will completely understand. <br>  <br>  It sounds like she had legitimate reasons for not coming to visit you those previous weekends, so you have to cut her some slack in that regard. Eventually you will have to move on if you perceive that the feelings are just not there, but I don't think it has gotten to that point yet. Without sounding bitter let her know about your desire to see her; be strong, be a man, and show her you have some heart. If you don't, this other guy is going to move in on your lady.|`|NrH787NZaa	cry a river,build a bridge and get over it|`|pJ7icz0taa	Look you are 18..

Maybe the problem is she does like you just as much as you like her, but she doesn't want a relationship.  She might just have wanted to date you and not be in a relationship and since you seem like you want her to be your gurl and all, she's probably trying to keep her distance so you won't fall in love.  I know its hard to get over someone you really like, but if that person is not on the same level as you, you can't force it.  <br>  <br>  This story sounds familiar, my friend was a girl who just wanted to "date", that's it, not have a relationship, and the man she dated wanted more from her, but she never told him that she didn't want a relationship so he kept calling and calling but she was on to a new guy already. By him calling and wondering where she was and when they were going to see each other again annoyed her and she stopped talking to him and went on to the next man.<br>  <br>  So I hope this helps you alittle bit.  Good luck  you will find someone who likes you the same way.|`|qX5N60YXaa	i think that.... before you even think about getting over this girl you need to tell her upfront how you feel about her - cause you obviously seem to like her a lot and if you wanna be with her rather than get over her then you need to tell her.|`|3CxtflUsaa	Long distance relationships rarely work out, especially for 2 people just starting.

In fact, I'd give it a month before you are on to the next thing. It looks as if she already is. If she really wanted to be there, she would be.<br>  <br>  And the only thing that mends a broken heart, is time. <br>  <br>  Focus on school and what's important - your future.|`|E6i7LIGPaa	I am sorry to hear...the same thing happened to me  1 week ago and its driving me nuts, my gf of 3 years decided to fall for a girl she met 2 mts ago and she dumped me for no reason.I gave her the world and she was heartless to me....your answer is ,you cant  it will take time to heal but you will never forget.My gf spent Vday with me and took off the next day to meet another woman...so I feel your pain man,she lied to me about where she went but I found out.

And just pay them a compliment about what they're doing first... as apposed to what they look like. <br>  <br>  Also in the library? If it's full, sit next to a girl. <br>  <br>  Any excuse! But try not to mention their looks first off- think of another way to appreciate them... then you can compliment them on looks when you've got to known them a bit. - We tend to think guys are shallow if they only come up and talk about looks|`|TnSB6rpeaa	Well it can be but it is all how you present it. Dont just walk up and be like hey you are pretty. If you are coming at her from a distance then say something like I was just realizing when you were walking across the school that i don't know you. What's your name? Then when she tells you you say well (say her name) it was nice to meet you. You are very pretty then smile and walk away.|`|1dx2AxQJaa	Stalk her..

Like, instead of calling her name say, "Hi miss goregous!" with a smile. You could also try to insert it in a conversation. When she smiles, compliment it, you know.  It has to be natural not forced. She has to feel that you're sincere. Make her feel it.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Yeah, a bit.  I like the making something up bit better.  Maybe ask the time, flirt a little, then go in for the compliment.|`|nogoUTDXaa	Depends on the individual person and their personality.<br>  <br>  Some girls would love a direct guy, someone who would just walk up to them in full confidence and compliment them despite not knowing each other.<br>  <br>  Others would see this as over-confidence and a negative trait. Your other idea about starting the conversation with a "don't-really-need-to-know" question might work best with these types. Although they might completely see through what you're doing and not like how you're trying to approach them.<br>  <br>  It's a shame you can't tell what a girl's reaction will be before you take that step.|`|8uMXFWgyaa	I was stuck n engineering too with all the dorks. Just be real with ppl. The ugly ones that I likw I just tell them that I appreciate them and I do. My prob is I treat the pretty ones like sluts.

His ex is goofy but over the years I have had her for holiday dinners when his kids are in town, we've done graduation dinners together and we just had a joint shower at our house for their son's soon to be wife. I took my ex's wife to lunch when she flew in to help out with a new grandson.  I wouldn't chose either one of them to be a friend but for the sake of harmony I try to get along. It's so much easier and less stressful for my husband and their kids and my kids for us all to get along.|`|b8f0567cc965cfac3a2b7aa6564ba025aa	Neither my husband and me nor him and his ex wife have children and  he talks at great length about his first wife and it,s all bad. other people who knew her substantiate this and while I have never met her there would probably be police come to the crime scene and charging me with homicide if I ever met her. My present husband and I have ben happy for nearly thirty years.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Yes, we all get along. Why not? It's so dramatic, and frankly, low class otherwise.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I'm not the ex wife, I'm the new wife, but I'd like to comment anyway. :)<br>  <br>  I COMPLETELY agree with you!<br>  <br>  I get along fantastically with my husband's ex wife.<br>  <br>  We have a pretty abnormal situation, though.  I'll keep it short as possible.  My husband and his ex only married because she got pregnant when they were 18, 3 months after they started dating.  They were divorced a year later.  They were unhappy, and did not marry for love.<br>  <br>  We met after they'd been divorced for almost 3 years.  We moved in together when my step son was 5 years old.  He is now 8.  He only visits his mother from 12-2 Saturday and 12-3 Sunday.  More often than not, one of those days she cancels because "it's snowing" or she's "sick" or "tired" so he really doesn't see her often.  I am his primary caregiver -- I work from home so he is with me before and after school, and I do everything for him.<br>  <br>  At first, when we moved in together there was a little friction because I think his Mom didn't like the fact that someone else was raising her son.  Finally, I pulled her aside and took a walk with her and told her that I wasn't trying to step on her toes.  I told her she was Mom, and no one could ever change that, and that I just wanted to do what was best for my step son.  That seemed to calm the waters a lot.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, 3 years later, she talks to ME instead of my husband about everything.  She still doesn't pay us a dime of child support, but that's okay.. we're not going to be bitter and go after it just because we can.  I haven't had a harsh word with her in 3 years.  I don't think she's a very good mother, but then again I don't really care -- he lives with myself and my husband, and we provide a good home and family environment for him, so at least he gets that.  As a person, I don't really have an opinion of her either way.<br>  <br>  What I do know is that I get along with her great.  It's easy to, because we don't really have a reason to fight.  However, even if I hated her guts I'd treat her well for the sake of my step son.  HE is what is important.<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking this question.  More people need to put the kids first and stop being bitter, jealous, and immature. :)|`|KmC0K59taa	I guess I am the new wife.

I have to talk to her about pick ups and drop offs with their son.<br>  We get along and have never fought.  I have actually consoled her when he's blown up at her.  I don't really, truly like her however.  I know she is a deceitful person and just puts on this image that she's a wonderful person.  We make fun of her quite a bit.<br>  <br>  I would say she doesn't truly like me either. I'm younger and thinner.  Ha.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I'm the new spouse, but get along pretty well with his ex-wife. They have 2 boys together and we see each other when dropping them off/picking up. She is always friendly and often comes in to hang out for a few minutes when she drops them off, even if he's not there. However, they have been apart for quite a few years and he's had other gf's before me. I think that helps a lot.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	My husband's ex is a crazy mo fo. Sometimes she is friendly and nice to me. Ex, I missed the last episode of The Batchelor, and she was nice enough to tell me about it.<br>  <br>  However the next day she went back to calling me names and ignoring my existance. <br>  <br>  I have no beef with her though. I truely just think she does it for attention bc she is jealous that my husband has moved on from her and we are happy. <br>  <br>  Its been 3 years already and she's the one that left him, like get over it already! lol|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Not me! <br>  She slept with my husband, made false accusations against me, threats on me, has been spreading lies about me in our small town, so she can go to hell. My ex-husband and I do share a child, but I have 0 involvement with her, I've never even talked to her and she's made up false harassment accusations... Ah well, the two idiots deserve each other!!!|`|AA10447677	Not the one that he has now, but his previous one I did. I loved her to death, we actually are STILL friends to this day, even though they broke up over a year ago. I told her that she was MUCH to good for him, and that in time - his abusive side would come out with her too. It did, she left him & now we still talk.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Yes. My ex and I are friends, my wife and her are friends and me and my ex's husband are friends, though I admit that we all became closer after the tragic death of my youngest son at the tender age of 19.|`|2mBupx1baa	Here is one for you ... I am best freinds with my ex's ex!  Long complicated story, but in the end her and I are closer than ever, and he HATED it! probably why it didn't work out between us.|`|fTiXy11caa	If my ex got a new wife, I wouldn't care what she was like, I would still like her.  In fact, I'd throw a hallelujah party that he found a new wife.|`|VPL6eZpPaa	I happen to have an excellent relationship with my ex-husband and his girlfriend.  She is a very nice lady and treats my daughter very well!!!   I get along with my ex better now than we did when we where married.  My ex also gets along great with my new husband--very strange I know!<br>  <br>  Alot of people think that it is strange but I think that it is nice for all of us, we have a 7 year old together.  Stranger yet--My ex-in-laws came to my wedding to my current husband!|`|c96a826a1b2655ff81b951010262f941aa	Im the new wife... and well I wish but no not really, she is not mean to me... she used to but i don't think she would anymore, when she found a new love, she stop being mean to me... but she changes alot, one day she would even make jokes over the phone, but most of time she just goes: politely can i speak to the kids... but she hang up on me before, she almost drove on me... yeah that'she past now... ouffffffffffff|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Do I get along with my ex's gf?  Yes, for the sake of not arguing.  I don't particularly like her, but I know that she takes decent care of my kids when they are with them, and many times she takes them to do things because their dad is butt who doesn't wanna do anything but drink.  I have no proof that he's ever endagered them, though (although I feel he has) so there's nothing legally I can do to keep them from going over there.  Because of that, even though I don't like the gf, many times I am thankful that she is there.
Vp1Wzu07aa	Best thing about having a sister...she is always there for you. Worst thing...she is ALWAYS there. I don't have a sister but I have two daughters very close in age. <br>  <br>  I do have brothers though, one older and one younger. The best thing about brothers is that they are always there to protect you. The worst thing...holding your face to his butt while he farts on your head..|`|zrHE78DCaa	me and my sister consider each other as friends more than sister's she has taught me everything i know and even though she is older that me i have taught her too. We are 13 and 15 and we are NOT allowed to watch 18's at all. however we find them on the web and watch them together. i love my sister we are so close she showed me the religion we are now in and we are going to be close forever.|`|LJDiSCCNaa	I find that being the youngest sister, my older sisters automatically think they are smarter than I am, this gives them an arrogance that produces disrespect towards me. I don't apprecitate that. It hasn't changed over the years; despite my career and family success and their lives are quite a mess from their poor decisions.|`|wqz3SbWhaa	Well i have 3 sisters, i am 13 and my oldest sister is 21, 2nd 20 and youngest 19<br>  so we have a MASSIVE age gap, but at the end of the day, you'll love them! the best thing they'll buy you stuff worst thing they will grass on you!|`|cbb4aa8076304023e6d2a335514bdea1aa	Me and my sister are the best of friends and tell each other everything but we have our squabbles from time to time and sometimes she ticks me off just because she's the youngest and gets everything she wants whereas I have to earn things and she also annoys me just for the fun of it. But I love her to bits!!|`|QilfSBfsaa	If your sister loves you, she would be your best friend; if she hates you, she would be your worst enemy.|`|XaysYqriaa	my sister at times is my best friend and others i could just kill her for taking my stuff without my knowledge|`|CM0C65dtaa	I guess it depends on the person, but my sister is my best friend and we have never fought.  We have also decided that if we are someday both old widows we are going to live together (with out cats). I wish she lived closer to us.<br>  <br>  The best thing is having someone you can tell anything to and she will understand, having come from the same background, and having known you all your life.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	My sister is my best friend-however my husband's sister is the demon from hell!
LzJJn1m7aa	because first love is usually NOT love its infatuation and lust! otherwise it would last|`|HxtKRMKAaa	There are so many factors that influence the choices we make.<br>  <br>  It is not uncommon for first loves to be long lasting relationships.<br>  <br>  However I do believe that the majority of the population would have multiple tries before they find the one that they can settle down with. <br>  Even then there are no guarantees that it will be a successful life long relationship.<br>  Look at the separation/divorce rates at the moment. The figures are ever increasing.<br>  Relationships are a work in progress always and youth and inexperience does not lend itself well to the coping skills required as they are often missing.<br>  Time and exposure is the teacher in all things.<br>  <br>  Simplistically put. When you are a child you may think that sodas are the best drinks on the planet. When you are a teenager it could be milk shakes. As an adult it might be wine.<br>  As a mature aged person it could be port.<br>  Tastes change, and how a person defines what their needs and wants are in a partner also can change with time, especially if the people involved do so at a different pace. This would be one of main causes for failed relationships.<br>  As I said there are many factors.|`|M4BUjVTnaa	I think it doesn't work because it's the first and u don't really know what it is you're feeling or what you're doing till u have a little bit of experience.

xhpAiWPvaa	Go with him|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Lap dances. You get boobies jiggled on your face =]|`|AA11289793	I dunno they are all kind of different, most of them have a stage for dancers to dance on and then strippers walk around asking people if they want to pay for a private dance.<br>  <br>  But as long as you trust him and ask him that you don't want him to get a private dance, then there should be no problem...|`|kTZevQNHaa	They're expensive.<br>  Booze is expensive. A soda  is expensive (price of a cocktail usually), now no smoking in most clubs, and the dances, at 20 bucks a pop...is outlandish.<br>  <br>  Many women from eastern Europe.<br>  <br>  The girls do a stage show--usually 2 a night--3 songs per show...dressed, top off, bottoms off and floor show.<br>  <br>  That's how the women advertise themselves--plus walking around soliciting dances--flirting with the guys to try to turn them on enough to blow 20 bucks a song on a dance...they will try then to get them to take them into what is often called "The Champagne Lounge"where there's more privacy and there's a fee for the guy to get back there--plus dances are more expensive--and explicit.<br>  (Some naughty women will let a man touch her privates, suck her breast, finger her, touch HIM etc...to get more dances and make more money --till he blows his wad--figuratively and literally)<br>  <br>  It's a nudie bar and the women solicit dances from the men at 20 bucks a pop...they're now lap dances-which means the women basically sit on the guy's lap and they can maul each other --some clubs more than others-(some women allow more  than others and some clubs' staff will look the other way--(and there's private rooms where the women can take the men--into these cubicles like in an office--with a softly padded chair/sofa etc...and -for the duration of the 3 minute song...they do the 'dance',(think:"dry humping"),chat,,,have a drink together sometimes, share chit chat...<br>  The women's JOB is to come onto the guy and make him the center of attention--to try to get him to spend more money buying more drinks...the women charge to sit and chat with the guy too...20 bucks a song.<br>  It means little or nothing to the woman--who may have a husband and kids at home, or a boyfriend-it's just a job-and rarely do the dancers actually see/date the guys or meet them outside the club--<br>  It's all about sex and money...and 99%-within the confines of the club.<br>  There's bouncers there to man the ship and make sure no one gets out of hand.<<==(But many of them can be paid to 'look the other way')...wink wink.<br>  <br>  Many clubs will allow a woman to go in there as a client so long as she is escorted by a male --so you can actually go and see for yourself...even buy a lap dance and see what it's all about 1st hand.<br>  (MANY women will dance or another woman-money's money.)<br>  <br>  If you ask him not to get a private dance, he might tell you he won't but--still might still get one and his friends will be the LAST to tell you--(men's code of honor.)<br>  But relax--it means nothing.<br>  It's when the boyfriend starts going into the clubs at all hours of the night or  the day alone that you need to look closer-only because of all the money he'd be blowing......if he becomes  a "regular"--but rest assured--from the dancer's perspective, all she sees usually are dollar signs. SHE won't let it mean anything...even if he did develop some sort of fantasial 'crush'...it's all about money to most the dancers.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider--even if you say it's not cool he go--you  will be the last to know..men will do what men will do...so, if he is hell bent on going--he will go.<br>  Does NOT mean he doesn't love you.<br>  Men are very visual--and most of the time, a strip dance means nothing...it's like a 3D nudie magazine...little bit of man's private man-fun. He's not gonna go falling for the stripper...that rarely happens--and most dancers won't date a guy from the club--and have super hot boyfriends/husbands /families of their own....so don't worry.<br>  <br>  Best thing you can do is do some sexy dances of your own --for him at home.<br>  Even buy a wig to change it up a bit and don a fun new personna.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Well, depends on what kind of strip club.  There are defo ones that are nicer than some.  Mostly it is a darkly lit room with topless woman dancing on an elevated platform and some going around the room asking for lap dances.  The men are all shapes, sizes and ages.  The woman's bathroom usually doubles as the locker room for the woman to change in as well.  If you feel apprehensive about your boyfriend going to the strip club, I would suggest that maybe the two of you go together before he goes with his friends.  That was what my husband and I did.  It was a lot of fun and now I don't really have a problem with it.  He has only gone a handful of times in the 10 years we have been together.  It kind of lost it's mystique when I didn't care if he went or not.<br>  <br>  Oh and PS, these woman are not there trying to steal your man.  They are trying to make a living and the men are just dollar signs to them.  Trust me, I have had friends that stripped.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	a strip club is just what it sounds like the women there strip down to nothing but a g string and dance for these guys and they put money in the g string...    They even get las dances...   Its not a nice place for a guy who is going steady to go...  believe me I have been there...  these girls are buck naked....    Grant M|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Like a candy store for adult males.|`|f3e5e4d7af5d1a05594696425078e04faa	Don't be mad.  If you get mad you are one of those WACK *** girls that noooobdy wants to deal with unless they are really hot.  <br>  <br>  It's lame.  Naked girls keep putting boobs and things in your face to extort money out of you and drinks are extremely expensive.  If he doesn't buy drinks or give them dollars they aren't even gonna come around his table lol.  To me it's just a big waste of money I wouldn't even consider going unless someone was hell bent on treating me.|`|fecUjSr1aa	a lot of girls, a lot of booze, a lot of money flying around, a lot of drinks, a lot of smoke and .... a lot of trouble ...|`|WFRooU7Maa	They are awesome<br>  They are also very tasteful and classy<br>  You should go with him|`|uZEmRPBFaa	Like throwing your money out the window.|`|wPtjtLycaa	Just like philly cream cheese... a little slice of heaven

WtTUNC8Naa	Lol, he is SOOOO hinting that he is going to ask you out.  :-) If you really like him too, then thats awesome girl!<br>  But seriously he was def. talking about you. The reason he wouldn't tell you "her" name or the fact he said that you know her.... you do know her, cause its you :-)<br>  <br>  If he said he was going to ask you out... then yea... but if he doesnt do it today... don't get upset, he might do it the next day. But good luck|`|2S2onP86aa	Yes, he obviously meant you. This is so cute. I think he will ask you out, you just got to wait. Be happy - good luck.|`|MV88rqDPaa	he is so talking about you because he didnt tell you the name so i think he will ask you out|`|CCpUkt4Raa	haha well it sounds like he might be talk about you but try not to get your hopes up, kinda mean to say i know, but if it turns out that its not you he's talking about, then you'll be really really devistated.... you know what i mean =/ <br>  <br>  but still, the days not over with yet ;D maybe he's still trying to get the strength to ask you out you know|`|GNGHr9D5aa	DEFINITELY.|`|rGisxubRaa	i honestlyy thynks he see youuhh as bestfriend && more than that .. he could trust youuh .. i honestlly thynk tha gurl is youh =]|`|Q96unluZaa	i think the girl he was talking about is you so yes he likes you|`|59DkkvSraa	ummm yes. definatly hes into you. have fun with your new bf after he asks you out haha|`|w2kOriiHaa	it very possible lol<br>  omg i want to kno what happens!XD|`|GYPnBHptaa	hes  GAY !!!  no  i  dnt  think  he  likes  u but  u  only  know !|`|7MJSPGnhaa	It's you and why not beat him to the punch and ask him out!! Take some of the pressure off of him.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I KNE IT WAS YOU! You go girl and you two have a GREAT time!! Yeah Amanda's got a date!!!|`|sCr2iTczaa	Well it sounds and looks to me as he likes you but i am not gonna tell you it is definite. He could like one of your girl friends, and if he doesn't ask you by the end of the day you know that girl wasn't you. Maybe ask your girl friends if they have a clue.
F3LBgfvwaa	Let me make this clear to you: you are NOT lazy for expecting the kids to help around the house. You're teaching them discipline and skills that will serve them well later in life. Good for you!<br>  <br>  Are the kids all satisfied that the work is split evenly between the 3 of them? You could have them rotate their responsibilities. My cousins have a calendar to keep track of all the chores and who is doing them for that day.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: What's with the thumbs down? I swear some people don't even read the answers but go down the list and mark everything thumbs down.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	It's only wrong that you ask, it should be expected!  ALL family members are part of a team and ALL team members have to do their share for the team to work well!  ALL of your children except for the 6 month old should also have chores even if it's just putting their toys away, your two yr old can handle that!  The others are old enough to help fold clothes, empty trash cans, clear the table, put clothes away, gather dirty clothes, help pick up the house, the 8 and 7 & 6 yr old can help clean the bathrooms, run the vacuum, sweep and dust!  My entire family got up on Sat. mornings and we ALL pitched in to do the laundry, clean the house and do the yard work.  Then the rest of the weekend was ours to enjoy together!|`|5apGkgS9aa	you all have to pull together but if you are a child in a big family it can cause resenment in later life they still need to be children and just be themselves why did you have all them kids tho.It was not their choice that they were born into such a large family.what life do you and your hubby have good luck|`|spYJU36Iaa	Of course its not wrong! With so many young children to look after, you need all the help you can get.<br>  How about giving them rewards for doing their chores?<br>  And they should be doing their bit for the household and family.<br>  x'|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	All children should grow up doing their share of the chores. I think what you are asking them to do is very fair!|`|iRXraQWyaa	Certainly not.  Children should help with the house chores.  Good for you!!|`|b188dffc272fc0cae0706fb1e108d2cbaa	No, I feel like you're doing exactly as a parent should. You and the hubby provide those kids with EVERYTHING (food, clothing, shelter, and extras), so yes they should do chores. You're grooming them to responsible adults instead of lazy slobs; wish more parents did the same!|`|LJDiSCCNaa	doesn't sound like too much to delagate. <br>  <br>  I tell my kids this (I have 3 sons) <br>  <br>  "It's my job to raise you into productive adults, and that will take practice in life skills before you are 18, if you have a  little fun along the way- consider it a bonus!"|`|CRk1goz4aa	The only "wrong" part about it is...you are asking. They need to help you out and NO, you are not wrong. They are old enough to do things for themselves. And really you are helping the to learn responsibilities.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Just don't give the girls more than their fair share of the work, simply because they are girls.|`|SsCMH480aa	i dont think thats toomuch to ask for.....it will teach them responsibility...until i moved away to school(when i turned 18) i cooked dinner for my 3 younger sisters, bathed them, did laundry on the weekends, washed dishes and a whole other loads of stuff. Now my 15,14 ans 12 yearold sisters do chores. the 15 yr old does the laundry and cleans the living room, the 14 and 13 yr olds take turns doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen. so i really dont think ur asking too much|`|ajOlzSJ1aa	I think you have too many children, I bet you hardly ever get any quality time, one on one in your house, sounds like a nightmare!<br>  I have one husband and three kids, and that is a lot of work!<br>  <br>  Oh as for your question...If they want to help out, fine, but they will resent it if pushed, kids should be allowed to be kids, yeah sure they need boundaries and some jobs to do around the place, but I do think the ones you listed are over the top.|`|rsdKX1fyaa	YOU chose to have all those children- which, incidentally, I find ridiculous and extremely selfish of you- and you should have made sure you could look after them all, properly.  Of course, NOBODY could look after 12 children properly, which is one reason why you should not have kept churning them out.<br>  <br>  Why the hell should your kids have to do the chores you are unable to do?  The 17, 14, and 12yr old kids should be keeping their own room/areas clean and tidy, and should sort out their own breakfast, school stuff and homework.  They could certainly empty or fill the dishwasher, take the rubbish out, and run errands to the shops.  But looking after the younger kids is NOT their responsiility at all.  You are a very foolish, selfish woman, in reproducing so often.  I feel extremely sorry for ALL your children, as none of them can have any privacy, space, peace and quiet, nor quality time with you|`|t7AIAXo9aa	That is pretty much perfect! No way of course you're not wrong. The tasks fit their ages and abilities and everyone contributes something. That's perfect!|`|HRY7cD2yaa	Everyone in a household should contribute, especially seeing the size of the family as it must need to run with almost military precision.<br>  Kids need to do as they are told (or asked), failing which they should be thrashed.|`|63JDNbVYaa	when i was younger (im 19) i wasn't asked to do many chores but i have an 8 year old brother and i help out when im asked with him, <br>  <br>  with that many children i wouldn blame  you for asking for help!|`|TT5MBHacaa	ofcourse they should be doing these chores.How would they feel in your shoes if you had to do ALL that by yourself? dont worry you are very right to request they do this. you have a lot of responsibilities on your hands|`|sIwtp0bGaa	I think what you do is not wrong, but you could let them have a bit of time to themselves. Maybe give them rewards for doing chores. It will improve their life skills and will help you!|`|TAWR8z9kaa	this is perfectly normal the kids should be doing these chores it is helping them with life skills you SHOULD be making them do this|`|JQNBnmERaa	i think all children living in the house should at least have 1 or 2 chores depending on age but yes i do think they should have chores...also makes them more responsible as my mother used to say|`|wyAbkG3oaa	They should help ot yes, but I think they are doing too much. You had 12 children...so you should look after them, not have the other kids doing it.|`|4QoHrLfqaa	Its wrong how can u do this to small kidsa? they are working for money but they r just kids now, why do peoples behave like animals with small kids?|`|mD4wAHyqaa	Damn lady u sure have ur hands full.<br>  First of all y r u having so many kids and expect ur other kids to become a mother sooner then there time. Hell after all of the responsibility of helping out with that many kid they my never want kids of there own b/c u made them take on a whole lot in there teen life. They should be going out  to the mall and movies with kids there age and enjoying some free time.<br>  U made the decision to have these kids and now u want to ask them to do ur responsibility. How fair is that to them. I can understand them doing house chores but bathing and feeding them is for u to do. <br>  If it was maybe just 2-3 kids i can understand but this is to much for a teenager to handle.U can't even handle this on ur own let a lone ur other kids. They do have homework and study time that they need to do to stay focus on there education. I can Image them coming home and doing all of this plus the house chores they must be just as tried as u r at the end of the day,<br>  If they do it all week then Fri- Sun Should be there time to do something that they enjoy doing. Hell go hire a nanny to help u out b/c u will see how much this is going to affect ur other children later in there life. U r selfish and i guaranteed that at some point ur oldest children will leave home one by one right after high school b/c of this. I really hope u r not planning to have anymore kids.|`|oSvwWFEIaa	12 kids wow! I'm the mother of 5 and you have every right to ask them to help you out ,I ask my kids and sometimes I tell them.And that is not at all being lazy .Children need to learn that sometimes then need to have responsibilities.

AA11898255	if you really love her and if she really loves you, you guys should talk it over. the biggest mistake everybody makes in a relationship is they hide everything from each other and are shy. just be open and talk to her. if both of you understand each other's problems it will be very easy to find ways to solve problems!|`|FcbRUYExaa	Talk to her.. with everything out in the open, get her exact words on how she feels and what she feels you two should do, if you both have each other, then, NOTHING CAN GO WRONG... <br>  i had the same situation, i dated one sister Topaz.. and later we ended it, but i ended up falling for her younger sister.. and we went on and on and on- a lot more on my level than the other sister could ever attempt... we are happier now than ever. I mean, Topaz, is not so happy.. but she is living with it.. we both love each other and she understands that..|`|afedd486ca16f44c561f2ec14e3ea8f2aa	so u r in love with best friend sister.........look buddy try to sort out that issue calmly.....its quite often with guys that they fall in love with there friends sis.....first you should ask your friend about that.what would be his reaction towards this issue.because giving up with friend just for girl is the most stupid things which guys usually do.friends are more and most important part of our outside world.just take my advice seriously|`|ReaD6u4paa	if you love her truly then i should not be a problem to risk eveything to get her.try to call to her|`|lhQB3Klzaa	tell her, wat u got to lose and risk it

There are so many other thing you could be tickling ;)<br>  <br>  and just to answer your question, it seems obvious, shaven and smooth...|`|5kIUmkz8aa	ahhhhhhh, i never get a chance to know what its like with hairy armpits as i stay shaved.|`|Mkn6vYO0aa	Shaven...because when not shaven they itch<br>  Would you say your dumb or your dumber?|`|2mBupx1baa	I have a question for you ... why would you put this in the marriage and divorce section!!
KX5ALUzWaa	:| Rofl...<br>  <br>  I've never been tickled with hairy armpits...Thats just plain disturbing<br>  I'm guessing...smooth?<br>  <br>  I'm much more ticklish on my feet and neck anyway :) why not tickle them there instead...<br>  x|`|CRsSw0ssaa	Hairy. Takes the biscuit.|`|65ojSBXgaa	Of course when shaved smoothly personally I dont like it when my man tickles me anywhere  :-)|`|xhDdYnHTaa	My armpits are always shaved but, yeah, they tend to be extra sensitive right after I shave them!|`|dalNxu8zaa	gross...<br>  most girls dont have hair there so i dont think this is a good question|`|WFRooU7Maa	Why??????|`|THwVItleaa	Is that supposed to be a tricky qu.bc if it is shaven then it would have to be smooth not hairy.|`|0xMUStgiaa	lolwut|`|M4BUjVTnaa	well i really don't think that makes a difference. I'm not too ticklish there any way. They sweat more when their hairy though. If that helps any..|`|cFB6f7Khaa	they get them in the right spot|`|7xl4Cuhwaa	nmore ticklish when yoooh dont shave duh|`|fecUjSr1aa	i don't tickle ...
B1sT1t44aa	If you know that you will never do it again move on and forgive yourself.<br>  It is not your fault that he was incarcerated for 3 years of your life so hopefully he will stay right and from this point on will always be there for you?<br>  Telling him will not change the fact that what you did happened but only make him miserable at the expense of making yourself feel better.<br>  I am one that believes in honesty but in your situation I would just learn how to put it behind me and forget it.<br>  Some things are better left unsaid especially when you both are going to continue on and restart your lives.<br>  From this point on just be the best wife that you can be and be there for him as I hope he will be for you.<br>  It was a one time thing so just let it go and do not add anymore stress to the relationship and put yourself through the issues he may have with it.|`|BUET39wmaa	well doing it was selfish of you and telling him would also be selfish of you.<br>  it was one time and you obviously won't do it again because you feel like garbage so telling him would get rid of your guilt but you would create a much bigger problem by telling him, trust me.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	If there's no chance for him to ever know, keep it to yourself. Confession is good for the soul but not so good for your mate. Why tell him? If it was just that one time and you are sorry, let it go. What good would come from him knowing?|`|AA11447210	What purpose would telling him serve? If you repeat offend, then you should just leave him. If this was a one time screw up and now you know how sh*tty it is to cheat, keep it to yourself. The guilt will be your punishment...right now you want to tell him so that you'll feel better, not taking into consideration how you'll hurt him.<br>  <br>  Karma...what goes around, comes around. You've got it to come around on you. Keep your mouth shut and be faithful from now on. If you can't manage that, then end the marriage so you're free to screw whomever you desire, without guilt (as long as they are single too).|`|AA11132696	Lier you screw up big time now dont think he will take you back.You better leave that poor guy alone.Imagine he is in jail enough hell for him and then you cheat on him coww!! That is horrible.Dont even dare to ask to forgive you that will be shameless.Ay friend you are hmm terrible.Look what you did .There is nothing to be done here.You tell him the truth and wait  for war.YOU HAVE TO THINK BEFORE YOU DO THINGS DEARR.NOW TELL ME HOW HANDSOME WAS  THE OTHER CROCODILE? JUST TO MAKE YOU LAUGH CAUSE THERE IS NO SALVATION FOR YOU SISTER ON THIS ONE.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I think this is a secret that needs to stay with you.  Why would you want to drive him crazy with that type of information.|`|hZWKe1oVaa	His fault he's in jail.Don't tell him|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	I get the impression that you want to tell him so he will want a divorce, because that is what you really want since he is in jail.  And if that is not the case and he is due to get out soon, you should not tell him because I am sure he will want to beat you up and then divorce you.  Good Luck keeping your guilt in check.|`|7q7fsYNaaa	thats pretty messed up :/ <br>  why would you do that in the first place .. what kind of wife are you ..<br>  jk.. no need to get all mean.. <br>  but i seriously dont think you should tell .. him unless u want your relationship to go down the drain then yeah go for it.. and also if u just want to have fun and not stay loyal to one guy then yeah do it..<br>   but otherwise dont..|`|AA11601031	No.  Defintely not.  You're telling him to make YOU feel better - it certainly won't make him feel better.  Live with the guilt - it's your punishment.  Then forgive yourself and never do it again.|`|AA11783622	Well, that would certainly end your marriage, and that might just be a good thing.  Why would you stay married to someone in jail?<br>  <br>  Aren't you worth someone better??????|`|ZtfN4J6taa	Why bother, I am sure he has figured it out already, He probably has been unfaithful to you in jail, so both of you are even.|`|Jn0Los9baa	I think that you should tell him because he's thinking that you was being faithful. Plus put the shoe on the other foot would you want him to tell you.|`|KmC0K59taa	It will mess everything up if you tell him.  He'll hold it over your head forever and never trust you again.|`|W0U56os3aa	Wow, that's a tough question. I understand how you might feel guilty in that sort of situation. Being away from your husband for so long must have been very difficult.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should get advice from your clergyman or something. If you do want to handle it on your own, my advice would be to tell him if you intend to keep the marriage together.<br>  <br>  Everybody makes mistakes. You made one, and he obviously made one too to become incarcerated. I have family in the criminal justice system, and I have seen dozens and dozens of men and women come out and STAY out of prison, which is the real challenge. If you are sure that telling your husband isn't going to cause him to reoffend (out of anger or substance abuse problems, for example), then I would find a good time and place, explain what happened and why, explain how guilty you feel and that you want to continue your marriage.<br>  <br>  Do expect him to be hurt, though. Do expect him to be angry. He might need a little time to come to terms with it. I believe that if you both keep your cool, you can get through this together, and maybe even become a stronger couple because of it.|`|y3cYAwZNaa	I disagree with Jillian, it is not her place to judge and predict how your husband will react. No one knows that, not even you. I have been in your shoes. I decided to tell my husband. Some may think that was selfish, because I now got to clear my conscience. I chose to tell him because the guilt was tearing me apart, I had thrown away my virtues, my morals when I knowingly chose to keep something like that from him. The fact that you even asked the question suggests that you want this burden off your shoulders. I know a few couples who have worked through infidelity, so your marriage doesn't have to be over. In fact, I know of 2 cases, where the marriage is now stronger. <br>  <br>  Your husband may be a lot more understanding than you are giving him credit for. I suspect that you've stood by him all these years is something he does not take lightly, there are a number of women who wouldn't have. To me, you sound like you are ready to let go of this burden that is weighing you down emotionally, therefore hindering your full potential at giving your relationship your all. I want to say, go for it! Don't let guilt and shame control you anymore!<br>  <br>  Was reading some of the new answers and wanted to say that so many of those people are PREDICTING and JUDGING your husband's behaviour/reaction. If you havent' been in that situation, you actually don't know what you're going to do in it, you can guess, but it's different when you're there. Look inside yourself, inside your heart and do this for you, whether it's to not tell him or to tell him. Do it for you. If you are guilt ridden, ashamed and feel unworthy of him, how much good will you be in a marriage like that?? It may tear you apart even more.|`|Z1AK2A4Baa	NO Your guilt is your payback. Telling him is passing your punishment onto him. Men are insecure when it comes to sex and they also have a double standard. He wants to believe that he is the only one for you. When he gets out, he needs to think about getting a job, straightening out his life, taking care of you and the family not worrying about one stupid night you had.|`|rDnQ6MNYaa	Well that would help you feel better.  <br>  <br>  However, it does nothing for your husband does it.  You would only be hurting him more than you want to. In addition, what would the outcome be...some reluctant forgiveness, or perhaps divorce?  <br>  <br>  Personally I would keep my mouth shut and let the guilt in me remind me why I wouldn't do it a second time.|`|hdTztmKDaa	I dont know the reasoning for his incarceration, but there is no excuse for cheating. You need to tell him right away. If the shoe were on the other foot, you would want to know. And dont tell him just because you want that guilty feeling to go away. Tell him because he deserves to know. Its the right thing to do.|`|b74d692feeebce552bcfcdfcb6a76acdaa	how did you come to find out he was going to jail?  Did he cheat you on the time he was incarcerated?  The Big Answer to your question is NO you shouldnt tell him unless you want to end your relationship. <br>  Honestly you are in a lose lose situation, dont tell and feel guilty, tell and you risk losing a loser?|`|IFraOYwRaa	Don't tell him, but you should make it up to him by giving him the best sex you can.<br>  <br>  But if you tell him, keep in mind that he'll see it as a "Get some side action for free" card and you don't know when he will cash it in.|`|5ace377e3ba7c902d796bbd6c9c815e5aa	No you should not tell him....tell a shrink instead<br>  <br>  If you really love him and want to be with him this will not help...it will only ruin your relationship more.<br>  <br>  Your telling him will not help your guilt.  Just look past it towards the future|`|a122b01b1756aff821e49bd8aa9c60d0aa	If it was a one time mistake, then forget about it and don't tell him.  If you plan on continuing to do it, then I would say you'd need to tell him.|`|oAv7Mv3raa	If he is jail for life then I would. I bet he has cheated also in jail.|`|n9Uu7l44aa	yes! you should tell him and always be honest with your partner...always. thats the only way to be.at least thats my opinion =)|`|Us0XGMwfaa	don't tell him.  It would do no good.  Sure you feel remorse but you'll get over it.  Why hurt him more by telling him.|`|4c6467d39aad002e60f9478ee17ff69faa	Depends on what he was in jail for? Definitely, no if he'd stab someone for looking at him wrong.|`|GmF4iAFXaa	tell him. There should be no lies in a marriage.<br>  And look very guilty.|`|lIUvDTcjaa	be straight wit yo nig!|`|L0Quyt1Gaa	If he did the same to you how would you feel?
7VceSwxIaa	If this is a mutual thing no and as long as you guys are using protection and you guys are aware of each others sexual background information. But all in all let fun be fun.|`|HqSWw6etaa	yeah I think it is because you really shouldnt be degrading yourself like you doing...thats not a good thing ya know. If your just hooking up then you might as well be a prostitute.=]|`|F3LBgfvwaa	If it's consensual and legal and you are both enjoying yourselves, I see nothing wrong with hope. Be safe.|`|q7sX6ACraa	if your just having fun then its okay ..|`|TPhIWWniaa	It is bad in the eyes of God because when you have sex with someone you technically become one in the body and you should be choosy with whom you become one.  That is why it is best to wait until you get married because if you've accepted to marry this person then you are willing to become one with this person in soul, body, spirit and mind.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	No, it isn't bad, but make sure you and him are on the same page.<br>  If you’re not on the same page someone might catch feelings for the other and potential get hurt.|`|xjv02joXaa	You're worth more than that. Don't hook up with him. You deserve someone who wants to make a comittment to you, because he thinks your worth it.|`|4293T0LNaa	so ur fu*k buddies, nope. there's nothing wrong, until one gets tooo attached then it turns into a big huge mess,
XUoI5ctcaa	FWB = Fail.<br>  Get a boyfriend.<br>  Then you can have sex whenever you want, yay!|`|n9Uu7l44aa	**HaY CuTiE! cOmE GeT mY nOoKiE or somethin like that.....idk..ive never had to do that.|`|SRZza0cWaa	why are you doing this to yourself.. why don't you just get yourself a nice BF and stop or this benefit nonsense.. he wont respect you cos he knows that's you gotta offer... think abut it..!!|`|e27C5qAjaa	Get yourself a new friend with benefits. drop this sissy.
pdbc4souaa	So what are you looking for, a fun-loving bed buddy or someone you can talk to and have a long-term friendship with?<br>  <br>  I don't see it having any substance, frankly. You can't do any worse than what you've got now. A crush on a goofy guy who won't talk to you.
SO7zRZK9aa	Stuppedest?|`|oojO4WAraa	Because basically - he is a jerk.  Dump him and find someone else.  He can stay mad as long as he likes.|`|cn04Dmzeaa	If I'm mad at my woman it's for a reason because I rarely get mad and if I stay mad at her it's because she's either failing to understand my side of the situation or just refusing to do so.<br>  You are no longer single and your guy friends and you "talking a lot of smack" is no longer acceptable, especially if it's in messages and not just on your profile.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'd feel similar if you, yourself was placed in that situation.<br>  <br>  I was in your position a long time ago but I didn't argue that I was right to continue to "talk a lot of smack" in messages to girls, especially messages because it's more on a private level, so I stopped because I cared enough.<br>  <br>  If I were him, I'd dump you, either that or you need to realize that you shouldn't be in a relationship because you might be too immature and too into your messages|`|DldJ9W5saa	What would you do if you were in his situation? Would you be mad if girls were leaving the same kind of comments on his page?|`|ff545BLyaa	It must not be stupid to him and honestly I think you are being a little critical of him.  Just leave him alone for awhile and apologize.  Peace...|`|ezT7xruoaa	haha, i guess its just that they get insecure. reassure him.
Sl0UPcheaa	Break up with him if you plan on cheating on him.|`|BUET39wmaa	the question is not about being faithful but about devoting any more time to this relationship???|`|WvOvoxLxaa	If you are married, yes, if not then why waste your time being unhappy. No problems ever got worked out by being silent.  The next time he starts something, you walk outside and come back in and give him the silent treatment.  That will surprise him to have the tables turned.   I would tell him once that I will not be treated like this, then stick by your word and don't get treated badly.|`|AA11502346	There is no reason to cheat on someone, ever.  Even if they do something to screw up, always stay faithful.  <br>  <br>  With that in mind, I would talk to this person in a non-confrontational way and ask as to why he/she is behaving like this.  If you can't get a straight answer, I would suggest counseling or break off the relationship completely.|`|tFcsLR7Maa	I hate that my man does the same sh*t to me. <br>  I've thought about cheating, but i would never do it. I love him to much. <br>  <br>  Don't date outside of your element. Stick with fire signs. Earth may not be good for you.|`|6aaCfPJiaa	no|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	Counseling is what I'd suggest. Ask him to go with you. If he will not, then go alone. You'll come to terms with what you should do. If you were married, or if you have kids, you have more incentive to work on this problem. If you do not have kids, though, unless he's willing to go get help with his temper, I'd leave. Really. Because if he starts arguments for no reason, it's a symptom he's either on drugs/alcohol or feeling guilty about his own behavior (as in cheating on you, gambling, or doing something else shady).|`|yhQPAQaFaa	hold on a minute. your question is should i stay faithful. to me that means cheating which i totally dissagree with. maybe you should consider talking to him or leaving him if its that bad. im sure nobody deserves to be cheated on and did you ever think he might have manic deppression or just be stressed. just talk to him 1st before you cheat on the guy|`|5ZVsl4fAaa	Don't cheat nothing good ever comes from it. How would you feel if he was cheating on you? You should tell him that it bothers you and see if he is willing to change. If not you have to decide if you can live with it or if you should end it.|`|B0GsaV8saa	What's the point?<br>  Your getting into argument's for <br>  no reason, that's pathetic.|`|Lc9KCnkoaa	just break up. dont cheat!! <br>  thats the worst thing you could ever do to someone, really it is!
nMWtEmEFaa	Does he have a religion, if so, is it a different religion than your own?<br>  Does he believe in a deity (god), ghost, the paranormal?<br>  What does he think about abortion, is it evil, or is it okay?<br>  Is he going to wait for sex until marriage?<br>  Does he believe in marriage?<br>  Does he want any children in the future?<br>  If so, how many?<br>  If not, do you think you can stay with someone who doesn't want children?<br>  What does he think about online dating?<br>  Is he for, or against gay marriage?<br>  Is he for, or against the death penalty?<br>  <br>  Basically, just ask him some very heavy and deep questions. These are the kind of questions that reveal someone's character really good.
GxSnVRAOaa	I have a sister with serious problems.  My father's solution: "She is what she is, let it go," so after following that advice for years...she's stolen from me, lied to me, prostituted herself...I am not saying that your niece is the same- but letting people behave badly only encourages it.  Letting things "slide" really only damages the relationship more.  She doesn't have to say "Hey Sis, you're a b**** and I never want to see you again," but maybe she should say, "You know what, I'm not in the mood to pretend like I enjoy our time together when you act like this,"|`|KBfW5A8Kaa	I would tell your niece you should go ahead with the plans.  Chances are something will distract them and they'll forget about the silly little fight.  They should cherish the opportunity of getting to spend time together, seeing as how old they are the probably will be seeing less of each other eventually.  Hope this helps!|`|140c30a72ab2e0f348f3894510c4b486aa	If your nieces were 11 and 13, I could understand your sister (their Mum) giving the "let it slide" line - but these are grown up women! The 22 year old acts the way she does because she told it's alright to be mean... every time the Mum tells little sister has to suck it up and let it slide. <br>  The younger niece has to tell her mum why she doesn't want to spend the weekend with someone who makes her feel bad about herself. When the older sister grows up and learns how to treat the people who love her with respect and kindness... then they can hang out. it's not your sisters business and she should butt out!|`|63QoqvPWaa	In my experience with this sort of thing, there is a clear boundry between help and 'HELPFULNESS' in regards towards the welfare and well being of both parties involved in this type of sibling disagreement. There are different scenarios you could play in your head of which will be the better route for you to take for the better outcome, and to bring resolve to this situation. Ideally a calm approach would be the best way,  (i.e sit them down and pat them on the shoulders and tell them to not be so silly and tell them to make up) but in all reality you should just pull them both aside seperately, look at each of them straight in the eye, at knife point, and tell them to slowly get on their knees and unzip your jeans, where they'll then start to roll their supple tongues, and lap up with their soft thick lips your organs throbbing veins.<br>  <br>  Life is too short to beat around the bush.|`|d3icrU62aa	I would tell her to still meet up her sister like her mom wants her to do but rather than letting it slide...they could calmly, maturely talk about the issues over lunch....this way she does what her mom said and she gets her way too.|`|Sxlcyua5aa	You need to stay out of it as much as possible.   By this, tell your niece that she needs to talk to her mom further about this and let her know how her sister is affecting her.   In other words she is an adult and she needs to start handling these things in an adult manner.   If you offer advice that goes against her mother (your sister) then you may ruin your relationship with her.   Hopefully all three can sit down and discuss the issues and get them resolved together.   Good luck.
OFJFLs2Paa	You really don't have to try all you have to do is ask her. There is nothing to it at all! Ask her in person! I think that it will be better that way! I wish you good luck trying to win her over! =D
PyRxe9B2aa	Decent men never cheat.Indecent men cheat.  It's as easy as that. The problem is dividing the two up and figuring out who the cheaters are. Listen more and talk less when your boyfriend talks about things. He will give it away sooner or later.  Tell him about your friend whose boyfriend cheated on her and she doesn't know if she wants to stay with him or not.  If he says he deserves another chance he  is questionable. Most guys will drop a girl who cheats instantly. Ask him why his past romances failed, Sometimes you have to read between the lines. Decent men are all over the place. They are not as flashy and wordy and smooth as the cheaters. Talk to your friends and listen to every word.  If you end up with a cheater they can make your life hell. I know I married a cheater and lost several years before I had my life right. I hope you make no error. Good luck By the way if you tell a man you are worried about being cheated on they will ALL say I would never do that.|`|AA11447210	Humans are not naturally monogamous, but there are plenty who are comfortable being so (male and female). There are plenty of men who won't cheat, they just get it out of their system (variety) before settling into a more serious relationship.<br>  <br>  Plenty of women cheat also...it's sad but true. Staying faithful isn't very important to some, but they often end up alone in the end.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	no self respecting women would try to get used to being cheated on. its true a lot of guys cheat but not all. When your man cheats its time to move on cause it gets easier the next time and don't take it personally some guys get their self esteem from how many women they bang|`|b3zGfYMpaa	If your the type of girl that wants to be the one and only and not anyone next to somone else than you dont have to be. No, not all guys are like that, but the reality is, sometimes the faithful guys are just harder to find.|`|jrdtQi04aa	There are some men who are very faithful, and they never, ever cheat.  If a man really loves you, he usually doesnt cheat if he has the maturity to think more of his relationship than his penis.  Some men never reach that state of maturity because they are just cheats.  I used to deal with guy who was a cheat, and I didnt really care, because when he got caught, I went shopping!  I didnt like it, and I never would have married him, but I did get some great clothes out of his being a dumb butt.|`|cfnuDybfaa	Some men can and will be faithful, but most of them wont. See I was in a relationship and I had to accept that my boyfriend was cheating on me. The only reason why I didnt speak up about it was because I loved him so much.|`|mZyFe2T8aa	There are faithful men but usually they are also God fearing.|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	No youre being realisitic.  theyre supposed to but some always dont|`|POHWTDPRaa	No we don't. There are plenty of men who won't run around on you.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I wonder that sometimes too, if all men cheat.  It seems like it's always all over the media.  I've been with my husband for 8 years and so far he hasn't ever come close to cheating on me.  My dad has been with my step-mom for 20 or 21 years and has never cheating on her.  So I think it is reasonable to expect your man to not cheat on you.  I think when you start thinking it is inevitable, it becomes inevitable, if you know what I mean.
GXeA6cBRaa	yeah...it shows the girl is confident and not afraid to take that first move. guys that are shy find that really attractive|`|ff545BLyaa	If he is shy then you can go ahead and ask him out but personally I feel less like the man in the relationship if I don't ask the girl out... weird huh but that is just me and I am not saying it is right or how most guys feel... Go for it he will love it especially if he is shy.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Mkq466xdaa	i wish girls would ask guys out more often|`|dm9evixvaa	if he's really shy then it definitely a positive. he'll like that you approached him and saved him from a possibly unnerving experience.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	its nice of you to sak him out,it shows to him taht you're interested..|`|vaIGEVHaaa	i don't care if i ask or if they ask|`|ulUBv22eaa	i like it. it shows she has confidence
5ladPSUsaa	Well what ur saying is that they wont be ur friends anymore well i think that u  need them if the cant back u up and its a shame that u didnt have any friends because u sound really nice and i dnt think that u should even be friends with them because if they cant trust u or believe u over something stupid that is pointless then y be friends with them i hope i help and tell ur friends good luck because they will be lost with out u|`|PXyPnLbFaa	<a href="http://www.myspace.com/457131313" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/457131313</a> <br>  <br>  ^idk if you have a myspace but i was recommended to that myspace site yesterday and it really helped me with my problem, maybe it will help you out as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope it works.
t6N64bBYaa	It doesn't matter how tall you are. Some women like their men shorter. But if you feel awkward/ uncomfortable, try going out with girls closer to your size. But if the only reason she doesn't want to go out with you is because you're smaller then you're too good for her anyway. Everyone secretly wishes they were small. <br>  <br>  It's good to be fun sized ;)|`|ReaD6u4paa	dont worry you will grow up.you are stil a kid.do awimming it help to make you taller.trust me..i am 6ft1 and a former swimming champion(national level)|`|Jn0Los9baa	Just be you because a person should like you for you.|`|DN6XtoViaa	age 13 is about the time boys hit their growth spurt! so don't worry you will shoot up in no time.<br>  <br>  as for the going out thing? don't stress about it.. you are still very young! enjoy being a boy :) and if they don't like you for your height then that is the type of people you want to stay away from...|`|0haWIfVMaa	You are only 13, don't worry about dating. It's not like you will find a serious relationship at that age anyway.
Pwg8IUbTaa	OK,take it nice and slow, make sure your bf has had some thing to drink ( not too much!),then sit him down and take things nice and slow,<br>  tease him,take your clothes off bit by bit...You want it to lead to sex,then if it was my bf, I would sit on his knee and start...well do I need to say more..... Have a good time|`|L7wq8Ja7aa	I would suggest hav lots to drink the stronger the better, get naked and wobble,
oQcrq39Eaa	There are always two sides to a story.  What does she accuse you of?  What does she say irritates her?<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are in a tough situation but she resents you for something and you are lowering yourself to her level of confrontation. When she pipes up simply say, in a calm voice that you are sorry she feels that way but she is entitled to her opinion but you want to begin to have a better relationshipwithout all the drama and that it will take some adjustments from both of you to begin to discuss your differences maturely.
nMWtEmEFaa	Nope, not me, I love having my boyfriend around me all day long.<br>  <br>  It's not any different than living together, is it?<br>  <br>  Some people feel like they need to have some time off from their partners though, like you. There's nothing wrong with that, except you need to tell your partner that you don't want to see them every day, or all the time. You want your alone time every day, where he's not present in.<br>  <br>  It's actually a very important aspect of the relationship. If both of you are on the same page with how many times you want to see each other, that's great! However, if both of you have different opinions about how many times you should see each other, that's already a start for a disaster waiting to happen.<br>  <br>  So always talk to your partner about how many times you should see each other.|`|hdTztmKDaa	If you dumped him, then whats the issue?|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Nope. Not at all. When you have a significant other, that person makes you feel special and loved. <br>  <br>  So why the annoyance? <br>  <br>  And he's hanging around you because he wants you back. But since you don't seem to want him back after dumping him, I also suggest that you don't date for a LONG while until you're more mentally/emotionally mature.
r8VvBxM6aa	I know it's not easy, but once you can block out everyone else's negativity you can focus on your own positivity. If you need, write out a list of things you like about yourself, go shopping and give yourself a makeover. Whatever you do though, do it for you, and not to please him. At the end of the day you have to face yourself, not him.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one on self esteem that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  either search for thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go to the link directly<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7QtfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7Qt...</a>|`|iQqsdl5yaa	Ummm...not good.

QqY8YgGDaa	You grow down|`|ugmtF6Bsaa	You been acting like a lil kid latel dont you think?|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Guys maturity levels are light years behind yours my dear. This will never change. But for a 20 year old to act like a 12 year old is a little extreme. Is his behavior that bad? If so, and it bothers you that much you need to point out the things that bother you when they happen. If not, the more hes going to think that its okay to act so inappropriately. If he doesnt change his ways your going to have to threaten him with a break-up, if he cares he should  at least give a good hard attempt at changing for the better of the relationship. If he still doesnt than reconsider why your with him in the first place by weighing out the good and bad.|`|AA11447210	You accept him as he is, or move on. You can talk to him about what you find childish about him, but chances are if he's not ready to mature you telling him to do so won't change anything.<br>  <br>  If you are not a good match, why are you together?|`|QulgGg5kaa	"Grow up" being truthful and honest is only part of having a successful relationship if he truly loves and cares for you he'll change his ways for you but at the same time still having fun|`|8n3NvYQwaa	g r o w  up ! ! !  THATS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY....   GOOD LUCK  GRANT M|`|ZuLjIHgUaa	Y’know, if you’re his first girlfriend, you could try making it a little fun to teach him how to be in a relationship. I’d definitely become more vocal about your wants and needs, though. Like, gentle hints, or requests. Next time you guys go out to dinner, tell him you’d like to go Dutch. A little reciprocation, right? But if, in the end, he can’t deliver what you need from him, then I’d suggest moving on, though I hate to say it. It’s important to get what YOU need in addition to the other way around.or Give him a chance, but don’t just swallow your unhappiness. Tell him how you feel.  Good luck, though!|`|eTYfa49Baa	I don't think there is a nice way to tell your boyfriend to grow up, and in some sense i think they never do! lol, you either have to get annoyed with it, and learn to accept it, or you won't be able to at all! lol and if that doesn't work you could throw him a diaper and tell him he is acting two! haha|`|PA7kYyAxaa	HAve a nice sit down with him.

ACecbVghaa	You'd probably have to start on the floor as a sales consultant. They just help people try stuff on, give their opinion on gowns as requested, put gowns back where they came from after trying-on, get gowns for people, etc. Try some of the larger chain stores, David's Bridal will hire anyone with a decent personality as a sales girl. Offer to help in other ways such as stockign merchandise, working in the shoes/veils department, etc. Also, get some letters of recommendation from people in the business if you know any, that never hurts.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	hate to say but your best bet when it comes to working in the wedding industry is apply for an assistant job to a wedding consultant. cause wedding dress shops have to have people who can make alterations. goo luck|`|AA10351134	Depends on what you mean by work with bridal gowns. If you mean you want to sell them to people, applying in the large chain stores is good advice. If you can't get in there right now, try to at least get a retail job (I think employers would love one that's commissioned).<br>  <br>  If you mean you want to design them someday, take classes and learn to sew. Then you should have an easier time with the smaller boutiques.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	In addition to what you have done, you need to create a resume and send it to them!

That just wasted 10 minutes of my life!<br>  <br>  Anyway... its soooo obvious you have wrote all that in such detail so you can show it all to Ms. Pink, or let her "stumble" across it. I believe that is the only reason you went to the effort, so i feel me giving you any advice is pointless, and would be a waste of another 10 minutes of my life.<br>  <br>  I do wish you all the best with it though :)|`|5bf08180c9f9ff092c1cac9f7edea283aa	wow, i couldn't even read half of this BOOK...i was bored after the first two sentences!

vUVxS9Xhaa	I guess it is but a lot of guys will probably be scared to date her because they will have feelings for her and then she might pass on and if that happens it will be a very hard thing to deal with.<br>  <br>  I dont think the scars has anything to do with it, i think these guys are probably worried about protecting their own hearts from being broken. <br>  <br>  Maybe if she goes on a date with a guy she likes she should just enjoy it instead of being too up front about it so early on. <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with keeping some personal details about yourself private early on in a relationship.|`|mVgY2I2Zaa	yeah.. i would. but you know theres more to that.. Theres gotta be attraction and appreciation. Sometimes i like to think of all this chronic diseases as a simple cold or headache.|`|6CPFRnGraa	It's quite possible. There are men that don't care about anything but the person and the person alone, regardless of anything others would consider wrong. You just have to look. It won't be easy, 'cause people can be quite stereotypical or won't look past what's on the outside. Finding someone that doesn't care about looks, or an illness, or anything to that extent, isn't impossible to find, just difficult. Don't let your friend quit, I'm sure she'll find someone. (And yes, I would date someone with terminal cancer, it wouldn't bother me in the slightest. I would do anything and everything I could within my power to keep them happy and let them know I love them). Hope I helped :) Don't give up!!!

tc5XLjUEaa	Compliments!!! Pisces love to be flattered. More than any sign if I'm not mistaken. The best part is, that it can be the most simple little thing too. If anything depending on how deeply passionate the pisces is about learning etc. It should be easy to pull his attention. But you must find a way to keep it, cause just as easily as you capture it, it can disappear. Figure out a way to keep his mind rolling. Flattery my friend!
NGz7R9enaa	Nose - Suntan lotion, travel size tissues for his car <br>  Skin - A new razor, men's lotion, cologne<br>  Lips - An ice cream to cool them off after a long kiss, chap stick<br>  Freckles - Kisses for each of his freckles.. ( that's a hard one)|`|Jsvvm4qsaa	nose- Nice colone <br>  lips- Hershey's kisses
I6dIkhbOaa	My advice is that if you really care for her, you should take it slow and be patient with her. I don't really get the part of her saying "I love you too" if you didn't say you loved her first, unless you were fumbling around trying to tell her how you feel . . . ? Anyway, this new in, I would be careful with the whole "love" talk and air more on the side of "care". Moving on, I am assuming the reason she withdrew from you after you guys had so much fun is fear. I have a friend that just got out of a bad marriage (well, a year ago) where the guy beat her and abused her verbally as well and she doesn't trust even her own judgment now. I am sure your girl is doubting her instincts, the fun and connection she had and felt with you and I'll bet she thinks you are probably too good to be true and that sooner or later you are going to show your "true colors", just like the last guy did. OR she could be afraid that she is too messed up and broken for you and that as you get to know her for real that you may not want her. Broken people are full of fears and insecurities and the only way past it is time and healing. For your sake and for hers, take it slow. If you MEAN it, tell her you can go as slow as she wants and that you will do what she needs. Reassure her that you will not physically harm her and you will do your very best not to hurt her emotionally. Tell her that you don't judge her and it's okay for her not to be perfect. Be very patient and DON'T make promises you can't keep. If you are one of the rare few men that actually don't cheat; assure her that you will be faithful. On the subject of telling her how you feel; I would say you should do it when you are both sober and in a comfortable, low presure situation. If you say it after a drink or four, she will probably think it's just the alcohol or alterior motives speaking. I hope this helps! You sound sweet and genuine and I wish you both the best!|`|xZI6noJiaa	It sounds like she does like you but that she's a little afraid. Of what, I couldn't say. But telling her how you feel might work. Plus if you guys are out drinking if she doesn't react well to what you say, it can always be blamed on the booze, and swept under the rug so to speak. But if you want it to come across genuine, it's best to do it when you guys are sober, especially if you want her to take it seriously.<br>  Just kinda lay it out like hey, we've been hanging out a lot lately and it's really opened my eyes to how much you mean to me... I want to see if this could be more than just friends... I know you just got out of a really bad relationship, but I really needed to tell you this, but I don't want to rush into anything you're not ready for... etc<br>  Who knows, happy endings really do happen.|`|MorbsRp5aa	don't get drunk just tell her how you fill about her and maybe you will get some|`|WIVzkr5xaa	Hell no not when ur getting drunk!!!!!!! Tell her straight up!!!!! Sober!!!!! If a guy told me that when we were getting drunk I would never talk to him again! Tell how u feel she will understand. And if you told her u liked her when you were both drinking u just proved her point that u are a blooke!!!!!!! It will make u look weak!
Ngc0teBqaa	Just try to find a good balance, okay?  <br>  <br>  Don't be too available (calling him all the time, being there whenever he wants you there)  - it comes off as desperate and unattractive.  But don't be so distant that he can't even tell if you're interested.  If you are, he'll get bored and move on.<br>  <br>  Above all, though, don't be anything that you're not.|`|WFRooU7Maa	I don't think so<br>  It just makes it harder to tell if she really likes you<br>  and makes everything harder on the guy|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Sorry.  I've never been into games.  It took me a year to get my wife to go out with me, but there will never be another girl I'll put that much effort into.  Still married to her, so I doubt the situation will ever come up.

2kKr0tzKaa	When you are having a conversation and they can't look you in the eye.<br>  He blushes whenever he is around you.<br>  He acts different around you than he does when he is with just friends.<br>  You catch him looking at you. <br>  When you catch him looking at you, he quickly looks away.<br>  <br>  There are some more signs to. Did he say that he likes you?|`|sC2WFC81aa	He blushes when he talks to you.<br>  HE is the one who messages you first.<br>  He always replies back.<br>  He hugs you alot, and you hug him.<br>  =D<br>  there ya go

He will be served in whatever state he lives in, and if he doesn't contest it, she will go to court in Florida and get her divorce.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Yes, you do not have to be present unless something is contested in court.

wSc7ZdBCaa	Sometimes it isn't easy being "young", like what's happening to you right now. You've invested your time, personality and emotions on this guy, yet you don't feel comfortable speaking "clearly and distinctly".<br>  <br>  There's usually a  whole bunch of stuff that you learn as you get older...like learning to look at things differently than you are doing right now.<br>  <br>  What the heck do I mean? Well, along with age, education, life experience... there's some advice that I got from Cosmo A LONG TIME AGO!  I'm going to put in into my words and "try" and make it as brief as I can.<br>  <br>  If you are healthy inside and out, if you pay attention to how you look, dress, act, talk...if you work at being a "good" person, have a sense of  humor (very important!!!) all of this to the best of your ability... then you are a  "okay - normal - winner" type person.<br>  <br>  When you  meet a person of the opposite sex you will KNOW that you are a desirable person (whether as a friend or "more"). You will tell yourself this as an affirmation everyday until you own it. <br>  <br>  When you look at a potential friend or "more" = instead of saying "OMG are they going to like me", you will say to yourself "OMG am I going to LIKE THEM!!! Is this person someone I would enjoy knowing?"<br>  <br>  When you look at things from this direction, then you can figure out that you've got nothing to lose by being honest and upfront. If you want to know anything you'll just ASK.<br>  <br>  This is where having that sense of humor (along with self-confidence) comes in handy. Hey (fill in the name) since we've been friends for awhile now... would I be totally crazy to assume that we're going to the prom together?" Because if I am crazy, which means I'm also wrong... then I need to start looking for someone else to go with me that's as crazy as I am!"<br>  <br>  What do you actually have to lose??? You find out exactly where you "are" in the relationship, if he's interested & going to the prom with you or if you are wasting your VALUABLE time on him.  If so, it's just not meant to be and you need to look around you and see what else is "out there".<br>  <br>  Wishing you a great future filled with lots of laughs, experiences and happiness.|`|7urRIYMbaa	you should just casually mention,<br>  "so, have you thought about prom yes"<br>  <br>  and if he says yes.<br>  <br>  say<br>  "awesome,blah blah blah"<br>  <br>  <br>  if he says no<br>  <br>  say<br>  <br>  "alright, thats cool,thanks anyways"<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!!<br>  <br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  paige.

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	wait what?<br>  <br>  your actual question is how much an engagment ring is (anywhere from $50 to $50million probably) but then you ask something completly differant in the actual info part.  what did you really want to know?<br>  <br>  if your engaged, your girlfriend becomes your  fiance<br>  <br>  but due to the large number of grammatical inaccuraces, im not even entirely sure what your asking.  consider going back to school and educating yourself a bit more before you become engaged|`|BUET39wmaa	wha????<br>  <br>  you are too young to be playing grown up|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Most people in the US spend between 2000-4000 dollars on an engagement ring.  You can get a decent diamond stone 1/3rd carat in gold starting at 600.  Call her your fiancee.

Or you got married this past Summer?  If you are already married then she is your wife.  If you are engaged she is your fiancee.  If you are not engaged she is your girlfriend.  Why would you get in trouble?  If you are over 18 you are legally allowed to wed - not that I'm saying it's a good idea when you are so young and have such bad grammar.  <br>  <br>  To answer your other question ... an engagement ring can cost any price depending on what metal is used, what stone, and what size of stone, etc.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	i dont really understand this question. #1 you have very poor grammar. and if you are engaged she is your fiancee. and if your worried about getting in trouble with your parents for being engaged your obviously not mature enought to get married and you still feel like a child worried about getting in trouble. and rings can cost anything...from $1-1Billion..it all depends.|`|d02gJC1aaa	general rule is for he ring to cost 3 months earnings.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	An engagement ring...well buy what you can afford. 1/2 carrot diamond is the average size.

jrdtQi04aa	Um... I would act like I didnt get any tea again, and ask him if he has an extra one.  That should get him over the offense.  Dont give it back this time though.  Also, if he doesnt have any, tell him in a cute way, "well, that's the only reason i ever gave it back to you, so you could help me out again someday"  You know, be cute with it, and that will take the sting out of it.  That may also open the door for more conversation.|`|65ojSBXgaa	I think he did take offense because he got something for you. The way he sees is 1: He was thinking of you 2: and he went out of his way and brought it for you because he cares. And what did you do? Well you didnt see it like anything and you carelessly gave it back. What kind of a guy would do that for you? Ask yourself that.

But, you should have said at the time he gave it to you "Oh, thanks!  I'll bring you one to replace this tomorrow".  Then, he could have told you to forget it, or said "cool".  You would have known how he would react.<br>  <br>  It's a tea bag.  It is not something that cost him an arm and a leg.  99% of folks would have blown it off as a nothing exchange, and while many may have given it back, most of the "givers" would have said "that's not necessary".<br>  <br>  So, it isn't offensive.  It wasn't that he was offended.  He didn't even think about it after he gave you the tea bag.  It was out of his mind.|`|WFRooU7Maa	No it isn't offensive,<br>  You just sound like your being friendly<br>  don't look too much into it|`|cfnuDybfaa	Yea thats kind of offensive.

Believe it or not, not everyone wants to go to the US, so find a girl who won't mind settling in dubai. If ur a doctor and will earn much, most women would love to marry u based on that solely...and of course, u won't be in india. The US seems to be  the golden ticket, but there are girls who'll settle for anywhere, but india...and they'll also like the fact that they can go home much more, since india is closer, and most ppl who want to be NRI's want the homey feel, w/o it being home, and if dubai is as indianized as u say, then most women would love that, because it's what they're used to, and also, they'll love the higher standard of living.<br>  <br>  The US is great for the bachelor, but most married indian guys don't like it too much. They say their women loose their indianess and adapt to the US culture. They lament loosing the sweet indian girl they married because she's turned into a US woman after having a couple of kids.
vVh7ex7daa	Firstly he sounds like the type of person who will be quite defensive if you tell him your problems and then you will end up back where you are now?<br>  <br>  You need to sit him donw and let him know you mean business. First though you need to decide what you want from him because you cant just go in all guns blazing and argue with him and not have a solid plan.<br>  <br>  Right down your points bullet form if you have to and tell him exactly what you feel he is doing wrong and then tell him what would make you feel better and tell him you are willing to come to some compromise like he stays home with the kids certain times and then vice versa but you also make time for each other. <br>  <br>  It is very important to try and sort this straight awya but be firm and let him know you literally will not stand for one mroe second of it. Dont give him an ultimatum or anything cos that is likely to just make him mad. Just siot down with him be his wife, his friend and just talk.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	He did not become this way overnight.

Have you talked to him about his behavior?  Have you made it know that you need more "you" time and tried to work out a schedule to make it work?  If you say "Yes, I've talked about this until I'm blue in the face", what you've got going on is a man who's way too comfortable with his marriage and assumes that, without tender loving care, it will continue to go on forever.  In many ways, if you're continuing to allow him to act this way, you're teaching him that he's right. <br>  <br>  Remember: we teach people how to treat us.  <br>  <br>  I was in a marriage with someone who did exactly the stuff you're talking about and he got very comfortable in me taking up the slack and picking up the pieces.  That gets old after a while.<br>  <br>  You need to have a very straightforward, clear conversation with him AND whatever you say in that conversation you'll do if he doesn't make adjustments, you need to STICK to.  Any falling back into old patterns will show him that you don't mean what you say.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, I know what it's like to have a new baby and it can be suffocating to not have "you" time, especially in these early stages.  Do what you have to to get the you time you need.<br>  <br>  All the best!|`|QVj2JwWKaa	You dont think he is messing around at all?<br>  <br>  And if he has hardly spent time around you and baby, would he be able to be confidant enough to take care of baby? <br>  <br>  Would you not worry just as much to know this husband of yours is finally home taking care of baby, but he's never actually around to really have learned...(I know a bit harsh, but I see it that way)<br>  <br>  Its like he doesnt even want to take care of his own child! That is disgusting!|`|ze7xiJwTaa	That sucks. My ex-husband was the same way (and he's an "ex" for a reason). If I were you I would tell him NO WAY. That this time it is HIS responsibility to stay home and take care of your daughter. If you are not comfortable with her staying with your sister in law then by all means do not bend on that one. If he doesn't agree, well girl you need to seriously evaluate your relationship and if you want to be with someone who does not consider your needs as important as his. It's a crappy place to be in. I feel ya.
IqUwHmvVaa	I would give it a chance; although, if you think you are the only girl going along, then I would bring a friend with.<br>  <br>  If you never met his friends before, just to be on the safe side bring someone with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you like him and he likes you, then why give up on the chance then.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JA6apGVFaa	go with him. if you blow him off then he will think that you dont like him and he wont be egar to hang with you............|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	i think that you should go and have fun and it gets awkward than just leave
GEXxB6Sjaa	If he were interested it seems that he would have contacted you or responded to your calls.<br>  If he lied, it was probably to pacify you or his feelings have changed since he's been gone. I would leave it alone; if he lied to you or his feelings have changed, then he will lie again. You deserve someone who feels the same way about you that you do about them.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	First off you don't know that he lied. Life can change so fast now. Things happen. He could be really busy with other things or people. This doesn't make him a liar. This is one of the things that makes men skeptical of dating. Some women expect every breath to mean something. If it doesn't then he lied. Loosen up a little. He obviously was interested. He might still be. You can kill that really quick with that attitude though. That's up to you.

She has a self esteem problem and thinks that the more you have the better. She hasn't figured out that quality is better than quantity.  So if you want to date someone and they want to date you, there is nothing  holding you back.

gO9tl2uhaa	Well, first of all, you're not alone. Most guys don't know how to express feelings. And it's a problem alright since most girls are very insecure in this situation.<br>  <br>  Now, if you want to get him to talk, you NEED to stop making this personal. I know, it's hard - let's just say it's A LOT easier said than done. But the fact is it's not a trust issue. I'm sure you're always there for him - taking care of him - and he knows it.<br>  <br>  But the fact is IF you take this personally, it'll hurt you and emotions will come in. And when emotions come in, it's never a good thing. There's a tension and then there's a fight. You blame him for not opening up, and bang! you hurt him and loose his trust for real.<br>  <br>  If you want to help him opening up, you need to help him fight his demons, not push him in the black hole so he can fight alone. And in order to do that, it takes patience.<br>  <br>  A lot of patience, which, from your words, I believe you don't have. Some guys open up after YEARS. Is YOUR burden to open him up? No. But, if and only if he's the love of your life, you'll find the strength to be patient. <br>  <br>  So, about him! You didn't talk about which subject he's uncomfortable with. My usual guess is parents. Either mother or father or both didn't have a close relationship with their son or one with no feelings expressed. <br>  <br>  Another fact is you won't crack him open anytime soon. He's in a shell  and there isn't much you CAN do (you're no therapist - neither am I for that matter). You need to make him realize something from the start, something like " I'd really like it if you would talk about your fears, the things that hurt you. If you're not ready to talk about it, it's very okay. I'm there for you whenever you'll want to talk"<br>  <br>  Again, you don't tell him that AFTER a fight. There has to be no emotion on your side behind this. Only support. <br>  <br>  You can also suggest (by suggest, I do NOT mean push him, pressure him or ask him every week) to seek counseling. However, this is risky. Most people perceive therapist as a bad thing, for the crazy ones. Also, a lot of them resent the person who suggested that - they feel unappreciated, as if the person wanted them to change. AGAIN, DO NOT BRING THAT AFTER A FIGHT. NO TENSION, NO EMOTIONS BUT SUPPORT! I can't say it enough. Most girls don't get it and end up losing trust which, in the end, resorts to losing the relationship. <br>  <br>  Now, before you do any of this, you need to be very true to yourself, not pretend or convince yourself. Do you really love him? Are you ready to carry that burden? It's not easy and most people fail. I did, many times, as I was convincing myself that I was in love with the person I was with and I ended up resenting her. The majority can't be true to themselves; it's hard to see the things as they are. We love to see things as they should be. But it isn't a good thing<br>  <br>  But you need to take this seriously, because you're about to touch something that he doesn't want to take a look at; which means it isn't pretty. It has hurt him before and he doesn't want to get hurt again because of this. So either you choose to completely help him or you let this go.|`|WFRooU7Maa	IT is good for guys to avoid certain questions<br>  <br>  But some people like their privacy and personal space more than others<br>  It he doesn't open up naturally, then you should ask him more questions<br>  and hint that he needs to open up<br>  <br>  but don't try to force him to|`|XUoI5ctcaa	Be patient and be nice.<br>  Tell him in a kind way that you want him to be able to trust you, and that you just want to help him out.<br>  If you force it on him, he's going to feel bad about it and not open up.|`|zyw4i3kRaa	Put out|`|CRsSw0ssaa	Get him drunk.|`|IOXJdCvSaa	Tell him what you asked us<br>  <br>  Because, out of anybody in the world, he should be able to tell you those things<br>  <br>  You're his lady<br>  No relationship is as close as a man and a woman romantically involved

Is it somethign that can be modified, like a bad haircut or bad skin, or weight issues, by a few simple lifestyle changes?  those are things that you can introduce to this guy if thats the case.<br>  <br>  while many might say you are shallow...they would do the same thing...so...do what you feel would make you happiest.  if you dont NEED a guy that is overly attractive then go with this guy...but if you like him as a person but cannot be with him sexually based on his looks, then it would be a bad relationship an i would not do it.|`|twft9R3Yaa	You don't need to start a relationship.

7e4jxj3Daa	It's usually a lifestyle and can easily change when the right situation arises.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	"slut" is a made up derogatory word. you could label someone a "slut" because of how they dress, how they act, anything, and all of it is undeserved.|`|tT6GMdHiaa	its a reputation|`|sCr2iTczaa	I think it is both because if you act like a slut then you are one. And if you are a slut it is considered a lifestyle because you live breathe sleep and act like a hoe and it is also considered a choice or identity because that is who you are a slut... i am not calling you a slut i am just explaining my answer.|`|ff545BLyaa	It is both lifestyle and identity, but you can always change both.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	It could be either or both. Anyone and everyone can change.|`|LzJJn1m7aa	I think it is a lifestyle only-while it could turn into an identity i firmly believe that is not who they truly are. No girl really wants to be slutty its all a cry or cover up of what they are really crying out for. I THINK a hoe can be changed into a housewife just like a player can be reformed given the right girl. A person cant change someone else if they dont wanna change. Keep that in mind God can change anyone but we cant, its all about the other person.|`|HEzyvbDvaa	Hmm..I say is both I know of one who has this annoying graving of having to put all her annoying innuedos or indescretions on the net..and it is going on for a couple of years now..As a lifestyle let see family and friends have to deal with her as well as her own children..as a housewife I heard her ex husband dumped her because she sucked as that as well...Identity of a prostitute...performs sextual acts for a fee..Goes home to play wifey???|`|lcNPeZOeaa	it's neither. its a choice. everyone has a right to choose the way they live their lives and so, some people become sluts. they CAN change if they want to. i'd say it's more of a lifestyle. i'm sure nobody would like to be "identified" as sluts as there are SOOOO MANY character traits (other than a liking for sensual pleasure) that make people what they are!|`|fecUjSr1aa	its what you are comfortable with. and if the man appreciates you for being slutty, hey, whatever turns him on and you got him hooked .. but of course, its always better if done in moderation and perhaps, in the privacy of a home.|`|4293T0LNaa	its a lifestye. if its a lifestyle then u can stop being a slut, but if its an identity then i guess thats how u were born?? but thatsnot possible.|`|WFRooU7Maa	It is a lifestyle<br>  and it is one that I thoroughly enjoy|`|ygGr1nX7aa	I tend to think of it more as a label applied by other people.|`|dalNxu8zaa	i think its both in a way...<br>  cuz thats how u live and thats how people see u so in a way it becomes and identity...|`|Z51fjE2Raa	An Identity. <br>  <br>  To have the I wouldnt call it 'confidence' to put on facy clothes and think that one looks sexy shows that their inner feelings believe that it is suitable to act and dress in this way- Proof they are slut- outside and in... which shows me that it is part of- at a minimun- of their identity.|`|RLoilwCNaa	It's a lifestyle.

kVnvtgeuaa	I'm an Asian guy who loves BBW. Big girls are so sexy. They have curves in all the right places. They have big breasts, big a$$es, and big tummy. Just thinking of them make me hard. When it come to sex a slim Asian guy like me can penetrate a big girl real deep. Single BBW out there should give Asian guys like me a chance to date.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	There are several reasons that I like BBW'S. They usually have really cute faces. I like the extra meat for love making. It just feels so good. They put forth the extra effort to make you happy. They usually are not high maintenance. They are usually really easy to please, and they will do almost anything to keep their man happy. Add all that up, and it's no wonder why I am a BBW lover.|`|rlEoPwjEaa	Oh they exist...<br>  <br>  as closet bbw admirers..or on the internet.<br>  <br>  im like you...i hardly ever in real life come across a guy that really likes bbw....if i do...he is old enough to be my father...and really creepy.<br>  <br>  if there was an island of bbw admirers and i moved there...knowing my luck..they would all magically disappear..lol|`|xKNjvVLXaa	well i find bigger women 2 be hot...but yeah she should not be VERY VERY OBESE ..i dont mind her being a litlle fat...or maybe considerbaly fat..ACTUALY I DONT MIND a fat gal..<br>  <br>  they are warm,sweet,caring<br>  <br>  and oh yeah..they got wonderful boobs as well..lol|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I know a few guys who like bigger women, and its their curviness and voluptuousness. After all, a bigger woman can still have a figure that has great womanly proportions.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Women of all sizes can be interesting and fun. Personality doesn't come in sizes.|`|faOBk7qtaa	Most likely the big chesticles.|`|qy2CIDmlaa	Here is an Honest answer.  I'm  6ft 2 inches tall and I have an athletic build. Most women think Im very attractive & I have  always been attracted to thick slightly larger women.  I dont mind women who have a little extra  stomach, big butt or extra weight.  I Love curves & to me its voluptuous.  Some skinny women think they are hot & all of them are not. Some are but some definitely are not. Now please keep in mind there is a big difference in Obese/ Sloppy fat and Slightly overweight.  Cleanliness is very very important also. If a woman is very clean with a pretty cute face and a warm funny personality she always has a chance with me. It helps if she smells pleasant too.  Some big women have dirty hair & lets just say dont smell the best. LOL!   Also a Bone skinny girl with a pretty face has no chance at all.  Why?  Because I like curves.   One of my best friends put it this way.. His name is Tim. He always said.. "No Butt!  No Tim".  LOL!  He Likes Hippy girls too but Not  Humoungous Sloppy Fat Hips.  There is such a thing as too much hips, ya know. So to put it in a nut shell.  Some of us Want Something we can hold on to.  No One wants a Bone, except for a Dog. LOL!   Curves are Great!  Oh yeah, and they normally have nice full breast too.  During the winter a slightly larger woman can keep you warmer too. ha ha ha.  All this is just exterior anyway.  The real key is to have a warm, pleasant personality & sense of humor with honesty.  I know women who look great but their personality ruins it.  I hope this help.  I'll Take A Slightly Larger Woman over a Bony Skinnly women any day.  LOL!  I Hope this helps...|`|jLppb1c2aa	big women have more curves and more to love. Bigger boobs too. most guys like skinny or just right women...but those women are mainly snotty and think too much of themselves. Bigger women ten to be smarter and have better conversations.|`|Z51fjE2Raa	What would you define as 'bigger woman'?<br>  <br>  I've asked many guys - at 17/18 they are a bit close minded it seems...<br>  <br>  Between size 12 and 18- are bigger women.<br>  <br>  And other guys have said 14-22<br>  <br>  no one said more than that though...<br>  <br>  :S|`|jrdtQi04aa	They like big boobies!  And anyway, dont nobody want a bone but a dog!

It makes a BBW look so feminine to have that extra weight and extra curves sticking out. I love big bellies, big thighs, butts, etc. It's all just so beautiful to me. If I see a muffin top, a double belly, a double chin, back rolls, or love handles on the right girl (not all big women are beautiful), it is an instant turn-on.|`|HOsF3g0maa	What?<br>  <br>  A lot of men these days are LOVING thicker women. I'm  not thick at all, but believe me I seem more big women with men then ever.
bO2rzfISaa	Too bad. If he wants custody, let him go to court for it, under the circumstances. Sad to say, I think he'll probably lose interest pretty quickly.|`|0TuWYaneaa	Don't let him take him if you don't have a custody or visitation order.He can easily go to another state and say you abandoned the child with him and get full custody.You should tell him to take you to court for visitation.Then get it in a court order saying you have primary custody and get visitation established before letting him take the child anywhere.He has as much right to see the child as you do,Every other weekend,holiday,birthday,etc.But you should have a legal court order before you allow any to protect yourself an the child from any wrong doing or falsified court orders that will lead to a long and expensive custody dispute.

You aren't going to get a fairy tale ending with this guy. That DUI is going to be expensive, and his license will probably be suspended for a while. How's that going, him answering to you? Seems like he's just committing more crimes. Leave. I don't think you will.|`|M7CdgSNSaa	Well if hes in jail hes prob going to stay since he violated his probation. If you want to stay with him then you need to lay down some ground rules for when he gets home. Tell him he needs to get the help he needs for his drinking or you will be forced to take the kids and leave. You need to know that your kids are priority number 1 please make sure they are safe before you decide any thing else.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Yeah, lady, you've set your son up with an outstanding role-model. Get a grip and lose this bum.|`|Wv592rOqaa	Alcoholism has been defined as a disease - and apparently it can be passed on from one generation to the next.  I am currently a medical student and I am currently re-doing a study on effect of alcohol and the liver.  <br>  <br>  Tell your husband that his long-term affair with alcohol is a serious one - he is destroying his liver and kidneys and other vital organs, eventually could end up wearing a bag for his bladder for the rest of his life or fighting for his life when his liver stops working and he will be placed on a transplant list.  <br>  <br>  As for you - take care of yourself - join Al-non (site below) - there is nothing you can do to stop him from drinking - no matter how much he claims he will stop - he won't until he has had enough either by killing himself, killing someone else or drinking himself to death.  You might want to hold off adding more kids to your family because they will be exposed to their dads disease.  He loves you and he loves his kids, he just has not learn to love himself enough to stop yet or he will never learn - but he has do it.  You can leave, but it should be with the term that he stops of you go - and then you must go.  <br>  <br>  In this study we found that a lot of drinkers are allergic to an ingredient found in alcohol due to their gene structure - which is why the Native Americans called it Fire Water - because it burned their soul and mind.|`|2mBupx1baa	He has to be willing to get help himself.  Willing to stop himself.  There is nothing you say or do that will make it go away, if anything it will make it worse.  If I were you I would leave.  You and your children are better of without him, and hopefully that will be what gets his butt in gear and some day in the future you can be together again ((But I don't mean a month.  He should be sober for AT LEAST a year before you even think about it))|`|BwcySP8jaa	Sweet heart the only thing i can tell you is pray an ask god to show you what to do.  that's if you believe in christ, But if you don't then leave him because he is not making it better for you or the kids, you can have  any good man in your lyfe that your kids can call daddy cuss if he love you so well he will try to over come his illness so thats for he dont care gurl don't be no fool you have kids to raise that enough for a woman that trying like your self you think about it. it might hurt but it's for the best.|`|N8EB7YkMaa	I was married to someone with some similar issues for 20 years.  I stayed with him "for the children"  what a mistake.  They will be lucky not to be raging alcoholics themselves. I thought if the kids were older when i left, that it would be easier on them.  Not true.  I think my leaving him messed my kids up worse than his drinking, money problems, infidelity and DUI's.  Leave now or forever hold your peace.  You can make it on one income and he and ONLY he is responsible for his actions and he doesn't need to answer to anyone.  You are right, he will "do what he wants".  You cannot change that.  Listen to your friends and family, I beg you.  They have a much clearer picture.  I wish I had of listened to mine.  I think you already know what you should do.|`|YBwJvDUEaa	You can gain strength and answer through AA. You said that you're like a mother to him and if you left him he will have no one to answer to. He's not listening to you anyway, and his drinking problem was probably there in the beginning. An alcoholic is good at what they do- hiding and lying. Over time he has become a dependent and you are a co-dependent. Go to AA not for him, but for you and your children. You also said that you need both paychecks, There is only one paycheck when he's locked up.
YbwDFvEaaa	The terrible thing is, I put my most recent ex-boyfriend through the same ordeal...<br>  <br>  He was a great person, and I did (do, to a degree) love him very much, but it got to the point where something was just not there anymore...rather than look forward to the fact that I would see him as soon as I got home from work, or when I first woke up in the morning, or be flattered by the fact he wanted to talk to me all the time...I started to find it irritating.<br>  <br>  So, I started to act cold towards him. I started to avoid him...horrible, thoughtless things that I never thought I would do to another person, especially one who I cared so much for...It finally got to the point where we agreed to part ways, although it was apparent that wasn't what he wanted. It was the saddest thing I ever had to do.<br>  <br>  So long as you're being mindful of her needs and just being as good a boyfriend as you have been, there really isn't much else you can do. If she doesn't feel romantically drawn to you anymore, she's going to drift away no matter what you do. Try and do yourself a favor and don't beat yourself up over it. Remember that if it doesn't work out between you two that it doesn't mean you aren't a great person, but that the two of you just are no longer compatible.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I'm sorry for you heartache.|`|ezT7xruoaa	sounds like she either stoped having feelings for you, or there is something major dramatic happening in her life that you don't know about and that is stressing her out. <br>  <br>  stop stalking her and give her some space, since you guys are on a break. you can only wait for her to contact you. keep hoping, but maybe she has already moved on...|`|YFvxJum6aa	You really cant force her to love you.

If you get caught, you parents will never trust you again.|`|OuQizrQ6aa	I used to WD40 the windows and use a home made rope ladder to sneak in and out of my parent's house. I was on the second floor and never got caught. <br>  <br>  You may want to use some grease instead of WD40 and get cheap curtains to go over the blinds so that you can leave the blinds open. Make sure to lock your doors and silence your phones. Have a hiding spot or escape route planned out. If there is no good place to hide, construct one (perhaps a trunk at the foot of the bed). Plan a believable story to tell if you're caught that explains why he is in your room. If you're caught, you will lose your parent's trust which is a priceless commodity at your age. <br>  <br>  Now that I live on my own, I kind of miss sneaking around like that. It can be quite a thrill. Be careful. There's a good reason that your parent's don't want your boyfriend spending the night in your room. You don't want to be a teen mom.|`|iFAlZfVMaa	find another alternative... sneaking him in is NOT the wat to go... <br>  <br>  they may not notice but the repercussions if they DO find him are usually not worth the risk.. find other ways to hook up with him... be creative and don't risk NEVER getting to see him... <br>  <br>  I had friends who had no contact with the outside (phone, internet, TV... NOTHING) world except school for MONTHS because of stupid things like this... <br>  <br>  be smart, you'll think of something...|`|273vsUezaa	This is going to sound mean, but I assure you, it's for your own good.<br>  <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to stop being a stereotypical teenage skank and keep your visits with your boyfriend during Parent-friendly times.<br>  <br>  <br>  The problem with what you are planning to do is that you will end up having sex with this guy, you'll write all over your notebook about how you will be together forever, and you will fight and break up like 20 times. IF you are still together during college, you will both be suffering because you want MORE. Then one of you will cheat on the other, and it will end in a big mess<br>  <br>  Or, if you learn to supress your urges and feelings, you'll become a responsible adult and end up with either this boy or another but you won't regret a thing because you will be happy.|`|T0Sw7mLZaa	You should not be letting anyone in your house without your parents' permission.  It is their house and they make the rules.   How would you feel is someone went into your room without your permission?  It would piss you off.  You should be honest with your parents.   If you are being sexually active, you should not be doing it under their noses.  Have some respect!|`|liHpJvVfaa	How about you just don't do it. You will be in a heap of trouble if your parents catch you and they prob won't let you see him anymore if they do catch you. So then you will end up probably sneaking around even more then because you seem like that kind of a person. How about you keep your pants zipped up and wait to see him till the next day.|`|Ls93X4ufaa	You are asking for big trouble little lady!

Instead of coming up with ridiculously complicated ways of hiding him and sneaking him in and out of your house (as fun as it is!! lol!) you should try and get you parents to like him. Speak to them with respective authority, and they'll take you seriously, they'll respect your decision and hopefully accept him.

Many states have laws that say if a parent has voluntarily not had contact with their child in a certain amount of time, then their rights can automatically be terminated.  Where I live, it's two years, but every states' laws are different.|`|0Kp7SI5oaa	does he pay child support still? i do believe its child abandonment if its failure to communicate and failure to be financially responsible for the child. but researching the laws on that should help out, 4 years is enough time to terminate his rights i think so. it is here in tx.<br>  good luck

SO that can be called fate.  One is obviously preferable to the other if you want to live a long life, get and education, have clean water to drink, be relatively untouched by political violence and famine...  fate.<br>  <br>  but there are plenty of people in SSA or the USA who either make or break their own lives.  There are some success stories in SSA, and so very many failure stories in the US.  Go figure.  In the US, at least, I call that shaping your destiny.<br>  <br>  I am a dreamer, a planner and all of my dreams come true because I make them.  I am a very successful photographer.  That's not fate, that's hard work.  I made myself into that, but I was born in the US, had a great education, supportive parents, etc.  I had a great fated start and I make my life wonderful.<br>  <br>  So it isn't one and not the other.|`|s15819vvaa	theres no such thing as fate...or your fate is written  etc..all that is just bullshit...<br>  you shape your destiny...you can mend it or break it..its all up to you...<br>  you do good you get good<br>  you do bad you suffer for the conseqences...<br>  its simple as that..just believe in yourself  and youll just suceed in life<br>  remember...hardwork...planning...and confidence is the only way to sucess no short cuts...<br>  and never let people change your mind focus on wht you want..<br>  and dont worry ...worrying did no one anygood<br>  all the best!<br>  cheers|`|qTTLALyeaa	Everyone controlls their own destiny!!!|`|cbn16s58aa	You can't sit back and wait for things to happen.

ZuLjIHgUaa	Philippines,These Filipino women are approachable and fun loving people. English is the second official language in the Philippines so communication is not a barrier.. The role of women in the Philippines is explained based on the context of Filipino culture, standards, and mindsets. The Philippines is described to be a nation of strong women, who directly and indirectly run the family unit, businesses, government agencies and haciendas. Although they generally define themselves in the milieu of a masculine dominated post-colonial Asian Catholic society, Filipino women live in a culture that is focused on the community, with the family as the main unit of society. It is in this framework of Philippine hierarchical structure, class differences, religious justifications, and living in a globally developing nation wherein Filipino women struggle for respect. Compared to other parts of Southeast Asia, women in Philippine society have always enjoyed a greater share of legal equality|`|AA10857166	Phillipines cuz they sound so liberal. Thats what i think|`|V2c0dAtwaa	The Phil. would be nice and bad at the same time...<br>  <br>  Good points:<br>  -They believe mostly in monogomous relationships so she's less likely to cheat.<br>  -Language wouldn't be a problem.<br>  -Cultural spice, you'll get oriental with a twist of that latina attitude.<br>  <br>  Bad points:<br>  -They're too family-bonded<br>  -(if u mind)Most are very religious (if u are too then scratch this one out)<br>  -Courtship may take time<br>  <br>  <br>  I can't speak for any other country because I am only familiar with the Filipino culture (since I'm one). >_<|`|0TuWYaneaa	None,there's at least 10 women for every man in this country.
yKCfJVWGaa	There is a huge difference between love and IN love.. you love someone (not in love or when you fall out of love) when you feel for them as a family member.. kind of. the whole "in love" aspects are out of your feelings toward this person but you love them as just a person, like you care for them deeply and would be concerned if they were in any danger, trying to hurt themselves, or if someone is hurting them, and etc but don't see yourself with that person forever, only as a friend. <br>  <br>  In love you would see this is the person you can't be without.. you will know that feeling if it's love. TRUST ME! Just ask yourself these questions and you should know the difference!<br>  <br>  Do I see myself forever with this person?<br>  Do I want to share my life with this person?<br>  Have kids with this person?<br>  Does this person satisfy me fully? <br>  <br>  And most important!<br>  <br>  That you're willing to give up anyone in the world for this person.. i don't mean friends and family but i mean other men or women that could try and be with you but you reject them for this person..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  if all or some no then you probably just love them as a friend or fell out of love.<br>  <br>  <br>  if all yes then there's your answer for "in love"|`|ff545BLyaa	It is different for different people and you will know when you get there, if you are doubting being in love with someone chances are you are not.
92n42vksaa	The only thing to do if you still want to be friends is make sure you give them the chance to still be friends, by doing something like texting asking how they are, or asking if they want to do something (if theres something you want to do that they can join in), being friendly whenever you see them (so they know you dont have a problem with them) and do something for their birthdays even if its just giving them a card. Then at least you're letting them know that you still want to be friends, without putting pressure on them. Basically it makes it easier for them to be your friends again if thats what they want.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes things happen in peoples lives so theyre too busy or preoccupied to keep up with friends. Then when they realise they've drifted apart, they find it difficult to get things back to how they were even if they want their friends back. So if thats whats been happening with you, just apologise for not being there because you had a lot going on and see how they respond.<br>  <br>  If you try these things and get no result, you will just have to accept that they've moved on and there's nothing you can do about it. People change and people's circumstances change and so the kind of friendships they want changes as well. Its sad when that happens but it happens all the time. You will make new friends and you will be just as close to them as you have been to your other friends in the past.|`|vrfuO9Asaa	me! wow this is so weird thats wat i was thinkin me and my friends r driftin away slowly. : (|`|BaNrweQ4aa	just need to keep trying. losing people that are closest to you is the worst thing ever! you really need to try and keep your friends close because old friends sometimes prove to be more friends than your recent friends - as they know you much better :) to stop drifting apart you just need to keep in as much contact with them as possible. talking to them on msn, ringing them and trying to meet up with them whenever you are free :D don't be gutted, you just need to work at it and show them that they are really important to you; and that you cannot possibly lose them. make as much effort as possible and just possibly talk to them about how you feel :) if they are real friends; then they will listen.|`|TxvWkK1Zaa	Yeah that's happened to me as well. But there comes a point where I'm not going to bother anymore because I can tell the other person isn't bothering. You only start to drift apart if one or both of you are not making the effort. If you're making the effort and you're still drifting, then it's the other person. But look on the bright side, you still have friends you know you can count on and you can make new friends in the future. =]<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd just cherish the friends I've got now.|`|oFeNwMheaa	its cause there bored, and they want new friends, sometimes I found it hard to make conversation when we have already discussed about everything! its happened to me last year! i dont even talk to my old friends now, they seem to forget so why cant i, thats how I see it! im jus making new ones its gd to meet new ones! I do miss them and think about them but of course u gt 2 move on wid life!|`|YDoYBdTUaa	yeh this is happening to me as well. it sucks but sometimes thats just life. you could invite them round maybe and try to rekindle your friendships. they need to make the effort as well though, so dont you do everything. i honestly dont know what to do, i am just trying to stay friends at least even if we arent close. <br>  :)|`|bJTtYEgaaa	It happens. People change , and when they do change they look for friends that are more fit to associate with their new likings and dislikes. You could put more effort into it, but it will ,most likely, only stall the inevitable. The best policy ,in this case ,is acceptance.|`|s15819vvaa	unfortunately this happend to me..but be strong..remember you can always make a new friend...!or get them..throw em a party o something it works wonders!...go for a movie together ..or planout something...just ask your self first are these the ppl i wanna spend my days with or should i make new friends out there..maybe someppl who i can be better of wid! the choice is yours ...its your life!|`|q5viMBDPaa	This is happening to me & i have no idea what t do other than keep making an effort, of course there will be times when you feel like the only one making an effort if you do speak to them
F3LBgfvwaa	I think it's about how you feel! Dressing creatively is about expressing yourself. If you are dressing how you feel best, and not doing it for attention or to impress or whatever, then you're not wrong.|`|plBXp91Daa	Just be who you are, it is how you feel and as long you don't wear trashy i guess it is ok.|`|dDFIJ1QOaa	wear what you want your sister shouldn't make you feel bad

I think that is just as intimate if not more so than regular intercourse and should be saved for much later in a relationship and when you're more grown up. <br>  When I was in a teen relationship we did a lot of "dry humping"  - the motions of sex but with our pants on (or at least underwear).  That's pretty gratifying in its own way. <br>  Scented and flavored oils and lotions are a nice way to step up the massage idea as well.|`|gNZfCmjbaa	if you dont want to go all the way then just engage in oral sex x
AA10447677	Confront him, tell him that it's NOT okay to disrespect me like that and that it better not ever happen again...what a total lack of respect.|`|srcV5iAMaa	Well I'm sort of a mean person when it comes to people trying to talk down to me in front of other people. I would first off argue back like do not try to talk to me like this just because your friends are here. Because normally you know that you do not act like. Then i would walk away in front of all his friends and say call me when you get some sense on how to talk to your girlfriend!!!|`|YNZmk8fZaa	I would be pissed. you always have the right to be mad about things and don't let the other person tell you differently. it this is a pattern that is repeated often then i would bring it up with the person and talk about it. If it continues then i would break it off.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	i'd take her out to our SUV in the parking lot,  fold down the back seats,  rip her shorts off, and then do her doggie style really hard and make her scream...  then with my arms waving, imma yell  "WHO'S YOUR DADDY?!!!"|`|bqkfu6Diaa	I am a good sport. I play along and let them enjoy their moment to shine. It doesn't have to hurt me if I don't let it. But that doesn't mean I am a door matt.

Give him/her a little time to change  ways.  If it was still happening after a month or so, i would dump him/her.|`|mFZeEm9paa	This has happened. I get pissed, and retaliate after they "can't see the big deal" I show them at a later date. Then they put more thought into what they say next time!|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I wouldn't tolerate that at all. I have the capacity to burn someone for that sort of thing and I wouldn't hesitate to do so.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	They probably wouldn't be my spouse much longer.|`|H7UphlLCaa	do the same thing to him.  let him know what a worthless piece of crap he is before you leave him.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	My Boss does it all the time..I just tell him to get over himself....|`|ODYrypwaaa	Red flag!|`|TJrRPIFLaa	Punch him in the d***.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	answer him, make him look weaker that way it will never happen again|`|AA11661476	Walk away and never look back... ever.
dw440Lylaa	Why don't you date someone else?<br>  <br>  It's not like you're exclusive with him, HE'S the one not ready for a relationship.<br>  <br>  Stop worrying about his fears and feelings, he doesn't have your best interests at heart.<br>  If he wants to continue to pursue you, great.  He's gonna need to put forth a lot more effort than he has so far.  Quit answering his texts and phone calls..............hell, tell him he's not interested enough for you to be interested in him, move on.<br>  <br>  Sorry<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|AA11209233	Date someone else--because he is!  <br>  <br>  So, get another boyfriend.  You can break up with this guy first, but you don't need to--clearly you two are allowed to date other people.  Maybe the new guy will be less frustrating, or maybe he'll make your non-boyfriend jealous and make him rush to be exclusive.  The non-bf teasing and pushing you away is part of what is attracting you--he won't let you have him, so you want him more.  (I thought all women knew that trick!)|`|NrH787NZaa	DROP HIM. soon as he sees youre not playing, he will get serious|`|a2t1hnl6aa	He seems to me he has commitment issues... He likes you, but at the same time either wants to date around or is afraid to be committed because of past relationships. You know him well, has he had someone cheat on him? Or is he a player type? I say make him jealous and see how he reacts because if he sees that anyone can just take you away from him, maybe that will give him the courage to finally commit. Play hard to get and don't make yourself available to him always.|`|gFHzuIrUaa	I say, leave him alone. It's not fair that he can keep tabs on you, but you can't keep tabs on him. Who knows what he's doing when your not around. And if you truly care about someone, you don't just disappear for a month. I say this is kinda unhealthy. but this is just my opinion. good luck with your situation|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Sounds like your not happy with the situation and not most of us would be. If hes not putting in the effort to committ to some degree than why is he acting so controlling? Is he guilty of something himself? Im not sure, but I wouldnt put up with this unless the relationship felt more secure. You deserve to be with someone whose going to respect you in the way that you'd respect them and no one respects a doormat so why have to stayed with this guy for so long? Law down the law. Tell him how this relationship (if you can call it that) ought to be or tell him to get lost!|`|Ngc0teBqaa	What he's doing to you - the whole trying-to-control-your-behavior stuff - is a form of relationship abuse (seriously)!  Not to mention, it's pretty clear that he's never going to be the boyfriend you want him to be.  All he's going to be is a big mess of hurt and frustration (or worse).  Get rid of him, the sooner the better!|`|GKmJM70Qaa	you need to get out of this relationship...he likes having power over you and controlling you and ur emotions. this situation is limiting your freedom and happiness....you need to find a guy who is gonna respect you and isnt so demanding of your time and attention.|`|97552c71c91b060395b06b8e3267cf6aaa	He obviously likes you he just has problems with commitment.

I agree that on a second date he doesnt count as your boyfriend but he is a guy you are dating. If you both want to have sex then have sex but be prepared that he may not have much respect for you after that. If you have only just met he may get the impression you ar eeasy.

Don't force C to make a choice you were ready when you gave up the clique but she is not sure if it is worth it.  Sorry friendships are not forever.|`|1UiYpUWiaa	friendship is not a binding contract,  if she wants D then let her, being your best friend should be a privilege not a choice!|`|Rt1FfBchaa	Grrr... that was hard to read... If C and D are friends why don't you just be friends with A.|`|34ruM1eDaa	FIrstly, you sound like an awesome person & a great GREAT friend. I dont think she deserves you. Let her know what shes missing. Stay a bit aloof. SHe's obviously enjoying this..you trying to "get her back" kinda thing. If shes being mean, dont respond at all. Ignore. Im not sayin stop talkin to her..all m sayin is, maintain your self respect..dont sound desperate for her "friendship" (which is darn fake, btw)<br>  <br>  I respect the fact that you left the older clique for her, but obv she doesnt appreciate that..annd such ungreatful people are best ignored or maintained distance from.<br>  <br>  Dont loose your head, mate.

KkTJf8kWaa	Some fantasies should be just that, fantasies.<br>  If you really love this guy and you want to marry him, then don't screw it up by doing this.<br>  What if he connects with her and you can see it in their eyes?<br>  Look at it from his view, what if he starts wondering if you would really rather be with a woman more than him?<br>  Do you really want to risk your relationship?|`|jgedIY8taa	The phrase "but then again it makes me kinda jelous [sic] to think about it" indicates to me that you should not do this.  I know you're asking how to get over that and be able to enjoy it, but jealousy is a difficult emotion to control.  You're risking too much as a couple to indulge in this fantasy at this time, so instead move on and enjoy other options - both normal and kinky - that are available to you in your relationship.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	you will enjoy it believe me you will...  I happened to do it while in college and my girl friend turned gay...   believe me you will enjoy it..  Grant M|`|mwEBrwlOaa	My feeling is that you are beginning to realize that it is no longer a fantasy but something that may actually happen. In my opinion you will have to resolve for yourself if the issue is the fact you do not want to have a threesome or a need for reassurance. If the latter is the case then what you need to do is talk with your finance and let him know your concerns. Also you may want to talk about how your relationship will return after the threesome. The main thing is that you need to talk with him and continue with it. Otherwise you may find if you have the threesome it may cause some problems because certain issues were not discussed due to fear of upsetting your boyfriend or because you were too uncomfortable to bring it up.|`|zHmZkMStaa	You really can't ease your mind fully - not until you do it.  I've engaged in this sort of experimenting before, and must advise that about 50% of the time it did not turn out well, or was dissappointing.  Proceed with extreme caution, and have a plan if things go wrong, or either party becomes uncomfortable.|`|DozD8lTGaa	Well, if you need to 'ease' your mind, i don't think you are going to be able to cope with it 'emotionally' after. i have read a few stories like this before, where one Partner hated it and stuff.<br>  <br>  so, make sure you are ready. make sure you trust them both and DON'T be paranoid :) ... just talk to him about it to ease your mind and then that way you will be fine...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i hope i helped :) x|`|yhQPAQaFaa	its a tricky one<br>  i wud never do it for the same reason as you. its not that you dont trust them its just you dont think you will like watching it. concentrate on your man instead of takin turns. wen she and him are together join in abit so your part of it too not just them.|`|722b542b7a67ede38cb14f02c50a186eaa	umm o.k i think u shouldnt do it b/c it like hes cheating on u in ur face. like *** on u no it a guy dream to have sex with 2 gurls @ the same time. i dont think u should do i dont trust guy to tha point.|`|n9Uu7l44aa	eeeeeeewwwwwwl. thats naasty! which would make you lesbian-ish!?yuck! i wouldnt do that anyway bkuz i know i would be VERY jealous if my boyfriend was havin sex with another girl...i mean thats just ughk!|`|D1NmwXsuaa	order a uhhh those girls out of phonebooks lol that way no connection is built lol and IF he sees her on the street [which he probably wont] then it wont matter haha; lame|`|HMDnaZaeaa	WHOA!!!! To be honest if you are planning on marrying this man, I dont know how you would allow someone else to enjoy him. He's your man and the whole idea is alittle to out there!|`|PTKiTblZaa	lol i wouldnt bc he ll prob want to do it alot but idk you guys so i mean i guess its up to u|`|hFSmjI6yaa	Have the threesome and then kill him...solved my issues!
hCJzZ5rnaa	Tell her how you feel over msn, but if she doesn't want to see you then that's entirely within her rights.<br>  <br>  Failure to comply with such wishes could result in her taking you to court, and harrassment charges can be quite serious. Very serious if she can give a lot of evidence of you continually wanting to see her.
FewhKlx9aa	There is such a thing as verbal abuse and it can do a lot of damage to your self-esteem.If you can make it on your own then leave him as it never gets better just worse as you are now experiencing.Guys that do this have very low self esteen issues with trust and feel the need to control you.When they have the power then they make you think you lost your mind.You are young and have a life ahead of you,if you don't want to waste them get on without him.Start taking some classes to meet friends and gain your independence back.Try looking up family services for free theraphy and talk to a therapist to help with your panic attacks.I use to suffer these for 15yrs with an x and now with my second husband I could'nt be happier.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Mental abuse is as bad as physical abuse and in some cases worse.  What he is doing is abuse.  It appears that you lack some self confidence, but sweetie, you need to regain some of the power in this relationship.  You may have to go as far as filing for divorce, maybe at that point he will see what he is about to lose, and at that point, you can make your demands.  Do not be afraid, you will be much better on your own than to live with this continued abuse, so put a stop to it.  Good luck.|`|bO2rzfISaa	13 years of abuse. It's time to go. There's something really wrong with his thinking and actions and he's changing who you are. You didn't used to hate yourself, did you?<br>  <br>  800.799.SAFE National Domestic Violence Hotline|`|109756733d11b28be4c1ee34aa4e9137aa	Yes, he is abusive. <br>  <br>  You need some therapy and support to gain strength. Check out your local DV center or is you have the insurance, see a therapist familiar with abuse. NOT marriage counseling.<br>  <br>  Check out drirene.com, there is lots of info and support.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It sounds like you both need joint and individual counseling so you can work on the marriage and your past issues. If not this is going to get worse not better. If he won't go then you go on your own it won't help to sit around and feel depressed and down. You should also speak with trusted friends/family so you can get emotional support. Get pro-active for yourself and do it asap.|`|mOayTJDmaa	I can feel your pain.  It sounds like there is a trust issue.  And with 3 kids, it's hard to find time with eachother anyway.  I have trouble with 1 kid.  He needs to start living in the here and now.  There is always 2 sides in a marriage.  Look at yourself and put yourself in his shoes.  What do you think you should change.<br>  <br>  Answer my marriage question please.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	You go forward or you go backwards..if it were me, I would concentrate on the future...Try to build your life by being a loving and supportive wife and Mother...You have 3 children??  and you seem depressed...geez, just think what a joy all of this is for your children...You are certainly TEAching them to be unhappy, miserable and Unloving Adults...That is the example you are giving them...Life|`|9bdEPcWIaa	You nor people reading my answer may not like what I have to say but I have had experiences similar so here it goes.<br>  <br>  People like your husband has to be dealt with offensive tactics.  When your husband starts to make accusations that's just not even possible, in your case, where the hell do you even have time to have sex others?  He is doing this because<br>  <br>    #1, he is having sex with other women and feeling guilty, he is expressing his anger to cover up his "narcissistic behavior disorder".   Look this up on your internet, see if all the symptoms match.  If they do at least you know that he has a mental illness and this madness is not about you.  When he starts up again, stand up for yourself and let  him know that you won't take his  B U L L S H I T again.  A professional therapist gave me this advise and it worked, he will recoil and back down but he will forget and start up again but you will at least know how to deal with him.<br>  <br>    #2, he is controlling and abusive, that's how his mother or father treated each other when he was growing up, he is insecure.  Talk to a professional, learn how to deal with him, divorce should be the last option, your children should take priority.|`|AA11208683	i have two different thoughts about this... first of i think that yeah he is abusing you mentally, but i don't think he sees it that way... this is probably his way of showing how self consiecnce he is. try showing him as much love as you can possibly muster to him... when he comes home give him a kiss and say, im glad your home. do little things for him, show him physically that you would never do any of what he is saying... if things don't get better than i would suggest him getting some help or the both of you doing marriage counseling, and if that doesn't help then you need to get out of there... i hope this helps... good luck!|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Hi Paula,   You are in a tough spot.  Yes the constant put downs are verbal and emotional abuse.  I wonder his feelings for you if he treats you like that.  Many men use it as a form of control.  For someone to constantly bring up the past is cruel.  The problem with arguing that way is you never get anywhere.  Do not settle issues.  You should not hate yourself, but when you hear it constantly it does wear on you.  I can't advise leaving him but when the time is right you will......If he can't leave the past ,  then your future will look the same.  Remember the movie "Groundhog Day" ?  He needs to stop putting himself first and do for you and the kids.  Whether he will is a big question.  Good luck Paula as no one deserves to live unhappy.|`|H1chCcVLaa	Damn if you do..damn if you dont!<br>  <br>  You shouldnt think about what ppl think of you. Your husband has a trust issue (serious problem) and mentally tortured you but it is your job to ignore that negativity and put your needs before him. He has issues not you but he blames you of course. <br>  <br>  Thus, you should be prepared mentally and not let your husband breaks you inside bit by bit. If you cant stand, maybe it is time to call off the day. Dont get too emotional about life. You should live well so that you can take care of your family especially your kids. They need more of your attention than your husband. <br>  <br>  Try to talk to friends or neighbors about this or close family. Don't let it bother you until it affect your kids. Not fair for them.|`|Us0XGMwfaa	It's never too late to start over.  Every one has the right to try to be happy.  If you're not whoring around try very very hard to convince your husband he is wrong about that.  Remember he was probably attracted to your self admitted wild ways when you started seeing each other.  Try to tell him that life is behind you and you are deserving the respect a mother and a spouse are entitled to.  If you love him, work on this marriage, if not walk away and start to live and enjoy your children your life.  If he doesn't love you ask him to walk and let you have peace.|`|mcmOslOFaa	First of you are a woman b4 you are his wife!  And he needs to remember the past is the past and he married so therefor he needs to get over it.  If your not happy then your kids are not happy.  I think he has issues of his own that he is hiding in the closet...maybe he should come clean.  What i mean is he is blaming you for what you have done and thinking so bad about you, but there is something he has done that he is feeling guilty about for all of these years...he needs help, maybe go to the counselor on the base and talk to them for some help.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Yes, he sounds abusive/controlling. You don't go from 0-60 like that overnight so I'm confident that he has always been this way. I'm assuming that you've talked to him about this plenty of times already, it might be time to start considering pulling the plug on this marriage. There is no need to be unhappy for no reason with no resolution in sight. If he isn't willing to improve, your only option is to continue taking it or leave and reclaim your peace of mind. <br>  <br>  People have strong morals about marriage, but when someone is causing you to take anti-depressants and doing this to your emotional state, there is but so much you can do.
s15819vvaa	if shes just using him for a fling..then ask him back from her by talking it out kindly...if you know this guy is rite for you then just tell her out...<br>  just tallking and sorting things out will work..or maybe you can just let her have him...cuz if she really likes this guy then stop flirting cuz that way your cheating on both of them..which i say is really bad...!<br>  cheers=)|`|srcV5iAMaa	Well theres nothing better then sending a text, im, or a e-mail. Then i think neither one of you should date the guy because even when one friend says its okay its really not and drama always always come with situations that can easily be resolved.|`|lNqE8H8Paa	First of all Wel is actually spelled Well, dis should be this tels is really tells...learn how to spell no wonder why this country is going down the tubes, look what we let the younger generations do. You are typing it doesn't take that long to type out the correct words...and if you don't know how to spell...its called spell check!!
Rp6cxboYaa	Yes, I would say it's fine.  She obviously was a huge part of his life for a long time, and he wants to keep that around a little bit. Don't worry about it.|`|4EWCegiRaa	Given that situation, yes.  They helped raise her, she's kind of like a daughter to him regardless of the fact that his then wife is now his ex-wife.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	13 years ago the sister in law would only have been 7.  It's possible after 8 years he came to look on her like a daughter, and wishes to maintain contact.  It's kind of a weird situation though, but his ex wife was guardian and functioned in a parent role, and presumably so did he.  They didn't have any children of their own, and if they raised this child as though she were their own, well, it seems reasonable to me that he would look on her as his own child, it would be a similar situation to raising a step child.  The girl is 20 and on her own now, but you should still be prepared to look on her as a stepdaughter, if she's his or not, he is still the man who stepped up to the plate and took on the father role for her.|`|twft9R3Yaa	I would say so, I mean you said they sort of raised her as their own. As long as he isn't hiding anything from you about her then I think that you're pretty safe.
Ngc0teBqaa	You did the right thing by deleting his number!  He was totally using you and disregarding your feelings.  The more distance you put between him and you, the easier it'll be to get over him - and the sooner you'll realize what a jerk he's been all along.|`|2AAhiwgnaa	I am sorry dear, but this guy does not seem to want to commit to you anytime soon. He only said that because he did not want to seem like he was using you, but in actual fact he is using you. You should not have had sex with him so early. You have to move on past this guy. I know you like him but you have to show some pride and cut things off now otherwise you are going to end up getting really hurt.|`|go4R8pN3aa	If a guy blatantly tells you to leave after sex, he doesn't care about you and is just using you.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't see how much clearer he can be.|`|aUn6o6dyaa	sorry to say but yes u r . dont talk to him anymore . u dont need such a jerk anyway ,u better than that . move on , u will finf right person who will respect and appreciate u not just having sex with u ,. head up !!! be strong !!!
RHPQUwCGaa	I am sure there are those out there that CAN work that out...|`|gRXy66dOaa	yeah i never been cheated so I wouldnt knoe

hizRPh9raa	Try Amazing Grace. It's delicate and beautiful...and completely suitable for the occasion. Not to mention, the verses are short, so you won't have a problem breaking it off at an appropriate point in the song.|`|cGbTJobeaa	We lit our Unity Candle to the Irish Wedding Song.  I had a CD that had that song on it so I provided it to the church organist and also gave her the sheet music since she was unfamiliar with the song.<br>  <br>  Here are the lyrics.<br>  <br>  Here they stand, hand in hand<br>  they’ve exchanged wedding bands<br>  today is the day of their dreams and their plans<br>  and all we who love them just wanted to say<br>  May God bless this couple who married today<br>  <br>  CHORUS<br>  In good times and bad times<br>  in sickness and health<br>  may they know that riches are not need for wealth<br>  Help them face problems they’ll meet on their way<br>  Oh God bless this couple who married today<br>  <br>  May they find peace of mind comes to all who are kind<br>  May the rough times ahead become triumphs in time<br>  and may their children be happy each day<br>  Oh God bless this family who started today<br>  <br>  As they go may they know every love that was shown<br>  and as life it gets shorter may their feeling grow<br>  wherever they travel, wherever they stay<br>  May God bless this couple who married today|`|g7zDWqSTaa	Is your ceremony going to be religious in a church?

For a female to try and make her look big busted for her male cousin is just sick. I think you should start questioning that lol.|`|AA11297266	It may be that her cousin has teased her in the past about being flat chested and she wants him to eat his words.....nicer to see a good side to it!|`|WvevK4n0aa	it's obvious|`|JJARLh3zaa	maybe she feels intimidated that her cousin's family is extremely physically mature and wants to be the same. just a possibility|`|oDQHEgNSaa	she has a crush on her cousin, just not right
slHUNl58aa	Eddie, hands down.  Besides Reality and Claire he had the most developed character. he was the most likable. <br>  I don't remember timdawg having a mouth at all except in the third person... too predictable.<br>  Krytska seemed pretty vanilla to me.<br>  Claire, unpredictable and a Consummate *****.. liked her for entertainment.<br>  Reality, thick headed and relationally challenged.. liked to hate/pity (fine line there) him most of the time.<br>  Personal favorite was her wanting to do the DOM thing to Reality with the video... That made me laugh really hard.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	crazy eddie all the way|`|vFCva8R5aa	I always liked Reality...We got to see his mess of a life unfold everyday on Y!A and it made me feel sorry for the guy. <br>  <br>  He was just so clueless on just about everything that you just had to love him for that. Plus you wanted to help him too.<br>  <br>  however you seem to be similarly lost...makes me wonder? hmmm...|`|NSKimt1Qaa	Probably Reality because he was my first (character on here).<br>  Next favorite is definitely Eddie, followed by Claire, Krystka, and last is Timdawg.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	I saw Reality on here yesterday...<br>  <br>  Obviously YOU are my favorite....lol|`|y9CgveCGaa	I'll have to stray from your list.

dw440Lylaa	Why wouldn't you talk to her?<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with friendly conversation..........I wouldn't go into the whole "I love you and want your body" thing.<br>  <br>  Start with "hi, how are you?"<br>  <br>  Then shut up and listen, you should be interested in how she is.<br>  <br>  Relationships are about communication, that means being willing to talk honestly, and being willing to listen.<br>  <br>  God gave you one mouth, and two ears.

acj9mB9Paa	I want a guy with at least a little  hair.  Otherwise I would feel like I was with a little boy....ewwwwwww.  My hubby is Native American/Irish and when we got together (ten years ago) he had a little strip of hair running down his chest and that was it.  That was fine with me.  Now, as he has gotten older, the Irish genes are kicking in and he is getting a little more hair on his chest.  This is also fine with me.  I just don't want a guy that looks like Austin Powers!!!  *shudder*  And sweets, on you ANYTHING would be fine, you are a cutie!|`|x3LclBZ0aa	as long as it not what you call the "caveman" look, i think that a man's chest and especially the stomach hair is very very sexy.|`|AA12387863	I don't know where you got the info that most women prefer shaved. I prefer natural. If there is hair, fine, if not, fine. Shaved leaves stubble and it is very irritating to be close to.

xcJwxyRRaa	your ages are not an issue, ever..it's the maturity level of the individual...as you've prob heard, age is just a number and nothing much more could be truer in life.<br>  If you like someone  you like them, plain and simple...regardless of anything, age, race, size, etc...and if the attraction is there it's something we cannot control.<br>  Attraction is Not A Choice.<br>  All you have to do is get your number to him and start hanging out by going out to do things together as "friends", but always be playful, kidding around and busting on him in a fun way..and he should be doing that too ..this is flirting and attractive. no more than hour or 2 at a time..then make sure he takes you home. Talks should be short  and never about feelings. this is the death of new(er) relationships especially. and no talks about the ex's..if he starts to do this, change the subject quickly and make it known hat you are not his counselor and he might want to talk to his buddies/sister/brother, etc  about this stuff...you're not the person to talk to <br>  If he wants to be over his ex, he will "break" it off and be over her..<br>  It's ultimately his choice..but Ahh, remember if you get involved too deep, too fast, you will be the rebound woman and this is not good, allow him several months to get over the ex..even up to a year..<br>  If he likes you, as he gets to know you, he will or should take the lead...<br>  in short, keep things fun and exciting and interesting and always look good, but not too good..always look him in the eyes with a smile in your eyes and on your face..you want to be so fun and different that the ex...<br>  if he say"what" when you look at him, say things like you're interesting, cute, funny, you're a dork(yes, you must say this sometimes and punch him in the arm then run from him and maybe even wrestle sometimes) play like kids sometimes or a lot of the times..<br>  good luck and have fun|`|4W3v2fO5aa	well if he told your sister he thiks your beautiful and hes hinting that he dont mind older girls then i would say just go for it... just generally start flirting with him (its not that hard trust me..just go with the flow ;) ) and just tell him that you ike him coz he clearly feels the same!!!|`|pn2t0gejaa	Let the sister help you out,or just say something to him you know he thinks your beautiful don't waste time you may not get a second chance|`|YcT2qwrtaa	rip his pants off and SUCKKKK awayyyy|`|JlDcVTVsaa	start giving hints like you dont mind dating boys younger than you.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	ask him out
ACecbVghaa	One of the most awkward scenes I saw played out happened at a wedding I attended in Texas. The couple got married on their parent's cattle ranch, outside, a la the Bush wedding. They had a lovely spot on the plain, a couple shade trees, tons of flowers, chairs all set up, lovely alter for the ceremony, flameless candles, etc. it was really pretty. The day seemed nice, warm, breezy and some small clouds passing by. The bride walked down the aisle, everything was peachy. As the ceremony began, a strom started rolling across the plains in true Texas style. It looked far away but by the time the sermon began, the wind was whipping and random drops of rain were falling! As the pastor ended his sermon and the couple stood to take their vows, the skies opened. Rain and wind pelted the guests and the couple - and they stood their ground and said their vows over the deluge! As soon as the pastor pronounced them, they kissed and everyone took off toward the house! A hundred dripping wet guests spent the afternoon weathering the storm inside, which was fine because the house had a large sunroom and plenty of space for everyone. It turned into a very intimate, causal affair as the guests discraded their wet clothes for the tee shirts and shorts and clothing offered by their hosts! It was a lot of fun and no one will ever forget it, a VERY crazy day, the bride looked great in a sundress as her wedding gown laid hung on a rack in the mud room and the groom was in chinos and a polo instead of a socking wet suit. The pictures of the crowd and the bride and groom running up to the house were priceless!|`|ODYrypwaaa	My dad did not walk me down the isle...instead we rode his Harley.  They played the typical music for the wedding march....then people stood us and started looking for us.  Then we came out from around the building on the Harley and reeving the engine.  My dad driving and me on back in full wedding dress and veil.  We then got off where the isle runner started and the wedding march started again.  He then walked me down and gave me away.  People loved it!  It was an outside wedding of course.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	When my ex-BF was best man at his brother's wedding, he was in charge of putting down the glass for the groom to smash.  Well, he didn't put it down right or something, and his brother couldn't smash it to save his life!!! He must have had to step on it like 6 times before it finally broke.|`|JQjs3cB3aa	a man in a white suit :O<br>  o man...a sight for sore eyes|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	i forgot i was chewing gum till i had to start my vows and handed it to my bridesmaid LMAO!

So, his brother got alcohol poisoning and was rushed to the hospital and spent a whole day there. At our wedding, they are sitting in the back, way back.
jJZz2U8Gaa	They are and were just jealous of your relationship with her. Guess what? You let them win and now you're suffereing because you gave in to the pressure. You are the mature one who is interested in a woman and wanting to be with her. They don't want that because they either don't want to grow up or they can't find someone like you did. <br>  <br>  I hope you didn't ruin your chances with her but if I were you, I would try and make amends. If not, you will probably regret it for a long time! You're not crazy because sometimes guys will take pressure from their friends. You can fix this, though if you stop worrying about what your friends think.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	are you friends still holding your hand? I bet not<br>  you probably lost the best thing that could have happened to you- have you seen her?you were young and stupid- Young people can be real easy to manipulate I hope now that you are older you will stand for your self|`|xxtrFHn6aa	dumb move for sure, your friends are immature and you should have told them so.|`|lj8PbJugaa	I think you're right.|`|Tuv79aXWaa	You def shouldn't have let your friends get in between that. Your friends should have understood, that you can't just ditch a girl that you really like for them all the time. If you really like this girl, maybe explain to her what you've done and how you regret it. They are much of friends if they complain. That was a stupid move. You obviously liked her to want to spend all of this time with her, so why ruin it?|`|RCfc9hMKaa	The one that got away? I think you already know it was a dumb move, it happens to everyone at least once I think. Never let your friends get between you and a relationship and vice versa. Do what you need/want to be happy and worry about everyone else after that.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	I think you are sooooo dumb for doing that.<br>  Your friends were jealous of you and Renee<br>  That's why they guilt tripped you.<br>  Hopefully you learned a lesson.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Everyone dumps someone for stupid reasons at some point in  their life. I wouldn't let your friends get in the middle of your relationships because that just never works.|`|U3gebnDLaa	You never know what you've got until it's gone ..|`|DLND3rokaa	yes that is a dumb move|`|GM63jFD2aa	Misery loves company is the explanation to your friends stupid actions. As for you, yeah, maybe it was a stupid reason, but in hindsight if it really mattered that much, why is it taking you a few years to realize it? Now, if you're lucky and you can still contact her and she is single still, you might have another chance. However, if you don't have that opportunity, then just count it as a loss and move on. I'm sure there's other girls out there and I think you've learned your lesson so maybe next time you find a good girl you won't screw things up the same as you did before.|`|oche3k5taa	I think that you may have made a mistake, because she really didnt do anything, and your friends werent even trying to understand you.<br>  However, you were young, and now you've learned your lesson, so stop looking back, and look forward, who knows, maybe she'll be in your future still, just see what happens. and if you ever come across her number, dont be scared to give her a call. maybe she wants to hear from you?   Goodluck = ]|`|J2lFJTuuaa	ya seriously that was stupid<br>  <br>  and besides, if you had plans with her first, that means you weren't ditching your friends. if you had chosen your friends, you would be ditching HER. you friends were just being possessive and immature.|`|X1DAg6mKaa	fell bad 4u im a girl nd i would not love u but since u really love her tell her u r sorry give her flowers tell her y u left her  don't let ur friends stop u|`|yxqk7SVOaa	if your friends were really your friends, then they would understand you for wanting to hang with renee. yes that was a stupid move, but that'sis why we can learn from our mistakes.|`|uwWoj1cOaa	You should have not done that cuz that makes u look like a follower in  reason...|`|kv3FrdS8aa	yes u r more than dump<br>  i can't belive it<br>  omg <br>  u shouldn't do that<br>  <br>  p.s. don't do it again|`|iTf0l9Wlaa	that was stupid and what guys dont seem to get is to stand up for their relationship with their girl guys need to be able to tell their friends to back off and your not ditching them but you need to have time for your relationship also. it takes a lot to have a good relationship and a lot of time and if the girls not getting that she will move on so the next time you get a girl that you really like you need to make time for her and your friends but dont let your friends run your relationship they arent the ones in it its your relationship you need to make you and your girlfriend happy|`|707gOCvbaa	It was stupid but so long ago. We learn from our mistakes and always hope to make the best decision for ourselves. I doubt you were really that into her because no amount of friends could talk you into dumping the girl of your dreams. She was just the beginning of many more to come.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I think you are right.<br>  but Im sure it wont happen wit the next girl you will fall in love with because you already made that mistake and you are upset about it.
OFJFLs2Paa	The thing that you need to do here is tell her how you feel in a letter or something that will not make it so nerves for yourself. I really do think that she does like you. The only thing is she don't know how to tell you that she really does. Really to me she is just confused about what she wants with you. So on Friendster you need to confront her by asking her out. Don't say you have a crush on her you done did that. Now move to the next step and try and share a relationship with her. Good Luck and I hope that you get what you want! =D
LX2fq6x2aa	uhhhm ... i think i like you coz ur kind and i realized that u are the one who really treasure a friend....but<br>  i have doubt with myself coz i dont knw if i like you just a man ur a friend....<br>  if u wondering what feelings i have to you all i can say is i really dnt knw......im happy when im in ur company i always laugh you notice namn that dba...but i really dont knw if i have or havent.......|`|fecUjSr1aa	she may just be playing hard to get. but if i were you, keep up the "friendship" right and play it by ear. she may just want you for a friend, not a boyfriend but then again, she may just be testing you ... how far will you go?<br>  <br>  true love, as they say, is patient. wait and see ..<br>  <br>  if she really wants you as just a friend and you make your move, she may not like it ...|`|nZyIofaTaa	tell her you love her fool. <br>  do it. <br>  it'll be worth it in the end. :)|`|LMfYodo6aa	I don't understand any of this...|`|yuwjQjKqaa	How old are you?<br>  I think you two are more than friends.<br>  You should just ask her out.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	tell her you do love her and see what happens
fmNEhf3Qaa	There's no right or wrong. BTW, you have sex with him because he's cute and your friends are crazy about him?Then that's not love i suppose. You've gotta decide whether it's just the hormones (sexual attraction and stuff...and maybe with a tad of the "haha, you know the gorgeous guy you all are drooling about? He's MINE!" thing) or are you seriously falling in love with him? <br>  Well, having a fling with the step-brother can be really exciting, but the same goes to the step-sister!You know men would like the erotic "i'm banging my step-sister, secretly" idea. So he may be just playing the guilty pleasure game and is not serious about you. And SO, if you're serious, you'll be seriously hurt ultimately. Just make sure you're aware of that. <br>  On the other hand, if he's serious about you and you're not, then there is goin trouble too, there may be vengeance and you can never really get rid of him. Because he's your BROTHER and you're goin to see him from time to time. So it's like you goin to see your ex occasionally. It will be awkward even if both of you aren't serious about each other in the first place. It will be awkward even if your parents don't know anything about it. And it will be worse if your parents know.<br>  This is truly a dangerous affair that in every way spells trouble for the future (unless you two are goin to be lifelong husband and wife - willingly and lovingly of course), but what's done is done, and i would suggest that whatever action you take from now onwards, please make sure you don't get pregnant. <br>  <br>  btw, i think the best case scenario would be, both of you are lovers in a stable relationship, and the parents know about it.|`|DgFhlJvYaa	Personally I wouldn't do what your doin seein that he is your step brother. But he's only your brother through marrage. If you dont want it to be like that then you need to tell him that your not comfortable doin that. & if he doesn't except it then he's just gonna have to deal with it. If you tell your partent's that might mess the family up. You just gotta go with that gut feelin you get.|`|59385c60c5203e426c9a99719ae545fdaa	It depends on how old you are for starters.  If you are not under age then at least make sure you use safe contraceptive protection.  It would probably be best to tell your parents before some one else does.|`|tlxG2q04aa	Fair enough.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	Well I have really thought about this question, and since you are not related by blood, its not wrong to like him, but I think your family might really question it. I wouldn't know what to do as a parent, because you both have to live under the same roof and I would be worried that you all could hook up whenever you want/be alone together all the time. I probably wouldn't tell them, at least not until you are sure you two really like each other.<br>  <br>  And don't feel bad, its not your fault that you like him, it really doesn't make sense that parents can bring other people into your family that aren't related but still expect you to treat them like blood (not have feelings for them I mean). This kind of sticky situation is a lot more common than you think|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	You can continue with the relationship but bear in mind you will have to keep it a scret and that can cause problems and stress for both of you. And if your parents found out it would not be good. I say you keep this a secret, but be careful. And if you think you've grown to fond of him then maybe you should back off a bit honey.|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	In a number of jurisdictions, incest statutes extend to relationships among individuals related by affinity. Such statutes proscribe sexual relations between stepfathers and stepdaughters, stepmothers and stepsons, or brothers-and sisters-in-law, and such relations are punishable as incest.<br>  <br>  <br>  But besides the definition you need to keep in mind that a relationship such as this may not go anywhere and if you and your stepbrother ends up having an affair and then breakup or have a fight what are you two going to do then?  <br>  <br>  It's going to place your parents in an uncomfortable position and it will place you and your stepbrother in an uncomfortable position. <br>  <br>  My opinion is to not progress any further and realize that a relationship such as this is not healthy.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Have you lived together? how long have you known each other?<br>  If you met as adults and never had a sibling connection although it's a little unusual weird you won't be the first.<br>  If you've know one another a long time. And have lived as siblings it really does reek of incest.|`|7XIa76Usaa	He is not a blood relative so enjoy yourself and who you tell is up to you. The only advice I would give you is for you to start taking birth control pills, remember condoms are known for breaking.|`|fioNl1k7aa	if i had a hot step brother, i don't know if i could keep my hands off him either........|`|FzFSzilmaa	your choice... you ain't blood relatives, so make the most of it...:D
xarKlp0Oaa	You are lucky to have a teacher that tries to help you so much. I don't think she is trying to control you, I think that she is just trying to help you out and enjoys doing it.|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	She may like you as a friend but only knows how to carry a relationship with a younger person as a teacher.|`|B7ILefOtaa	just gave her a chance. she is so serious in helping you, just dont judge her action first..
ikXRqWxUaa	i think that she is telling the truth...it's just that he's the only one that's not listening.  what your friend needs to do is call her bluff.  the next time that she says this, he should calmly say "honey, i'm sorry that i trapped you into this marriage...i have contacted a divorce attorney.  when will you be contacting yours?".  either this will shock her into reality (i'm doubting it) or she doesn't care and this will be her "out".  either way is better than living in the farce that he's living in now.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Don't know him and don't know her I also don't know ugly he may or may not be, or whether she loves him or not.....neither do you. Evidently he was appealing to her at least once, when she got pregnant. She could have avoided that with a condom and she didn't have to marry him, she had other options like being a single parent.|`|a984cQjKaa	what, that she thinks he's ugly?  it doesn't matter if she really means it or not, she's being verbally abusive towards your friend.  your friend should leave her.|`|NGKwsawdaa	well she might be saying that because she wants to make him feel like sh*t or she might really mean it. Either way, it's not right what she is doing.|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Obviously if she says it more often than not, or even when they aren't fighting there is some truth to it.|`|fjztyiXmaa	It's possible that your friend's wife is saying that your friend is ugly on the inside.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	If he was ugly and she found him undesirable than why did she spread her legs for him in the first place?|`|XIDPqzMaaa	Probably be cause he's ugly..|`|Ks1uiHReaa	she sounds wonderful. y the heck does he stay??|`|GoGaYHDyaa	Of course, he can't leave without giving up half.<br>  <br>  She has no real reason to be nice to him anymore. Isn't that right American women?|`|91ACjB5eaa	i bet she married him b.c of the baby<br>  maybe he is ugly lol but she shouldn't tell him that...sound's like he might just want to start cheating any day now|`|81cb1ce39da4213ebe7cbc833cc3f808aa	It takes two to tango, remember that. If those comments were really devastating to your friend, you would know it. But relationships are complicated. I had a friend who referred to his wife as "the beast", and yet they were happy. His wife pretended to hate it when he called her that, but it was clear that she actually thought it was humorous. I know other people that call each other stupid, etc. While I would NEVER do that, the couple that I know have an unspoken understanding that neither of them really mean it.  Some times, in relationships, weird things work for people.

Or is there a dorky/geeky guy you could use to pretend with or a guy friend even to play along?  You could do something like putting a rose and a note on her windshield having it be from some guy.  Leave a note on her locker (taped in an envelope) or on her desk in one of her classes, in her bookbag.  <br>  Or you could even do it like it's from a secret admirer.  But maybe do it the week before April 1st so she may fall for it.  Then have it lead up to April 1st signing your name and saying April Fool's.<br>  <br>  You could send her a text message from a secret admirer from a phone number that she wouldn't recognize, too.

dFHsAXDMaa	Okay wow this was nothing really you will encounter more challenges than this is your relationship and in love if you can not handle something as minor as this you are not cut out for a serious relationship and you were definitely not ready to have had sex. when you love someone you love then through the good bad happy sad and you work little things like this out.... it was not like she was making out with someone she found atttractive and she did not have oral sex or sex grow up and get over yourself pity she did not cheat... if she had would she have told you honestly about this incident or hidden it... she would of hidden it.... she loves you and is trying to be honest... and hoping you realize that she can not control oother people actions but she can stop it.|`|BzH7l27oaa	She shouldn't get so drunk, especially since she allows things like that happen to her.  If you can't forgive her and trust her again then don't waste your time or her time continuing the relationship.  It was a mistake and she was drunk, you should understand that BUT she should control her drinking because it puts her in really vulnerable positions.  She's lucky she wasn't raped.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  You've asked this question 5 times in the last week, what answer are you looking for exactly?!  Get over it, people make mistakes and it wasn't really her fault.  She just made the mistake of getting too drunk which allowed some guy to take advantage of her (he was probably too drunk too and didn't know what he was doing).|`|ysAlWzEvaa	Your gf is innocent, the guy was in fact trying to take advantage of her. She did not cheat because she did not initiate any of the kisses, realize at all times he's the one that comes to her and she's the one that's always backed away. The worse thing you did was tell her you wanted a break or to break up because you did not know the full story at the time, now she knows you're always going to look at her as a cheating and it could easily push her away. If you want to hang on to this girl (which i think you should) talk to her, explain to her how you feel about the situation and tell her that even though she and that dude may be friends, he's trying to be with her so you would like it if she stay away from him. He might just force/lead her to be with him in other ways next time. As for you, if you're going to stay with her don't continue to think of her as a cheating because she's not, you're just going to get paranoid if you do she her in such way and the relationship will end. Good luck!|`|DF22BQ3yaa	The bottom line is you and her are still in a relationship and you two will have to work this out.

I was telling them about my new boyfriend and how happy I was. Well later on that night we were all drunk and this one guy just leaned down and kissed me out of nowhere.<br>  <br>  I called my boyfriend at the time on the way home and told him what had happened. He was happy that I was truthful with him, and let it go. <br>  <br>  But the fact that he was in the bed with her and she didn't get up and move to another bed or couch or even the floor is weird. Being with my boyfriend now I am so happy that if a guy who tried to kiss me came to lay in bed with me I would sleep outside if it were the only way to get away from him. Seriously.<br>  <br>  And that she let it happen again? She could've locked him out of the bathroom or told him to get the hell away from her. She let him hold her??

I can see by this that she is, give her some credit. Has she ever done anything to betray your trust before? If not then you should believe her. She kissed him back because she felt comfort and probably was thinking of you. She kissed back purely out of the stress and emotion of the situation. She has no interest in him.

It also seems like maybe she isn't telling you everything.  Maybe she led this guy on.  Why was she sleeping in the same room with this guy in the first place?  I don't know how your relationship is but in my relationships, I don't put myself in situations like that.  She wasn't even drunk so she could have made a wise decision and avoided the situation entirely.

eJ9xtz4Saa	You are a great person and a very considerate individual for respecting his wishes even when you feel differently, that is love. I would sit him down and discuss how much you want to respect him but that you love him and would like to make love with him to show him that. I would say that just as you have respected him, will he respect you and come to a compromise that is satisfactory to both of you. If he still refuses, then you need to ask yourself what you want more: A great relationship with zero physical contact or a new relationship that will have physical contact. Good luck!|`|oche3k5taa	If you guys have made love before, then theres no reason for it to have stopped unless theres more to his side of the story, and unfortunately that may be the case.

You are just going to have to talk to him about it.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Have your next date at the psychiatrist's office. He obviously has issues that he needs help in dealing with. If he's not willing to work to resolve them since it's affecting your relationship then get rid of him. The only way to respect his feelings about being touched is to put him in the friend zone where he doesn't have to worry about intimate touching.|`|294kSBhyaa	if you want sex and he doesn't, the relationship isn't going to work. so basically you're saying that he can kiss you whenever he feels like it, but you cannot in any way come into contact with your boyfriend? that's insane. you need to be happy in this relationship too. if i were you i'd tell him how i was feeling. if he doesn't respond i'd know that he doesn't care about my wishes, and leave. i don't want to be with someone who only cares about what he wants.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	I would get out of this relationship. He doesn't want to be touched or have sex? Something is definitely wrong here.<br>  People need affection in relationships. Get out. He seems very controlling and unpleasant.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Be patient with him. There are allot of people with his problem. As you spend more time together he will feel more comfortable around you. Let him take things at his pace.|`|rgQ2zUkxaa	u should wait if you really like him|`|M6QvkEBEaa	First off when did this start. You say it's been a long time since you two made love. So what worked last time and could it e repeated.<br>  Secondly it sounds like he may need some councelling for something ( I hate to say it but he may have been abused). To push him to go you can explain to him that you love him and want to express your love physically as well and that it's a part of a reltionshop that you require. If he doesn't want to lose you he may seek councelling, if not, you either have to find someone who can.<br>  If you don't want to give up that easy, then try with less sensitive areas. Holding hands more frequently at first, then the arm around the shoulder and some cuddling. Let him get comfortable first. I used to be a very shy guy and this could also just mean he needs more time. How  long have you two been togetheer I should have asked as well?|`|RCfc9hMKaa	It's hard to say what you should do...

If he's unwilling to try it and see how he feels about it with you, you might want to evaluate if you can make it work with him.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	He needs to get help if he wants to have any type of serious relationship.

19JRf8Cxaa	I know this will be hard for you (and her,) but it is her decision. You cannot stop her from going to this school if she wants to. Support whatever decision she makes. I am sure that making this decision is enough pressure for her already and she doesn't need a bunch of people inputting on it.<br>  <br>  You can't make her decision for her, but you can make the decision to stay close to her. Call or text her every day, have her over to your house as much as possible, and have sleepovers on the weekends! It might be harder to stay in touch with her if she decides to go, but it will be well worth it in the end (for both of you.)|`|X6C6kZKKaa	just let her go. you can continue to be friends. maybe she won't like it over there and she will come back. good luck.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	You cannot stop her from doing what she wants to do. It's her choice. It sounds more like you want to own her. Friends don't do that. I can understand your sadness right now cos you feel like you're gonna lose this friendship. But you can still get in touch with her, and you will meet new people in your life. Experiences like these teaches us to not be attached to something too tightly.

7d768c46ae3bc8900df03faec5161f4eaa	Its not unusual for women to have hormonal issues after the birth of a child.  Factor that in, plus having a child now changes both of your focus' off of each other and on to the child.  That makes for situations like you are in now.<br>  <br>  Sadly, by the time she realizes what she's doing with the picking on you and the flirting... there's a chance that there won't be a relationship to save.<br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest that you both seek out counseling.

It sounds as though you know in your heart of hearts where the marriage is heading but just don’t want to admit it. I don’t think the person she kissed is to blame, nor do I think you’re to blame for looking to online resources for satisfaction. These are symptoms of a larger problem with the larger problem being you may not be right for each other. She’s been flirty with another person and went so far as to kiss them – clearly her having a baby didn’t dampen her interest in men; just you. <br>  <br>  Because there are kids involved, you owe it to everyone to go through counceling. If you’ve done that (and given it time, say a year) I think you’ve done everything you can. Speaking from experience, it’s better to acknowledge your failings and work toward rebuilding. Staying for the children is dangerous because the more unhappy each parent becomes, the more evident it will be to any kids involved. If there is a separation or divorce in your future, it’s best to be done when the kids are young. They’re young and resilient as long as you both always have THEIR best interest in mind. And note, staying with her because you are afraid she may have a man “in the wings” is NOT a good reason to stay in the marriage.<br>  <br>  I have young children (baby, pre-school, and elementary) and I have watched them flourish post-divorce. My ex and I just didn’t work out – we’re both good people, just not good ‘together’. Life gets better once that’s acknowledged.|`|yCFxuqTraa	I know what u mean when u talk about pride, this happened to me once...

LwjOKhgyaa	I think its a bit immature of them to only invite you and not your partner.  At our wedding we invited a guest, who was not that popular with one of my bridesmaids, and was certainly not popular with her parents either, but the guest still came along and there was no hassle at all.  Speak to your partner to see how he feels about it, if he would be upset if you went yourself then dont go.  It might ruin your friendship with your friend, but it seems its half way there already.  Or you could speak to the bride and see if he is welcome to come.  Hope you get it sorted, its not very nice this ill feeling.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well you have to choose either ho's or bro's.  if you choose your bf, and don't go to the wedding, you can count on your friendships being ruined with both the bridesmaid and the bride.  sounds like they've already left you behind anyway which is a shame.  if you go by yourself, you're basically telling them you think it's OK for them to exclude your bf and you don't care.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	It is to the discretion of the bride and groom not to invite your boyfriend. Obviously, this falling out was serious enough to warrant banning him. My suggestion is that you suck it up and go without him, and find out what really happened between them, if you don't already know. It has been my experience that if my friends have asked that the person I was with not to attend, it is for good reason and I should not be with him in the first place.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I'd go to the wedding and respect the bride's wishes not to bring your bf.<br>  <br>  Try putting yourself in the bride's shoes for a minute.  She is a close friend of yours and she wants you to share her wedding day with her.  On the other hand, she has her MOH saying if bf is there, MOH will boycott the wedding.<br>  <br>  Her choices are<br>  1. invite you and your bf as guests because she wants you to share in her day, but then she loses her MOH;<br>  2.not invite you at all and still have her MOH; or<br>  3.  invite you but not your bf and still have her MOH.<br>  <br>  Go to the wedding by yourself and have a great time celebrating with your friend.<br>  <br>  BTW, if you lost all of your friends over whatever this incident was, you need to take this as a red flag.  Unless your friends are completely immature, most people would consider the argument to be between the MOH and the bf and wouldn't take sides.  The fact that they are picking sides to the point that you're getting ostracized by everyone is pretty important.  <br>  <br>  Don't sweep that reality under the rug.  This is a red flag. It's normal if one or 2 friends don't like your bf because that's just preferences.  If he is universally disliked by your friends, there is something about the 2 of you as a couple that makes him incompatible with you.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	Your friend is only a bridesmaid, not the bride, its not up to her.

Try to get your boyfriend and her ok again, they dont have to be good mates, more like aqaintences at least. You should definatly go to the wedding at the end as you are going to pay respects to the couple and they shouldnt mess it up for you (no offense) -- good luck|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	You need to stand by your man, hon.  If your b/f is unwelcome, then so are you.  I certainly wouldn't set foot in a wedding or other event where my fiance was not welcome, because as far as I'm concerned, he's part of me and we come as a set.  In fact, I wouldn't even remain friends with anyone who has that big a problem with my fiance.  I mean, what would the future of that friendship be if I have to keep them away from my man all the time?  No, this is about loyalty, and if you're serious in your love and commitment for your boyfriend, then you'll pick him over all of them and tell them to have fun at the wedding without you!|`|b1xQKDEraa	my motto is, friends are for life. if your bf split up with you tomorrow who would you want to turn to? this is her big day and may only do it once so you should go.

I can appreciate why the bride is protecting her friend, we woman are loyal that way, however, the bride will also have to be equally understanding of you and your decision<br>  <br>  If your boyfriend was a friend of the bride and groom, this bridesmaids spat has to be put aside so that everyone has equal opportunity to bless the union and give their congrats, does the bride always let this bridesmaid walk all over her? Have a private conversation with her over coffee, and explain to her that you are trying to be neutral over the disagreement for obvious reasons, but your feeling as thought everyone is taking it out on you, and your finding that really unfair, ask her for ADVICE, and make it seem like it isnt a ***** session, or your way of getting your boyfriend invited, rather your asking her for some advice, support and help over the situation, tell her like you told us your fed up almost now, and you want to be there for your friend of her big day, and your really confused and hurt, youll get further by talking to her, and you will feel better letting all this out in the open|`|91e9695f022eaa142b297e5f77df3a74aa	First of all do you really want to go to the wedding? These people cant really be your friends if they cant put an arguement behind them to be supportive of you and your decisions!? If you still really love them as friends then you should definetly go, missing your friends wedding is something that you WILL regret! Speak to your boyfriend and see if he would mind you going alone, im sure he wouldnt be that bothered if he doesnt like them?! <br>  <br>  <br>  ...People are so petty lol|`|hUGyzfwlaa	The Bride will not want to be hassled with anything other than making her day special.  <br>  <br>  If it is important to you to go to the wedding and do the 'right' thing then go - you dont have to stay for the entire event<br>  <br>  If however you can live without these 'friends' then dont go - spend the day with your bf and find new friends who value you both<br>  <br>  One word of caution - make sure you are choosing the right side - you dont mention what the fight or disagreement was about but ensure that you understand both sides before making your choice
KX5ALUzWaa	A man will lock eyes with a woman he is interested in getting to know. If this look is accompanied by a large smile, all the better! A man who is a bit less confident in your reaction may look at you until you meet his eyes and then he will look away. If he is interested you will feel his eyes on you again very soon. <br>  <br>  When a man is looking at a woman he is interested in his pupils will dilate. This is perhaps that hardest sign to catch. The eyebrows rising slightly and quickly may accompany this. This sign is true for both men and women. Our pupils will dilate when we are looking at anything we like whether if be an object or person. <br>  <br>  Men and women differ when it comes to eye contact during conversation. A man who is intently listening to what you have to say may be looking off to the side or towards the floor. Women usually take this as a sign that he is not listening when in fact he is paying close attention to you. At the same time if he is constantly looking away and watching other people, he may be showing non-interest. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  x

AA11817490	hey, it sounds like u got it pretty bad and readin it makes me realise how lucky I am. My family never really had money my dad left me, my mum and brother so it was down to my mum to keep us goin, I remember gettin clothes from charity shops & hand me downs and my mum having to literally count out all her pennies in the shops and having to put things back because she didnt have enough. but now she's fine living with a partner, brothers happy and I'm living in a little flat on the side of my fiances parents house, we both have jobs, car and independance but to be honest I still find myself moaning we dont have money to do this or that or our own house away from his family or holidays, but seriously, I read what u said and ur totally in ur rights to be angry at people like 'us' i suppose we really do forget how lucky we are and how bad other people have it, so I'm sorry. I guess in my lame defence we just dont realise how other people have it or how bad things can get untill we experience it ourselves. But i really hope things get better for you and I believe in life you have bad times but there will always be good times to keep the balance, maybe ur break will come soon x|`|wqL84O8Naa	rant much?|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I supposed we should feel sorry for them because they don't have the grit to suck it up and get on with life.

Instead of worrying about these people, be proud of youself and your ability to keep on keepin' on.  <br>  <br>  Some people have internal poverty ... feel sorry for them that they are lacking in substance.  Keep plugging away, and ask "how can I improve my situation."  Asking how, over and over and over, is what keeps someone in the game and makes what seems impossible into a reality.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Jesus, I got halfway through that and stopped.  Sounds like you are very jealous of other people and feel that you should be pittied.  Which I feel sorry for you, BUT I also feel sorry for the ones you are whinning about.

If you display the attitude you are giving off on here to guys then you wont attract any guys with good intentions.<br>  McDonalds is always hiring by the way, you have to do something if you need money.  Feeling bad for yourself and getting mad at others is only going to make things worse.

You'll have to prep yourself for it and once you tell her what the consequences are for misbehavior, you will have to follow through on your penalty.  This will be step one in you holding her accountable for her behavior.

They will likely not go to jail, but the criminal charges would teach them a good lesson.  The civil suit will make them cough up the money they owe.  And talk to your credit card company. Since the charge was fraudulent, they might hold Verizon responsible and let you off the hook.<br>  <br>  NEver speak to these people again.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CM0C65dtaa	Rather than sue your parents, go after Verizon for allowing it.

If not go to the clerk of the courts and take a warrant out. They will not be put in jail for such a small amount how ever they may have to post a bond but this is doubtful. but if you do not show them your feed up with it it's going to keep on and could get worse. You will not have to hire a legal adviser unless it goes to Superior Court and then I would say be sure and get one.

The legal occurance we incorrectly call "marriage" is that two adults become next of kin to one another, creating a new family. The expectation that as an adult we will cease listing our parents as our next of kin and instead create a new family with a next of kin of our own choosing is not such that gender should play a role. <br>  <br>  Whether the law calls this may be civil union, domestic partnership, or whatever -- but most of us will continue to call it "marriage" and we will come to accept same gender couples in the same way we more and more accept mixed race couples.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	REF: you say gay unions/relationships have NEVER happen in history you say hmmmm i don't believe that.<br>  <br>  How about in Japan , where Shudo (衆道 shudō), the Japanese tradition of age-structured homosexuality was prevalent in samurai society from the medieval period until the end of the 19th century.<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  In the story of Nero, p113 Suetonius mentioned (in the context of Nero's vices) that Nero married a slave boy, and also a male friend.

I married the love of my life, and I wouldn't favor denying that joy to anyone else.|`|w1necKzYaa	I think that gay people should have every right that straight people do! I like what one person told me! I find it funny how many people are all for it Yet it is still illegal in so many places!|`|7rokG1kfaa	its wateva|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	They pay their taxes - why can't they get married?|`|Qas05nZraa	it's a bad idea|`|tyl9aSu9aa	I am all for it.<br>  <br>  What bothers me most, though, is when pundits get on the television or the radio and say that same sex marriage is a threat to the institution of marriage.<br>  <br>  What planet are they on?? What's really a threat to marriage is people who don't take it seriously, and figure that if it doesn't work out, they'll, "just get a divorce." Divorce should be available, but like abortion, it shouldn't be your immediate fix to a problem.<br>  <br>  Pre-nups, I think, are the biggest threat to marriage tho - if you're planning your divorce before you even get married, what does that say about your confidence level in the marriage?|`|sDAnuaBYaa	If marriage is only for procreation we should make sure that couples who don't want to have children aren't allowed to get married either, after all, it's only for procreation right?<br>  <br>  Oh, and we should also make sure that every woman who is pregnant and single gets married off to someone so she doesn't raise that child alone. It's just *not right* dammit!!   Not only that, but just to preserve the sanctity of marriage, let's be sure to abolish divorce as well. <br>  <br>  And, well, gay marriage is an abomination in the eyes of god. A man laying with man, it says it right in there. So let's throw all those gays in jail for their abominations! Make sure you get those that work on the sabbath too, AND anyone who eats crustaceans, and animals with a cloven hoof! Those are all abominations too!  As for those who don't believe in God but still want to get married, throw them in jail too. Not believing in god is an abomination!<br>  <br>  As I'm sure you've caught on I am being sarcastic. There isn't one argument against Gay marriage that stands up to scrutiny. Not a single one! Instead people use their religion to spread HATE. (Religious passages were also used to try to stem the Civil Rights movements with African Americans, and the Feminist movement/ suffragettes) <br>  <br>  I live in Canada, and same sex marriage is protected here. Just another thing that makes me proud to be Canadian.|`|mesqZ1mUaa	Since conservative groups are so against the idea, this is what we should do.<br>  <br>  Remove ALL civil benefits that couples get from being married. Then establish civil partnership benefits open to all couples to wish to apply for it. Instead of getting a marriage license, you apply for civil partnership.<br>  <br>  Those who chose can get that partnership blessed in a church and get a non-legal marriage certificate. Having a marriage certificate would not be considered sufficient to get joint health insurance, file joint taxes or any of the other civil benefits.<br>  <br>  That way the churches can protect the so-called sanctity of marriage, but our government does not legalize discrimination and marginalization of a group of it's citizens.|`|ge3meKYEaa	Why should only straight people be torched with Marriage?  LOL<br>  <br>  No really, I think everyone should be able to be married and legally bound to the person they love.  Realistically, people make it a religious thing but the government wants to prevent it because HEALTH CARE providers don't want to cover it because it will cut into their profits if they have to cover same sex marriages.<br>  <br>  It's always all about money!|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	Believe it or not, most of my friends are gay or bisexual. I don't mind at all. It doesn't make them any less of a person to me. It's their choice. I have the choice to be with the person I want to be with. They have the same choice. If we say homosexuals cannot get married, then we should abolish divorce. Because I know gay couples who have been together since their high school years and are now in their 50's and 60's and I know people who are heterosexual and have been divorced multiple times!<br>  <br>  If marriage is only for procreation, then I guess men and women who are sterile don't have the right to be married either! Which means you're saying my sister, who I love very much, has no right to ever find love and publicly express that love.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to convert anyone to my beliefs, but what is it hurting? Are we so sickened by things we find that are different that we can't accept someone and the person they love just because they are the same sex. It's just as bad as being racist or sexist. Prejudice is illegal and yet the government is doing a fine job of showing everyone just how to be prejudice!<br>  <br>  Personally, it's not my choice. But if my best friend falls in love with a girl, I'll be at their wedding! Heck, I'll be helping to plan it!|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I think anyone who wants to get married should be allowed to, regardless of whether they are marrying a man or a woman.  Aside from being the biggest commitment a couple can make together, it also offers all kinds of government protection in the form of tax deductions, insurance and healthcare issues, etc.  I don't see how it's constitutional to deny these rights to people just because they are simply not attracted to the opposite sex.  To me, it's no different than the way America used to deny women and minorities their rights to vote, etc.|`|FzFSzilmaa	they say that "marriage is the ultimate show of commitment"...<br>  <br>  do heteros corner the market on commitment??? well, if the divorce rate is anything to go by, the answer is NO...<br>  <br>  why shouldn't homosexuals get married to show their commitment to their partners??? just cos they are gay/lesbian, doesn't mean they are any less committed to their partners...|`|62cQv3z3aa	i think that everybody should have a chance at love and everybody deserves it too... if they decide to love someone with the same body part as them then that is them... they shouldnt care what other people think of them as long as they are happy... it also depends on what they believe in|`|tvUAO4ioaa	I think if we let celebrities get married and divorced and married and divorced and married, every other human being should be allowed to as well.<br>  <br>  It doesn't effect my life, so I say, whatever makes people happy.

Each to their own!|`|PccHbsKbaa	i think everyone deserves to be happy, so i dont have a problem with it, if thats what they want.. then so be it|`|hizRPh9raa	I say "why not"? They're fighting so hard for their right to get married and straight people who have the right often treat it like a game. "If it isn't easy, I'll toss it aside and go on to the next one." Gay people can probably reinstate the meaning of marriage for those who take it for granted and have cheapened the meaning. Marriage isn't just about procreation (too many people do that without it). It's about the love of two people publicly announcing that they want to spend the rest of their lives together. I don't see what it would hurt to legalize same sex marriage. It's just a piece of paper. I don't see why everyone is so angered by the prospect of this being legalized. I say "go for it!"|`|cBsmcc8Daa	let em get married, straight people can they should be able to also. i dont understand why just because they are different that they cannot share the same benifits as we do. its like slavery, black people were different so we enslaved them.  now everyone hopefully realizes that differences in appearence, ethnicity, and sexual preference should not stop a person from enjoying the benefits that the rest of us get.|`|f8bazE0aaa	It doesn't bother me about same sex marriage. <br>  They can do whatever the want, it's there life.
rtuunGMSaa	It's going to affect you. Only a robot could not let it bother her. <br>  <br>  My gram died shortly before my wedding and I just kept reminding myself that she was so happy for me. <br>  When you start to feel overwhelmed, think of something he did that made you laugh. For me, it was that my gram hated dancing. So she kept teasing me that she'd step on my feet during the bridal dance. So whenever someone stepped on my feet, I laughed and thought of her. <br>  <br>  Don't deny yourself the emotions you're feeling, but don't let them rule you.  You're going to be sad. You're going to cry. But try remember the wonderful things he did and said. <br>  <br>  You could make the rehearsal dinner a celebration of him, too. That way you can get a lot of the emotion out before the big day. Have people bring pictures. Serve his favorites foods, tell stories. Remember that your whole family is affected by this. Don't try to get by on your own, and be there for those who may be too proud to ask for help.<br>  <br>  Be strong. And enjoy your day!|`|oche3k5taa	your dad would want you to be happy.<br>  he may not be there where everyone can see him at the wedding,<br>  but he'll still be walking with you down the isle, and watching over you.<br>  just have a big picture of him printed, and sit it on a frame near the stage [or whatever your getting married on] and remember he'll always be with you.|`|f94429414cd98123c4786b002c4a1354aa	i am so sorry to hear that your father has passed away but you should not feel guilty you have a right to have joy in life especially have joy in the Lord if you dont have that joy take the time and invite Jesus Christ into your life  you wont regret it  and by the way congrats on the marriage|`|uuh9VEhcaa	Your dad would want your wedding to go on, and he'd want you to be happy.

Not that you have to be supportive of premarital sex, but it's your place to support her and encourage her. You can't control her actions but you don't have the "right" to chastise her mistakes.|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	It's not normal in this society but it is not your place to tell her if it is right or wrong.

oche3k5taa	I tried giving up on love. i lived with my ex for two years, and oh i loved him sooo much. I promised myself he was the one, i thought there was noone else. well, he really had a problem, and i was not his only addiction, if you get me. <br>  <br>  so i walked away. and swore to never let anyone hurt me like that agian, and i gave up on love, just like that.<br>  it was too painful and pointless.<br>  and alot of guys would ask me out, but being a spoiled ***** i would play games with them.<br>  noone expected me to fall for another guy.<br>  <br>  <br>  but surely enough, another guy cast his spell on me, an d here i am in love again.<br>  and i wont let go this time.<br>  <br>  so yes it is silly.<br>  dont give up on love because your scared pf pain.<br>  sometimes getting hurt can be the best thing for you.<br>  you just have to live your life and take chances, and find that one special guy you feel safe around, and love being around.<br>  <br>  but dont forget to complete yourself first.

Fear of commitment either stops you from getting into relationships, or you block out the fear and go for it. Most people let the fear take over their needs and wants for a significant other. <br>  <br>  All I can say is that if you or someone else is meant to be with someone and commited to them, it will happen when it is supposed to. Don't worry about forcing the issue. It will only happen one day if it is meant to happen. Have faith.|`|nfQhsRvfaa	If that's your reason for giving up then yes it's silly.

Wait until you're ready to commit. I'm the same way actually, I have a hard time trusting anybody (nothing personal) but girls especially.

Texting, Internet and etc... Theres is a need for face to face conversations. Adults and teens need to stop sitting around argueing over who is right or wrong but to come up with a decision together.

Too many parents work all the time, spend no time with their kids and then buy them stuff because they feel guilty.  They need to work lees hours, have less stuff and spend more family time!  Most parents don't even know who their kids are, let alone what they are doing most of the time!  They just have a fit when their child does something they don't agree with.  That is why so many teens do crazy stuff, they are just trying to get their parents attention, any way they can!|`|8AqePkCqaa	Nowadays it's bad not enough communication between them. For me I have 4 teens to get them to open I started by listening to their music to a point. I also got a myspace to try and relate to them. Too many parents both work so kids are left behind to live daily on their own and they're rebuking. I'm a school custodian and kids are definitely in for a rude awakening when they get out of school. The real world is hard.|`|DKGiGbxGaa	I would have to say talk. when i were teenager me and my mon were close (still is) and we talk about every thing (include sex). It some things i don't tell here but we talk about everything.

Your local family court should be able to give you that information, however you would be better off speaking to an attorney, most of whom will give free consultations if you call and ask for one.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!|`|NeTNnvSZaa	As long as you and your husband are separated, yes.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Yes.  Child support is legally payable whenever parents don't live together.|`|rv0EMOKwaa	It really depends on your state.|`|GoGaYHDyaa	Men look at this question!<br>  <br>  Marry foreign women only!
