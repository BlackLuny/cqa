A person has hardened their heart and is going to do what they want even knowing that it's wrong.      As in this verse:    1Ti 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;    1Ti 4:2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Have you ever seen Dead Like Me?

cMa5DNhYaa	just tell her that sometimes instead of a mom and a dad loving each other that a mom and a mom or a dad and a dad love each other and that it is normal and nothing is wrong with it. Kids look up to their older role models so if she sees that you are ok with it chances are she will be ok with it to.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Tell her anyone kissing is gross! LOL. The most important thing is leading by example. Your attitudes about an towards gays will effect her.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	If she thinks it's gross, she probably HAS been exposed to it (in a negative way). Children are usually accepting of others, until told that they shouldn't be. Maybe she hears other children saying mean things about gay people - I don't know. Or maybe (it's possible) she came to this conclusion on her own.    At any rate, explain to her that gay people are just like everyone else - they just have different relationships. Just like some people only eat vegetables (even though some people think veggies are yucky!) some people are attracted to members of their own gender (even though some people think that's yucky).    Above all, instill in her a sense of tolerance. Tell her that gay people are people too, and must be treated with respect. ALL people deserve respect, and also deserve love and intimacy.|`|3pK4Gn6Kaa	Don't worry, the public school system is going to explain it to her and indoctrinate her to accept and glorify this lifestyle.  And be sure, you will have no say in what she is being forced to learn or accept.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Tell her just what you told us: It's not gross, and many men marry other men, and women marry other women. Keep in mind, though, that at certain ages, kids also think heterosexuality is gross, too.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	I have a seven and a six year old sister.    Our older stepsister is a lesbian.. it's interesting to see their responses:    Seven Year Old: Ewwww that's silly and they are just pretending!    Six Year Old: No they are not! Girls can have girlfriends and boys can have boyfriends - even if they both smell. It's love!      Hehe.. cute.. Basically if they ask I just shrug and say 'they love each other so it doesn't matter' and they accept it and no longer comment on it anymore. It's great :)|`|QHwxYQxFaa	dont tell her that they are married.tell her that they are just really good friends. good luck|`|c1wCuGzpaa	Thank God she has a good head on her shoulders. She is seven and knows right from young. But anyway....just tell her that people are allowed to make there own choices in life and they made the choice to be date girls...lol that doesnt even sound right sayin but yeah...uhmm please make sure you let her know that just because some people do it doesnt make it right. You are the big sis she is looking up to what you think about things... Please dont steer her wrong. Take care sweety.|`|3secB3Smaa	at age seven you cannot explain that.. All you can say is that we should be kind to people who are different from us and leave it at that.|`|AA12172766	Cool question. Since she is so young she doesn't know the ignorance of her ways and this is the perfect time to teach her the love is between two adults with no boundaries among gender/race/hair type or otherwise.     To put is similar for her: "Love is blind and you should accept people for who they are as long as they are trying to do good."     Hope this helps.    shay|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Tell her that they love each other! They find what's on the inside, and sometimes men have different spirits and traits than women, that other men are attracted to!|`|vL8JErXNaa	Tell her that when people love each other and want to be with each each other all the time they get married just like everybody else|`|8Pbevy7laa	Generally most young children think that anything to do with sex or relationships is gross, I wouldn't worry about it. If, like you, she has the same upbringing she will learn in time to be accepting of other people and their life-style choices.|`|PyAgEejnaa	Tell her that some boys like girls and some girls like boys. Then there are some boys who like boys and some girls who like girls. It's not something to be ashamed of, it's just who they are. And even though those people may be different from her, she still has to respect them. They're people too, no matter who they choose to love.|`|vg3ih0foaa	I don't think you should mislead children, but you really don't have to give them brutal honesty though. Just tell her that because everybody's different, not everbody likes the same things. I like apples but he might like oranges, I might like girls and she might like men. To kids, it won't really affect them either way unless they've already been exposed to homophobic behavior. And teaching kids tolerance while they're still young, lets them grow into adults that have more compassion and understanding later on. Diversity is wonderful :)|`|cnc1j5IAaa	Ha, I had the same thing with a girl I used to babysit.     I find the conversation is a lot more centered on what they think love means than the idea of same-sex relationships.     I used the love between a couple that was understood by the girl - in this case, her parents, and put two women in their place. I asked her if two people love each other enough - shouldn't they be together and do what makes them happy? There shouldn't be any restrictions put on love, right. It doesn't have to be between a man and woman. It can be between people of the same gender, people of different ages and races. Emphatically, love is blind. It may be gross to her because she's never seen it before, but is the love her parents share gross? They love each other make each other happy without risking anyone else's happiness. Who should and who would stop them?     But of course, you have to fully explain the idea. Explain why some people may think same-sex relationships are "gross". Of course, that includes religious bigotry and prejudiced thinking.     IMO, even if you think one side is right, both sides should be given as long as the person is willing to hear and willing to consider it carefully. The choice is theirs, but you can help them make an informed decision. I mean, this is where bigotry and prejudice can start by being fed choice facts as easily as open minds can be developed.|`|c65079a866af13b504815c397b72f4d1aa	Her reaction was natural and appropriate. Homosexuality is not something that should be celebrated. We can try to delude ourselves and say it is natural and normal but that does not change the fact that it isn't. The Germans told themselves all day long that they were the master race but it turns out they weren't. Its the same principle behind homosexuality.|`|NwXnzARwaa	Most boys fall in love with girls and most girls fall in love with boys, but some boys fall in love with other boys and some girls fall in love with other girls. Gay is a word used to describe boys who love other boys, and lesbian is a word to describe girls who love other girls. When people love each other so much that they want to be together forever they might want to get married, even the boys who love other boys and the girls who love other girls.

FmazIF6Maa	Magic spells are real... but muttering a bunch of word or following instructions on a website to wave a wand over a candle won't work for you.    I could give you my whole book of shadows and you wouldn't be able to do them.    Spells aren't instant gratification or everyone would walk around twitching their noses instead of working.    Magic requires mental discipline obtained through meditation, learning how to alter your states of consciousness, focus and direct energy.    It also requires knowledge; understanding what you're doing and why you're doing it. The principles of magic and why it works.     Really, if you're not going to study and learn magic properly, don't bother dabbling. Best outcomewill be nothing happens; worst case scenario, you'll botch things up and not know how to fix things.|`|IJZZkDUvaa	This is like asking if Prayer or Miracles are real and where you can get some online.    Spells require you to believe in what you are doing, you have to know what you are doing, and you need to be careful - or you can get into big trouble.      Spells are NOT the place to begin if you are interested in Wicca or Paganism as a faith. You first have to figure out what Gods and Goddesses you worship - what culture are you from? I worship the Greek and Roman Gods and Goddesses, so all of my faith and ritual is based upon things from that culture.    If you are looking for a "quick fix" to problems, then you are looking in the wrong place. For magic to work, you have to have good intentions and good energy to put into achieving your goals - much like prayer or meditation in other traditions.    If you are looking to magic to bring you love or to have power over another, you are in BIG TROUBLE. Magic cannot and should not be used for either, or you will have an awful experience.    Finally, if you decide to ignore those of us here who are pagan, and you try to do some spell you find on the internet or in a book in your library, you need to remember the Rule of Three: whatever you do - magic spells or otherwise - will come back to you times three. If you do something selfish, abusive, retaliatory, mean or harmful, the karmic effects that you will have to experience will be THREE TIMES what you did. (In other words, it will REALLY suck for you!)    It's best not to play around with magic, as it is powerful stuff and can end up backfiring and hurt you or someone you love.|`|zR0Dcdevaa	There are some religions that believe they're real, but you have to believe yourself that they're real for them to have any effect, because it's all psychological.  Even still, you're not going to find Harry Potter magic spells that can turn people into diarrhea or anything, but some cultures sentence people to death with magic spells, and the people actually die, choking to death on their own vomit, because the psychological effects are so strong, that they become physiological.    In short.    No.    Not real.|`|W4mXcYu9aa	Yes.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lwuFEz_y...|`|G1fDp1PEaa	lol    I'm sorry, but not in the real world.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	Spells are simply a manifestation of will.  Kind of like when Christians pray to their god.  It's the same thing.  How real they are depends entirely on you.  As for websites, no self respecting witch is going to put proper spells on the internet for just anyone to read.  Besides, the best spells are the ones you write yourself.  Just think about what you want to accomplish and write your spell from there.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	If you are Pagan, yes. If you believe in prayer, yes.|`|2mlHf7Opaa	No.  Definitely not.  Even if you're a neo-pagan, and you believe with all your heart, spells are not real.

Get a girlfriend makeout with her in the hallways. Be comfortable no matter what people say to you. It's none of their concern. You'll be surprised how many people "come out."|`|QOxtCMEAaa	I think you'd look pretty silly trying to explain it to a building!|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Well, you don't want the whole school to know something they don't need to know, right?

It does it every day, with super model contests, what is a better looking car, and more.|`|5u4pKWTRaa	Maybe because they don't know pretty well that person that they are judging.Also it has to do with a little bit of ignorance.But there is another thing people reflects their insides in how they dress and act.|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	1) Because they are using their brain to try to discern potential problems, if you saw a bald headed white male, wearing a wife beater, and metal tipped shoes with red laces, you would be wary (or taking a gample). Because these things are associated with white supremacists.     2) Its usually the first piece of info we get.    3) We have some control on the kind of look we want to put off.    Edit:     Also I'm not saying that people can miss judged, base on looks but, we are generally good at recognizing patterns.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Well, before they know you, that's all they have to go on.|`|FPT6pstraa	Everybody does it, men and women.

nnwbxPKfaa	They're spoiled. Their parents hand them everything they ask for without expecting them to earn it. They're allowed to do whatever they please and have almost no supervision or restrictions.

With love|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	We all need God, not just Athiests are incomplete without God, but everyone is incomplete without God. It is more arrogant to think you don't need God, than to think you do.|`|LjsRfaskaa	You are correct. I don't think anyone would argue that God by any definition is an Indescribable Force.     So how can anyone possibly comprehend or know an force that can not even be described.    Any self respecting creator would not want fauning. That would mean God was a egotistical child that needed some toys to play with.     I would not want my children to faun over me morning noon and night. I would worry if they started doing that.     But quantum physics is comming to the conclusion that there has to be a univeral consiousness as a collective of all energy. Including us. Matter is an energy vibrating at a particular frequency. Life and death are an illusion because we simply change into another form.

God forbid we try to help you people. As soon as we try to inform you of our views you act like you're being persecuted and your lives are unbearable. Cry me river.|`|qEh84eqNaa	Yes, it is, but conversely, isn't it arrogant for some atheists to think that theists are unintelligent wackjobs who can't think logically and reject reality? It goes both ways. It's arrogant for anyone to assume anything about another person's life, whether it is a Christian assuming they know  better than an atheist or an atheist assuming they know  better than a Christian. The individual knows better than anyone else what is best for them; some feel "incomplete" without a God, and others, like yourself, don't need a belief in God to feel fulfilled.|`|EepiLrmZaa	yes it is self centered. that is a side effect of bible poisoning.|`|qPzxKhrlaa	Yes it is. I was guilty of thinking exactly that in my Christian days but it wasn't from a feeling of "I'm better than you" but a feeling of "How sad that they don't know the same joy I do", if that makes you feel a little better. As a former Christian, I have to say I miss the feeling of "knowing" there is more to this life than this life and feeling that a divine being loved me personally no matter what. ;)|`|c65079a866af13b504815c397b72f4d1aa	No more so than atheists assuming we Christians are deluded.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Keep in mind that these are the same people who believe that the divine creator of the entire friggin' Universe personally cares about what they eat and who they have sex with. As such, I'd say arrogance is something they're rather good at. Claiming that atheists' lives are hollow and empty without God is a rather small step further.|`|MvZMA5BGaa	I wouldn't say incomplete.  I say dead in their sin.|`|s2TJ6H1raa	Well religion is supposed to help people with empty lives to find meaning; therefore people who are religious do not have meaning in their lives.  I think that being a good person and living from ones own centre and morals are good.

(Class of 1957!)     IF YOU ARE A CHEERLEADER OR HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST....    Q. -- What do you think are the advantages of being a cheerleader?  A. --  I don't recall any "advantages". For example: None of the teachers  gave you better grades or anything!       Q.-- How about disadvantages?  A. -- There were a few dis-advantages. -- The one I recall most is that we had to ride to the games on the School bus, with the team. It would have been MUCH more fun and more comfortable to go in our own cars, but they wanted to make sure that we made it there on time.        Q. -- What are your concerns and hopes?  A. -It had nothing to do with Cheerleading!     Q. -- What do you do for fun?  A. -- What we did was pretty standard at the time.   1. After school we went to the "Sugar Bowl" to listen to records on the jukebox, and dance.   2. We went to Saturday night movies.  3. We went to the Burger Drive In after the movies, and just   "hung out".   4. And of course there were the Friday night football games!      Q.-- Do you think it's easier because guys to date because you're a cheerleader?    A. -- I don't know on that one, as I had a "steady" before I became a Cheerleader, and we were together all through school. (We got married and have been together for over 50 years.)       Q. --  Anything else you would like to add?  A. -- Those times was a lot of fun. The 50's were probably the "best" time in history! We had all the "necessities" like cars, phones, TV's, washers, dryers, planes, trains, etc: But not all the negativity of today.  -- We could sit and watch TV with the whole family, and not have to censor it for kids.  -- EVERYONE could watch I Love Lucy together!!!     I miss the 50's!     Thank you so much for anything you can answer for me!  A. -- I hope this helps a little!       .|`|Rjgu1f31aa	advantages- your usually well respected and athletic. if you like to perform and show off then cheerlleading is a good  sport for you  disadvantages- you need to be very committed and it takes up soo much time. I have to miss alot of things because of it.    I really don't think guys are gonna like you more just because your a cheerleader, it's not all like in the movies where the cheerleaders are all stuck up snobs (where i'm from, at least. I don't know about yours.)    if you really want to do cheerleading then definately go for it. it is a fun sport and if keeps you in shape(:

It is really good that you want to be a better muslim and do all thoses wonderful things..mashallah.:)  as for hijab...it will take some time and getting use to...at school people will stare and sometimes make faces but just ignore them and expalin to them that i am wearing it because God told me to and i want to dress modestly and not show my hair.. u r doing it for God so just trust in God and ask him to make it easy for you....I know you are strong and can face anything so yh...the people who treat you differently like meanly in school cause your starting to practice islam more and your wearing hijab are not your friends and just forget those losers.   and as for ur bruvas friends who come to your house randomly, just wear a scarf, like maybe a winder muffler or something around your neck while you are roming your house but not in your room...and when you see his friends just drape the scarf over your hair and just put it down when they go away or you go to your room....i do it all the time....  as for you family>>dont give up on them!  DONT GIVE UP! DONT GIVE UP! DONT GIVE UP !  once they see you praying and practicing more, inshallah that will eventually influense and open their eyes more to islam...but the number one rule is not to give up on them and DONT let them influense you and let them drag you back! dont....  try to expalin to your mum that praying 5 times a day is mandetory and do it in a soft kind way...once she sees you doing it she might do it....inshallah (god willing)   so yh try your best my sister..inshallah Allah will reward you for your efforts and dont abondon Islam....read books and listen to lectures about islam to increase your knowledge of Islam and read the quran.  and the number one rule is to PRACTICE islam in your everyday life....ill keep you in my duas and if u need help anytime ill give you my msn.....masalam|`|FJYuMpfoaa	as'salaamu alaikum,    What your family is going thru is the result of not practicing islam and not being raised properly with islamic values. your family lacks islamic knowledge which is why they believe what they believe. You should focus on learning about Islam as much as you can inshalalh, this knowledge will help you make the right choices and give knowledge to talk to your family also.

When His Kingdom is set up on Earth where Christ is the ruler, those who have qualified to enter the Kingdom will become a spiritual body.    This is the process of being born again.  God and Christ are made of spirit.  It only makes sense that we are made of spirit as well.    We are to become God and become apart of the God family.  Just as the children of a family look similar to their parents.  We were intended to look similar to God and our future brother Jesus. We are intended to have His same power...if we qualify.    Otherwise, the other option is the Lake of Fire.     This is all supported by the Holy Bible.|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	Of course He can.  He's omnipotent.

M3Xmqlt8aa	It is any ones guess. That is literally one of the most vague stories conveyed in the Bible maybe next to the prayer of Jabez. In Jewish mythology some meanings were given but they were written a thousand years after Christ. I did not commit any of it to memory because it is just guessing also. All possible motives are after the fact and disconnected from the actual story. I had often suspected there was a very fine blonde girl that Kain fancied and when his younger sibling tried to cut in, well Kain being full of pride  a bit slothfully tried to talk sense to Abel and seeing that had no good effect on Abels greed  he filled up with a vain wrath and unloaded his brothers blood onto the Earth in a Glutonous heat of lust and jealous mad passion for the girl. And this was just edited out to sanitize the story. The evidence is thin but Kain takes a wife and builds a city right after the murder, so there she is. Later King David repeats this murderous folly with a young hotty Bathsheba. It is a pattern, Der Bibel is full of them.    LMAO! :)|`|FmbwIbtzaa	The two boys never got along well, and this matter of sacrifices further contributed to the growing hatred between them. Abel knew he was the son of both Adam and Eve and never failed to impress upon Cain that Adam was not his father. Cain was not pure violet as his father was of the Nodite race later admixed with the blue and the red man and with the aboriginal Andonic stock. And all of this, with Cain's natural bellicose inheritance, caused him to nourish an ever-increasing hatred for his younger brother.   The boys were respectively eighteen and twenty years of age when the tension between them was finally resolved, one day, when Abel's taunts so infuriated his bellicose brother that Cain turned upon him in wrath and slew him. Page 848-4|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	I believe it was jealousy, rage, and frustration. I believe jealousy is the one motive that is taught most often.|`|E7fguoVBaa	Selfish hatred.    Hebrews 11:4 points out, Cains offering lacked the motivation of faith that made Abels sacrifice acceptable.    It is likely that Cain gave little more than superficial thought to his offering and merely went through the motions of presenting it. But God did not approve of mere formal worship. Cain had developed a bad heart, and Jehovah God discerned that he had wrong motives. Cains reaction to the rejection of his sacrifice reflected his true spirit. Rather than seeking to set matters straight, Cain grew hot with great anger, and his countenance began to fall. (Genesis 4:5) His bearing betrayed wicked ideas and intentions.|`|q2x13qDWaa	Jealousy because Yahweh favored Abel over him.  Apparently Cain was a loose cannon, and Yahweh pushed him a little too far.  Then Yahweh is angry at Cain when he finds out Cain killed his brother.  But Yahweh is omniscient.    Yeah, that all makes perfect sense.

Edit for CJ: clearly you don't understand biblical teaching or the teaching of the Apostolic church. Perhaps you should learn what our teachings are first, and then compare them to scripture. You might be surprised.    I can guarantee that those who call Oneness a cult do not understand the teaching and have not compared it to scripture. I can guarantee it, because if they had, they would see that it fits scripture perfectly. But more often than not, people misunderstand what Oneness teaches, and then they think it contradicts scripture.

fEkKuGlEaa	The question, I think, refers to the second set of tablets that God made after Moses smashed the first set in anger. The Bible clearly speaks many, many times of the tablets being placed in the ark of the covenant.     The answer about the Ethiopian church claiming to have the tablets is correct. They do make that claim.     Most people think they are in the ark, and if still in existence, buried somewhere under the temple mount.

Sinai, then came down to where the Hebrews he led out of Egypt were worshiping a golden calf that they had made. (they were worshiping something that was not God) Moses got really angry and threw the tablets at the ground really hard. They broke, but Moses was able to go to the top of Mt. Sinai again to get new tablets.     No, I don't think anyone has them now.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	There are many legends about where they have gone and who has them, but rabbis in Israel have said that they know where they are when the temple is rebuilt in Jerusalem, they will be brought out.

Respect HER identity.  Maybe this will help:    To know a persons sexuality you must know how they identify gender-wise first.

If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are lesbian.    If a person identifies as male, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are straight.

If she is male to female than she is a woman, if she likes you she is a lesbian. If you don't like her that way, you don't like her that way, just tell her you don't like her that way. You don't have to bring up her medical history.|`|xuuaMTmtaa	SHE is gay. She's a lesbian.     If your friend who was born male, and is transitioning to female, but is sexually attracted to other females, that would make her a lesbian.     Sexual orientation and gender identity are two different things.     Let me ask you it this way, so maybe you can understand: Is your sexual orientation defined by your vagina, or do you define it by the person you're attracted to outside of yourself?       Now..your gender.  Do you define yourself as a female because you have a vagina, or because that's just how you feel yourself to be and fit in society?      See? Two different things.     Your friend is a female, who is attracted to females. She's a lesbian.  I think your friend isn't confused in the least.  I think maybe YOU are though.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	If your friend is on hormones (the right way) then they are bisexual...or perhaps SHE is gay.    By gay I mean lesbian.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	As others have said, it's probable that your friend identifies as female, so when she says "I'm gay", she means she likes women.    Or it might be that she was gay before and liked men when she was male, but that transitioning helped her realize that she could feel attraction towards women.  Getting on hormones and living your life as your true gender tends to bring out a lot of changes, including sexual attraction.  Lord knows there are so many transmen who previously thought they only liked women, but then start becoming attracted to men post-transition.    You're just going to have to break it to her gently that you're not interested.    Also, if you want to be a good friend, you should probably start using female pronouns for her.|`|fL0wHyNNaa	You keep calling her "him." That's pretty disrespectful for someone you call a friend. If she has told you that she is transgendered, and is becoming transsexual, do her a common courtesy of calling her, "her."     Male to female trans people= her, she, hers, etc  Female to male trans people= him, his, he, etc    As far as the attraction to you, it may be completely natural. If however, you don't feel the same way, just let her know.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That is a mess for him, but not for you.    I am sure this isn't the first time a friend of either gender has been interested in you romantically or sexually and you have not been interested in return.  So for you this is the same, just be sure to stress that you respect who he is and what he's doing, but that you simply aren't and never have been interested in him romantically or sexually.    For him he has to figure out who he is (male, female, or in the middle) and what kinds of people he is sexually interested in.  Then of course he has to find the right person for him, which is hard enough for anyone.|`|qY3U4FACaa	Just be honest with him, and put him down nicely.

XmJZkFuMaa	Yup, because she was on bed-rest for 7 weeks before they were born and needed help.  Her two other homes are being liquidated in the bankruptcy filing (can we say housing crisis?)  She has never been on any sort of government help, not for any of her kids, and is described as a great mom.  Before this pregnancy, she has a bachelors degree, worked as a psychiatric consultant, and was working on her masters before leaving the program in 2008 (think maybe because of the pregnancy?)  Now... of course she isn't married... but her father has said that they have already bought a huge house that they will move to, once the babies can come home, a house that will be more difficult to the press to get to.  He has said he has no problem helping to support them, more than likely expecting her to finish her masters and be able to support them eventually in the long-term.    In other words?  Read more than one news-story.    Add:  Oh, and from my understanding?  The frozen embryos were from the previous implantations.  She didn't want them destroyed, so she opted to try and see if any would take in the hopes of one more baby.  She did not expect to be pregnant with 7, let alone the hidden 8th baby.      I don't agree with it.  But I think folks should get off their high horses and think the best, at least until the worst is proven.|`|tDmemV5yaa	I can't even begin to answer, I thought I had a thought about it, but couldn't come up with anything nice, exept the word litter.

JTu1cLkYaa	You will find those that say that works are unnecessary, only faith. Others say that say you need works not faith. They are actually two sides of the same coin, you need both.     Works are obeying the commandments. The 10 commandments, to the best of your ability, loving one another and doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. There are no other detailed instructions, just prayer and remember the initials WWJD for the rest.     Works are important.     Rev 20: 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.     Rev 22: 14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Hi Kim!  Always neat to meet baby Christians.  Try not to sweat things like this.  Faith is supposed to be childlike and have a very simple aspect to it, so try to keep it simple!    To me it comes down to this -  if you truly believe you will do good things.  Not to be saved but just because it's right and you care.    Don't worry about what or when or how.  If you're open for opportunities, God will bring them into your life.  I wish you the best!|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Works do not save, and works are not required for salvation.  In fact, if someone forces works for salvation, then that person has a false gospel of works that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9).    Works cannot be added to Jesus's perfect salvation, and works cannot be used or required to "prove" that you are saved.     Rather, salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|AA10034051	Some Things that are Essential to Salvation    God's grace (Ephesians 2:4-10; 1:7; Titus 2:11,12; Acts 15:11)    Jesus' death and resurrection (Ephesians 1:7; Romans 5:6-10; 1 Peter 1:18,19; Revelation 1:5; 1 Corinthians 15:17; 1 Peter 3:21)    The gospel (Romans 1:16; 1 Peter 1:23-25; Acts 11:14; James 1:18,21; 1 Corinthians 15:1,2; John 8:31,32)    Learning God's will (Acts 11:14; John 6:44,45; Romans 10:17; 1:16; 1 Corinthians 1:21)    Faith     Love (1 Corinthians 16:22; 13:1-3; Galatians 5:6; 1 John 4:7,8)    Hope (Romans 8:24)    Repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 17:30; Luke 13:3,5; 2 Peter 3:9)    Obedience (Hebrews 5:9; Romans 6:17,18; 1 Peter 1:22; Acts 10:34,35; 2 Thessalonians 1:8,9; Galatians 5:6; James 2:14-26)    Confession of Christ (Romans 10:9,10; Matthew 10:32)    Baptism (Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Peter 3:21; Romans 6:3-7; Galatians 3:26,27; Colossians 2:12,13)    Faithfulness (Matthew 10:22; Revelation 2:10; 1 Corinthians 15:58; Matthew 28:20; Titus 2:11,12; 1 John 2:1-6)    Church membership (Acts 2:47; 20:28; Ephesians 5:23,25)|`|TzY9vkinaa	It's keeping the commandments and following Christ's example.|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	are works are our life in relationship with the word of God so Gos can see if we mean what we say about our faith. Please read this about Abraham  Gen 22:1  And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.   Gen 22:2  And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.   Gen 22:3  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ***, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.   Gen 22:4  Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.   Gen 22:5  And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ***; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.   Gen 22:6  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.   Gen 22:7  And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?   Gen 22:8  And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.   Gen 22:9  And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.   Gen 22:10  And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.   Gen 22:11  And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.   Gen 22:12  And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.   Gen 22:13  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.     In verse 12 for now I know that thou fearest God. How did God know that Abraham frared Him (had reverance) by the workes he did in offering his only son.    Jas 2:14  What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?   Jas 2:15  If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,   Jas 2:16  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?   Jas 2:17  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.   Jas 2:18  Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.   Jas 2:19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.   Jas 2:20  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?   Jas 2:21  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?   Jas 2:22  Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?   Jas 2:23  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.   Jas 2:24  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	First - I want to be very clear that works do not save us. We work, because we are saved.    Eph 2:8-10  For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithand this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God (9)  not by works, so that no one can boast.  (10)  For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.    Joh 6:28-29  Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"  (29)  Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."    Second, I'll answer the question. Works are following the law and doing good deeds.  Rom 4:2  If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast aboutbut not before God.    All of Romans 4 talks about works. Like "working" our way to heaven.    Here are more references:  Mat 5:16  In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.    Act 9:36  In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.    1Ti 2:9-10  I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,  (10)  but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.    1Pe 2:12  Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.|`|e7I0PXBNaa	You are so smart to think of this. This question is one that has been debated and disagreed about for a long time. Many people have a wide range of opinions on the matter. I can only give you mine, based on my life and my experiences.   Some religions believe you will only be saved if you do so many "works" and charitable type activities. They say that God will love you and save you if you do this. But we also know that He loves us unconditionally, even if we do not love Him. He sent his son to die for our sins, which shows us His love and tells us we are saved if we accept Him into our lives. When you truly love God and want him in your life and follow His words,  then you will want to do "works". It shouldn't be a stressful thought, being loving and caring will come naturally. Good luck with you new faith, and don't worry having question is a good thing, none of us know all the answers. God Bless.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

I'm not sure if I'm right but I think he meant    "Boku mo suki desu"   "I (masculine) like you too(formal)"     either way, it's really formal to say to your boyfriend/girlfriend.   You use suffixes like "desu" when you are talking to a person who you respect or is older, first time meeting, etc  and "suki desu" is usually for asking people out... but isn't that weird the way you used it. :]    I think it's cool that you guys used Japanese :] |`|HJ9eOk37aa	Well since you said "Me like".    Which, of course, begs the question "You like what?"   Trigonometry?   Ham and cheese sandwiches?  Your boyfriend in a thong?    So obviously he tries to confirm this by saying "You like ME right?!!"|`|19V5gVbNaa	Er... well, it baisically means I like you.. though the ne at the end... makes it kinda like 'I like you, eh?' or something like that. And boku is like I, but it's mostly used by guys. Sorry if this doesn't really help... I'm not that good in Japanese...
bBjRL1BLaa	In rather non-poetic language:    When someone meets someone walking through the grain fields and when somebody kisses someone, must that someone cry?  As a girl has her boyfriend, none they say have I, yet all the boys smile at me as I walk through the grain fields.    When someone meets some one coming from the town, and someone kisses someone, must that someone frown?  (repeat from above)    Among the train (of boys) there is a swain (a suitor or special boy) I dearly love myself, but I do not care to tell his name.  (repeat again)

I'm sure of it.|`|vg3ih0foaa	Obviously you've had some rough times with your homosexuality. You know what a tough time it can be and I'm not surprised that by those kind of situations, people begin to reject who they are. No, just like everything else, being gay isn't "everything", but it can be an important defining moment in your life when you actually do come out. I would suggest letting your nephew know that being gay can be hard and tough in life as there are still people who consider it to be gross, wrong, whatever. Give him the support he needs when someone makes fun of who he is, give him a shoulder when that guy he likes breaks his heart. Show him that at least, you don't love him any less because he is gay. Work on your own issues when you can but please, don't abandon him and tell him he's wrong.|`|MT1498npaa	You're ridiculous. You're gay yourself, and you're not accepting the fact that your nephew is gay, and he trusted you enough to come out to you? You should give him your support.

"Aboriginal" does not refer to ONLY the Australian Aborigines.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal|`|sMw0P9F8aa	A race of indigenous people to Australia|`|MyV9qm99aa	Aborigines are Australia's indigenous people. Recent government statistics counted approximately 400,000 aboriginal people, or about 2% of Australia's total population.    Australian Aborigines migrated from somewhere in Asia at least 30,000 years ago. Though they comprise 500600 distinct groups, aboriginal people possess some unifying links. Among these are strong spiritual beliefs that tie them to the land; a tribal culture of storytelling and art; and, like other indigenous populations, a difficult colonial history.  "The Dreamtime"    Aboriginal spirituality entails a close relationship between humans and the land. Aborigines call the beginning of the world the "Dreaming," or "Dreamtime." In the "Dreamtime," aboriginal "Ancestors" rose from below the earth to form various parts of nature including animal species, bodies of water, and the sky.     [divider]    The name "aborigine" derives from the Latin, meaning "original inhabitants." There are approx. 400,000 aborigines living in Australia.    [divider]          Unlike other religions, however, aboriginal belief does not place the human species apart from or on a higher level than nature. Aborigines believe some of the Ancestors metamorphosed into nature (as in rock formations or rivers), where they remain spiritually alive.    Storytelling, Art, and the Didgeridoo    The oral tradition of storytelling informs aboriginals' vibrant cultural life. Songs illustrate the Dreamtime and other tales of the land, while dances and diagrams drawn in the sand accompany oral tales.  Books About Aborigines and Australia    The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith  Thomas Keneally    The Songlines  Bruce Chatwin    In a Sunburned Country  Bill Bryson    In the Northern Territory, aboriginal art includes sculpture, bark and rock paintings, and baskets and beadwork. Rock carvings and paintings can be found in such places as Arnhem Land, Ubirr, and Nourlangie. Many aborigines earn a living through selling native artworks.    Aboriginal music is often recognizable for its most famous instrument, the didgeridoo. A wind instrument typically made from bamboo, it extends about five feet and produces a low, vibrating hum. Aborigines use didgeridoos in formal ceremonies at such events as sunsets, circumcisions, and funerals.  Land Rights Movement    As a result of forced assimilation, by the late 1880s most aborigines had joined white rural and urban communities. Aboriginal people became economically marginalized and were exposed to new diseases. The consequence was massive depopulation and extinction for some aboriginal tribes.  RELATED LINKS  Encyclopedia: Australian aborigines    Olympics Overview    National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Educational Website    Aboriginalaustralia.com    Land and property rights fueled an important civil rights movement in the 1970s. Aborigines spoke out for equal rights, and specifically for land rights for property that had been forcibly taken by British settlers. The Aboriginal Land Rights Act, passed in 1976, became instrumental in territories with tribal associations. The 1990s witnessed further rights milestones, including government legislation that returned a great degree of autonomy, and increased wages and welfare benefits to aboriginal people.

Apostles faith is the true and perfect religion. But it has been destroyed by modern Christianity.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Christianity is the one true religion. That may sound awfully dogmatic and narrow-minded, but the simple truth is that Christianity is  the only true religion. Jesus said that He alone was the way to the Father (John 14:6), that He alone revealed the Father (Matt. 11:27; Luke 10:22). Christians do not go around saying Christianity is the only way because they are arrogant, narrow-minded, stupid, and judgmental. They do so because they believe what Jesus said. They believe in Jesus, who claimed to be God (John 8:58; Exodus 3:14), who forgave sins (Mark 2:5; Luke 5:20; 7:48), and who rose from the dead (Luke 24:24-29; John 2:19f). Jesus said that He  was the only way. Jesus is unique. He was either telling the truth, He was crazy, or He was a liar. But since everyone agrees that Jesus was a good man, how then could He be both good and crazy, or good and a liar? He had to be telling the truth. He is the only way.        Christianity is not just a religion; it is a relationship with God. It is a trusting in Jesus and what He did on the cross (1 Cor. 15:1-4), not on what you can do for yourself (Ephesians 2:8-9).       Buddha didn't rise from the dead, nor did Confucius or Zoroaster. Muhammad didn't fulfill detailed prophecy. Alexander the Great didn't raise the dead or heal the sick. And though there is far less reliable information written about them, they are believed in.        The scripture is right when it says in 1 Pet. 2:7-8, "This precious value, then, is for you who believe. But for those who disbelieve, 'The stone which the builders rejected, this became the very corner stone,' and, 'A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense'; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed." (NASB).    The Mathematical Odds of Jesus Fulfilling Prophecy          "The following probabilities are taken from Peter Stoner in Science Speaks (Moody Press, 1963) to show that coincidence is ruled out by the science of probability. Stoner says that by using the modern science of probability in reference to eight prophecies, we find that the chance that any man might have lived down to the present time and fulfilled all eight prophecies is 1 in 1017." That would be 1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000. In order to help us comprehend this staggering probability, Stoner illustrates it by supposing that "we take 1017 silver dollars and lay them on the face of Texas. They will cover all of the state two feet deep. Now mark one of these silver dollars and stir the whole mass thoroughly, all over the state. Blindfold a man and tell him that he can travel as far as he wishes, but he must pick up one silver dollar and say that this is the right one. What chance would he have of getting the right one? Just the same chance that the prophets would have had of writing these eight prophecies and having them all come true in any one man."        Stoner considers 48 prophecies and says, "we find the chance that any one man fulfilled all 48 prophecies to be 1 in 10157, or 1 in 10,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,... 000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,... 000,000,000."          (This information was taken from the book Evidence that Demands a Verdict, by Josh McDowell.)          The estimated number of electrons in the universe is around 1079. It should be quite evident that Jesus did not fulfill the prophecies by accident. He was who He said He was: the only way (John 14:6).|`|vOuSZnKxaa	Buddhism|`|Cs6aBBrJaa	Pray to your Creator and ask him repeatedly, and in sincerity for the true religion. Then keep an open mind (but not so open that your brains fall out). :)   He will show you the way, you just have to be humble enough to listen. Keep searching!|`|0tHYQHY7aa	I agree with Alissa, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If you look in the Bible and study it extensively there are many truths that only the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints follow. We have a true and living Prophet. In Amos 3:7 it says, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." If God loves us so much, why would he not give us a prophet in our days to reveal His truths through them. How are we in these days any different then those in the times of the Old Testament? That is one example but there are others. Of course, I believe that if a religion teaches its followers to be good people than it is a good thing. Only God will be the one to judge in the end to decide where a person will end up. Thank goodness I don't have to do His job.    **Edit - Go ahead, some of you, and knock other religions but if you want truth, why don't you study each religion and go to their specific site to learn what they really believe. You say things that you have heard to discredit religions but where did you learn the things that you have heard. If I want to really know about a religion I would ask a faithful member of that religion and not my own pastor.

ONE CHURCH - Is there to be only one Church or many? According to Scripture, Christ wanted us to be one (John 17:22-23). We are all as a Church to be of one mind and to think the same (Philippians 2:2; Romans 15:5). There is only to be one "faith" (Ephesians 4:3-6), not many. For the Church is Christ's Body and Christ only had one Body, not many. Also, since the Church is Christ's Bride (Ephesians 5:29), can Christ be married to more than one wife (essentially a spiritual form of the the sin of polygamy)? No, Christ can only have one wife (i.e., one Church, not many).      Every Christian believes that Jesus Christ established and sustains a community of faith, hope and love for all believers. This community we call His Church. The Church that Christ founded is the Catholic Church in 33AD which has a formal earthly structure established by Christ and which continues under His authority and protection.     Jesus did three things that established the framework of His Church. First, He chose humans to carry out His work. He appointed Peter to be the visible head of the Church. Jesus said to Peter, "You are Rock and on this rock I will build my Church." (Matthew 16: 18) Jesus said "build," as in to create a structure. Jesus built His structure on specifically chosen human beings Peter and the apostles.     Second, Jesus gave Peter and the apostles the power and authority to carry out His work. "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven."(Matthew 16:19; 18:18) "Receive the Holy Spirit, whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven, whose sins you retain, they are retained."(John 20:23)     Third, Jesus gave Peter and the apostles commands as to what that work should be. At the last supper, He commanded, "Do this in memory of Me." (Luke 22:19) He commanded them to "Make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19), and to "Go into the whole world and proclaim the Gospel to every creature." (Mark 16:15)         The Catholic Church is the only church that can claim to have been founded by Christ personally. Every other church traces its lineage back to a mere human person such as Martin Luther or John Wesley. The Catholic Church can trace its lineage back to Jesus Christ who appointed St. Peter as the first pope. This line of popes has continued unbroken for almost 2,000 years.     God rules, instructs and sanctifies His people through His Church. Under her teaching office, the Catholic Church preserves the Word of God. She is the custodian, keeper, dispenser and interpreter of teachings of Christ. And she accomplishes this under the protection of the Holy Spirit.      FOUR MARKS OF THE TRUE CHURCH         If we wish to locate the Church founded by Jesus, we need to locate the one that has the four chief marks or qualities of his Church. The Church we seek must be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.     The Church Is One (Rom. 12:5, 1 Cor. 10:17, 12:13, CCC 813822)   Jesus established only one Church, not a collection of differing churches (Lutheran, Baptist, Anglican, and so on). The Bible says the Church is the bride of Christ (Eph. 5:2332). Jesus can have but one spouse, and his spouse is the Catholic Church.    His Church also teaches just one set of doctrines, which must be the same as those taught by the apostles (Jude 3). This is the unity of belief to which Scripture calls us (Phil. 1:27, 2:2).     Although some Catholics dissent from officially-taught doctrines, the Churchs official teachersthe pope and the bishops united with himhave never changed any doctrine. Over the centuries, as doctrines are examined more fully, the Church comes to understand them more deeply (John 16:1213), but it never understands them to mean the opposite of what they once meant.     The Church Is Holy (Eph. 5:2527, Rev. 19:78, CCC 823829)   By his grace Jesus makes the Church holy, just as he is holy. This doesnt mean that each member is always holy. Jesus said there would be both good and bad members in the Church (John 6:70), and not all the members would go to heaven (Matt. 7:2123).     But the Church itself is holy because it is the source of holiness and is the guardian of the special means of grace Jesus established, the sacraments (cf. Eph. 5:26).    The Church Is Catholic (Matt. 28:1920, Rev. 5:910, CCC 830856)   Jesus Church is called catholic ("universal" in Greek) because it is his gift to all people. He told his apostles to go throughout the world and make disciples of "all nations" (Matt. 28:1920).     For 2,000 years the Catholic Church has carried out this mission, preaching the good news that Christ died for all men and that he wants all of us to be members of his universal family (Gal. 3:28).      Over 38,000 Sects "Scattered" Outside The One Church Founded By Christ          There Was Only ONE Church Founded By Christ    AND HIS CHURCH STILL LIVES TODAY!!    Catholic Christian|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Its not the heart it is the mind. We experience life though our conscious mind this is where God has placed a spirit part of himself for us to know that he is, it is then up to us to seek out this God in our lives.  Our survival is based on our choosing this God over ourselves which not many are willing to do. The next life is based on all having placed God before them selves this is the mark that gives us their trust that we will not do anything that is so un God like it could not be tolerated.

The way to the Almighty is One Way Only, through His Son, Yeshua the Messiah.    We do not need false Prophets, Popes, or Laws that the Messiah fulfilled at His death.

Why is that? Well, it's because the fossil record is characterized by abrupt appearance and stasis. Animals appear fully formed and the oldest fossils are still recognizable as belonging to the same types of animals alive today if they haven't gone extinct.    Any so called "transitional" fossils appear to be separate species that just went extinct. There is no "line of transitional fossils" where you can clearly see that a reptile started to become a bird and observe the gradual changes that evolution theorizes must have happened along the way. Claims that fossils are transitional is based upon wishful thinking and not clear evidence.    Add all that to the fact that the fossil record or abrupt appearance followed by stasis supports what the Bible teaches and then consider who should you trust. Scientists who make lots of mistakes and were not there to make any direct observations and are only trying to fit evidence into a theory to make it work, or God who was there and who doesn't make mistakes who says that He created the life on this planet so that it would reproduce after it's own kind.|`|L0R92wWeaa	Evolution is true, up to a point- in my opnion. Different factors- cause things to evolve. For example, we are healthier humans, and are taller than people of the renassiance era. This is because we have better food, and more health care. Now the bigger part of Evolution. Much of evolution is based on chance..especially the big bang. How could a world so complex evolve out of "chance", 'an explosion of matter". Think of how a cell is made up, how a baby is formed, how our world orbits- it's just to complex. We are so much more intellectual then animals, look at how your made. You are so complex- your thoughts, the way your body functions, the way your organs are set into place, how millions of cells work together to keep you alive. How would animals just adapt- to create something so perfect. If your really looking for scientific evidence I recommend the book called "The evolution cruncher". It's basically a book full of scientific facts, as to why evolution is impossible. Hope this helped.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	I consider evolution to be true, because I feel there is sufficient evidence for it.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	keyshia....yes you did, you were born of a living breathing female human. She was an animal.|`|MtweOtuLaa	Evolution is THEORY, not fact. There is just as much proof for creationism as their is evolution. If evolution was true, then why are there still monkey's that exist today? Why haven't we evolved to overcome certain disease. It doesn't add up no matter how you look at it.    I find it funny that we're mocked for "blindly" following our Lord, yet the majority of the people mocking us blindly follow science.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	I'm a Christian and I don't consider evolution to be false.  I consider it to be somewhat incomplete and it fails to explain a lot of things. Mainly because I have studied it and understand there's nothing about it that conflicts with my faith.  Besides, it's science which means it's fallible and always changing based on new information, and I grow interested as each year brings new scientific discoveries that both refute and support the theory.    Bottom line, it's no big deal and merely an item of intellectual curiosity at best.    God bless you.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	anything that goes against their literal interpretation of a translated text that belongs to the jews is "anti-god" to them|`|Kbry7CnOaa	One word - Bible    Because of course a 2000 year old book written by a bronze age middle-eastern tribe is meant to be taken literally...    Personally I not only believe it but have a degree in it.|`|QL0FOQMmaa	First of all, it is a "THEORY OF" evolution. Nothing more. It was one man's hypothesis that has been passed off as though it has scientific support, when in actuality it does not and never has. The more Scientists try to prove evolution, the more they find that creation is the only real true possibility. Unfortunately, many "godless" scientists won't admit it, but it still doesn't change the fact that evolution always was nothing more than a "theory". And yes, it is "anti-God". It was invented by a man desperate in his unbelief to find an alternative explanation for the meaning of life.|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	No. Evolution is man's corrupt way of trying to prove God doesn't exist. If the evidence leads toward God they dismiss it. The only good thing about scientists' research is that the evidence uncovered shows everything is so complex nothing else could have created everything except God.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Anyone who insists on a word-for-word literal interpretation of the Bible isn't going to believe evolution is true because they just don't line up. (I don't know about other religious texts, sorry.) You aren't going to be able to argue with such staunch fundamentalists. I think most other people who believe evolution is anti-god just don't properly understand it. There's nothing to indicate that God as a creator and evolution can't happily coexist - I took a class in evolutionary biology last semester, and to be honest, I'm much more impressed by a creator that can set all those tiny, perfectly-times collisions into motion than by someone who just thinks and poofs up worlds. There has been a lot of anti-evolution stuff going around encouraging a misunderstanding of it, for example, saying that humans came from monkeys. Evolution doesn't indicate that we came from monkeys, but that we had a common ancestor somewhere down the line. There's also a massive misunderstanding of the way the "theory" concept works. A scientific theory isn't just a guess someone made - it's believed to be as true as it is possible for something to be, scientifically. (Remember, in science, nothing can ever be totally proved, only disproved.) It isn't a hypothesis, it's been tested again and again as much as is possible.    So, the moral of the story is, it's a lack of adequate education on what evolution is and how it works.|`|QQbBM77Jaa	I think evolution is false because I wonder where are all the monkey people? Why are male and females needed to created a child why don't they just slime their way out of the ocean? Why are we not still evolving?   In my bio class my teacher tried to sell evolution to us I just can't get past the fact that a bird got scared started running and that's how it learned how to fly(hm and people think Christians are crazy).    Also I don't believe in evolution because I believe that God created the universe and every thing in it.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	During the Reformation, all the new groups (Luther, Reformed, Baptist) professed that there is a conflict between faith and reason.  This was one of the Catholic doctrines they protested.    Later, for some reason, some Protestants held that the six day creation story had to be literal.  They were already beginning to battle a rise in agnosticism  in the west and the theories of Darwin was a huge flash point.        As for me, I neither confirm nor deny evolution.  I have not seen enough evidence on either side to pledge my belief.  I find a number of problems with the concept that the most incredible life forms and attributes on the planet are all here by chance through natural selection.  The scientific understanding of evolution is still developing.  I look forward to watching the developments in the next 300 years.    I in no way think the theory is anyway anti-God.  I do not affirm evolution, but if it is true, it certainly answers how God made the earth and humans, and such conclusion does not infringe on my current religious beliefs.    Finally, check out the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy_Lett...  where +10000 Christian leaders have agreed with evolution.  The anti-evolution crowd of Christians is actually very small.|`|RrnMRJ2Laa	I didn't come from no animal.|`|H0Immui8aa	The completely obvious evidence doesn't make sense when you mix it with religion. So they choose not to understand it.|`|3RYqo9dJaa	As a theist I consider evolution to be true, both micro and macro evolution.|`|HSaVBaiaaa	Because faith is really about ignoring the truth than believing in the truth.|`|AA10880624	It's not anti God. The biggest problems we have with the creation are that some Christians take it literally and Atheists assume that we know scientifically all there is to know about it - when we don't.     The scriptures tell us that God created the worlds, plural, meaning the universe. We also know that God created ALL things and made them for the benefit and use of man. Not so man can take advantage of them, but to have the responsibility over them.     We don't know the purpose of everything nor how it was all created or organized, but I also like to keep in mind that these scriptures were written centuries ago, without the scientific knowledge we have today and they don't rule out or conflict with science.

yvho9ZmXaa	try this..........................25 min  Level  Intermediate  Yield  40 servings  CloseTimes:Prep1 hr 30 min Inactive Prep2 min Cook25 min Total:1 hr 57 min Recipe Tools:  Ingredients  4 egg whites   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature   1 cup sugar   1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract   1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract   2 cups sifted cake flour   1 tablespoon baking powder   2/3 cup milk, at room temperature   For the Fondant:  2/3 cup corn syrup   2/3 cup hot water   7 cups powdered sugar   6 drops lemon extract   Food coloring   For decoration:  2 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted   Silver dragee   Directions  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.     In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment whip the egg whites until stiff but not dry. In a mixer fitted with a whip attachment cream the butter until smooth. With the mixer running, slowly add the sugar and mix. Add the vanilla and almond extract and mix well.     Sift the flour 3 times with the baking powder (this is to lighten the cakes). Add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix. Add 1/2 of the milk to the butter mixture and mix. Add another 1/3 of the flour mixture and mix. Add the remaining milk and mix. Add the remaining flour and mix until smooth. Fold in the egg whites.     Pour the batter into a parchment lined jellyroll pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake until firm to the touch 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan then chill.     To make the fondant: Whisk the corn syrup into the hot water until dissolved, then whisk in the powdered sugar until smooth. Stir in lemon extract. Divide into smaller bowls and color with food coloring, adding color until you achieve desired shade.     To make the petit fours, cut the cold cake into small squares, rectangles, and circles using small cookie cutters. Place the cakes on a wire rack over a pan to catch the drippings, inverting them in order to have the golden layer on the bottom. If the fondant has become stiff, just whisk until smooth again. If the fondant is has not become to stiff, proceed to the next step. Either dip the cakes into the fondant and place on the rack to drain or ladle the fondant over the cakes, making sure all sides are coated. Once they are set, they should be coated again. Let dry, then with melted chocolate or colored fondant, pipe thin decorative lines or use silver dragees.     Notes about the recipe: There are many options for these darling little cakes. You can split the cake in half horizontally and spread it with jam, you can spread jam on the top and stick down a thin layer of rolled marzipan or do the simplest plain version like I did here. You can also tint the fondant different pastel colors.   .................|`|56aKh5K8aa	well idk about the cake. but be careful with the new baking dish. we bought some and for some reason the brownies didnt bake right.

Zadysvg5aa	Up until the 1960 the Irish language was written in a gaelic script, which consisted of only 18 letters. The letters J  K  V  W  X  Y  Z  were not used.  The point above the c, which you refer to was known as a BUALITE or sometimes a SHEIBHU, and was replaced by a H following the c, in the revised script. The fada was still retained and is used as an accent on the vowels, like ?????  I sat my leaving cert in 1962 and  that was the last year in which the old script was acceptable.

First, is to just type as normal using English, but typing in the Irish Language,(if that makes sense,) & you don't bother about the marks above the letters. People who can read Irish will know what you are saying anyway.    The Second Way,, Is to get yourself an Irish typewriter or keyboard/wordprocessor with all those little dots & things on it above the letters.  It really just depends on how much trouble & expense you want to go to.!  A Third Way,,, Is to get an Irish Language Program put onto your computer. That way, everything you type will come out in Irish, unless you deliberately change it back to English or another language!  .... Hope this helps you.|`|7a3UzWenaa	The only thing you need to change when writing in Irish is inserting a fda over certain vowels. You type a fda by hitting Alt Gr and the vowel. The point above the c as mentioned before is a sheimhi and was used in the absence of a "h". You type the letter with the dot above it and add a "h" afterwards.

lmdhY6nraa	It's not a real website / group / organization thing. But a lot of people don't / won't know that. What it actually is is a viral marketing campaign for Roland Emmerich's upcoming film '2012'.    Here's the link to the IMDb site: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/  Here's the trailer for it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VXa82Auw...      Want proof?    At the very bottom, click on any of those small links: "Privacy Policy", "Terms of Service", or "California Privacy Rights". There will be a link that takes you to a page run by Sony Pictures saying that the site belongs to them. One more thing, watch the trailer for the movie and notice how the text displayed in the trailer pretty much matches up perfectly with that on the introduction to the website.|`|HS7qRRiWaa	Just another example of the hundreds of other end time predictions. The Maya example only means that the world will change (for the Maya). and Nostradamus' predictions are too vague to be taken seriously.|`|zcy6hhMzaa	The IHC Lottery is part of a Sony Corporation viral marketing campaign. The reason for this type of marketing is that it takes advantage of the already existing genuine interest in the 2012 subject related to the Maya Calendar.    Also connected to this are some other viral marketing activities on Twitter, Myspace, YouTube and via other Sony Corp owned websites.    The reason they are saying the world will end in 2012 is simply because that is the storyline of their film!|`|JO8YzDNVaa	2001 was a better movie.|`|0uMLrKAbaa	itz really scary!  i dont wana die i m only 16!|`|qDYzdz5daa	The whole 2012 thing is idiotic, and everyone who wastes more than a minute's thought on it should be rounded up and forcibly sterilized for the good of the species.    It's garbage.    Everything you have heard about 2012 is full of half-truths and outright lies, with the following exceptions.    1. There will be an American presidential election in 2012.  2. The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012."     (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)    December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.    All the other predictions, "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) "galactic alignments" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it, "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.|`|O8qyhAegaa	On the verge of the second great depression; Iranian nukes, Iran(Hezbolah/Hamas)&Israeli conflict; India&Pakistani conflict; Russia&Georgia conflict; REX 84, King Alfred Plan, FEMA coffins, FEMA camps, secret prisons, Patriot Act, tapping public phones, reading public e-mails, RFID Verichips, XMARK, Mondex, SOMARK tattoos, Operation Urban Warrior, Operation Sudden Impact, MJTF, Project Bluebeam & pretend "aliens", LHC, Operation Mockingbird, Agenda 21, NESARA, entomopters, DARPA monstrosities, Iron Mountain, Denver International Airport Murals, Georgia Guidestones, Bohemian Grove, Real ID, HR 1022, vile Bush executive orders(yes they carry over!) regarding martial law and putting people into work groups, warrantless searches, end of Habeas Corpus, and the rise of a new character called 'Homegrown Terrorists' as specified in Senate Bill S.1959 which will be anyone against the North American Union and the New World Order especially Christians and Jews!

QIQNzE11aa	If you want to become so wealthy you can retire for your life, it most likely will never happen.     Education is the key. Go to college and get a degree. There are community colleges and you take out student loans to get whatever degree you are interested in. You may have to work while going to school as well. I know many who work full time and go to school part time to make a better life for themselves.     You have to work on your understanding of the language wherever you decide to live and work. You need to sound and write in an educated manner.     Then you work hard, you work so hard that people will allow you to move up. Whenever you need a different type of degree to move up, you work on that degree while you are still working. You save every penny you make and do not actually need. Most people who end up with rich companies that started from all have this in common. They will tell you how they lived off of roman noodles and soup for years. How they never went anywhere and never spent a thing. How they found furniture on the side of the road for free to get by with. And even when they made profits, it all went back into the company in the beginning. Until the profits were high enough to start making more money.     Wealthy people are one thing... stingy. They don't like to spend their money very much. They always ask for free things, always are trying to save money any way they can. Rich people who spend aren't normally rich 20 years down the road.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	First of all, you have to get educated.

This practice is widespread among those who have gray hairs, which they cover with black dye; this leads to many evils, such as deciet, and cheating people by boasting of something which is not true. It is true that the Prophet(SAW) used to dye his gray hairs with henna, which gave a yellowish, reddish or brownish hue.  When Abu Qahafha, whose hair and beard were as white as thughamah (a plant with intensely-white leaves and flowers) was brought to the Prophet(SAW) on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, the Prophet(SAW) said:   "Change this with something, but avoid black".[Muslim, 3/1663].   The corect view is that women are like men in this regard, they are not permitted to dye black any hair that is not black.|`|x6PNkSxbaa	yeah if its alcohol free ( u can find it hot topic)

And Jesus did what he was asked WHY? because he could not refuse his Mother.|`|DiIAaFgzaa	Nowhere in scripture does it say that the wedding party went to Mary and asked her to ask Jesus to make wine for them.  Mary saw a need and asked Jesus to do something about it.  That's not so unusual in itself.  The amazing thing about the story is that this is the Jesus' first recorded miracle.  We should not try to read into this scripture more than is there.|`|AA10166652	Excerpt from the article listed as "Source":    Only God can create something from what does not exist, in this case wine from water.

John goes on to tell us that this first miracle had two outcomesthe glory of Christ was manifest and the disciples believed on Him (John 2:11). The divine, glorified nature of Christ was hidden when He assumed human form, but in instances such as this miracle, His true nature burst forth and was made manifest to all who had eyes to see (Matthew 13:16).      ?|`|A01w1dHqaa	Who are his mother and brother?

Where was the supposed rebuke? does CJ realy believe that Jesus snarled at His own Mother in anger? `What is this to do with me Woman as my hour has not yet come`seems to me that Jesus was stating the obvious and this was as far from a rebuke as you can get.  But then with such a blatant fear of the Mother of God it is no wonder that CJ and those of his mindset would resort to the tactics of the pagan.  God bless.|`|G6ein0naaa	There are two types of intercession.    Jesus is the MEDIATOR OF SALVATION, and the only way to the Father.     We also have a lesser type of intercession. This intercession is praying for others, which is entirely different than "Jesus being the only mediator".  If we can pray for each other, then why can't we ask Mary to pray for us? I don't see anything wrong with it as long as you don't go to Mary expecting salvation and a ticket into Heaven.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	Can you provide Bible version, Book, chapter and verse?|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Midge,  The wedding was before Jesus' Time.

Thanks,  Eds  ------  The reference that you are speaking of comes from John 2:1-11 (NIV) and says that Jesus told HIS' Mother that "my time has not yet come".  ------      .|`|4eb65c12497840f599500825222da691aa	well, if you are going to actually use the bible to try and make praying to mary something that is not just acceptable, but required?    Then if you read the apostles that couldnt cast out the demons themselves from one particular man, they had to go to Jesus to do this.    They did ask afterward, why, they couldnt cast out the demon.    Jesus told them that this demon was different and required fasting and prayer to expell.    No one went to mary here, nor did they in a multitude of other situations. In fact, the people did not go to mary and ask her for more wine either.  This is very important.  Mary saw a need and tryed to fill the need in a way that she knew could be done.  The people did not know that Jesus could fulfill this need, anymore than they thought mary may be able to get him to do it.    When we see a need and we do what we can or we pray for that need, we are not being asked to interceed for a person.  We are seeing the need and doing what we already know how to do.    If I were already dead and in heaven with God, I am not able to look to earth and see need and ask for its fulfilling.  And if somehow I could hear and see all needs and prayers, that would make me all knowing just like God and that would be sinful at its very least.

Thankfully there are other prophecies that points to better world conditions that will take place soon Psalms 37:11, 29.      the scripture at 2 Tim 3:1-5, highlight that in the time period that we live in today would be critical times and hard to deal with. the worlds condtion according to the bible will|`|EAuMJrs4aa	its snowing too much|`|BC2CNH3jaa	As a Christian, I'm far more hopeful, even excited, with Obama at the helm.

I saw an angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth, and I said to him, 'Uncover (her),' and behold, it was you. I said (to myself), 'If this is from Allah, then it must happen.' Then you were shown to me, the angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth, and I said (to him), 'Uncover (her), and behold, it was you. I said (to myself), 'If this is from Allah, then it must happen.'"

However, some non-Muslims think he married her when she was still a child, and this is totally incorrect.  Girls at hot-weathered countries grow up faster than girls in colder weather, I myself have an aunt who became an adult lady at the age of 9 years old.  Hence, prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) married Lady Aisha (may God bless her soul) - who was the daughter of his best friend, neighbor and first believer Abu Bakr - at the age of 6 years old (after a revelation from God to do so), but she stayed at her parents place and they didn't start any marital relations before she was a fully grown up adult lady (and this happened to be at the age of 9 years old for her) and moved in with him, and this sort of postponed marriage to young ladies was common at the time.  Aisha (may Allah bless her soul) was the only virgin prophet Muhammad ever married (all the others were widows or divorcees) and she did live long enough after he passed away (peace be upon him) and transfered a lot of knowledge to both men and women about many aspects including directions for handling intimate details of daily life.

Therefore, Jew,  Though justice be thy plea, consider this,  That, in the course of justice, none of us  Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;  And that same prayer doth teach us all to render  The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much  To mitigate the justice of thy plea;  Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice  Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.    If you go through the Old Testament you see the people and writers projected their own human emotions upon God. They believed in an eye for an eye. period.The Psalms best reflected God's true nature there.He is only loving, Jesus made that clear.

MVT34FZsaa	It is equivalent to " Jacob I chose, but Esau I rejected.    In verses 6-13 Paul  is clearly dealing with personal and not national election - he is not portraying the nation Israel ( Jacob ) over the nation Edom ( Esau ) - though Mal 1:1-2 does speak  of the nations. Paul's intention is evident in the light of the problem he is addressing: How can God's promise stand when so many who comprise  Israel ( in the OT collective sense ) are unbelieving and therefore cut off?    Is God unjust? Unjust to elect on the basis of his sovereign freedom, as with Jacob and Esau.    Psalm 5:5 This morning prayer, perhaps offered at the time of the morning sacrifice, is psalmist's cry for help when his enemies spread malicious lies to destroy him    Psalm 11:5 Reply to the fearful: God is still securely in His throne. And this righteous Lord ( see v.7 ) discerns the righteous ( v. 5 )  to give them a place in His presence ( v. 7 ), while His judgment will " rain" ( v. 6 ) on the wicked.    He loves us equally. His proises and offer is the same for all of us. He will do what He promises. He would love to have all of us, but He will let us go if we do not follow Him|`|SsSIbFhcaa	Because of Esau's attitude regarding his birth right.    Esau was the first born. By law he would inherit everything that Isaac had including the promise of God through Abraham. God had given a great promise to Abraham and Isaac and it would be passed to the one who inherited, which by law was to the first born.    Esau had no regard for his inheritance and nothing but contempt for the promises of God. They meant so little to him that he sold it all to Jacob for a bowl of soup. It was not so much Esau that God hated but his attitude and contempt for the things of God.    In the end it all comes down to our attitude about God and how we are going to relate to him. If we love and seek after him then he accepts us and loves us. If we hate and despise him then we are his enemy and he will treat us as such.    Which are you?|`|r8rykCkGaa	It has something to do with the translation that wasn't easy to translate into correct English I believe.  Not that he actually hated Esau, he just chose Jacob instead for a special purpose to be the father of the tribes of Israel.    He will reject all workers of iniquity if they continue in their sin and the wicked who love violence.  He gives them a chance to repent first.|`|UTH4q0l2aa	He secretely fancied Esau.|`|dcWFZ0y1aa	God does love everyone. Men who wrote the Bible sometimes put words into God's mouth that are not true; this is because humans are limited in their understanding of how truly incredible and profound God is. I do not blame these men. They were attempting to understand God and to present Him to their people. However, God is greater than the limited human emotions of hate, jealousy, or rage. Yes, some of the Bible is divinely inspired. But not all is. Passages that ascribe negative human reactions to God rather than glorious attributes to God are those that are clearly of men, not our Creator.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	This is why for some people literal translations do not serve the purpose.That Hebrew idiom means I preferred Jacob over Esau.Same with Jesus statement about "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother..."|`|k03dYskYaa	God does not love everyone. There is proper hatred, and there are things and people that God hates. But this cannot be attributed to any arbitrariness on Gods part. Esau proved himself unworthy of Jehovahs love by despising his birthright and selling it and hence also the divine promises and blessings attached thereto. Moreover, he purposed to kill his brother Jacob. (Ge 25:32-34; 27:41-43; Heb 12:14-16) God also hates lofty eyes, a false tongue, hands that are shedding innocent blood, a heart fabricating hurtful schemes, feet that are in a hurry to run to badness, a false witness, anyone sending forth contentions among brothers, in fact, everyone and everything standing in complete opposition to Jehovah and his righteous laws.Pr 6:16-19; De 16:22; Isa 61:8; Zec 8:17; Mal 2:16.|`|AA11992885	i already answered this........or maybe you are a different person asking the exact same question    it is a BELIEF that God loves everyone, a BELIEF not supported by doctrine    the God of Abraham does NOT love everyone...........the very concept of a deity loving everyone is NOT the God of Abraham    thus another reason why Jews don't accept christianity.....a god who loves everyone is NOT the God of Abraham
TVJsOEKNaa	The Tanach is a compilation of the Torah (First five books), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvi'im (Writings).    The OT is supposed to be the complete combination of the three sections; however, the translations, and wording in some cases are quite different. The order of how the books are compiled/listed is also different.    It is important to note that in Judaism, there is nothing old about our books because there isn't a precursor to something new. They are fine as they are.    Here are some classic translation differences:    Psalm 22:17: "Hikifuni ca'ari yaday veraglay"  Translation: "They bound me like a lion my hands and my feet"  Christian translation: "They pierced my hands and feet"    Nowhere in the Tanach do the words ca'ari or hikifuny mean anything resembling the word pierce.    Isaiah 7:14: "Hinei ha'almah harah veyoledet ben"  Translation: "Behold the young woman is pregnant & shall give birth to a son."  Christian translation: "Behold a virgin shall give birth."    In Hebrew, 'ha' means 'the' and 'almah' refers to young woman. Betulah is Hebrew for virgin and is used in the Torah.    The term mashiach means anointed one, not savior. It refers to the practice of kings being anointed with oil on the throne. Every King/High Priest was anointed with oil, each being referred to as an anointed one (mashiach).    In the OT, Isaiah texts have conveniently changed tenses from past to future.    Isaiah 53:5:    Translation: "..He was pained because of our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; the chastisement of our welfare was upon him, and with his wounds we were healed."    Christian Translation: "..He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed."    Isaiah 16:4:  Translation: "Become a hiding place for them."  Christian Translation: "be thou a covert to them..."    Isaiah 23:1:  Translation: "he appeared to them."  Christian Translation: "it is revealed to them."    Isaiah 30:5:  Translation: "a people that will not be of benefit to them"  Christian Translation: "a people that could not profit them"    Isaiah 53:8:  Translation: "because of the transgression of my people, a plague came upon them."  Christian Translation: "for the transgression of my people was he stricken."    There is a few. :)|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Because us Jews read it in Hebrew, un-messed with.  The Christians are left with many self-serving translations.  Not self-serving to you, to your predecessors, the priest and monks who translated it.    The Torah is the first five books.  We include most of the prophets works as well in the Tanakh as well as Psalms, Proverbs, etc.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	i have seen minor differences in the translations used by jews and by christians ... i've not exhaustively compared all of the tanahk to the old testament, but the differences i've seen aren't all that significant... unless one is nitpicking for a prophecy fulfilled in the NT, and then the christian translations keep with their tradition, despite it having been shown to be a poor translation.    the biggest consistency issues are the NT quoting the greek translation of the tanakh, which was rather poor, and then being bundled with a more modern (even in the KJV) translation of the tanakh from hebrew sources... some of them are quite laughable - proof the NT was written by greek speakers not familure with the hebrew scriptures.|`|AA11992885	the TORAH is the law that God gave to Moses  the Old Testament as you call it, comprises all of what Judahism considers holy writ    the LAW  the Prophets  and the Writings    other wise known as the Tanakh  Torah  a  Nevi'im  a  Kethuvim    TaNaKh  o..e...e  r...v...t  a..i....h  h..'....u  ....i....v  ...m...i  ........m|`|QpUhZHj7aa	They are 2 different documents, Who told you they're the same?

Yes, there are dramatic differences.  What people are downplaying is the fact that one word can change the entire verse:  present to future tense of a word makes one a reference to a current event and the other a prophetic one.    the words "a virgin shall conceive" being changed FROM the original "a young woman shall conceive"     Pierced from Stabbed    Claiming one verse in Isaiah 53 is prophetic while ignoring the previous chapter and all of chapter 53 is referring to Israel and her people, not a messiah.    etc. I will ask my Jewish contacts to give details.    http://www.hareidi.org/bible/    there's a better translation but I don't have the bookmark on this computer. Hang on|`|WF085j2Daa	No nothing like that, the early christians found that the Jews had a lot of mistakes in their version so they fixed them up|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Because the Tanakh condemns Yshua bar-Ysef (aka by Christians as 'Jesus') as a fraud since he failed every single one of the Messianic Prophecies.    If the Christians hadn't mangled the Tanakh, they wouldn't have a religion at all.    (By the way, to be completely technical -- the Torah doesn't contain any Messianic prophecies at all.  All such references are in the writings of the Prophets, not the Torah, which is just the first five Books of the Tanakh).    ----------    To the below commentator:    Correct.  The Messiah will be a prophet, and the referenced verse will apply.    However, it is not UNIQUE to HaMosiach, and therefore is not considered messianic in and of itself.  It applies to ALL prophets.  Notice that the passage of which it is a part proscribes how the Jewish Nation is to identify and distinguish prophets of G-D and false prophets.|`|9MhdJ1YDaa	I would want examples of the "dramatic differences" before going any further. Do you have any? Never believe what you are told about the Bible/Tanakh without a reference to it.    ***  The above commentator is an excellent example of making statements without proof. I beleive most rabbis agree, for example, that this is a messianic prophecy, from the Torah:  Dvarim 18:18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.     http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0518....    ****  Note to the above comment: Thanks for the reply, but you ought to get your facts straight. Midrash Tanhuma (1989 - KTAV, pp. 166-67) is one place that states that this is a direct reference to Mesach, not generic. Can you site me the source of your opinion?|`|DiIAaFgzaa	They have different translators.  I would like to have a copy of the Torah (in English) so I could check out these alleged differences.  Some say that there are significant differences, but I've never seen a direct reference to what they say.|`|VDTTzwlUaa	I have looked at the TaNaKh and the Old Testament, although I haven't compared it word for word. In my opinion they look pretty similar, with the exception of some words translated differently, e.g. the Psalm about having pierced his hands and feet is actually talking about a lion and being at his hands and feet.    Some would say that this translation is a blatant attempt to make prophecy appear, others would say it was not. I will let you decide on that.    As far as the two go on the books, I believe they are the same, although in a different order and arrangement.
7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Quoted by K: the book of Mormon is NOT SCRIPTURE...it was written by Joseph Smith (who was NOT a prophet) and his stupid wife.      Ummm it still says Christ. Even if it was a lie, (And it's Not, at least for people who know it's not) it still says Christ. Honestly, talk about turning a Blind eye to our beliefs.    Edit: skepsis: The Christ we read about and teach about are the same. Although the Christ in the Book of Mormon is a reserected being. He has not changed at all and only has changed in your mind.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	They do, nobody denies that, but they believe that He is the offspring of God and the Heavenly Mother, whoever that might be, and believe that He is not God incarnate, but the firstborn son of God...  Some of their teachings clash with the teachings of the bible and the bible is the only Written Word of God...at the very end in Revelation God warns us not to add nothing to the Word, and to take nothing from it...  The book of Ne phi, that you are talking about must have been added by some of the Mormon members into their own variation of their own bible, because my King James has this book nowhere in it...neither do my other bibles...|`|AA12203324	It is because the Mormon Christ does not act like the New Testament Christ.  Having the same name does not make for the same person.  It would be like promoting a story about Teddy Roosevelt going to Venus and showing the Venusians how to live in peace with their bitter rivals, the Mercurians.  It may be a good story, but people who are familiar with the biography of Teddy Roosevelt will not believe it.    To be fair, the Christian Jesus didn't behave the way that Jewish scriptures said he should behave, but that just illustrates the explanation.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	I find it ironic that Christians will say things like:  "The problem with CULTS is that they alter the Word of God. They always add to it, which the Bible CLEARLY tells people not to do. "  The entirety of Christian belief is rooted in the "New" Testament, a late day addition and rewrite to the Bible, the Law as given to G-d to Moses, and the covenant given to Abraham.  The Church of Latter Day Saints is only slightly more "latter-day" when compared to Christianity itself.  It took about 2000 years for Joseph Smith to declare himself a prophet, following the "new" testament. It took about 3000 for Jesus' followers to do the same thing, following the "old" one.    I think all religions are cults, but to each his own.  Why fight about mythologies?  Just believe what you will and leave everyone else to do the same.    To answer the question simply: certainly, LDS believe in Jesus the Christ.  All Christians believe the same thing, but they fight over essentially minor stuff.    If there could be a Jesus, then WHY NOT a Joseph Smith or a Muhammad?    Or a flying spaghetti monster?|`|Mo0Md3c8aa	Of course Mormons believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.|`|AA11636949	People say it to validate their fears. They fear that we are right and that all they have known in their religious circles is wrong or at least misconstrued. They say it because they can. The joy of living in the U.S. is the constitutional right of freedom of speech and they use that freedom full and well.|`|84nXWNT3aa	Whoever said they don't?|`|AA10043552	Nothing a Christian hates more than another Christian who believes even slightly differently.|`|Z4b1bZlSaa	Mormenism is seriously messed up....i heard some freaky things before on what they believe...can't remember exactly right now|`|PKWHLbdfaa	No one questions the LDS belief in Jesus.  The question is, which Jesus?  And which gospel justifies us before God?    All attacks on Jesus from heritics attempt to diminish his divinity or his humanity.  He was 100% of both.  Those who claim he was fully divine but not human believe that he faked suffering and doesn't really related to the human condition.  Mormons make just the opposite mistake by questioning his divinity.  Let me explain.    To the LDS or Mormons, Jesus was a spritual creation of Elohim just like us, who grew up to be like God, and eventually became God.  To Mormons, Jesus is their Elder Brother leading the way to Godhood.  He became God and so can you if you do what He did.  Brigham Young even went so far as to say that eventually we'd have to pay for our own sins.  That's where the blood atonement doctrine came from.    To Christians, Jesus is God who came into human history.  Emmanual means God with us.  We view him as 100% human but also 100% God.  You and I are creations.  Angels are creations.    Does the difference matter?  Yes.  The LDS explanation exalts us and places unrealistic burdens on us.  We're not Gods, nor do we have the ability to be perfect, sinfree right now.  We look to Jesus...as God to do that work in us, not our Elder Brother who is simply showing us the way so that we can act like him and get what he got.    Let me put it another way.  Bruce R. McConkie in his final address said that if we want the blessings and power of Elijah, we must believe and act as he did.  Conversly, Mormons teach that if we want to be joint heirs with Jesus, we must acheive his perfection.  Remember D&C 82:7...when we sin, all former sins return to us.  That's not good news.  That's another gospel.    The real Christian good news is that God himself came into human history to take on our sins.  We can put on His righteousness through our faith in His finished work.  We can be justified before God right now because of Jesus, completely apart from our works.  In Mormonism, you can't because if you're not doing EVERYTHING in your power, you fall short, even to the point of all your sins returning.      Remember that LDS church headquarters agreed that we must stop all sin before we can receive the fullness that the atonement has for us.  And that includes receiving ordinances.  That's not the gospel that Paul taught.  In fact, Paul taught that those who look to law and ordinance obedience are cursed.  Gal 3.  Think about it.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Oh don't waste your breath - those with "ears to hear the truth and hearts ready to hear the gospel" are those that see beyond all the bologna that people say & claim and spew about the LDS Church... the contenders are not worth arguing with... I hate to say it - but it's true.  Don't let them frustrate you as FRUSTRATING as some of them are....    "ye shall know the truth & the truth shall make you free" - we know this to be true too.....|`|WNWKDw4uaa	People are weird.

"And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us   "That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness;   "That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him..." [D&C]  This is the pure and simple gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed thru his prophets, ancient and modern.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	It's beyond ignorance.|`|AA11713693	Jesus Christ is the keystone of the religion and the centre of our teachings.|`|8OeulLkmaa	the book of Mormon is NOT SCRIPTURE...it was written by Joseph Smith (who was NOT a prophet) and his stupid wife.    If you read the Bible all by itself, you would find out what is wrong with JOSEPH SMITH.  Please read the bible and do not JUDGE the word of God by Joseph Smith LIE.  The problem with CULTS is that they alter the Word of God. They always add to it, which the Bible CLEARLY tells people not to do.  The bible is not enough for mormons.  They need JOSEPH SMITH BOOK to explain the Word of God.  JW's need another "holy book" to explain the word of God.    EDIT:  Joseph Smith and his wife TRANSLATED the golden plates...mormons believe by supernatural power.    EDIT:  Read the Bible only.  When you don't understand something, don't get your answers from the book of Mormon.  I personally think Joseph Smith plagerized some of the Bible and then added his on imagination to the rest.    Think of this: Abraham was promised land by God to his children's children.  God promised this for a purpose.  His son is going to come to earth and rule on that land.  It is ISRAEL..I think Joseph Smith is no better than Muhammed who wants his people to be the "chosen people".|`|rg4lS9E9aa	it's just ignorance on some peoples part. they also say this about JW'S again not true.
g7RnYMoNaa	You are right, the only way for us to get into God's kingdom is through Jesus Christ. His death for us, gives us the right to become children of God, because he forgives us everything. A thousand years in obedience cannot take away one single sin. We are saved by grace  and grace alone. Still there is another side of the coin, and that to some people appear confusing and contradictorily (even if it isn't), and that is the fact that breaking God's law may prevent us from getting into God's kingdom. Both statements are true, we are saved by grace, but lost through doing bad things.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Why do you believe these myths? Do you understand that your deity comes across as an abusive parent?|`|bYqWHuzyaa	Jesus will forgive if he sees in your heart that you are trying to change.  You can't go off and kill someone then ask for forgiveness.  Saint Paul was a nasty person, but God saw something on the inside.  It's all about what is in your heart and the only person who can see that is God.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	It's in the bible.|`|boqwvEvUaa	well, if you believe in jesus and then spend the rest of your life killing people, i'm not sure if you would deserve a paradise ;)|`|Z1e4HJMEaa	Please do not be discouraged, You are doing the right thing here preaching the word of the Lord!

It doesn't mean that to me, but to the dudes a long long time ago, that's how  it was.    Jesus isn't unique.    I don't see Christianity dying anytime soon though, it still shinning brightly. But, yeah, eventually it'll fade out and be replaced. Just, probably not in our lifetime.|`|ULVz11Evaa	The funny thing with this is that the Christian leadership didn't adopt the "Virgin Birth" theory until 4 centuries after Jesus' death as a result of a mistranslation.|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	Like any good story, the one of Jesus' birth has been corrupted over the years. But the bible's account has remained the same for 200 years.    Christianity won't be replaced and Christianity did not overcome pagan beliefs. There are plenty of people today worshiping false gods, just like in the old days. The more things change, the more they remain the same. At least until Jesus returns.|`|AA11984833	Satan has been using his lies and imitations for thousands of years now.

Note also the theme of Jesus being nailed to a cross and being reborn is also not unique - he is the fruit of a tree that is planted and reborn...    Scientology is the religion of the future. It suits our time.    "Who wants to suckle on Abraham's bosom?"   -Joseph Campbell.|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	Birth and pregnancy were highly significant in many ancient cultures, and at some points even more so than they are today. The idea of a virgin birth was seen as something so Holy, and the one thing that could never be achieved by man, only Divine Intervention could be the cause of an "immaculate conception", as it's called.  Unfortunately, most of the ancient religions contains examples of virgin births have either died out or aren't in the main focus of most modern day people.   Jesus may stand out more due to the vastness of Christianity. According to my textbook and the chart "World Population's Religious Affiliations", Christianity is at 33%, surpassing in population other religions and beliefs including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, "Other", and non-religious.
lcvhhGjpaa	Yes I did and yes I did to your second question also.    http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/a...    Without the presence of the male chromosome only a female can be reproduced, basically a clone of itself.    The virgin birth was never part of Hebraic prophesy and an invention of the Council of Nicea 323-325 AD, which probably was due to the infestation of Greek mythology within scripture.  They basically voted on it, there were many who opposed it and also claimed Jesus was only a prophet.  They were asked to meet at a temple and were murdered, there were 145 or so of them.  When the Catholic church is questioned regarding this it states that, ''It was the will of God that they were murdered''.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	You're speaking from a purely genetic standpoint.  In other words, were His Spirit to not intervene then a virgin birth would produce offspring genetically identical to the mother.    Talk about "obvious"...    God bless you.|`|RS3qwNCqaa	Atheist here. While I agree with you that the virgin birth is a scientific improbablity of ...oh...something that means big...proportions, I also should come to the defense of Christians now. The reason is this: as theists go, Christians have a track record (in the last 50 years or so) of not going around killing, torturing, enslaving and oppressing people. So, unless you've got a cool nifty ray gun that turns everyone into an atheist, I would hope that you would kindly lay off the less offensive theists and , in keeping with your assumed respect for logic, focus your criticisms on those theists who have yet to join the 21st or even the 20th century.|`|OhhKRahTaa	My parents died before they were born.|`|hnhb119Laa	I always wondered what God's DNA would look like compared to just normal human DNA.|`|AA11466759	Not if RNA was used instead of DNA  but the entire story is based on the premise of divine intervention...something that had never occurred before in human history.    And you either believe that God can do anything, or you don't believe in Him at all.  After all, the nature of God is that He is in control of all things.|`|AA11690436	Parthenogenesis may occur in nature occasionally, and, yes, the progeny produced will necessarily be female.  But if we are telling stories about NON natural occurrences or SUPERnatural events, the outcomes can be whatever we care to claim.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Yes, there is parthenogenesis when it comes to other animals, however, there are no cases in humans.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Yes, but weren't those captive whales?  Or was it dolphins?|`|qbelhflAaa	Those are dragons. We are humans.|`|AA11297267	Obviously :)  Since a woman has no Y chromosome, she can't make a male baby on her own.  It *is* possible, though rare, for eggs to make some genetic mistakes and sort of "self-fertilize," and there you go -- virgin birth (assuming the mother is a virgin, of course).  But yeah -- it'd be an exact copy of the mother.    You do know the bible story is a *myth,* right?    Peace.|`|UV6osJh8aa	So, you are asking Christians to say how the virgin birth can be discounted as the act of a supernatural entity, and can be explained away as a random biological phenomenon?    Are you asking Christians to ARGUE in FAVOUR of the viewpoint that the virgin birth was a random biological anomaly?    I am quite sure that the virgin birth of Jesus could not be a random phenomenon.    I am also quite sure that the Almighty is well capable of performing this act of will.  Christians have NEVER claimed that the virgin birth is a natural anomaly, but that Jesus was fathered by the brooding of the Spirit.|`|AA10043552	Virgin Birth is a metaphore. It wasn't suppose to be taken literally|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	you know I always said that jesus was a woman...|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Yes, I did know that. However, there has never been a documented case of it happening in humans. It could - but we haven't seen it yet.    Mary almost certainly did not have a virgin birth, if she even existed. Just because it is scientifically possible for a virgin mother to exist doesn't mean it did.    And, like you said, if she had, the baby would have been female.|`|9MhdJ1YDaa	Did you ignore the "fact" that the article stated this was only found in reptiles & amphibians? I saw Jurassic Park too......    "Isn't this an obvious fact that Christians ignore?" Can you say "irony"?|`|O7SshRl6aa	Yes, you are right.  I believe the term is Parthogenesis (please forgive spelling).  The mother spontanenously creates a duplicate of herself.  This offspring MUST be female.
xWi4ua0Iaa	so okay here are my questions:  1. how many are in a deck? is there a limit?    78 cards in a deck - if more or less, it is not a Tarot Deck.  It may be based on the same stylings, but it is not Tarot    2. how do you read them?    We read them through a combination of intuition, the position of the card in the layout, understanding the archetypal image of the card, and the relationship of the card to the other cards in the reading.    3. do you need some special skills to read them?    You'll need to spend time studying the individual cards first...after that, you'll want to learn "spreads" (layouts) until you come to the type of spreads you feel most comfortable with.  The most popular is the 10 card Celtic Cross layout, so I suggest you familiarize yourself with this spread early on.    4. do you need to call up any demons or anything creepy like that?    There is no demonology or anything overtly religious or non-religious in them.  They are about archetypes, meaning they are closely related to dream imagery.    5. do you need any specific props in order to be able to read them?    Some people like to use special layout pages, but nothing is actually needed.  You should however respect the cards enough to keep them wrapped in cloth when not in use, and to keep them in a safe place (a wooden box is preferable).    6. do you need to be anything specific to participate and read them? (i mean like do you have to have any believes, experience, or be part of any religion)?    You could study a little about Jungian psychology, to have a better understanding of how archetypes interact with the mind, but it is not necessary.      7. is it dangerous?    Only if you take the advice of somebody who does a poor reading.  I would suggest you learn to do your own readings, and to take NO ONE else's advice.    8. do they even work?    Depends on how you define "work".  They can be useful in helping you detirmine direction or clarifying a specific issue you are being troubled with...in that sense they are as helpful as journaling or meditation.  If you think they are going to tell you the "future", then no, they don't "work".    9. do you need to be involved in meditation to read them?    It couldn't hurt.  The more spiritual your life is, the more respectful you will be to the information the archetypes convey.  I personally meditate at least 15 minutes per day, and usually twice a day when I find the time.    10. do you say anything?    Saying anything is sort of a theatrical method used by charlatans to milk rubes out of their money.  You encounter this, get your money back and run.     is there a way to place the cards?     As mentioned, there are many spreads...there are even Tarot books devoted to just spreads.    please help and make sure to mention any details      This is too vague I'm afraid...my suggestion to you is when you get your first deck make it a Rider-Waite Deck.  This is the most basic deck, and most decent decks are variations on the Rider-Waite.  Also visit a used book store and buy a couple of the most basic books on the Tarot (even get the Tarot For Dummies - remember, it's for beginners.)  Don't get too heady or it'll scare you off, and don't go spending a bunch of money on the bazillion different decks there are out there - you don't need a specialized deck right now.  You only need one.  Check out a few tarot sites for some more basic information, and don't get into doing readings for money - it's dishonest at it's worst and disrespectful to the cards...the best thing I can tell you is it's closest esoteric cousin is the reading of dreams, and you may want to supplement your study of the tarot with a little deeper understanding of dream working....good luck to you.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	1. A standard deck has 78 cards. Here's a popular set: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider-Waite...    2. Each card has a central impression, and a cloud of meanings around the impression. The draw is on one issue. Cards are drawn in a pattern, most often the Celtic Cross (http://www.learntarot.com/ccross.htm). The position of the card tells about influences surrounding the matter of concern, such as past influence, underlying motives, goals, people around the subject, etc.    3. Intuition and symbol interpretation helps a lot. Being able to see associations and conflicts between cards in different positions.    4. No. Although many tarot readers have spiritual beliefs about drawing, tarot works like free association to bring out unconscious thoughts and feelings in the person being read. It is often the case that the reader will talk about the card meanings and their association with one another, and not understand how the read relates to the person being read, but the person being read "knows" exactly how the read relates to the subject they're considering.    5. No props. Just use the cards and their positions as talking points.    6. No. Tarot works well with or without religious or spiritual beliefs.    7. No. Free association is a common way of bringing up unconscious material.    8. Yes.    9. No, but the reader should strictly avoid influencing the read with their judgment, personal convictions, prejudices and preconceived ideas. Just read, point out cards that have strong similarity, and let the person being read come to their own conclusions.    10. You can if it helps you clear your mind of prejudices and pre-judgment. One thing I used to do remind myself to keep my opinions to myself, and leave conclusions to the person being read, is shuffle the cards by spreading them out and swirling them around so the cards were completely random. Doing the cards this way, to me, was like an erasing motion, which reminded me to keep my influences out of the read.    I also would say what position a card represented as I placed each one; e.g. "This card represents you as you are now in the matter. This card crosses you, and represents opposition. This card is beneath you, and represents underlying influences.", etc.    You will need a book or online resource which details the meanings of the cards. If you are getting a deck, look at the variety and choose one that appeals to you.|`|UpReVityaa	seriously?    dude, take up Magic: The Gathering or something|`|AA10043552	www.learntarot.com|`|81oQXCxGaa	1.

God warns us to stay away from the evil of those things and with the end coming close the answer should be getting closer to God not going satans way.|`|Yw1k1W19aa	Well, you list ten questions but begin by asking 'what are they?', so I'll start there.    Tarot cards are actually playing cards. They were created in the mid 15th century for the Milanese court by adding adding a fifth suit of picture cards to the existing pack of Latin suited playing cards. These extra cards took as their theme a Christian triumph procession, hence their early name trionfi, meaning triumphs and from which we get our word trump. It was the invention of tarot that marked the introduction of trumps in card games - and that was their original use, card games. For 350 years they were used for nothing else and the games continue to be played throughout continental Europe today.    The number of cards can vary more than people realize. There is an early example of a pack with 80 cards but most have 78. However, notable exceptions include the Florentine Minchiate, which has 97 cards - though this game is no longer played. In Sicily they play games with a 64 card pack and in Bologna, a 62 card pack - both of these regions use unique packs with unusual arrangement of trumps.    At the end of the 18th century, Parisian occultist Antoine Court de Gebelin found a pack of tarot cards and, ignorant of their true origin, invented one about their coming from Ancient Egypt and suggested a method of divination. For about 100 years, these notions were limited to France but at the end of the 19th century, some British occultists brought them to the English speaking world, where the games were unknown.    Without an occult origin, fortune telling with tarot cards is no different in kind from using dominoes, tea leaves, or knuckle bones. You must decide for yourself if you can take these seriously. However, there are objections made to the notion of knowing the future by both science and philosophy because it is subject to the same logical problems and paradoxes as time travel.    At the end of the day, the various methods and interpretations that people use to read the cards are all the products of human inventions - there are many methods and interpretations published and one is as good as another. There are no demons or religions involved, and no dangers - this is a pack of playing cards. You can use whatever method you like, you can invent a method yourself, it will be no less (or more) valid than any of those published.    Personally, I think you might find the games more rewarding and enjoyable than the fortune telling. However, if you would like to try fortune telling then try this site:    http://www.aeclectic.net|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	1: about 78, and it varies.  The cards can be big, and some are circle-shaped, not rectangular.  No limit; sometimes two decks are used at a time.  2: You look at the pictures and use your brain to interpret what you see.  Like an inkblot test, but without the inkblots.  3: You need some shuffling skills, and some memory for what certain cards represent.  4: nope.  No creepy stuff.  5:  Props might include a flat surface, a tablecloth or fabric to keep them from sliding around on the table.  6: You have to be willing to see things a different way.  Sometimes the card you see is not to be read at face value.  It takes a bit of intuition sometimes.  7: It's only dangerous if you resign your life to the cards and abandon your own ability to make choices.  8:  They don't do the work.  Your mind in interpreting them does the work.  Either your mind works or it doesn't.  9:  Some focus would be good, but meditation is not required.  10:  It helps to have a question to ask.  No fancy words.  There are layouts of cards called "spreads" and you can get some in books, or invent your own.      Try your local library, section 133 in the dewey decimal system.

You gotta know what the pictures mean. So I guess yo have to kind of study. Normally people kinda inherit it. Passed down each generation.     I don't know how many cards there are. (you can google that) but I know that the customer has to pick three. Normally.     1st represents the past  2nd the present   3rd the future.     You can't conjure anything with tarot cards. They're there to look into the past, present and future.     I don't believe in them, you don't have to believe in any religion. Most people just do it for fun in carnivals, and festivals.     No meditation involved as far as I'm aware.

2MfMyh4Maa	The Christian idea is that God is the only goal, not heaven.  Heaven is just a place where we will be with Him.    Belief is not the end of the matter.  Belief is part of the means to seek our Creator.  We have to "assume as true" that God exists before we can seek Him. To "assume as true" is the definition of believe.    Belief enables us to honestly seek Him.  If we don't seek Him, it means that we really didn't believe.  We seek God by trying to obey His commands such as "love your neighbor as yourself" for we think that where love is, there God is also.    So that's the answer as to why.      Why do Muslims do their good deeds?  If you would, I'm asking you to email me an answer.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	nice one :)|`|29X6EEsKaa	Add this to the list of problems/errors/contradictions.

However, it isn't works in and of themselves that give anyone salvation because that a) gives people an opportunity to boast that they earned heaven and/or are better people than others and b)  in Christianity, heaven is a gift that cannot be attained through works because the Bible claims that all have sinned and fallen short of God and the wages of sin is death (separation from God).    Only God can grant you access to heaven and there is nothing you can do to gain the prize for yourself other than obedience to God.     "heck, why do any good at all"  If someone really believe in Jesus and what he had to say then that person isn't going to want to commit what Jesus said were sins. A genuine Christian doesn't go around committing adultery, stealing, etc.    That is what the New Testament teaches. Now, it seems like you 1) have a holier-than-thou attitude and 2) are talking condescendingly to Christians.     If you have a question to ask people and sincerely want to know the answer then be polite about it. However, it seems that the intent of your question was to just attack Christians. Maybe this isn't the case, but the last line "heck, why do any good at all" doesn't make it sound sincere. I will admit that I have thrown my own frustrated statements into questions before but I am aware that this is not a civil way to discuss these issues. If you really wanted to be sincere you might have phrased your question more like: "In Christianity, if you believe that Jesus is savior you are guaranteed heaven. If you already are secured a spot, is there anything to drive you to do good works?"    Be aware that people are just as critical of your religion as they are Christianity or any other religions and you should not assume that you have the absolute truth and everyone else is a dimwit.|`|bHeNC3HAaa	you're lucky that i have self control otherwise i'd be yelling at you right now :)  you're asking this question like you think that Christians are dumb and that you're better because you're Muslim. Ask the question in a different and more polite way and you could very well get more answers, but i'm not going to answer it because i'm too mad right now to answer it. so thanks, now i'm even more annoyed :D     let's put it this way, say i asked a question about Muslims (sorry i dont have an example for a question because i dont exactly enjoy looking up and studying your religion) in a way that you did, i think you'd be pretty mad right now too :D *notice those are SARCASTIC smiles* so yeah, shut up :]
be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	sunnah prayers are extra prayers the prophet did consistently.      You can offer 2 rakats at any time...well there are certain restricted times....but in general yes.   Those aren't sunnah since the prophet didn't do that...they would be nafil.        Now why did he offer extra prayers.....not 100% sure...  There is a hadith in reference to tahajud..but i think it applies to sunnah prayers in meaning.      Narrated Al-Mughira: The Prophet used to stand (in the prayer) or pray till both his feet or legs swelled. He was asked why (he offered such an unbearable prayer) and he said, "should I not be a thankful slave."    There is another one i heard but i can't find it...but its the same thing...where aisha asks why he prays soo much when he knows he's going to heaven and he gives the same reply.|`|8FbJjRpwaa	He did them obv because he loved Allah and you are supposed to be doing sunnah prayers too not like that 'Ex sunni' said! Thats how ive been bought up anyway praying sunnah and fard!|`|2uB2Iv66aa	Sunnah prayers are not mandatory.    If you want you can offer Sunnah prayers all day long.|`|hP7edhKYaa	well the prophet Mohammed s.a.w was described as a great role model for us in the Quran    I dont really know why he did extra ones. but i mean like i sed he is a great example mashallah and its great to do things for Allah that arent obligatory    Ok stupid example but ....  Its like... if i asked u to get me some food or somet.. and u come back with not only food but like extra sidings and salad and drinks ect etc im gona be more pleased with u.... (stupid example) :P    But yea its always great to give extra worship to Allah so its not for "no reason" the reason is the love for Allah swt and wanting to please him in ways what are not obligatory for u.   Extra salaah  Extra zakat  Extra fasting  EXTRA EFFORT :D so that inshallah we get extra rewards :)|`|v6KqicByaa	he didnt say 2 do it. its something he used to do, so ppl would do it to, and its something very good 2 do!
IxoBFCpTaa	That is sunnah.    The prayers during the day are read quiet while Fajr, Maghrib, and 'Ishaa are read aloud only in the first 2 Rakat. However, during the day, Jama'at is also read aloud during Jumu'a.          Peace ?  ^_^|`|4aveC2aaaa	Aloud, when you are doing Jama'a (with other people)    and silent, when you are alone     it matters as long as your heart recites it as well      also what Raw said ^_^|`|x7uRjwseaa	Actually the Quran says that you should pray in a moderate voice, nor too loud neither silently.    "Say: "Call upon Allah, or call upon Rahman: by whatever name ye call upon Him, (it is well): for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Neither speak thy Prayer aloud, nor speak it in a low tone, but seek a middle course between." " (17:110)|`|2uB2Iv66aa	So that you do not sleep at night.|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace...    "Say: "Call upon Allah, or call upon Rahman: by whatever name ye call upon Him, (it is well): for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Neither speak thy Prayer aloud, nor speak it in a low tone, but seek a middle course between." " (17:110)    The prophet told the Muslims that they should pray silent (to not disturb others i.e. Non-muslims were even respected) and pray aloud (to awaken others as at fajr)    There are many reasons but time does not allow me to answer it fully, inshallah another time..

2g8m8USQaa	There is no time limit so take all you need.    EMT|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I'm not really sure your question here.    What loss?  Why do they say you are psycho?  There is normal grief and there is extreme grief.  Some people deal in an extreme way that is "psycho" and they need help.  People rarely say you need a psyche hospital on their own so maybe you should figure out who says it and why they say it.    No there is no time limit on grief.  There are 5 stages and everyone goes through it differently.  However if a long time has passed and your grief hasn't lessened to any degree that you can even function, perhaps you should seek therapy.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	No, there is no right or wrong amount of time needed to grieve, I lost my Mom in 2004 and am still grieving it is a very personal thing and only those who have had to deal with it can possibly understand it.|`|jz9CnL2Eaa	We are all expected to grieve after a loss.  Some people do take longer than others to cope and to find a new normal.  If you are having trouble doing so to the point where you are stuck in your pain and see no way out, then perhaps counseling would be wise to seek.|`|mQZDizMVaa	No one's immune to losing someone. Sooner or later each of us will experience a loss in our lives-and that includes those who think you're "psycho." Don't listen to them. You need people who'll uplift you and who understand what you're going through.    I lost my first husband in 1994 and although I'll probably never get over it, I've moved on by staying busy and with the strength that came from within.    There really isn't a timeline for one's grieving period. It depends on the individual. For myself, keeping busy was a big help. Before he died, my husband said: "You're not going to cave in on me." I think those words helped me to stay focused and kept me going.    All the best.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	There is no time on grieving.  However, after a handful of months you ought to be slowly getting on with your life, learning to adjust to the loss and carrying on since you are still alive and should be living.  Or if your grief is spilling over and affecting your ability to deal with other people and life, then you do need to talk to a grief counselor to figure out how better to deal with your grief, learn how to let go,|`|mRun89yLaa	well if your still grieving for a loss of someone that has died about 2 years than maybe you should go to the crazy house, but if they just died cry away, and see a therapist. it helps|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	People grieve in different ways.  There is a time when you have to pick yourself up and move on.  Don't let the words of others make you feel bad.  We all suffer losses.

The Muslim community of America condemns the repeat-assault on the Al-Askariyan shrines in Samara on June 13th 2007. The wounds inflicted by the first assault on February 22nd, 2006, when the golden dome of the shrine was demolished, have reopened.    Nevertheless, a latest fatwa has been issued by the evil-minded muftis of Saudia and Kuwait, encouraging the so-called students of Islam to demolish the holy muslim shrines in Iraq and Damascus.    Here is some information on what has already demolished:     The Jannat-ul-Baqi is the famous cemetery located right across the Masjid-al-Nabawi in the Holy City of Madina. Children, wives and immediate relatives of Prophet Muhammads (pbuh) are buried in this cemetery.    They are:  ? Ibrahim (a.s.)  Son  ? Fatima Zehra (a.s.)  Daughter  ? Imam Hasan al Mujtaba (a.s.)  Grandson  ? Imam Ali Ibnul Hussain (a.s.)  Great Grandson  ? Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.)  Great Grandson  ? Imam Jaafar Sadiq (a.s.)  Great Grandson  ? Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib  Uncle    Jannat-ul-Baqi was razed to the ground, with no sign of any grave or tomb whatsoever by the government of Saudi Arabia.    Demolition Date: April 21, 1925 (8h Shawwal,1345 Hijrah, Islamic Calendar)    Demolished By: Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman ibn Faisal Al Saud (aka Ibn Saud) Monarch of Saudi Arabia.  _______________________    The Askariyan Golden Mosque  in Samarra, Iraq is The Holy Shrine that houses the tombs of the family of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).    They are:  ? Imam Ali Hadi (a.s.)  Great Grandson  ? Imam Hassan Askari (a.s.)  Great Grandson  ? Hakima Khatoon  Sister of Imam Ali Hadi (a.s.)  ? Narjis Khatoon (s.a.)  Wife of Imam Hassan Askari (a.s.)    This holy shrine was bombed twice to demolish it:  ? First on February 22nd, 2006, and  ? Second on June 13th, 2007   _______________    Chronology of terrorism against the Ahlul-bayt(as)        * 1801: Wahabis attacked Kerbala, damaged the shrine and looted the Zarhis.      * 1925: Wahabis demolished the Jannatul Baqee.      * 2006: In February, Wahabis assaulted the Golden mosque in Samara, Iraq, the famous al-Askariyan and demolished the golden dome of the shrine of Imam Ali Naqi, al-Hadi(as) and Imam Hassan Askari (as).      * 2007: In June, a repeat assault on the al-Askariyan shrine by the Wahabis, to demolish the remains of the shrine and its slender minarets.      * 2007: Recently, an evil fatwa given by the so-called muftis of Saudia to demolish the muslim holy shrines in Iraq and Damascus.    _____________    Pictures of the Protest    http://al-baqee.org/pics2007.asp|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Well, many Muslims have told me there is no such thing as "Wahabis."    So what exactly are the leaders of Saudi Arabia?  Are they Salafi Muslims?    Or are they not Muslims?    This is awfully confusing.    Look, if you kept every historical place intact, everyone would have to live in 100 story, 20' x 20' high rises...    It's called growth.
AA11994957	the Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil.    love is an action verb as a root of affection.  Our source of that love is the key.  remember money leads to materialism and greed and envy.|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	Yes.    Before you were born, Christianity was the norm and the masses were strongly righteous and moral.  With such a clean-cut society, prostitution, gambling, drinking and drugs wasn't as profitable (GREED) as the mobsters wanted it to be. So they began to form "Unions" and used the enticement of a "job" in exchange for political activism. Their biggest opponents were the Churches. Now they had a "Union Congregation" to battle the Churches and loosen the morals of the public by any means they could. They worked to ban censorship and loosen the FCC Regulations to stimulate their audiences with sexual temptations and glorified drug/alcohol use.    Before there was television, it was the radio broadcasting that captured America. The mobsters organized musicians unions and got bands and singers work with their "Play for Pay" schemes with local D.J.'s and radio stations. The Songwriters Union wrote songs of rebellion, sexual permissiveness, obscenity and vulgarities.     Soon AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and SAG (Screen Actor Guild) unions fought the Churches by making movies ridiculing religion and making sexually risque' films so they could tempt more viewers and make MONEY from legal films and illegal prostitution, drugs, and at one time alcohol and tobacco.    Knowing that Republicans took the high moral ground, the unions became politically active as well, therefore the unions or "Democrats" fought the Republican high moral ground by using influential Actors and popular Musicians, songs, TV and Hollywood Unions (Including the NWU National Writers Unions which controlled newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, textbooks, screenplays, comedians, media of all types.    Today the Pay for Play was recently the cause of Blagojevich (Chicago Mayor) being prosecuted by the FBI. He's one of the few that got caught. Judges, Politicans, City Councils etc. are all financed by this massive network of unions that are used to control the money being fed to the mafia. Congress feeds them through earmarks (pork barrel). Judges feed them with their decisions (Roe Vs. Wade), (Eminent Domain) and City Councils the their Gov't projects (Casinos, horse racing, Contractors, Public Works & Transportation, Public Service Announcements (our tax $ given to TV/Hollywood & Actors).    Now, through the teachers unions they have control over our tax dollars and our children. The textbooks they read are hand picked by the Unions, many of which are pro communist atheistst that have been the cause of student protests and degeneracy of morals.    FROM "45 Goals of Communists in America" 1963 (Library of Congress)   MOLD THE MIND OF THE YOUNG AND THEY ARE YOURS!  http://www.rense.com/general32/americ.ht...    5. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.  17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda.  Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.  19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.  20. Infiltrate the press. Gain control of all student newspapers.   21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.  24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them "censorship" and a violation of free speech and free press.  ?25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.  ?26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as "normal, natural, healthy."  ?27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a "religious crutch."  ?28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of "separation of church and state."    As you can see - they have accomplished their goals.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	Envy and pride are the mothers of all evil.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	No. It is one of it's biggest starting points - but all human nature and the devil, and also sin, are the sources of evil.

Start with women, children and infants, regardless of social class. When you've done that, evacuate the remaining men. Anyone still on deck when the ship sinks will have to take their chances.

AA11726497	The Bible warns against it.  The believer will NOT lose his or her salvation.      But later on it could cause problems because you bring two different worldviews into the marriage.  The believer I would hope would want their children raised with Christian values and beliefs.  The unbeliever may not care or may have a different idea of how the children are to be raised, etc...  This could cause problems.    All marriages have issues and problems, a believer and un-believer joining in marriage may add to it.      2Co 6:14  Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers:    The question would be, is the believer going to do what God says or what their feelings tell them to do?|`|UTH4q0l2aa	Yeah.

1NvTeGp4aa	There is clearly an error in that sentence. The error is the word "ser". It was probably translated digitally, thus the mistake. The correct word would be "estar", which is a different state of the verb "to be" (as in "I'm here"). Also, "com voc sempre" lacks a preposition, the word "para".    The correct sentence would be: "Eu desejo poder estar com voc para sempre", which means: "I want to be with you forever".|`|tnPw8rwsaa	"I wish I could be with you always" That is soo sweet hahaha.|`|2HP7IhBqaa	"I desire that i could be ???? always"   lol something like that|`|cf217a7ce3f072b96b3827b9fa9b820faa	that means i wish i were like you|`|iw0slAK9aa	I desire that I would be able to be with you always|`|QBBQ0sWqaa	Dont you mean in English|`|IVUSG4Uyaa	I wish I was like you forever.|`|Ep0j9Wapaa	I wonder to be with you forever.

This phrase doesn't make sense. I think it should be: Eu desejo que eu poderia ser como voc sempre.

If the answerer's are not interested in what the bible says, they will probably say what the people in the days of Noah said; that "everything is continuing on now, just as it did in the days of our fathers', but the bible says also that the fact that the world of Noah's' day did come to an end, with the flood, is ignored by such ones, so they can continue to do what they like, without fear of God doing anything.

GuBF5xhDaa	there are some cults like Temple of the Vampire and Aset Ka.    Vampirism is NOT a realigion or lifstyle choice. Real vampires are normal people who have a physical need for extra energy because they don't have enough of their own to stay healthy. Sanguines drink small amounts of blood from willing donors, and psychic vampires pull the energy directly from their donors. They are not mental, and they don't have medical conditions like Porphyria. The only reason they use the word "vampire" is because it is the closest word that fits their condition. They don't sleep in coffins, they aren't immortal, and the worst that they get from the sun is a burn.

It all started while he was a satanist and it started as a ritual to suck blood from one of the female satanists when they gathered and they let him do it.  Then he wanted more and more and got some women on the street late at night or in the wee hours of the morning.  The women didn't try to stop him and he did this even though he was married.  It got to the point where he didn't want anything to eat---only blood.  The name of the book is "Lucifer Dethroned."  He was delivered completely and became a dedicated Christian with a wonderful ministry to other oppressed by occultists.  The devil  has attacked his ministry very much though and his wife was on the verge of death for heart failure a long time.  He was a Catholic at one time after coming out of the occult and was a Moron for awhile.  Now he puts out much literature warning people not only about occultists but about Catholics and Mormons too.  He considers both to be cults.|`|zURZtvufaa	FFS !!

EXamples: God-incarnation/satan-reincarnation, God-christianity/satan-hindu buddha. God says that life is in the blood and that you shouldn't eat it. It would make sense that satan would be behind the whole vampire thing...cause it involves the drinking of blood!

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	I find it rather fascinating that there are those Christians that claim all one need do, is believe to be saved, yet add so many conditions to that belief to make it less than what Christ said, especially in light of what is found in John 3:16.    Where did Christ say that there are conditions regarding the "type of Jesus" you should believe in?     They place these so called conditions, without any Biblical evidence, yet deny all of the repetitive Biblical scripture that says "faith without works is dead,"  "we are judged according to our works," and "we are judged by what we do" and any other Biblical mention of works.    It amazes me that while many Christians claim that we Mormons fashion our own beliefs by having another testament of Christ, the Book of Mormon, yet many Christians fashion their own interpretation of doctrine and change its intent.    Why else would there be so many different denominations if this were not so...?    Christ said there would be one faith, one baptism" yet is can be so confusing with all of the various denominations.   I do not think God would want it to be so confusing.   I would think that God would not want us to drift along in this confusion without knowing the truth.    I would think that God would follow his word in the Bible (Amos 3:7) and send his message through prophets.    This he has done, and I so testify that God has prophets on the earth today, to share his word and bring his gospel to light in plainness.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	I quite agree with you about "whomsoever"!    There is pretty much one collection of books (Bible) accepted by most Christians, with minor variations.    But who gets to interpret these books?    Understand that no book is ever read apart from context.  And among Christians, there has always been a Community in which these books were read during worship.    So the worshiping Community as a whole understood these books and that Message through a process of Communal discernment.  Taking the leadership in this discernment process were bishops, councils of priests, popes and councils of bishops.  There were also other eminent teachers and apologists who wrote on these topics.    Problems arose when certain leaders in this discernment process -- various bishops and popes -- claimed to have the final say and to shut out other parts of the Community.    For about 400 years there was One Church scattered throughout the world, but then first the Oriental Christians were dis-invited (Monophysites and Nestorians).  Then there was a break between the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) parts of this Community.  Again, the Western (Catholic) part broke into pieces again, first by multiple claimants to the papacy arguing against each other, and then by the huge break-off of the Protestant Reformers.    Later, the Protestant parts of the Community also split off from each other, and the splintering continues.    *****    Now, keep in mind that *all* these splintering sections of the Christian Community shared in common the ideas that there was ONE GOD and that Jesus Christ was also GOD (Divine) as well as human.    *****    What makes Jehovah's witnesses and Mormons stand out from the rest is that they disagree with one or both of those basic assumptions.    -- Jehovah's witnesses think Jesus was an angel who became human, but they deny that He is truly God and One with His Father and Spirit.  This is a major clash with prior Christian understanding about Jesus.    -- Mormons think there are multiple Gods and that we are essentially no different from the Gods, because they are simply ahead of us.    *****    So on one level, yeah, JWs and Mormons are a distinct breed.  They would not be classed as being one in mind with the rest of the Community over history.    However, on the other level, I would NEVER judge someone's standing before God or claim that they were not "saved".    Even if JWs and Mormons are incorrect in their understanding of who Jesus is, I don't think that shuts them out from the Love of God.  We are not saved by being "right" or intellectually "correct".  We are put right with God as a loving Grace-gift, not by what we do or know.    *****    If God had mercy on Saul / Paul because of his ignorance -- read 1 Timothy 1:13! -- then won't God have mercy on us if we misunderstand and are incorrect on some point of teaching?    *****    Once a child asked me, "I have a Muslim friend.  Does God hate him?"    I told him to shut his eyes, then asked him, "What color are my eyes?"    He guessed green, which was wrong, for my eyes are blue.    I had him open his eyes and asked, "Now, what color are my eyes?"    "Blue!" he said.    "You guessed wrong.  Do I love you any less because your guess was incorrect?"    "No!" he smiled.    "If we guess some things wrong about God, do you think He will hate us?"    "NO!" smiled the boy.    "That's right," I said.  "God is Love.  Jesus saved Thomas even when Thomas didn't believe He rose from the dead.  Jesus will save your Muslim friend too.  Christ came to save the whole world, not just us, but everyone."    Whomsoever indeed!|`|2LsR22g9aa	With so many contradictions and misinterpretations it's easy to come with several separate beliefs.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	Well there isnt just one Bible, look at the book of Mormon.

Your question though does hint at the answer. "Interpretation"    Mormons do not believe the bible is understandable without assistance so they have the Book of Mormon to "Interpret" the bible.    The JW's do not like what the bible says so they re-wrote it to say what they want it to say.    By the way in both cases above the additional book or the re-write were done based on "Special Revelation" that can not be verified by anyone. The tables that were used to translate the Book of Mormon were "taken away" and no one knows who the interpreters for the New World Translation were for the JW's, that's secret.    As to the differences in the Christian religions and denominations.    Most denominational difference come down to groups taking one or two verses and making them the central focus of their teachings. Speaking in Tongues, Baptism, the day the Sabbath is observed on etc etc.    In the cases of the Christian denominations the Jesus being worshipped is the same Jesus but methods of worship differ. Between JW's, Mormons and Christians the difference is that to Christians Jesus is God, for JW's and Mormons he is not.    Between Protestants and Catholics the differences are also doctrinal. Both still worship Christ as God but the Catholics add a lot of things that are not really in Scripture. They also add some books to the bible that are very questionable in order to support their beliefes. Its a rather complext topic and would be hard to cover here.    If you want to talk about it feel free to contact me.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, First it is a human problem. It is what we have done with God's message. There is only one Bible but the original was in Hebrew and Greek and there were small variations in the texts back when they were written (NT near 2000 years ago and OT up to 4000 yrs ago). Some of that was doctrine difference. The book of Mormon is not a bible. It is totally false copied human production. See errors of Mormonism.  The Bible has been translated into 100's of languages and many versions in English. English is a living language and changes over the years so there are language updates. The first printed Bibles were about 1600AD one being the King James. This was Shakespearean old English with different words and meanings to now. Some insist this is the only correct Bible because it was translated from the only correct early copies. New versions often put some texts into doubt. This is a very small problem. I like to have a Bible I can read easily. They all really say the same but in easier words except the NWT of the JW's who changed it to suit their errors. The message is really the same.   Now to your second question. I'll try to make it short. We really need to look at church history. Christians were thrown to the lions, burned on stakes until Constantine won a battle carrying a cross and declared Christianity the state religion just after 300AD. This started the decline in truth. Then it was an advantage to be Christian so unbelievers, pagans etc all joined. Over 1000 yrs later it was so corrupt that Luther a Roman Catholic priest read the Bible and started the reformation. He taught the Bible truth of Galatians 2:8-9, By grace are you saved --, it is a gift of God not of works least any one should boast. He taught that sins could be forgiven and could not be paid for or made up for. At this stage the RC church was selling indulgences(tickets) to have sins forgiven. A money making scheme. They sold Bishop areas to favourites or the highest bidder.These 100's of years are called the dark ages. The evil crusades were in this time too. The Christian religion had become a corrupt political organisation. Christians(Followers of Jesus) were separated from this and extremely persecuted. Luther and many others were persecuted and burned on stakes for haveng a Bible or translating it or teaching it. The reformers then had to establish the Bible doctrines and variations started because of emphasis on different texts. A few 100 yrs later now we have more human strange ideas added to or taken from the real Bible teaching to the extreme of some claimimg to be Christ.   The real message is that God creation was perfect. Adam and Eve chose to follow the evil deceptive god called Satan(a rebellious fallen angel). God promised a Saviour Messiah on the OT. His birth place, family, miracles and dying as a substitute to redeem sinners and resurrection were all prophesied. Jesus Christ is that person historically. Now if we accept Him we can be saved and know we have eternal life.   If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to  believe Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be  willing to turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word the  Bible and owning Him before others. May God bless you as you seek the TRUTH.  Hope this helps and isn't too long. nev r|`|F6ENoUMkaa	There is one earth and millions of different ideals, What gives?|`|jfEb0tIJaa	Marketing|`|lxQ8dLC5aa	The Bible leaves a lot of room for interpretation and therefore people have interpreted it differently.  This explains some of the difference.  A lot of the more modern differences come from people trying to make the Bible say what they believe or want to believe it says.  These people do not follow the Bible.   For example, the Bible is anti-homosexual and yet some churches say it is okay, when it is not.  These people are not following the Bible period.     Others also say that adultery is okay.  Again the Bible is very opposed to this behavior.

This leads to the existence of different denominations.  For example it seems to say both that we have a free choice whether to follow god or not, and also that it is predestined whether we will or not.  You could put those together and say god knows what free choice we will make, but there are denominations who say one and others who say the other.    There is also the matter of church government - some denominations believe bishops are necessary, others don't, still others believe that each congregation should govern itself and having a national organisation is unbiblical.

Two men sat up on the driver's seat, outside the enclosed coach. One needed all his attention to drive and control the horses. The other held a shotgun and had his eyes and hands free to see bandits approaching from far off and defend the stagecoach against attack.

It goes back to the days of stagecoaches.  There was a driver and a guard carrying a shotgun.  Both sat up front.  The driver drove the coach, while the person 'riding shotgun' acted as security.  He could watch out for potential dangers and provide protection from robbery and attacks on the stagecoach while allowing the driver to focus on maintaining control of the horses to get away from danger if possible.  Watch some old American western shows and you'll see what it means more clearly.|`|pFlkWQySaa	They mean an actual shot gun.  They mean riding beside the driver as a guard.

4fTiCNiKaa	According to the Bible, the power of prayer is, quite simply, the power of God, who hears and answers prayer.    1) The Lord God Almighty can do all things; there is nothing impossible for Him (Luke 1:37).    2) The Lord God Almighty invites His people to pray to Him. Prayer to God should be made persistently (Luke 18:1), with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6), in faith (James 1:5), within the will of God (Matthew 6:10), for the glory of God (John 14:13-14), and from a heart right with God (James 5:16).    3) The Lord God Almighty hears the prayers of His children. He commands us to pray, and He promises to listen when we do. In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears (Psalm 18:6).    4) The Lord God Almighty answers prayer. I call on you, O God, for you will answer me (Psalm 17:6). The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles (Psalm 34:17).    The power of prayer does not flow from usit is not special words we say or the special way we say them or even how often we say them. The power of prayer is not based on a certain direction we face or a certain position of our bodies. The power of prayer does not come from the use of artifacts or icons or candles or beads. The power of prayer is based on Who hears our prayer and answers it. Prayer places us in contact with Almighty God, and we should expect almighty results. The God to whom we pray is the source of all power, and He can and will answer us, according to His perfect will and timing.    God bless.    May all Christians prayer be...    "Give us revival Lord, ere we die!"    Elder Greg  ~SFECU~  pray4revival|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	Prayer is the power of God expressed on earth through his believers in Jesus Christ. The Bible verse of Luke 1:37, "...nothing is impossible with God." becomes an individual expression of prayer with the Bible verse at Phil. 4:13, "For I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength." That's the power of prayer.|`|DyY2Uj7maa	It moves the very heart of God , and when you really think on that it is a wondrous thing ...  ~Star~|`|l1ctIW7eaa	its as powerful as a placebo and can be damaging because it keeps someone from getting treatment...    that is real treatment that could actually help them|`|A01w1dHqaa	When aligned with the will of God, it has the infinite power of God.

There is no inherent power in faith. There IS power in God who answers our prayers which is why we should have faith in HIM.|`|AFDgHtZCaa	Sister the power of prayer is GOD.     As humans we are very limited but through the power of prayer(allowing Christ to work through us) we can do anything(providing it's in God's will).    A piece of wire by itself can do nothing. But connect that same piece of wire to a generator & a electrical gird and you will be able to light a entire city.    Likewise if you have a Christian connected to God, through prayer, then ANYTHING becomes possible.    Friends do you really "know" Christ, the source that all power comes from, as your Savior or do you just "know OF Him",    IF YOU DON'T KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR REPENT & BELIEVE IN HIM FOR SALVATION AS HE'S SOON COMING BACK!!!|`|6s6wGCzxaa	Jesus is the power of prayer as Jesus is our intercessor we are to go to Him in thanksgiving and in faith.|`|2b262d236b57238a4521e83f95a4b9feaa	In my opinion the power of prayer is in the one who hears the prayer.  God loves to work through us as we commune with Him in prayer.  The fact that God hears every prayer of those who follow Him and are born again of His Spirit is very powerful.  We have full and complete access to the creator of the universe.  Very powerful indeed!|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Paula,  Prayer is used to ask GOD for many things.  It is generally asked that HE assist those around us and those who are friends/neighbors.  It is used to thank HIM for the many blessings that HE gives to us.  It is used to ask HIS' Blessing of our food and goods that we receive from HIM.  Prayer is a conversation that GOD'S CHILDREN have with HIM.  Have a great week.  Thank You,  Eds  ------    .|`|vddPsXzIaa	Orthodox saint fathers have a special teaching of prayer. It's a very important and complicated thing. But when plain people in need address God with clear heart, very often they just feel that their prayer has been  heard. Real prayer needs to be clear of all everyday life impressions and thoughts. You just immerse yourself into God. If you remember all the time that this life is temporary, it helps a lot. If you are moving into the right direction, you gradually learn to "carry" the prayer in your heart. And when you master this skill, you get a feeling that God is always with you. God is generous, but he won't cast His gift to those, who are obsessed with secular life. And to experience what the power of real prayer is, normally they need to work a lot.    To one of the posts above I would say that we haven't got full acess to God because of our sins. We need to work to be heard (normally).
3oK5N9tIaa	You say that breathing slowly you can see these images?  Fascinating!  Read this article:  "I have always considered that the two questions  respecting God and the Soul were the chief of those that ought  to be demonstrated by philosophical rather than theological  argument.  For although it is quite enough for us faithful  ones to accept by means of faith the fact that the human soul  does not perish with the body, and that God exists, it  certainly does not seem possible ever to persuade infidels of  any religion, indeed, we may almost say, of any moral virtue,  unless, to begin with, we prove these two facts by means of  the natural reason.  And inasmuch as often in this life  greater rewards are offered for vice than for virtue, few  people would prefer the right to the useful, were they  restrained neither by the fear of God nor the expectation of  another life; and although it is absolutely true that we must  believe that there is a God, because we are so taught in the  Holy Scriptures, and, on the other hand, that we must believe  the Holy Scriptures because they come from God (the reason of  this is, that, faith being a gift of God, He who gives the  grace to cause us to believe other things can likewise give it  to cause us to believe that He exists), we nevertheless could  not place this argument before infidels, who might accuse us  of reasoning in a circle.  And as regards the soul, although many have considered  that it is not easy to know its nature, and some have even  dared to say that human reasons have convinced us that it  would perish with the body, and that faith alone could believe  the contrary, nevertheless, inasmuch as the Lateran Council  held under Leo X (in the eighth session) condemns these  tenets, and as Leo expressly ordains Christian philosophers to  refute their arguments and to employ all their powers in  making known the truth, I have ventured in this treatise to  undertake the same task."  God can talk to us by our meditation. We open the door to Him and  He can show part of His creation, like yours (Aurora Borealis).  Lights  you see, are heaven lights in my point of vue.  Just a question: Does it happen very often?  Did you ever try to close your eyes and have the lights embrace you?  Try to do it! You'll feel God in you.  It's an amazing experience!

What's your object of meditation?    Some objects of meditation have what are called "nimitta," or signs.  These are mental phenomena and are usually a precursor to full absorption (or jhana).  In most cases, they are extremely simple (like a ball of light), and they tend toward being white or transparent. They are very common in breath meditation.  But without knowing your method of meditation, it's hard to say more than that.    EDIT--Breath meditation is specifically the style that uses a light nimitta.  My advice, if you're interested, is this.  The mutli-colored lights are an indication that your mind is still too complex.  Let go more, and it should settle down and stabilize into a white light.  Once this happens, stick to the center of the nimitta.  Don't worry about shapes and edges and what-not.  Just stick to the center, and you should go right into jhana before long.|`|UV6osJh8aa	I was doing a neo-Taoist contemplation on the concept of self awareness, and as I did so, I become aware of my own radiance.

HZqi9XyJaa	They shouldn't.    Pork is still unclean. It is an extremely filthy, unhealthy animal to eat.     The distinction of clean and unclean foods were made all the way back in the book of Genesis with Noah, before Jews. So these food laws were meant for everyone. And they were never changed.... People have thought it is now ok to eat because of misinterpretation of scripture....    The verse where it says not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man, but that which comes out of the mouth,this defiles a man has nothing to do with unclean foods, if people read the entire section in context the Pharisees were telling them they were defiled because they did not wash their hands before breaking bread.    The verses in Acts where Peter see's a sheet come down showing unclean animals and saying they are clean isn't literal. If they read further it explains those verses, it actually says it wasn't talking about the animals literally, it was talking about the Gentiles (who were originally considered unclean). Once Stephen was stoned the Gospel was taken to the Gentiles. God was telling Peter that they are no longer to be considered unclean anymore. It refers to PEOPLE, not animals. The animals in the vision were just used as an example.    The verse that says everything God has created is good, and no food is to 'be rejected, provided if is received with thanksgiving: the word of God and prayer make it holy.... By examining this passage in its overall context, Paul was countering a false teaching by saying that it is permissible to eat animal flesh as long as the meats were approved in the word of God. Paul was addressing the subject of enforced vegetarianism, not the subject of "unclean meats."     Pork is still an unhealthy, unclean animal. God didn't change the animal and he didn't just change His mind about them.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	They are not Jewish and it is good!

41ac7d9d52a54e7a6b648bd7d6d7d8ffaa	The capitals were the identity of tribes to discern their     duties to the league of Centurions.  After the earliest ancient     pharoahs were major sheperd farms, the centers of culture     became indentured slavers.  At that time the revolters to     order got into the flow of civilizing workers.  This juvenile     area rapidly devored the civil farms because it was still     natural to have soldiering as a way of survival and trades.     The askumite were thought to be one of the cities of Axum      that ruled for a few centuries with the better livestocks.  In      this area the promised land looked so far in the future yet      rich in minerals that China, India, and other major tribes      of different evolution came to trade.

vEEeq7kYaa	If a Christian converts to Judaism, this means that the Jew inside them recognized the reality that Jesus never had that ability in the first place, to give eternal life.  They're no longer a Christian after they convert to Judaism.  They're Jewish.    Just as a Jew would be a Christian and  not be Jewish any longer if they converted to Christianity.    Judaism is based on monotheism.  Pure monotheism.  Not belief in demi-gods or man/gods.  Those notions are in fact condemned in many places in the Torah. Two of the narratives in Tanakh that are all about condemning the notion of humans as deities are cherry picked out ot context to try to impose a concept of a fallen-angel devil ( that isn't existent in Tanakh)in the Christian NT.      The prophetic vision of a Davidic messiah ( anointed ruler) is not of a divine entity that pardons sin etc..but of a very human king who does specific jobs.    The Christian concept that a savior man/god or demi-god metes out eternal life is incompatible with Jewish belief.      It is Christians that believe that Jesus does this, Jews do not and have no concern of worship of a Jew.  Worship of or through a Jew is a violation of the Torah to do.    it is a matter of belief whether or not that is real..but since the person recognizes that there is only one God who is one, they're not going to be concerned about Jesus.  Christian doctrine is as insignificant to the Jewish religion as the Quran is to Christianity.    The Christian concept that before Jesus, God was exclusively for the Jews, has ALWAYS been foreign to Jewish belief. The book of Kings records Gentiles worshipping at the Temple , Torah teaches that every human can directly connect to God and the righteous of all nations are blessed. It is Christianity that has as a part of it's dogma that one must be Christian to connect to God, not vice versa.    Jews are obligated to participate in repairing the world by participating in tzedakah (justice and righteousness) and g'milut hasadim (acts of loving kindness). As the prophet Micah so succinctly stated : What does God require of you, Do justly, love mercy and walk humbly with your God. Practice living as if you are in partnership with God in perfecting the world and then one day you'll understand that is exactly what you were doing|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: no since they are now covered under the original and ETERNAL covenant.

You will get yourself tossed into the lake of fire with all the other infidels.|`|wrw92W0Taa	If you are close to God, that is all that matters, he doese not care whatsoever what religion you choose as long as you love and believe in him. There is no such thing as one religion that puts you in heaven, and just because you go to church and you sing a song about him that doese not always mean that you will go to heaven. Church and religion was man made, God just wants you to believe in him. So believe and try not to put a name on what you believe or how much you love him :)|`|RZ44Vz8Saa	Were they ever truly a Christian?  I would say not.  Jesus does not take back eternal life, it is forever promised to us because nothing at that point can separate us from the Lord.  Those that turn away, were never truly among us.      No one can pluck us from His hand.    John 10:27-29  Romans 8:35-39  Ephesians 1:13-14|`|hiOeQZVsaa	I thought God loved everyone?    So God only loves Christians?|`|dm8aBiIVaa	If God judges people on wanting to learn beyond themselves then that's fairly weird. He see's the truth in others, hopefully he's not judge mental as to disregard somebody for a simple mistake. Unless that's what gets him off. Who knows, good question though.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	If the person is now Jew, he really doesn't care what Jesus said about eternal life because we don't believe in all that in the first place.    Just stating a fact, not meant to offend anyone or their respective religion.    And NO, Jews don't believe Jesus never existed or was a liar.  Tuck in your agendas and leave these questions to actual Jews, not haters spewing falsities.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	What's to take back...all the acceptance is on our side.

They are designed to stimulate study or conversation, as they include review questions near the text & Scripture references.    Together, they have 19 Sections / 77 Chapters, that cover as many youth-related issues.  They are based on an on-going series of articles, several of which have been posted on-line > Here is a list of --& links to-- those (34 so far) :  http://watchtower.org/e/archives/index.h...    The first volume should be easy to get, the second just came out last year, & its distribution may not be in full gear yet.  That one is designed as a work-book, as well.    Besides the issues being discussed from the Bible's viewpoint, actual experiences are included, as well.  These books have already 'sparked' many young one's lives.  I know of one lad in particular who was suicidal, and took up a serious study of the Bible after studying this book.  With further study, he became a minister, & is now learning  a trade to support himself in his ministry.  http://watchtower.org/e/20021201/    What Kind of Education Can Make Your Life a Success?  - Benefit From the Best Education Available    http://watchtower.org/e/20051015/article...|`|AA10043552	How about...

After reading about him I no longer question. The first time Bobby tried to kill himself was far before he ever came out. This tells me he had other mental health issues going on. I feel very sorry for his mother that she got brainwashed by the homosexual agenda, but bottom line is Bobby made a choice. I may not have been a good choice but it was his choice. He did not kill himself because he was brainwashed by the church that his lifestyle was a sinful choice, he kill himself because he bought into the homosexual agenda that his lifestyle was not a choice and he couldn't handle the consequences.|`|84nXWNT3aa	I saw the trailer and started crying.

8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	Okay i will take the bait.    Belief in God is like belief in other axiom, such as the fundamental axioms of Mathematics. All logical systems of thought require a set of basic axioms. While you can choose to reject certain axioms and thus open up whole new lines of thought. Like non-Euclidean geometry, which rejects Euclid's 5th axiom. (If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.) Logical thought still requires a basic set of axioms to act as the foundation.    Thus while you can live a long and serendipitous life without defining the square root of minus one. I amongst other do choose to define the square root of minus one. In the same way using a 'God' type axiom allows certain lines of thinking and confidence in discovering solutions to problems. A rejection of the axiom of 'God's existence' is not wrong but does lead to a different form of Logic since it has an alternative axiom basis.    So to me, i get to accept (or at least believe) there is an objective reality beyond the sum total of subjective perceptions. And while i may be constrained by my own subjective experiences there are ways to transcend this and observe the universal objective reality that binds us all together.    Obviously this only applies to a Vedic notion of God and not to the Abrahamic or Taoistic notions of God.    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn5DLp8y3t...    _()_|`|d76540548b78851b2b0db3441e66ae54aa	42|`|MuK6HIKoaa	To go to Heaven.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	You get to have a relationship with your creator, and you get infinitie wisdom on how to live the best life possible :)    Not to mention that you get to be with him forever in the afterlife :)|`|3BrOSZujaa	You  beleive in him, then when he destroys everything he will replenish the earth and give those who beleive the gift of eternal life we shall be reborn.

fqLo4HvKaa	That applies only in the reality-based world. In the world of invisible supernatural supreme beings there is only divine truth. So, all knowledge that challenges divine truth is by definition false and, therefore also by definition, evil.    That is the reason for the Dark Ages - a 1,000 period where political power was religious rule; where all knowledge of the great ancient civilizations was destroyed; and the pursuit of non-Biblical knowledge was a crime punishable by torture and death.    Imagine what the world might be like today if the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions of the late 19th century had occurred during the 7th century. The only thing that changed was the emergence of secular government and the law of man and the decline of theocratic government and God's law.     It is not as if the ability for scientific thought biologically evolved from being nonexistent in  AD 800 to being fully developed by AD 1800. Christianity, alone, is responsible for retarding human development during that time.|`|cNniG2L0aa	I think it's the only time bibel awthors included something they had no idea about; it was all to do with something enlightening.  ~|`|lRNAlYyXaa	Because it is a fictional, and ill thought out fairy tale.|`|AA11994957	It's called obedience.    He gave a simple choice - you can eat of ALL the other trees or be disobedient and seek the one thing we were told not to have.

Proof that knowledge only puffs up.|`|4oDn5zIpaa	because even though the bible says it was appealing to the eye... but the tree of knowledge was not thing of math or science or anything of that matter. But when adam and eve ate from the tree they realized their bodies were naked. the tree of knowledge took away their innocence and introduced bad and sinfull things into their mind. God did not want them to sin i do not know how to explain it well maybe some time go to chuch and ask your pastor. i am sure he would be glad to answer it better than i can explain it but eve also disobeyed God witch is a sin    Also the opposite of evil is not knowledge god wanted only knowledge of him knowledge takes away innocence and introduces evil because with knowledge is curiostity.  Also god gave them knowledge god. Have you heard of pandoras box the mythologial story it is the same concept they new of things. God did not want them to be stupid but adam and eve only knew of God witch is good and he was able to speak to them a lead them.  ALSO ANOTHER BIG THING IN THE BIBLE IT DOES NOT SAY IT WAS AND APPLE IT SAY IT WAS FRUIT APPEALING TO THE EYE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT|`|TfR6fBL5aa	Mmmm.. Read genesis:3  It will answer all your ???s  But just in case...  well befor eve was tricked into eating from the tree of knowlege  There was no pain..course there was the devil but besides that...when she ate the fruit she then became aware she was nude so god punished her by leting her feel pain witch means know girls can feel pain when having kids...  :(that sucks:)  Genesis3:13-16  "then the lord god said to the woman what have you done?  The woman said the serpent tricked me that's why I eat the fruit  14.  So the lord god spoke to the serpent he said becouse you have done this   I am Putin a curse on you   You are cursed more then all the livestock  And all of the wild animals you will crawl on the ground.you will eat dust all the days of your life   15  I will hatred between you and the woman. Your children and her children will be enimies  Her son will crush your head and you will crush his heal.  16  The lord god said  "I will greatly increase your pain when you give birth. You will be in pain when you have children   You will long for your husband and he will rule over you..    Hope this helps:)|`|tWWqqM8Zaa	His good point was not to let us eat from the tree.

First time we turn our back, the child will eat a cookie.    The Tree of Life is a metaphor; but I think God actually WANTED Adam and Eve to eat the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge because God knew that was the only way that Adam and Eve could become truly *human* -- and being truly human, they would experience joy and pain, they would want to explore their environment, they would ask why things work and why things are the way they are, they would love and know the joy and pain which comes with loving, they would yearn to create things, etc.    Essentially, God told Adam and Eve not to eat those delicious, warm cookies knowing that the first time God turned His back, they'd be right over at the plate eating cookies!    Had they NOT eaten the fruit, we would have not had a desire for knowledge, to take risks, to create things, to have longings and to appreciate getting something we'd always wanted, to love (and to grieve when that love ends, either by death or end of a relationship) -- humans would basically be fat, lazy automatons in the Tree of Life but not the thinking individuals we are today who have the ability to choose good -- and evil.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	All make believe if you ask me|`|SGSl5yeAaa	It isn't just the "Tree of Knowledge," it's the "Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil."  God knew if we knew about evil, we wouldn't be able to keep away from it.    Atheists always try to point out that "Oh God didn't want humans to have knowledge!"  Freakin' misleading people all the time.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Yes, up to a point. What knowledge creates is freedom. The full name of the Tree is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. So eating from the tree gave Adam and Eve the freedom to know (and commit) evil, and good as well. With the Fall, Adam and Eve became morally conscious beings. They acquired the kind of free-will that Christians talk about when atheists ask us: "why is there so much evil in the world?"|`|GrKiEDb1aa	The tree was the Tree of the KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL.  Sin didn't exist at that time and if Adam took from that tree, he'd know evil.  Adam was sinless.  God wanted Adam to obey, but God gave the freedom to choose. Without choice, Adam would have been like a prisoner, and his obedience would have been hollow.  The tree provided an exercise in choice, with rewards for choosing to obey and sad consequences for choosing to disobey.  When we're faced with the choice, we should always choose to obey God.  And where do you get an APPLE?  There's nothing in the Bible (Genesis 2 and 3) that refers to any APPLE.  It says FRUIT.  You'd have known that if you studied the Bible instead of TRYING to make fun of it.  Biblical ignorance is a funny thing to see in those people like you who TRY to put Christians down with your supposed biblical knowledge.  You lose, hoss.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	we were better off not knowing about evil.|`|FDsopi1Taa	It was the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. NOT the Tree of Knowledge.geesh|`|T5ztIAZbaa	Your very premise is off.  You can't just state that Evil is the lack of knowledge.  A lot of people know a whole lot about Evolution and such, and have led them to believe in eugenics, since we are only animals, after all.      This is simply not the case in every scenario.    The Tree of Knowledge was there to give a choice to Adam and Eve.  What good is free will without a choice?  If the only choice that they had was to do good things, is that really free will?|`|k03dYskYaa	The mere ability to recognize right and wrong most certainly cannot be meant, for obedience to Gods command required of sinless man that he be able to exercise such moral discrimination. Nor could the knowledge attained upon reaching maturity be meant, for it would not be sin on mans part to reach this state, nor would his Creator logically obligate him to remain in an immature state.    As to the genus of the tree, the Scriptural record is silent. But it becomes apparent that the tree of the knowledge of good and bad symbolized the divine right or prerogative, which mans Creator retains, to designate to his creatures what is good and what is bad, thereafter properly requiring the practice of that which is declared good and the abstention from that which is pronounced bad in order to remain approved by God as Sovereign Ruler.  Both the prohibition and the subsequent pronouncement of the sentence passed upon the disobedient pair emphasize the fact that it was the act of disobedience in eating the prohibited fruit that constituted the original sin.Ge 3:3.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	for the 100th time, it was the tree of "the knowlege of good and evil"    not knowlege.    Specifically the knowledge of good and evil.  Don't be sloppy with your thinking.    It has nothing to do with education or advancement, or thinking skills - it has to do with making moral decisions for yourself.  We were never meant to take on the burden of trying to evaluate right and wrong ourselves, we were to simply trust God and do what was right, not distrust him and think we knew better.|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	Knowledge of Good and Evil.    Prior to that, there was only a knowledge of Good.  There was no evil.  God wanted to save us from that heartache.    Still, he planted the tree there because truest love has to give people an opportunity to reject that love...as well as embracing it.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	The opposite of evil is knowledge. How stupid...All angelic intellects including demons are way more knowledgeable than the most knowledgeable ( == GOOD ?) human.    How stupid and philosophically juvenile.     Knowledge leads to good !!! Laughable -- and if you really have read the Bible and not just cut-and-pasted again off the Infidels site, why didn't you mention this :    1 Corinthians 8:1  "Knowledge  makes arrogant, but love  edifies. "    Ironically, I have proven you are ignorant AND -- with strong probability -- evil.     Even Plato would condemn you :  False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.      Plato, Dialogues, Phaedo|`|A01w1dHqaa	The problem is in seeing life as good or evil. You are right that when you truly learn the light shines away the darkness or absence of good.  Sin is lack of love. With God there is no lack.    The fruit was that evil exists. It doesn't, just like darkness or lack doesn't exist. By listening to God we return to light. We wouldn't have had to go through this if we hadn't turned away. But it's all like water over the dam when truth comes.    We were created with and in love. Adam and Eve is a metaphor for all of us, but not totally accurate. We are not our bodies, we are more than ancient.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	because it makes you discover truth and knowledge is truth so knowledge equals evil|`|84nXWNT3aa	Wow, dude. We should impeach God and put you in office.    You're way smarter than him.|`|i48kxrbaaa	Knowledge is not neccesairly all good.  It created hatred, wars, violence...ect...|`|7mhRDbvsaa	its a fairy tale duh!!!     its like fariy tale stories or tv shows...they say don't do this or else and then the characters obvious don't listen and do it and they get in trouble|`|XEcDuMYZaa	It is not an actual tree    It stands for something evil|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	The opposite of evil is not knowledge.    "One doesn't get born with empathy" is there a source for this because i doubt it.|`|UBYu08bOaa	No one said that knowledge of all things was a good thing.|`|4IYKRhxIaa	first of all, evil is not the opposite of knowledge. God is. your statement "Evil is not the absence of good, it's the absence of the knowledge of good" is wrong as well. knowledge does not always lead to good. ok. now to your question-God was testing adam and eve to see if they would obey him by not eating off the tree like he told them not to. so there is your reason.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Knowledge isn't the opposite of evil...    I know that it's good to be racially tolerant, but that doesn't stop me from acting against it.. (I'm not racist BTW)|`|bDrtrlV0aa	Ever told a young-ish kid not to (insert text here)?  Ever noticed the reaction?  The tree of "Knowledge of Good and Evil" implies that evil will be part of that knowledge too. And the sad thing about humans, is that we're drawn towards doing things we're not supposed to?  So Adam and Eve eating from the Tree of Knowledge, finding out about evil, would have enabled them to do said evil.    Hope that works. :P|`|AA11992885	so you think    you think evil has an opposite other then "good"  and what is good and evil?  i am not asking you what YOU THINK good and evil are.......everyone thinks they know the difference between good and evil    you have already layed claim to evil being ignorance and good being knowledgeability.........but from what do you base that on?    there are many HIGHLY knowledgeable people who are very evil    you lay claims to the differences between good and evil that are based on nothing more then your liking or disliking of something    i say, where there is no knowledge, there can be no evil............to be punished for something where a person is ignorant of what they are being punished for is tyranny    if i commit an act, but did not know that it was wrong, to be punished for it is wrong    sure, you might think of the idea of an extreme like killing, but i lay claim to the insignificant concepts, like preaching one belief over another, in many countries, you will find that it is illegal, you are not allowed to preach anything other then the accepted religion of the country, and if you do, you are liable for deportation or even execution    where there is no knowledge of something being wrong, there can be no wrong being done, BUT ONLY if the person is truely and completely ignorant of it being wrong|`|hIaBgCrgaa	WoW way off  First of all Evil knows what is right and chooses to reject Jah Way    Second the story of the tree dates back 5000 years bc to the Sumerians who told the story correctly.    Enlil (God) wanted to raise Adam by giving him the tree The Devil told Adam not to saying it will kill you. Adam did not trust God and betrayed himself. The tree is the magic mushroom or manna and gives one knowledge of good and evil.    The bible "borrowed" the story and changed it like many other things they conveniently did.    Its ok because Gods plan is to raise up his people anyway and since he is God it will happen. And the lesson  will be learn t.    thats my take on it.|`|dL82oSHTaa	First of all who said it was an apple? 2nd it wasn't about knowledge God gave them plenty. The whole lessen was about obeying God.  You have about 1,000 trees to eat from (just guessing) and God said you can't eat from this one. Why would the fruit make you smarter any way?     It comes down  to obedience, just like now when people say it don't matter what day we go to church, when the 4th commandment says remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.    And we our supposed to be Christan's and follow Jesus, well Jesus was a Jew and kept the 7th sat. holy all his life and the catholic Church comes in and changes the day from sat to sun the 1st day of the week and people thing they are following God your following the catholic church Daniel 7 :25 they shall think to change Gods times and laws.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	I don't think that God ever intended Adam and Eve to stay in Eden forever. The Tree Of Knowledge Of Good/Evil was meant to show them the difference between obedience and disobedience. Evil was already in the world and they were going to have to face it eventually, so God used the tree as an example. There was no special power in the fruit of the tree, it was the act of disobedience that had the power.     I don't know if that made any sense, but that's the way I see it. God loved Adam and Eve, and because He did He gave them free will, as He does with all of us.

And you will not go to hell for it. I have started a site to help explain God's plan for us. It may help you. In short, they are just another "version" of modern Christianity. And while some may be cults, and suspect this one might be, they are more interested in volume and money than they are "Saving" people.     Eternal hell is a concept derived from Roman Paganism and championed by the early "Roman" Church. This idea was contrary to the first Christians ideas but Rome had the power to push this doctrine through with fear, money and war. It is a "scare" tactic and worked well. The truth is that while there is a literal hell, it's not what most believe. Trust me that if you keep an open mind and know how to love you will never see hell.     I'm sorry I can't put all of the explanation here, but to undo 2000 years of mistranslation and mysticism would take a lot of space. If you need more please ask me at http:// jesus-christ-church.co.cc I would love to explain further.    Rev Todd
fEkKuGlEaa	CS Lewis made an argument for that, especially in worship. He felt that evil deeds and thoughts, even done in the name of Christ, were actually worship attributed to Satan, for Christ can neither accept nor acknowledge evil.     Likewise, all that is good and pure, even if not directed toward Christ, is Christ's rightful due and (if you want to call it this) "marked in the God column." (my phrase, not Lewis's.)|`|Lol0iLfgaa	No actually.    If you are a good person but don't believe in Jesus, you will still go to hell.  That is due to Christian's belief in Original Sin.  Remember the whole Eve and the apple thing?  I guess God is still mad about it.    This means that even if you do good, you aren't obeying God.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Yes, kind of, in a way ... but it's like saying milk come from the store.  It's true, but it's not the bottom line.    Goodness is acting in the loving best interest of the people around you.  Evil is acting selfishly and/or hurtfully.    It just so happens that acting in the loving best interest of your neighbor is obeying God.  :)|`|DArAz67Caa	all good comes from God----God is love---|`|HqrU9RJOaa	Yessir!!|`|iblT1HJpaa	In a fashion.   "Goodness" is one of the attributes of God's character that has been instilled within us as described in Genesis 1 and 2. "Let us create man in our image..." Goodness is part of that image. And that can be broken down further into Moral Purity (Holiness, Righteousness & Justice), Integrity (Genuineness, Veracity & Faithfulness) and Love (Benevolence, Grace, Mercy & Persistence) of which each one can be broken down even further.   You know of love. See 1 Cor 13 - Paul's essence of what love is and should be. We hear it at every other wedding.     For me, "badness" would be NOT doing any of the above for then we would not be showing God's character to the world, but satan's.|`|9GuqdXa2aa	Goodness and badness don't really count Spiritually speaking. The Bible says, "All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God". To go to Heaven, you need to be sin-free. NO BODY can do this. Therefore we are all "bad". What counts in the spiritual world is forgiven or not. "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord"- The only way to be forgiven is to accept the payment that Jesus paid with His death on the cross as payment for our sins. With our sins paid for, we can go to Heaven - sin free.Good and bad are words people use to judge each other- which is clearly not something the Bible encourages.|`|U51pBeLfaa	Exactly. If a disobedient person realises that they have been bad they may be forgiven if they exercise their faith in God. If they exercise their faith I would expect to see repentance and restitution and obedience to God. I belong to the group that believes it is faith that saves people not the obedience. God wants obedience not sacrifice. People who think they are beyond redemption should not give up and sacrifice themselves. I believe God is a very forgiving God. However someone who thinks they can be bad all their life, say the magical words and repent on their deathbed; has missed the point.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	Kind of an Occam's Razor approach to the ontology of theism, isn't it?    P.S.  What if being bad makes me feel so good?|`|f3nwI8ytaa	No.  Goodness is being like God.  Badness is being unlike Him.    peace|`|T5ztIAZbaa	Uh...Sorta..    Everything that we do to obey God is good, and everything we do to disobey God is bad.     But goodness is God and what comes from God, not obeying God.
mU2eMSi3aa	I agree with him, I think most religious people know nothing about God and a good atheist is much better off.      I've always been into religion even the couple years I got sick of it and was angry with God I was studying Buddhism but I love religious humor of all sorts.    Celebrities like Jon Stewart, Lewis Black, Stephen Colbert, George Carlin all kill me with their religious logic and wit and I could see myself similar to their views.  I will often seek out just jokes about religion like Sam Kinison is hilarious, Dane Cook is Christian but still hilarious to me.

b77af9f788ecbbd1984a5e2166b0d0ceaa	Those are cross references to other scripture(s).    Example:      The word kingdom with (j) in Matt 24:14, now look to the middle for ch 24, scan down to "j" it should give you scriptures Dan 2:44; Matt 6:10; Matt 10:7.|`|acba053766e5c7bbc265d96563d212cfaa	Cross references for further research in your personal studies. My2Cents summed it up well.|`|qKSn0AVsaa	Yeah sure. These are comparative scriptures. If you look the first verse of Genesis goes on to explain the Earths beginnings. If you then look at the scripture cited in the central column it says (a) Heb 1:10 where it mentions The beginning It is there for us to compare and see the similar thoughts and reiterations. Notice also the corresponding letters within the verse according to those in the column.    Its there to aid studying of the Bible.|`|MJg0QjQsaa	Those are cross references to other scriptures in the Bible - scriptures that references a word or phrase. My2Cents explained it very well.    You can usually find the context of a particular scripture by following those cross reference points.     If you look at John 3:15 it says, "that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life" and it cross references the letter 'N'. When you look at the scriptures to letter 'N' - Matthew 7:29, and John 7:46 has more information about everlasting life.     Now, when you read John 3:16 and you see what it says about everlasting life there is another cross reference there to even more scriptures in the Bible about everlasting life, many of them are Jesus' teachings.

Or  2-be satisfied with your own judgment that the engagement needs to be broken off, and work on a plan to to sit down with him face to face and tell him of your decision that you don't wish to stay in the relationship, either saying for you own reasons, or simply tell him why.  Or  3-take some time off and postpone any decisions for now till you get more hints that will help you figure out what you want.

vEEeq7kYaa	This Jewish person's explanation for that:  You've posted a link to a site that perverts Talmud and Judaism in attempt to proselytize to Jews.   That's the short explanation.  It's a common thing done here in Y/A, too.    I'm not usually known for short explanations when people go to great lengths to deceive Jews with little knowledge of their religion or heritage...Yes, we do have those, and for some reason, many evangelical Christians operate as if they assume they win extra brownie points in heaven if they convert a Jew, rather than working toward making this world a better place for all living.    .After Jesus death, Jews and Gentiles continued to pray and connect directly to God and offer sacrifices for appropriate sins uninterrupted until well over a generation after the year(s) ( not all christians agree what year) when this event is said to have taken place. These things most certainly did *not* cease when Jesus died, but when the Romans sacked the Temple in 70CE and not before. Sacrifice was only for unintentional sin and animal sacrifice was for even a narrower range of sins still.     In addition, no historic writing of either Roman or Jew *contemporary to the events from within an entire generation* attests to the Gospel's claim that there was such a catastrophic earthquake, nor did Jews or Romans write anywhere contemporary with the supposed event of any astonishing sights of seeing dead saints rise from their graves that were all supposedly torn open by that quake and walk among them as the next verses read in Matthew.    I am Jewish and I have read the book of Matthew as well as the rest of the New Testament, so that I could better understand what it is Christians believe based on their New Testament. It is not a holy text to my religion and the events it depicts are insignificant to the Jewish religion. It is also apparent that any events that took place during the time of Jesus death did not affect normal activities and prayer at the Temple nor was there interruption of sacrifice mentioned in the writings of the scribes of the day.( except for the Temple treasury being raided in 66CE by the Roman governor of Judea, Florius and a massacre of Jews in Jerusalem then),..there is no reason to suspect a cover up. Jewish history has always recorded the good with the bad, the stories of the good Jews and the bad Jews, warts and all. Also it is interesting to note that the Synoptic Gospels do not mention an earthquake, but that the sky darkened for 3 days, also events not recorded any *contemporary* Romans or the Jewish people.  Christian accounts on this event are not even congruent with one another!    I have read other Christian apologetic, besides this one that tries to say the Talmud refers to it and points to Rabbi Yohanan B. Zakkai in the Talmud telling of the large doors behind the veil opening by themselves until he closed them with words telling the them , Hekel, Hekel, why alarmist thou us? We know that thou art destined to be destroyed... Nevertheless, there is no mention of earthquake or veil being torn, OR of the graves opening with the astonishing event of the dead walking the earth. If those events had transpired, why would doors opening be more significant to record than the dead walking the earth would?   I only address one of those perversions of Talmud because I reocgnize readily that the site is only an attempt to retrofit the passages of Matthew into them, and they require on a great amount of perversion of Talmud.  I'll be back with some references to keep those busy who want to find out just how awful an attempt it is.    Those were years of the Sadducee collaborations with Rome, attempts of Hellenized apostates and Romanized apostates and Gentiles trying to bring pagan sacrifices back to the Temple as had sporadically been going on for several centuries ( as Ezekiel condemned for example, the sunrise worship of Tammuz who was born a virgin and was "resurrected" each spring..look up Ezekiel's condemnation of that)    Every time Jews had come to adopt foreign gods or practice that was forbidden by Torah precept, calamity befell the Jewish people, and Tanakh illustrates this often happened at the very hands of the people whose beliefs they had abandoned Torah to follow.. It is a chilling indictment that just as a dead Jewish man was being turned into an object of worship that the very people who were promoting and adopting this man/god worship were soon to destroy the Temple and exile the Jews once again.    This lesson was not lost on the Jewish people, and thus, in the Diaspora the men of the Great Assembly set about means to preserve intact the covenant of faith of Israel without the Temple as it had been in the days of the destruction of the First Temple. Judaism was here before First and Second Temples and it is still thriving today. As Torah teaches, sincere repentance, doing one's best to make amends and seek pardon from the one offended, not repeating the offence and asking God directly to forgive, are still the ways to achieve forgiveness of sins as they were long before the Temple (see story of Job, see Deuteronomy, Kings etc for instances of these things and others referenced at web site below)    Lastly, the New Testament is the Holy Scriptures for the Christian religion and insignificant to Jewish beliefs. You did not appear to be seeking knowledge (I tried to address this from a knowledge standpoint) Instead, you seek opinion from adherents of Judaism about a belief system that is not compatible with Judaism, that of a human sacrifice to atone for sin.   To summarize:   My explanation for this question is that this is a feeble attempt to proselytize to any knowledgable Jew, but it is a dubious endeavor, nonetheless.    As to why the ribbon didn't turn white..Tovia Singer covered that Christian apologetic attempt in full a couple of years ago..see link |`|38vza5Gxaa	What is the "Messianic" explanation for this:  Jesus never fulfilled ONE of the actual prophecies.  That the Jewish messiah is to be human, not divine?  That the messiah will NOT be worshipped?  Or that everything about Jesus proved that he wasn't he Jewish Messiah?    answer: try reading the Tanakh and talk with actual rabbis about what is contained in the Talmud instead of listening to Christian 'scholars'|`|AA11245447	It's not a Jewish website; check out the names of the holidays - Jews would NEVER name our holidays things like "Trumpet" and "Pentacost".

Get your self an In/Out box, and put important work that has a deadline in that, and what's completed in the out box.      As for everything else, go through the area with a trash bag and throw out anything that you know you won't need in the future.

I am a huge procrastinator as well. To be organized in school I used to use one of those trapper keepers that everyone uses until maybe 5th grade. It worked well for me because I used to not bring home either my assignment notebook or my homework because I would forget to write things down or misplace a worksheet. Maybe instead get one of those 5 subject notebooks with pockets from 5 Star. Those are really great, and that's what I upgraded to for college.    For getting organized in life, either get a notebook or a pad of paper that you can write reminders to yourself with. At the beginning of the week I write all that I need to do. Then as I go, cross off what I've finished. It's a visual representation of what you should be going through in your head as well. It will teach you to remember to get things done and maybe make you not procrastinate as much. Not sure what motivates your procrastination, but for me, it's getting overwhelmed with too much to do that I forget what I need to get done and just put it off until I think about it again or when it's already too late.If you have to, get post its and post them all around to remind you to get things done.

They could discuss the reasons that religion doesn't make sense to them as individuals with others as this might be an outlet for them to share similar viewpoints with others especially if they come from religious families where such topics might cause a problem or be seen as disrespectful.  They could also discuss the benefits of a secular government and ways to safeguard or create such. They could do community projects together since they don't have religious groups they would belong to that engage in this. Or like some religious groups they could also engage in purely social activities with likeminded peers.

Only people who know about this understand but you have to lock everything up or they will rob you no matter how much they love you so you have to learn to protect yourself....I am giving examples since I don't know what happened but whatever it is there is a lesson that is going to make your life better...you than have to decide if you want to caring your bad feeling or leave them.

All "travelers" experiences both joyful and "ill" experiences while journeying through life.  Sometimes paths are crossed with "bullies".    Observe, mourn, heal, learn from it. Transform experience into "gifts" of lessons . . .release . . .breath . . .move forward.  That's a gift to give yourself . . .To be a peace . . .To celebrate and embrace life in spite of "glitchy" experiences.    Forgive person who "wronged" you.  The "wrong" experience belongs with them...not to person wronged.    Forgiving does not mean you like them or need to be around them.  Simply, forgive the being of the person and release the "hurt" out of you.    Have experienced several "ill" experiences in life.  What I noted above is what feels loving, peaceful, strong and right for me and others around me who share in my life.

5MLPuTdqaa	I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anywhere. Events led me to this place. There's more to it, or less. I still don't know. I'm wasting time here. There's nothing here to gain from. Sometimes I'm surprised at the things people think or believe. Other times I'm disgusted. Then I don't know what to be. People are doing things and living out their lives, for what purpose I can't often discern. Why do we act as we do? I think it may be a psychological curiosity. Then there is the matter of what's "actually true." The absolute truth will never be had, but I continue to be amazed as one way of seeing things comes over another. Are they truths or are they just useful tricks to carry us along in this life? The fact that I can ask such a question seems astounding or is it just another trick? I know my thoughts seem like those of a child to someone else whose intelligence greatly exceeds mine but I still get to wonder and experience nonetheless. Is that experience of wonder universal? Does the man who sees more clearly have a greater sense of wonder?    Again, I don't know why I'm here. I should be doing other things.

AA11296212	You were lucky to be one of a dozen siblings, Suzie.  In a family that large, there is no avoiding hurting one another for very long.  In today's society, too many children in smaller families grow up believing they have a sense of entitlement, and therefore, exempt from apologizing to those they hurt.  Also, parents don't always demand civility, and finally the media portray a constant rudeness and mean spirited undertone in most programs.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Define mean things.

We are better people !|`|UOybpxsfaa	They have a sad life and they know no better as that is how they have been and will be all there lives|`|JQChBFQzaa	Usually if someone can't apologise or admit that they're wrong its because they're too proud, full of them self or arrogant.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	OK now what did I do?

Now for her I am sorry.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	You are spot on Suzie..My sister and her children are that way...  She makes up excuses for their Rude behavior Her kids are now 18 and 16.

People Get respect from my family until deemed not worthy.

Indeed I would be horrified if anyone ever said I was mean to them.   I accept that I am human, I accept that I am not perfect, However, I also accept that those who do not know me will have their own agenda and judge me accordingly.  I am at ease with myself, I apologise to the ATM if I key incorrectly lol.   Good manners and the ability to apologise is no excuse for being mean. Truly good manners mean that you are NEVER mean to anyone.|`|0ede6ed5af86402f961daba9a691dc95aa	Maybe some don't think they have done anything wrong and so feel there is nothing to apologize for.  I know a few people who are like that and you are right, they don't have friends, and even their families are staying away.    I may be straight to the point sometimes, but do keep the feelings of others in mind.  If I cross that line then I have no problem saying "I'm sorry"... and I mean it too!|`|049a5ee66231db2295d9daeba62a36bcaa	Maybe they are living by their own conscience and not anyone else's and people only apologize for their own benefit not because somebody else thinks they should.  In some cultures there are no apologies, just life.  Apparently live and let live is very hard for some people to learn|`|DJLeObm4aa	If I do something and know it was wrong I would most certainly apologise most sincerely. Some people's pride just doesn't seem to let them apologise. It is as if it is beneath them, despite knowing they are in the wrong. Thing is it gets them nowhere in life. People may 'put up' with them some of the time but it is unlikely they will have true friends. To be/have a true friend demands the same values from the two people concerned. If one person knows the other is ill mannered and does thing he/she won't apologise for which obviously often hurts even if they are absolute saints they must know in their hearts that the other party can never be a true friend to them.|`|4Wgf6WZraa	Shame?|`|kYYHw7xEaa	First, you have to have the ability to realize that you are not the beginning and the end; if you know what I mean.  Some people just can not admit when they've made a mistake. I know a man who lost his wife after many years of marriage because of this.  Everything that went wrong, be it big or small, was someone else's fault. Usually hers.  It's very wearing.  In all the years of marriage, he never once said, "I'm sorry".    *I'm so glad I'm out of there*|`|XEbrGfZuaa	It could be Alzheimers if they are seniors.

They made rude comments to  my face, and it was hard to not retaliate as I'd wanted. I believe that  they both died as they had lived. And maybe thoughts of how they  had treated others came to them, during their last moments. No one  will ever know.     I see this in a few other family members, and can't understand  their positions toward me. I wish I knew the answer for someone   who is not elderly or senile. It's like a switch turned off, in their   normal behavior.

These are very sad narrow minded fools though - more to be pitied than anything.    An apology is a kind of giving and its better to give than receive!|`|2R3iJnFPaa	I think a lot of mean people don't know how mean they are.

To the unbelieving materialist, man is simply an evolutionary accident. His hopes of survival are strung on a figment of mortal imagination; his fears, loves, longings, and beliefs are but the reaction of the incidental juxtaposition of certain lifeless atoms of matter. No display of energy nor expression of trust can carry him beyond the grave. The devotional labors and inspirational genius of the best of men are doomed to be extinguished by death, the long and lonely night of eternal oblivion and soul extinction. Nameless despair is man's only reward for living and toiling under the temporal sun of mortal existence. Each day of life slowly and surely tightens the grasp of a pitiless doom which a hostile and relentless universe of matter has decreed shall be the crowning insult to everything in human desire which is beautiful, noble, lofty, and good.

Our condemnation is rightly deserved due to our rebellion and disobedience of God's laws. God is not responsible for our sin, but we are, because of our own lusts.13 However, God, in His love, has provided a way of escape for those who recognize their own inability to live up to God's holy standards.

VOLJCMFJaa	"O judgment!" as in: reasoning, conscience.  "Thou art fled" meaning, you've left me  "to brutish beasts" meaning to wildness or savagery.    So the translation would be something like "Oh, my conscience has left me completely for savage notions."  So, probably, the character should be using better judgment, but his/her savage, primal instincts/emotions have caused their ability to reason to falter.|`|acbqsZZbaa	Pretty much what it says.    "Oh Judgement, you have fled to (gone into) brutish beasts"    It makes more sense when you include the following line:    O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts,  And men have lost their reason.    Edit:  Mark Antony is making a speech in honour of the deceased Julius Caesar (the famous "Friends, Romans, countrymen" speech). The "brutish beasts" is a pun on the name of Brutus, former friend of Caesar who is one of the men who assassinated him.|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	It's exactly what it says. "Oh judgement!

Xt4n9h40aa	Any church that bashes other churches is not following the Word of God.  They are apparently forgetting to love others as they love themselves.  If you have spoken to the minister (and I am assuming you mean the pastor, if not do tell the pastor) about this and he doesn't seem to find anything wrong w/ it, I'd find another church to go to.  One where you can get fed the true Word of God, not some bologna from a bunch of self righteous hypocrites.    Churches today should focus more on working together to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to see souls saved, not spreading gossip and animosity amongst each other.  What kind of example are they setting to the lost world when churches can't even get along.  Where is the love of Christ they are supposed to have?  That is why non-Christians look down on the Church World today.  It is a sad affair, but those that are true Christians must continue to push ahead and continue in the work of Jesus.  I know for a fact that our Pastor does NOT tolerate such behavior and I praise God for that!     God Bless!|`|F4IjI9qaaa	I'm with you. It would have been best if you had spoken up at the time. I would have asked why s/he felt it was necessary to slam others? I've always thought the world would be much better off if each of us worried less about everyone else's beliefs/actions, and more about getting our own butts into heaven.    Your former teacher shows that it's much easier to call yourself religious than it is to actually act in a spiritual and enlightened manner.    Be well and good luck in your quest.|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	The first thing you should do is speak with your Pastor about this situation.  I would also spend some time in prayer about what you should do as far as leaving the church.  If your going to leave your church you should let your Pastor know the reason why.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	You would do well to speak to the Sunday School director, minister of education, or pastor.

They are all more or less the same but on different levels of stupidity. When I was in sunday school as a kid my teacher told us not to go by the arcade and play video games cause we'd get possessed by the demon buddha.|`|KjF0p72naa	That sounds like the right thing to do. It is not a good idea for Christians to segregate themselves in this manner. That Sunday school teacher was simply wrong in saying that. It was OK for you to not have said anything at the time because noting his actions it probably would have come to nothing but a useless argument in which no one would have "won". I WOULD, however, write either an email (if their church has a websight) to a Decon or some senior leader of the church (usually not the Pastor because they generally like to follow a chain of command if you will and have things like this come from someone in authority in the church because I assure you the Pastor probably recieves lots of things to deal with and going to a Decon/other will give your issue a better chance of having attention given to it that it deserves).  Don't get all upset, but state what happened and that it is the reason you are not going to be attending any longer. State why it hurt you and simply ask that someone look into it not happening again to someone else.  Keep your focus on Christ, not people and you'll be OK.

In sum, that Plan revolves around GOD's finding, redemption, raising and salvation of an enslaveed and oppressed people into complete, even perfect development, and eventual communion with Supreme Being    This Plan, contained within Bible and Quran is very sophisticated, yet written on one level or another so all can understand it-whether accept it or not, to guide our lives. that Plan is to become GODS or childrens of GOD , we are not perfect yet!  through a process of purification of generation and self " through study of God words and act on God words thats the greatest ALL maricals when human beings transform they life better, to become likness of GOD or reflection of GOD.

But you also have to take into context the time it was written in and the people who wrote it. The first bible wasn't written until 90 years after Jesus' death. And people didn't write much back then, b/c most people couldn't--read *or* write. Which means the story of Jesus' life and death got remembered and passed down by those who witnessed it.     Ever form a story chain? You get a bunch of people together, and you tell the first person a story. He then tells it to the person beside him, and they tell it to the person beside them, and so on. Everybody thinks differently, everybody is unique, so people will remember different parts of it. By the time it gets to the last person, the story barely resembles what it began as. The fact is, the bible was likely written by people who weren't even alive when Jesus began his teachings. They didn't live long back then either. Mother Mary, by the time Jesus began his teachings, was considered really old.     So, I think it's both.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) The Holy Bible: Symbolic or Literal?    Both.  Some are quite plainly symbolic, others quite plainly literal.  Some are debatable.      2) Who is allowed to make those decisions?    In most countries, everyone.      3) Thou shall take certain parts of the bible as literal and what you feel should be symbolic is under you discretion    Well, no - but the bible *does* indicate in several places when symbolism is being used.  For someone like me who prefers a literal interpretation, I like to see clear evidence (in Scripture itself) of a non-literal intent before I accept anything other than a literal interpretation.  To my mind, this is simply the most reasonable approach - take what it says literally unless Scripture itself gives you a reason not to do so.      4) I am guessing most of the book is simply "symbolic" and not to be taken literal?    I would say the opposite is true.  Most of the book is clearly a historical account.  There are, as mentioned, some portions which are clearly symbolic.      Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com

When I was a child and used to stay with her, I vividly recall seeing him. I stopped seeing him so sharply when I hit my teens, but I always feel his awful presence. He wasn't a good man.    I can sense if a spirit is near. I am a photographer, and only a week ago whilst driving looking for photo opportunities, I came across a four-grave catholic cemetary that had been abandoned [I live far out of town so this is not unusual]. This particular cemetary had such a dark, ominous feel to it I took three photo's and left. I still feel frightened when I think of it. I took a photo of a grave stone, and in the photo it looks burned though I don't recall it being so [however I cannot verify that].    I have also experienced a demon apparation. It was the reason I moved from my old home. It was just like Hollywood movies - a black cloaked figure that hovered - though I could see his face which is something I cannot bring to describe. It even happened between 2 and 3 am the supposed witching hour. I am not sure, but I do believe it was the teenage boy who lived behind us - I overheard his suicide a few months prior. I always wanted to visit his family and ask to see what he looked like so I could confirm, but naturally the family would most likely want to be left in peace.    I still continue to experience similar things and frankly, it terrifies me. I have found the best way to rid them is simply to 'tell them off' or ask politely, depending on the situation. However that's only for the pranksters, I have no idea how to deal with demons..|`|rllnRDNmaa	no  dont pick up hitch hikers  they could be escaped prisoners  or they want to rob you|`|xzL2oRq9aa	im sure it was a ghost. often when we drive, our minds slow down, and we relax, although this is very dangerous, but it happens.

The Bible in Genesis 2 gives us some description about the geography and the location of Eden.  The problem is that the flood would have changed any perspective of the area.  Noah exiting the ark could have mistook the Tigris and Euphrates rivers or simply used those names for the first rivers that he saw.  There is no reason to assume that Eden was in Iraq. Due to the flood any and all perspective of the location of Eden is lost.   Perhaps the biggest clue is the presence of gold around the garden, but even that doesn't narrow the location down.|`|AA11340918	The Euphrates river is mentioned several times in the bible.|`|32ea1406ffe3eb1c76e6d8f5d28e2c02aa	Even fairy tales can have a hint of truth to them, and in this case, I think it does.  I think Eden was a real place, though I seriously doubt that it was the heavenly paradise depicted in the Bible.  But after all, the Jews had to come from somewhere.  Maybe the myth of the Garden of Eden represents the original home of the Jews, before they relocated to Israel.  It can't be proved, but it's an interesting theory.    Genesis 2, 10-14 says that the Garden of Eden was located at the source of four rivers: the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Pishon, and the Gihon.  That sounds too specific to be totally legendary.  Now, Tigris and Euphrates we know, but nobody knows where the Pishon and the Gihon are.  Plus, rivers move over time, and it's hard to tell where any of them were thousands of years ago.      David Rohl, an archaeologist, did some work on this, following the rivers, talking to locals, and he argues that Eden was in Iran, about ten miles outside a city named Tabriz.  He later did an expedition on the site that provided further evidence for this.  He found no giant angel with a fiery sword, so Christian literalists usually scoff at him.  But his results are pretty convincing, if not conclusive.

There's this new search engine that you haven't heard about, it's called Google. Just go to www. google.com and type some words in.    ============================  Satellite photos reveal two dry riverbeds flowing toward the Persian Gulf near where the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia also terminate. This would account for four easterly flowing rivers. Archaeologist Juris Zarins claimed that the Garden of Eden was situated at the head of the Persian Gulf, where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers run into the sea at 29470N 48380E? / ?29.78333, 48.63333, from his research on this area using information from many different sources, including Landsat images from space. In this theory, the Bibles Gihon River would correspond with the Al-Qurnah in Iraq, and the Pishon River would correspond to the Wadi Al-Batin river system (also now called the Kuwait River) that 2,500-3000 years ago drained the now dry, but once quite fertile central part of the Arabian Peninsula from the Hijaz mountains 600 miles to the South West.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	according to south park it was in imagination land|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	I remember that answer from 1st grade catechism:  Between the Tigris and  Euphrates Rivers.

They explain the difference between the pentagram and the pentacle.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic...|`|WZ6YXDODaa	Never read it, never will|`|XctJvD7Aaa	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=Sata...
N73oZyY8aa	No  Big hairy guys  No    One can be fun but I prefer free roaming hands  Big hairy guys  No, it isn't, but it's kind of hot.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Depends on how you define 'common'.  Many LGBT people are involved in BDSM, but just like in the straight community, it's not a majority of people.    Bears are bigger, hairy men (hence the resemblance to bears).    It is in the BDSM community.|`|hZiwiboRaa	Erm No.  Huge hairy men.  No it is not.    Hope i helped!  (:|`|Lg6loLdhaa	What is 'normal'?. Everybody in this world is different, you can never say someone is 'normal'.    'Bears' are fat hairy middle aged guys.    It might be common for some people to wear harnesses and some of those might be gay so yes and no. It all depends on the individual.    I know you are gay but you don't half generalise and stereotype gay men
AtY7izyHaa	It depends cause there could be unforeseen ramifications that could     work against me instead of for me . . .    Example: In a younger day i made my living as a lead singer and rock    guitarist playing in night clubs , in fact that's how i met my then     groupie who eventually became my girl, and now, my wife . . .      that's the good news, the bad news, i dropped out of high school, in     pursuit of a career in the recording industry, it didn't happen, and not     for the obvious reasons but we won't go there . . .      ironically at 5 my future ad-vocation was to be a doctor, specializing in     psychiatry, but being born with the proverbial silver spoon in my mouth     musicaly speaking that is, well, the music took care of any possibility     of a career in medicine, when at ten i pick up a guitar and never looked    back, not to mention sounding like some one who had been playing all    his life, and yes, it does happen but dosen't come without a price along    with singing as well at a most advanced stage, already for one my age    not to mention even a more advance music writting potential, it  didn't     make me to welcomed amongst my garden variety peers . . .      Point being . . .      had i not engaged on a musical journey, i may never have     met my wife, which was the best thing that ever happened     to me, though that wasn't the original ides, not for awhile    any way, the music just expidited the situation to my     advantage . . .    which is more ironical cause she's in, what else? you guessed it, the     medical profession, lol. that's why i said it depends, cause if i had to     do it again, she'd still be included . . .      Simply put, same wife, but i'd be a doctor, instead of a looser, which of     course she doesn't think so, hence " Love Being Blind "  then when do     women ever admit to making a mistake? no reflection on any one here        any way, as things stand right now, i wouldn't trade her for the world    and all it's gold . . .|`|mBHQEzd1aa	No I don't want to change.I've been through a lot of change.  I like who and what I am right now.   I'm happy with myself the way I am.  Its taken me 68 years to get like this and I like it.  I like me.
RdmStaQGaa	not dangling things. give him something from the heart, like write him a song about your times together and sing it to him|`|iW6iJBCEaa	Great idea. At my school, there's a group that sells candy grams and flowers to give to your sweetheart.|`|7xCzwVRUaa	give him a home run!|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	no dangling things
uGIIR9Beaa	The problem is the dead can't consent (and normally speaking sure did not up front). On their part, necrophilia is not right. As far as the necrophiliac goes, they may have a serious mental problem or an unhealthy fetish (more so hygienes then psychologically maybe) and would do wise to seek help for their 'taboo thrill'.|`|mBHQEzd1aa	Well, I kinda sorta think its gross if your definition of necrophilia is correct.... Uck!|`|RhX0TxOBaa	That's just fvcked up in so many ways.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I guess it's OK, if you can find a corpse capable of giving informed consent. (Definitely not MY idea of a good time.)|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	Over my dead body.|`|hZiwiboRaa	Is that the thing where people umm.. Start having sex with dead  bodies...?  If it is that is just sick to me. If there dead let em be in peace ( :|`|UVKSHcK8aa	lol at jenny... and i don't think it's hot... but to each his own, i guess... just not with my dead body:P|`|k3TKEOJBaa	It kills me B}|`|nooocNV1aa	only video game nerds do it cuz no live person would f*ck them
TLLklriUaa	What disturbed me most about this video was that Penn used the whole "if someone is going to be hit by a car, shouldn't they be warned" argument to justify the Christian's behavior.    If someone is going to be hit by a car, we have scientific evidence that they will be injured. There is absolutely no evidence that warning someone to believe in God has a beneficial effect. It shocks me that he seems unaware of how illogical it is to state otherwise.|`|Frw0mu2faa	just because someone's religious doesnt mean you need to be mean to them|`|TnquzeM5aa	It's a war of ideas, and I've launched a blitzkrieg.|`|gb9ERmHPaa	As a fellow athiest, we all have to be nice.  We have to show hard-core Christian Americans that we are not bad people.  Athiests hold fundraisers and do things for the poor all the time.  We just don't believe in a God or a book full of lies.  One day we will earn our respect, and I can't wait to see the first openly-athiest politician.  I saw a poll that more Americans would vote for an openly gay political figure than for an openly-athiest one.  Until that day comes it's good to be nice to religious people in a predominatly Christian count|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	totally, come on stand up for atheism, I do everything humanly possible to prove god doesn't exist|`|3oCdTWYZaa	Me too!!!!    We should STAND up for our beliefs, and be more vocal!|`|8tF9Py9Daa	No.  One can disagree without being disagreeable.|`|4sUek7ugaa	I never get annoyed at people for being nice.  There's not enough niceness in the world.|`|ioBUzPVraa	Yeah why should Atheists bother wasting their time being nice to anyone? They're all going to hell anyways.|`|0bOSZIzJaa	Now you are being narrow.  There is a lot of good in religious teachings, but we can't be mean to make them understand why we don't believe what they do.      I do think someone should burn down that awful creation museum in Kansas though....|`|qQzWECQ2aa	I dont see whats wrong with being nice to another human being?|`|LGBNKuxRaa	cuts both ways, that one. I'm not out to eradicate religion, just to stand up for my right to call it silly or dangerous when that seems to be the case. atheists like you annoy me sometimes.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I get annoyed with anyone that can villainize an entire group of people, and cannot accept a nice gesture.|`|TR2MYeLUaa	Accept it, the world is religious...the only way we can get anywhere is by dealing with them--it's a good skill to learn.|`|8tYKGDy0aa	ok|`|bnPPrJY1aa	It's called TV|`|4PQOiSfZaa	Since when was it so bad to be nice?|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Maybe it wasn't.....Penn always strikes me as a smart, very perceptive person. He could probably tell what sort of person this guy was.|`|OOL4XdjPaa	No, but we get mad when you write stupid questions..|`|u5ZjG99Kaa	i get annoyed at crazy atheists who make a big deal of everything religious that ever happens. If you dont wanna have a religion good for you nobody cares let other people have their own opinions|`|nwdwKnS7aa	I wouldn't ever be nasty to a decent religious person who practiced what they preached. I would admire them for being a charitable, good person  But we all know it's rarely that way, (as proved by some of the comments here) so the criticism of Religion and people who abuse it has to be harsh, as it has caused War, Intolerance, Terrorism, Manipulation & Interference.|`|Tg8AT0A1aa	hmm never noticed... im not very strict athiest/very strict agnostic...idk wut ud call it. wut annoys me is when other religions try 2 convert me or when u c all those "jesus luvs me" things on facebook and stuff. UGH.|`|WKkyriIZaa	I do sometimes, and most christians get mad at athiests because of the bible sometimes.    I was in class the other week, and our teacher asked who was christian, buddist, muslim, athiest, jewish, etc. Half the class raised their hands when she said christian. But when she came around to athiests, we raised our hands and some girl yelled out; "You're all going to hell for not believing in god!!"         Well, i went off topic a bit, but you get the idea right?  I dont like it that much, but you cant really avoid it.|`|I6D7xdcVaa	I get annoyed when people are as narcissistic and arrogant as you are right now. All people should be encouraged to be as nice to their fellow man as they possibly can. There should be no cap on the kindness one can share with another.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	People like Bozo are seriously misinformed. I disagree ALL THE TIME and I manage to do it in a polite manner.    We expect to have our views respected, so we should respect those of others. Respecting a point of view is not validating IT, but the person behind it.    A sincere person is worthy of respect. And a respectful atmosphere is a calm one. Which is the proper "venue" for an intelligent debate.    All that vitriol and like idiocy do is lower the debate and those who participate in it.    If you are making an argument from logic, why would you introduce illogical distractions like ridicule or juvenile attacks?|`|Pcw4XYXIaa	Give Penn some credit.  I'm sure he knew that it was a sales pitch and that the guy was trying to "convert" him and so forth.  But he isn't going to be a complete dick about it.  This guys religion is important to him, so Penn will respect that and listen to his pitch.  It's no big deal and takes only a few minutes of your time.  Basic human decency.|`|67SW7hamaa	Do you seriously believe all religious people are out to get you? o.o     People are nice when they have kind hearts. They are mean when they have cruel hearts. There are manipulative people out there, but one or two manipulators out of a bunch doesn't mean that the whole bunch is the same way. That's sort of a rude stereotype. Yelling in the face of people who do that sort of thing can cause bitterness, the type that gives people cruel intentions.|`|Uxdiv3fdaa	Wow, I couldn't agree more. I am writing a thesis on a similar topic and for my paper I have been conducting research. My most recent test involved hiring a leper to dance naked on the steps of a church begging for money. I know for a fact that the man really did need money. I mean he offered to dance naked for only five dollars an hour. I payed him fifty an hour. However he was kicked off the steps only moments after beginning his performance. This was so fundamentally unchristian and appalling that I created a pipe bomb, strapped it to the leper and sent him in during 10 mass|`|XEy7lgsFaa	ok first of all, i am religious and i am not nice most of the time. I am nice to  people because that is my personality, not "religious" people are nice. who i believe in or worship or what  the bible says has nothing to with being nice. second of all , the bible DOES NOT say to be nice. it  doesn't say being nice is an obligation. religion is not something you advertise. that is rude and steretypical of you to say **** like that. just because someoneis an atheist it means they can't be nice to other people because they are religous? one of my best friends is an atheist, i love her tough and i do not judge her. i am ALWAYS  nice to her and she is to me!!!     BTW-IT IS JESUS|`|hHN93lwuaa	THAT IS TERRIBLE YES IT PISSES ME OFF ALOT!|`|UvxxyVCQaa	Yea all the time|`|mV1VqBWhaa	no disrespect to what u believe in im a reglious person n maybe this guy doesnt know whats going on|`|AA11043053	Deluded people can be nice. So can freethinkers. Then there's you.|`|XfjAwH7Haa	Nope, all people should be nice to each other regardless of religious beliefs, most Atheists believe that.|`|P91FugsAaa	Penn is an entertainer, and his income depends on people going to see his shows, buying his books, watching his TV programs, listening to his radio interviews, etc, etc.  He's a die-hard skeptic, and atheist, but he's also aware that most of his paying audience in places like Las Vegas are religious people, and he's simply playing the game... don't sh*t where you sleep.|`|QJbFD1T0aa	I dont need to be mean to religious people just because they dont believe in what i believe in... its unfair for them, they have a right to believe what they want|`|yoPNXiluaa	And who should be afraid?  God Bless the internet, it allows for a safe distance.|`|M78fZEQWaa	I think you might be stereotyping a little too much.  Not all Christians are alike, nor are all athiests alike.  I believe that everyone should be tolorant of everyone...  I dont think you should be rude, or unkind to a religious person, just like you wouldnt be to an athiest.  People are just people, regardless of what they believe.|`|uo4Or00qaa	Sounds like you just think every religious person is pushing their "sales" on you.  Maybe the guy just loves his religion enough to want everyone to be part of it. relax, and don't be a pusher.|`|bT3mzootaa	GOD bless you desiree!|`|KH8JAV6qaa	In that specific case, yes, because the christian was basically being condescending to him and his beliefs by giving him the bible in the first place. It's like "here, you poor lost thing, I'll learn ya!"... but I don't think there's anything wrong with being nice to christians if they have questions, etc, and just honestly want to have a healthy debate, without being pushy. We won't make any progress as a human race if we all keep bashing each other.|`|m2uYYyPEaa	I think you are the one people would get annoyed with. Religion gives people hope when they have nothing left. It lets people know that there is a reason for all the bad things that happen to them or the world. They know that if someone close to them has died, they will be able to see them again, which would be a wonderful thing.   Sure, I am not a religious person, and I am an athiest, but just because SOME religious people are nuts doesn't mean all of them are out to hurt the world or "make everyone believe." Some of the religious people I know are obnoxious, just as some of the athiest people I know are obnoxious.|`|ot0YO4mDaa	a lot of religious people arent doing it just to get to heaven/etc. or as a sales pitch. chances are if theyre doing it they believe in it and they genuinely want to help you. if they didnt want to do it, they wouldnt..|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Who the hell shoved a broom sideways up your bum? And since when did you meet every christian on earth and gain the almighty right to judge every one of them? And since when did you gain the ability to judge which people are able to be compassionate, and selfless and which are faking?     Does that make you a better human being some how? because iam not seeing it... I've met a lot of christians, and most of them are so blinded by religion that they dont know Jesus, or themselves, or anything. And of all the people who have hurt me the most in my life its been christians, people who claim to know God. But I am pretty certain that everyone has false motives.    I've heard a lot of jaded ignorant comments... but thats probably one of the worst. You are whats wrong with the world today.    I dont think anyone is really qualified to judge the motives behind someone elses kindness. Least of all you.|`|Bkkevvamaa	I don't see the point of this really. Just because a person's kind to another doesn't mean it has to be based on religion. Are you expecting atheists to bash Christians just because it's against their beliefs? Oh come on, that makes us no better than over than narrow minded zealots.     You also have to note Penn is on camera and most of the world is governed by the Christian populace. He's not going to lose ratings by acting like a jerk.|`|1a03fd470e002c088b333c229350271faa	You are clueless....every line in this "question" proved you more clueless than the line before it.    The question itself, without all the snot that followed, might as well have been written "I can't stand when other atheists don't act like a$$holes to people who believe in God."  You are obviously very insecure in your beliefs or lack thereof and need other atheists to stoop to your level with you to make you feel more secure.    You don't know a thing about Christians, or as you call them "religious people." You don't know anyone's motives behind what they do and have a lot of nerve pretending that you do. You saying that "religious people" only do things for others because they feel like they have to, is the equivalent of someone saying that when atheists act like morons, it's a result of them being atheists.     You are BEYOND ignorant.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	"Nothing more than a deluded religious person, pretending to be nice in order to lure someone else into believing the same lies as he does; why couldnt he see this?"    Well, a lot of those proselytizers really are trying to be nice, I think they just don't know any better. And even if another atheist wants to be a passive wimpy milquetoast, that's his business. I only get pissed off at "holier than thou" atheists who try to one-up the rest of us by bragging about how nice and respectful they are towards everybody's beliefs.|`|PM23RDycaa	Desiree don't take offense at this but Atheist who think like you are the EXACT reason why most people think all of your are major class a-holes. I'm a pagan and I have maintained SEVERAL christian friends from my childhood and my catholic friends as well. I even have atheist friends. There are PLENTY of genuinely nice Christians out there.     The problem is they are overshadowed by the rabid fundies. Penn is a nice man who btw depends on the people who come to their shows for his JOB. I know plenty of Christians who enjoy their act despite the fact Penn has never hidden the fact he's an atheist.    Fine be disappointed with him, but ask yourself this; do you think he gives a damn what YOU think? Who are you to dictate what makes a good atheist or a bad one?    Its called being polite.
pSS1xPknaa	I dont believe that you swear on the bible anymore in any jurisdiction within the United States.     You are asked to affirm that the testimony that you are about to give will be truthfull.

uzczwVT1aa	Salam. From the Noble Quran:    4:40  Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubleth it, and giveth from His Own self A great reward.    6:160  He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit: He that doeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil: No wrong shall be done unto them.    24:38  That Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace: For Allah doth provide for those whom He will, without measure.    21:94  Whoever works any act Of Righteousness and has Faith, His endeavour will not be rejected: We shall record it in his favour    21:47  We shall set up scales of justice for the day of Judgement, so that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least. And if there be (no more than) the weight of a mustard seed, we will bring it (to account) and enough are We to take Account.    29:7  Those who believe and work righteous deeds, -from them shall we blot out all misdeeds that they have committed, and We shall reward Them according to the best of their deeds.    4:124  If any do deeds of righteousness, - Be they male or female and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the last injustice will be done to them.    I can go on and on with these beautiful verses you will find in the Quran. Allah is Just  He is not only the God of Muslims, but God of every body of every faith, every creature:      49:13  O Mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (Not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most Righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).'     Very true, there is only One God and He is Most Merciful and Most Gracious  this is what we say before we do anything  before we go out, before we sleep, before we get in the house, or bathroom, or anything, we remember Allah and say In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, Most Merciful.   Anyway, even though what this person did was heroic, there are limits. Of course if anything happened to me, and this man saved me, Id owe him my life, but like I said there are limits. This has nothing to do with ethnic background or race, in Islam everyone is equal, and no one is better than the other. But a Muslim woman can only marry a Muslim man if she can be sure that her children will be raised as Muslims, and it will be hard to do this if this man was a non-Muslim, especially if he did things which were haram, such as drinking and whatever, which would just make me want to back off even more. Also, if parents say no to this, then it is also haram to go against their wishes and they would definitely refuse, but only because he was a non-Muslim, and it is haram. In Islam, obeying parents is very important. Islam has to always come first, so Muslim women cant marry non-Muslim men, but thats just me, some people would do it. I can't just want to marry him because he saved me, I guess. Id be very grateful to him for the rest of my life and repay him in anyway I can, how can I not? But marriage it's just clearly forbidden.   And yes, there is only One God  its a fundamental belief in Islam that there is no God but Allah, it is the declaration of faith. Allah is fair and just to every single one of His creatures, not just those who are Muslims. Anyway salam alaikom :)|`|8901e2819a6bc62c741fd8706d58f081aa	I dont think your allah would praise anyone who isnt muslim, no matter how good they are . Your allah seems to be very narrow minded|`|WL7nKDplaa	Ok, sweetheart, if a man, any man, saves you from potential gang rape you are bound to feel something towards him. There is nothing wrong with that. Now first off Muslim so I don't know everything about your religion and second I think everyone would have a different answer. Your mother might think that you should ONLY marry another Muslim, but my mother (if I were Muslim) might say 'He saved you from something horrible, he is husband material'. Do you get what I'm saying? And I'm sure that if Allah does exist, then he would approve. (I'm sorry about the if he does exist, I'm just not positive about my beliefs. I rule nothing out and respect everyone's choice.     Now on a different note, do you even know how he feels about you? I believe that if you love him, then he should be husband material, but if you feel differently that's your right and I respect that. I wish all the luck in the world.|`|SvAwrzZ4aa	marrying or seeing someone of different religion isno accepted in muslim religion so that person will have to convert|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I don't know who you people think you are. You should be grateful if a Jew or Christian wanted to marry you. As for parents wondering whether such a man is good enough, they really ought to take a long hard look at themselves. You are so prejudiced yet you accuse everyone else of it.

AYs6iFlLaa	Call them the same as Always, Allah knows the intention of your heart and what you are doing. Changing this could have a negative affect on them and harm your relationship. 'God children' is a term used for Children who you have promised, in front of God (Allah), to take care of in the event something bad happens to their parents. There is no harm in this. There is no committing of Shirk in this action you are simply promising in front of God to take on a responsibility.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	you can refer to them as a neice/nephew  and you are like an aunt to them, ya?  ...if you feel they are family, why not!  just don't claim them as your own children (of course lol)    :)    Allah(swt) knows best|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Maybe just a guardian to support them, if anything happens to their parents.|`|bn0oXqDcaa	Call them your lil munchkins lol :)    well people before me have said: nephew/niece etc.    i think something more endearing would be best. Maybe just take the word God out and insert something else, watever you think best suits it.    My examples: "spiritual children"                         "lovely kiddos" :P    And congratulation on the reversion :)    edit: i just noticed that u asked whether islam has the concept or not, well islam does obviously permit guarding and looking after other children but it just doesn't call them "God children", in fact the prophet pbuh has  strongly enforced that we look after the orphan children and guard them. Same goes for any child who needs support.  i wish i knew some kids i could be a spiritual aunty to :)

JIOIK9x0aa	Perfectly normal. You needn't believe in anyhing, and not believing shouldn't trouble. If you don't see a reason to believe, logic is you won't.  Performing rituals for Gods you don't believe in would feel silly and pointless, so it's normal that you feel that going to church is a waste of time.  Don't worry, even a bit, about that. Go with what feels right. Spirituality, or absence of it, is mainly about believing what you feel that's true.   If you force yourself on a belief you don't have, it can only bring negative consequences.|`|v7Wflu78aa	I find the most satisfying approach to being in a religious community (your family, for example) is not to ask "is God real or not," but to ask what the function of the religion is in the peoples' lives.    It could be that half the people in your church on any Sunday don't believe in God, but they get something else out of it:    For example:  They get to feel superior to people who don't go to church  They like seeing friends weekly  They enjoy the time to feel grateful and thankful for the good in life  They make business connections  They learn more about the bible  They still hear their parents' voices telling them to go to church  They are waiting for the belief in God to be kindled in them  Church brings back feelings of family and community from their childhood    It is not correct that  believing in God is necessary.  It is not necessary that you believe in God in order to go to church.    Most educated Americans don't believe in God, so you are joining good company.|`|dXtzLcIwaa	being a Christian takes FAITH. u have lost ur faith and trust in God. which is not good. try going to church a few times. u will find that its not a waist of time. at all.

(That's if you go twice a month like you say). A couple of hours a month is a small sacrifice. You may not like it, but it's not like excruciating pain. If you don't believe in God, then it shouldn't be a big deal to be there. If you don't believe in the "Christian God" then you need to figure out what "god" you believe in. Any way you look at it, you are a minor. Go to Church twice a month, if only for your mom.

Love cannot be forced, so do yourself a favor and don't try to change his mind; it'll only make you look weak and pitiful. Who knows, in time he may realize he does love you after all. In the meantime, try to realize that that you don't HAVE to be "in love" all the time. It'll happen when the time is right.

GNQ70MEFaa	I find that this particular verse isn't too hard to practice when the Holy Spirit really dwells within a person. When the Spirit dwells within a person, then he/she will know whether or not another deals at all in Truth. He/she can recognize the counterfeit "kingdom" in action, i.e. these people on television selling prayer packages and handkerchiefs. I do this often because I hear too many people using church vocabulary and misusing their gifts just to make a nice impression or to receive some kind of profit, like many of today's pop stars. Even Oprah, whom many people admire has made some statements that are out of line with God because they don't match up with the Bible.

This only means that it may be predicting a future prophet|`|JXfGHsF6aa	1John 4:1-6 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.  Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:  And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.  Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.  They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.  We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.    Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 1 John 4:1.          As the years went by and the number of believers grew, John labored with increasing fidelity and earnestness for his brethren. The times were full of peril for the church. Satanic delusions existed everywhere. By misrepresentation and falsehood the emissaries of Satan sought to arouse opposition against the doctrines of Christ, and in consequence dissensions and heresies were imperiling the church. . . . Thus many were being led into the mazes of skepticism and delusion.         John was filled with sadness as he saw these poisonous errors creeping into the church. He saw the dangers to which the church was exposed, and he met the emergency with promptness and decision. The epistles of John breathe the spirit of love. It seems as if he wrote with a pen dipped in love. But when he came in contact with those who were breaking the law of God, yet claiming that they were living without sin, he did not hesitate to warn them of their fearful deception.         We are authorized to hold in the same estimation as did the beloved disciple those who claim to abide in Christ while living in transgression of God's law. There exist in these last days evils similar to those that threatened the prosperity of the early church; and the teachings of the apostle John on these points should be carefully heeded. . . . While we are to love the souls for whom Christ died, we are to make no compromise with evil. We are not to unite with the rebellious and call this charity. God requires His people in this age of the world to stand for the right as unflinchingly as did John in opposition to soul-destroying errors.         He declared what he knew, what he had seen and heard. . . . Out of the abundance of a heart overflowing with love for the Saviour he spoke; and no power could stay his words.          So may every true believer be able, through his own experience, to "set to his seal that God is true" (John 3:33). He can bear witness to that which he has seen and heard and felt of the power of Christ.    http://www.bibleuniverse.com

Even translating it to English the words retain their same meaning.

If God is all these than how would He not protect His book? If God knows our hearts wouldn't He also be able to influence our thoughts and give us knowledge of things that we wouldn't otherwise know?The Bible is multi layered in depth and meaning, containing past, present and future sometimes in the same sentence. It applies to today the same way it applied 1800 years ago. Try praying before you read it and look at it as eternal truth past down through the ages, and has now found it's way into your hands by God's design.|`|0hQyClksaa	People who know what they are talking about do not take the Bible only literally because they understand that there are parts to be taken literally and some to be taken poetically, some to be taken symbolically and some to be taken metaphorically, etc, etc.

Matthew 23  22 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.      Mat 18:9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.      This 'hell fire' is a reference to the Valley of Hinnom, south of Jerusalem, outside the walls where all the filth of the city was taken, dead animals and probably any unclaimed bodies from crucifixions. This is a place that everyone in the area would be well aware of as the flames would literally have to be kept burning to destroy anything disease carrying. This is also the place of previous worshippers of the god Moloch which was involved in child sacrifices by people not believing in the one true God. So it would have had a reputation.    When Jesus spoke of this he would know his hearers would have clear understanding of this place of fire.    When we hear of a lake of fire it is symbolic of total destruction.    Mark 16  19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.      Luke 15  7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.      Heaven and the kingdom of heaven are different places.    Note here that in Jesus' day the kingdom of heaven was still to come:    Matthew 3  2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.      Matthew 4  17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.      Matthew 6  10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as [it is] in heaven.      Hell:    Psa 55:15 Let death seize upon them, [and] let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness [is] in their dwellings, [and] among them.      This word Hell is 'Sheol' in Hebrew, meaning the place of the dead.    Luke 16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.     This is also the place of the dead 'Hades'. in Greek.|`|ToztjpAsaa	Neither exist, but given the choice I'd prefer Hell.

So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

I know that type and want no part of it again.|`|KjF0p72naa	Heaven and Hell are both actual places and each human will experience one or the other after [a possible] first death here on earth.  God's word is very specific on this matter. If you want to know where you are going for eternity there is a simple plan.   In regards to Christianity, we see death here on this side of eternity as "the first death" for those who are not saved. (Have not chosen to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.) "The second death" we refer to is eternity without the chance to be saved as on earth that person chose to deny that free gift. This is an eternity in a place called Hell where those who will not follow Christ will spent all time in a lake of fire that can not be put out. For those who have accepted Christ in the here and now and lived a life getting to know Him and accepting His love and His guidance, theirs will be an eternity spent in His presence in Heaven and will even see a new Heaven and a new earth come to pass by fufilled Biblical prophecy.       Proverbs 14:12-13 ensures "There's a way of life that looks harmless enough; look againit leads straight to hell. Sure, those people appear to be having a good time, but all that laughter will end in heartbreak."    John 3:16-18 reveals "This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, His one and only Son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in Him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn't go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again. Anyone who trusts in Him is acquitted; anyone who refuses to trust Him has long since been under the death sentence without knowing it. And why? Because of that person's failure to believe in the one-of-a-kind Son of God when introduced to Him."    2 Peter 3:8-9 provides "Don't overlook the obvious here, friends. With God, one day is as good as a thousand years, a thousand years as a day. God isn't late with his promise as some measure lateness. He is restraining himself on account of you, holding back the End because he doesn't want anyone lost. He's giving everyone space and time to change."      As for me, I follow Christ.

They remind me of 5 year olds.|`|UO9x4Curaa	Dear Soul,    I love you!    Please don't resent me for writing you this uncomfortable letter.    It's a topic that is not frequently discussed,     yet it will be the most important decision of your life.    "Where will you spend Eternity?"         Every day, thousands of people slip into Eternity     only to meet their decision in Hell.    Inspite of God's pleadings,    they have rejected the blood of His Son    and now must face eternity without Him.    In a place called Hell.         God doesn't want anybody to go to Hell.    He has made a way of escape so that all might be saved.         The Scriptures says,     "For God so loved the world,     that He gave His only begotten Son,     that whosoever believeth in Him     should not perish,     but have everlasting life."    (John 3:16)         All throughout scripture, God warns us of the reality of Hell.     He warns us as a father would warn his child    to keep him from danger and protect him from harm.         Yet, thousands of people every day     make the decision to go to Hell, by simply doing nothing,    not accepting Jesus Christ as their Savior.    It's a solemn yet sobering thought.    Where will you be a hundred years from now?          Those who put their faith in Christ    will enjoy the delights of God in Heaven.    But those who reject the blood of His Son,    will be cast into eternal damnation.         You may ask, "Why a decision, why not put it off?"    It's because tonight, thousands of souls like you     will slip into eternity, either in Heaven or in Hell.         Some will be taken  in their sunset years,    others, in their prime of life.    An automobile accident on their way home from work,    a sudden illness,     or heart attack...    will claim their life,     not giving them time to accept Christ.         One may ask how can a loving God send a person to Hell?    Soul, He doesn't send you there,    you send yourself there    by rejecting the blood of His Son.    You would have to walk over His blood stained body    in order to go to Hell.    You are the one who makes that decision.          Listen  for a moment to what the Scriptures say about Hell.    What if a loved one were to come to this place?         "But the wicked are like the troubled sea,     when it cannot rest,    whose waters cast up mire and dirt.     "There is no peace", saith my God to the wicked."    Isaiah 57:20-21 (KJV)         "...He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone    in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.    And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up  forever and ever:    and they have no rest day nor night..."    Revelations 14:10-11 (KJV)         "But the cowardly,the unbelieving, the vile,     the murderers, the sexually immoral,    and those who practice magic arts,    the idolaters, and all liars -    their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.    This is the second death."    Revelations 21:8 (NIV)         "If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life,    he was thrown into the lake of fire."    Revelations 20:15 (NIV)          "They will throw them into the fiery furnace,     where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."    Matthew 13:42 (NIV)         "Where their worm dieth not,    and the fire is not quenched."     Mark 9:48 (KJV)         ...Then will He say to those on His left,    "Depart from Me, you who are cursed,    into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."    Matthew 25:41 (NIV)         "Hell from beneath is moved for thee    to meet thee at thy coming...    ...All they shall speak and say unto thee,     Art thou also become weak as we...?"    Isaiah 14:9-10 (KJV)         "They will be punished with everlasting destruction    and shut out from the presence of the Lord..." 2 Thessalonians 1:9         *******         O soul, hear the tears in my voice!    What if you were to come to this place?    What could I do to persuade you    to turn from your sinful ways,    while there is still forgiveness and hope?         If I could walk the pit of hell with you    to show you the agony of souls who died in their sin,    it would make you vomit!    You would cry out for the mercy of death,     but there is none!         The reality of Hell is so horrible    that words are inadaquate to describe it.    Who could describe the horrid smell of flesh    falling off the bones, yet without death?!    Where the worm never dies, and the fire is not quenched     as you suffer alone in such hopelessness.         Soul, bend closer,    let me in on you a secret...    "In hell, you won't be having a good time with your friends!"    The parties, the drugs, and alcohol,    act as a bandaid to put over your wounded heart.    Although I am helpless in saving you,     I can point you to the One, who can.         Every minute hundreds of people like yourself    |`|TEsq9K54aa	Count me OUT of these fantasies please.

If they exist at all then they are aspects of consciousness and mind.    It will be the same as how we can choose to live in heaven or hell in this world just by choosing what our thought patterns and behaviours will be.      It will be the same in any future lives that we have.    If I believed in Heaven and Hell then I'd say that I'm going to Heaven, because that's what I'm choosing for myself.

It happened to me once when i was in sujuud and making deep dua'a for a loved one that had just been laid off. I just burst into tears. It was intense.   I wish it happened more frequently, you feel so refreshed are so confident when you finish salah.   You need a very strong connection with Allah in order for that to happen.|`|Tledw3eAaa	It is supposed to be moving and overwhelming (and indescribably beautiful). You should embrace the fact it feels so much so that it brings you to tears, rather than try to change it.    There's that saying that goes "don't fix what isn't broke."     I don't think you need to fix your trembling heart at all. What you feel is an incredibly wonderful thing, and I don't think there is any shame in shedding tears (not for these reasons).    I don't know if it is normal or not, but sometimes when I pray or read the Quran I am brought to tears also... and it always feel good. I'm not sure I would have described it the same way as you, but I understand what you mean. And definitely, I think you should embrace that feeling rather than try to change it.|`|uzczwVT1aa	Aww mashallah, whats there to fix? :) Alhamdullilah, keep enjoying the beauty of Salat, it SHOULD be normal lol. Salam alaikom :)|`|ZOFM0g9haa	Of course it's normal!  *whispers: I feel like that too sometimes*  Let it all out.  I fix it by letting it all out and smileeee :)|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Happened to me once. I don't know why, tears just flows out for some reason while the imaam recites the surahs. Though I was able to contain it later on.
kiZV7qyqaa	truthfully i think this is hard cuz it all depends on the person. like some people avoid eye contact cuz they are nervous or intimidated or feel awkward or somethin. sometimes people keep it short because they have to be somewhere.like i always try to keep the conversations short on the phone with one of my best friends cuz she talks so low on the phone and she is always distracted but that doesnt mean i hate her.  but i think that i guess the best way to tell whould be that people would target you in certain things, like blame something on you or ........... i guess that society would be when people start clubs and things like that against you or your race.     ok im not done with my answer but i have to go so i will finish it and edit it when i get back  or tomorrow cuz i wont be bak till late.|`|na9nG47zaa	They'll rarely talk to you, and avoid you, and when you start trying to talk to them they'll just leave and walk away in mid conversation, and they'll have rude comments and looks to things you say.|`|AA12186207	I wouldn't know...everyone loves me.|`|dm8aBiIVaa	Well if somebody farts on you that pretty much sizes it up.

Also, if they try to look like they're not paying attention to you and they look like they are at the same time, if that makes any sense.
DArAz67Caa	I have bigger fish to fry---|`|eAMq1iBWaa	One cannot repeal a law that has never been made.    God simply tolerated polygamy in the beginning    Gen 2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;        Gen 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.        Gen 2:23 And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.        Gen 2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.        Gen 2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.       ONE MAN- ONE WOMAN|`|D9lMg7A2aa	MATTHEW 19:8    But from the beginning it was not this way. -- Jesus      I just thought that since you studiously avoid Scripture references, I would put one in.

Adultery, polygamy, Biblical marriage, infidelity, divorce, none of it matters.  If unrepentant homophobes were really concerned about the sanctity of marriage, they would be doing something to strengthen it rather than waging spiritual terrorism against gay American families.|`|AA10263279	Go right ahead and try it sweetie,  I would love to see what happens to YOU...|`|k03dYskYaa	Polygamy was regulated under the law. Jesus Christ restored the original standard for marriage. Mark 19:4-8 "In reply he said: Did you not read that he who created them from [the] beginning made them male and female ?and said, For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh? ?So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart. They said to him: Why, then, did Moses prescribe giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her??He said to them: Moses, out of regard for your hardheartedness, made the concession to you of divorcing your wives, but such has not been the case from [the] beginning. "    1 Corinthians 7:2 "yet, because of prevalence of fornication, let each man have his own wife and each woman have her own husband." This verse shows it was not just for the clergy.|`|UV6osJh8aa	Well, the Mormons are!|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...why are you asking "Christians"...?   All of your references are from the Old Testament !!!

Please report my answer *****.|`|evStsOQiaa	God made the genetic changes from primitive man up until the modern human evolved. Then God stopped the genetic changes to the modern human because of perfecting us and keeping us from evolving any further. God did the same over the course of evolution to the rest of the life forms He has been creating on Earth for the last billions of years. Yahweh is and always has been the "missing link" in the chain of evolution.|`|a7IHVTNZaa	One possibility is found in Genesis 6. It talks about the Nephilim, the offspring of demons and humans.

HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY ARE HUMAN ?    Even in the standard view of evolution from simian to human,  there must be a point that it is one but not the other. This is insane.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	I don't need to explain it away.  People now are born with weird shaped skulls.  It happens.  More to the point, just because there are different shaped skulls does not mean that that skull evolved from a glob.  I'm sorry but it doesn't.  It's just like when people say plants changing traits is proof of evolution.  Micro-evolution is obvious and fact!

That's like saying, if you are aware of your intelligence then you are dumb. No, if you are aware of your intelligence, then you are aware that you do not know everything and will sometimes make dumb mistakes. Likewise, if you are aware of your humility, you are aware that you are not perfect in that humility because you are a human who makes dumb mistakes (assuming you are intelligent enough to realize that).
O7SshRl6aa	Would the installation of an elevator be a better short-term solution than a new building or building addition?

Our church is very comfortable, financially, and we have our fellowship area downstairs in the basement.  We find that sending our comfort moneys on missions is much more fruitful and our seniors use the chair to get up and downstairs.    We should all look to economical ways to use the space and abilities that we already have, rather than looking to why we cannot do certain things and thinking we need so much more than we really do.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	I'd pray, do some fundraising, give most of it to those in need, consider whether God wants your group "out there" instead of "in here" right now, and see what happens.

Don't pick me for BA.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	Maybe at one time all Catholic Nuns wore a head covering, but not all Nuns wear the traditional nun habit and veil today....though they still dress very conservatively.   A veil can symbolize modesty, being conservative and chastity.|`|lNtwpzpOaa	Canon 669 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law reads " 1 As a sign of their consecration and as a witness to poverty, religious are to wear the habit of their institute, determined in accordance with the institute's own law.  2 Religious of a clerical institute who do not have a special habit are to wear clerical dress, in accordance with canon 284." Canon 284 says "Clerics are to wear suitable ecclesiastical dress, in accordance with the norms established by the Episcopal Conference and legitimate local custom."     It should be noted that these requirements apply to all Religious; not only to nuns, but also to brothers and priests. It is unfortunate that some religious communities have chosen to mask their identity by adopting as their "uniform" a symbol which can be easily mistaken for a piece of costume jewelry. The ultimate authority for enforcing these requirements of canon law falls upon the bishops who are responsible for all Religious working in their dioceses.     http://www.scborromeo.org/glad/c12.htm|`|zURZtvufaa	Its a habit they have.|`|LLey4VRzaa	Because they cut their Hair and God in 1 corinthians 11 says that is what a women should do if she cuts her hair!|`|50zbKv0jaa	most of the orders were founded in the middle ages and they adopted the dress at he time of their founding, This has been modernised and many orders no longer have head coverings.  Interestingly monks and some ecclesiastical officers wear roman costume, the pope is also the pontiff maximus a pagan title.|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	I agree with the guy above me...the bible does tell women to wear the veil as it is a symbol of modesty and chastity. Even today you will find practising christian sects that use it like the mennonites and amish...And even images of the 'vigin mary' that are in churches etc depict her as wearing one.|`|Jc8rbyHXaa	Although the Apostle Paul said that women should cover their hair, Catholic Nuns covering their hair is taken from an ancient custom long before christianity and has nothing to do with Christian Biblical laws.  In ancient times, the wives of men of power used a head covering to alert the ordinary folks of her prestige; we see the same in the days of Mohammad...every one of his wives wore the the Hijab; it must be noted that contrary to what some Muslims think, Mohammad never commanded ordinary women to wear the Hijab; only that they dress modestly.  Following the same ancient pattern, Some Catholic nuns wear the head covering--or Habit,  to indicate that they are the wives of of the Church. A nuns habit alerts ordinary folks that they are  special; just like Mohammad's  wives were special, nuns are wives of God.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	a symbol of modesty, chastity and of dedicated celibacy in particular  In Eastern Christianity(Orthodox and Catholic) both monks and nuns "take the veil"|`|ql2fHxxlaa	Selam Fatima,    The Bible tells women to cover their hair:    1 Corinthians 11   1Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.    Propriety in Worship    2I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings,[a] just as I passed them on to you.    3Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 4Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 5And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her headit is just as though her head were shaved. 6If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. 7A man ought not to cover his head,[b] since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. 8For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 9neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 10For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.      11In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 12For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. 13Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 15but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 16If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practicenor do the churches of God.

Try to stay away from her or call the local police station.    Why not get a restraining order against her?|`|AA10620246	Everybody is entitled to their opinion, including you. If you don't like your neighbor, you don't have to have anything to do with her. You need to stand up for yourself. You won't get in trouble unless you assault or threaten the woman. Telling someone off is not a crime. Next time she tries to impose on you, tell her in no uncertain terms to mind her own damned business.

And my sexuality has encouraged me to study my faith far deeper than I might otherwise have. It is because of it that I took the time to learn Hebrew and Greek, to read scripture in the original languages, to study world and church history, and to write books about these things.

Ether 12  (from the book of Mormon)    27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.    I know these scriptures are about weakness, but I think it can be applied to bad things happening.

In answering this question, the first thing to consider is whether such a thing as the          even exists. According to the Bible, the heart is wicked and deceitful above all things (Jeremiah 17:9), and all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). Therefore, no one is          in the sense of being sinless. Sin entered the world when Adam and Even rebelled against God in the Garden of Eden, and mankind has been in rebellion ever since. Sins effects permeate everything, and the suffering we see all around us is a direct result of that sin.    But God did not leave us here to suffer pointlessly. Our loving and merciful God has a perfect plan to use that suffering to accomplish His threefold purpose. First, He uses pain and suffering to draw us to Himself so that we will cling to Him. Jesus said, In the world you shall have tribulation (John 16:33). Trials and distress are not something unusual in life; they are part of what it means to be human in a fallen world. In Christ we have an anchor that holds fast in all the storms of life, but if we never sail into those storms, how would we know that? It is in times of despair and sorrow that we reach out to Him, and, if we are His children, we always find Him there waiting to comfort and uphold us through it all. In this way, He proves His faithfulness to us and ensures that we will stay close to Him. An added benefit is that as we experience Gods comfort through trials, we are then able to comfort others in the same way (2 Corinthians 1:4).    Second, He proves to us that our faith is real through the suffering and pain that are inevitable in this life. How we respond to suffering is determined by the genuineness of our faith. Those with faith truly from God, the author and finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), will not be crushed by suffering, but will come through the trial with their faith intact, having been proven through fire so that it might be found to praise and honor and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 1:7). Those are the ones who do not shake their fists at God or question His goodness, but instead count it all joy (James 1:2), knowing that trials prove that they are truly the children of God. Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because having been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him (James 1:12).    Finally, God uses suffering to take our eyes off this world and put them on the next. The Bible continually exhorts us to not get caught up in the things of this world, but to look forward to the world to come. This world and all that is in it will pass away, but the kingdom of God is eternal. Jesus said, My kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36), and those who would follow Him must not see the things of this life, both good and bad, as the end of the story. Even the sufferings we endure and which seem so terrible are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed in us (Romans 8:18).    Could God prevent all suffering? Of course. But He assures us that all things work together for good to those who love God and are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28). So even suffering is part of the all things that God is using to accomplish His good purposes. His plan is perfect, His character is flawless, and those who trust Him will not be disappointed.|`|TEsq9K54aa	My condolences for the loss of your sister.    I wish there were reasons for stuff but it all seems pretty much random.  Guy-in-the-sky stuff defies reasonable thought so try not to go there.  .|`|U8yovU7yaa	No.  If there's good in the world then of course there's bad too. What counts is how you deal with it.  Something else it seems, is that as humans we are never content with what we have. Always focussing on the things we don't have and never appreciating the things we do.   We waste so much by doing this.   Don't live in the past, and don't live in the future, they are both distractions from the now. Live your life in the present|`|ji7gqCWxaa	Good things like bad things happen to everyone. we can't just focus on the bad.  I am in your exact situation, couple of years younger, but, living with the same impressions about life that has passed without return, yet I still wake up everyday, knowing in the deepest part of my being, that things do not stay the same. Every day carries a different flavor, a change, that if one drowned in negativity, will fail to see and use.  Couple of years back, I was few years ahead of my friends, by all means. I lost it all, I even lost myself, but, never lost that notion that life has its ways to offer you what it has taken away from you.  You just need to keep your mind awake, aware, and ready for those moments, cause chances do happen again. those are specifically designed for you and your life.   Good luck to you, and keep your chin up.|`|1GytoT0xaa	Bad things happen to everyone.|`|EGNX4tuxaa	First things first: I am a moderate atheist and was once a devout Christian.        The purpose of God isn't to fix all your problems.  What you have to do is fix your own problems and stop having faith that one day it will all work out.  You have a lot of life experience....  Did having faith and God start your two first businesses or was it your own hard work and determination?  All you can do is wake up everyday and work hard.  If you are going to have faith in anything then have faith that your own hard work will eventually pay off.  Life isn't easy; its not suppose to be easy.  There are always going to be people have worked half as hard for twice as much.  You can't let that get to you or get you down.  I'm not sure if you have a wife or girlfriend but I think that might help.  Having someone who loves you to get you through hard times is always the best way to do it.  And if one day you are fortunate enough to have kids then you have to strive everyday to provide them with the life skills that you wish you learned earlier so they can live a relaxing life.|`|fVDopUOZaa	How do you know you're a good person?

He never said that he did.    He calls himself I AM    We use the male identifier when referencing him.  It is easier that way.  Just as we tend to identify angels as female, they actually do not procreate at all.  They have no real gender , yet the names that they give us in the bible tend to seem to be male oriented forthe most part.|`|AA10852244	Hmmm, i think when they translated the text from hebrew they forgot that there is no such thing in hebrew as "it" in arabic too there is no such thing as it, so when they refer to something that they don't know what is it they call it "He".|`|DiIAaFgzaa	In Hebrew God is referred to with male and female attributes.

I think the whole Genesis story is an allegory to explain why life is the way it is:  why there is joy and suffering, why we have to work, why we have to grow crops and harvest them, why childbirth hurts, etc. but I don't believe the story was EVER intended to be taken literally.      So, I don't believe in a talking snake.  (I know:; boo, hissssssss...!)|`|EAuMJrs4aa	Serpent is a word of Latin origin (from serpens, serpentis "something that creeps, snake") that is commonly used in a specifically mythic or religious context, signifying a snake that is to be regarded not as a mundane natural phenomenon nor as an object of scientific zoology, but as the bearer of some symbolic value.    Chthonic serpents and sacred trees    In many myths the chthonic serpent (sometimes a pair) lives in or is coiled around a Tree of Life situated in a divine garden. In the Genesis story of the Torah and Biblical Old Testament the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is situated in the Garden of Eden together with the tree of immortality. In Greek mythology Ladon coiled around the tree in the garden of the Hesperides protecting the entheogenic golden apples.      Under yet another Tree (the Bodhi tree of Enlightenment), the Buddha sat in ecstatic meditation. When a storm arose, the mighty serpent king Mucalinda rose up from his place beneath the earth and enveloped the Buddha in seven coils for seven days, not to break his ecstatic state.    The Vision Serpent was also a symbol of rebirth in Mayan mythology, fuelling some cross-Atlantic cultural contexts favored in pseudoarchaeology. The Vision Serpent goes back to earlier Maya conceptions, and lies at the center of the world as the Mayans conceived it. "It is in the center axis atop the World Tree. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power". (Schele and Friedel, 1990: 68)    Sometimes the Tree of Life is represented (in a combination with similar concepts such as the World Tree and Axis mundi or "World Axis") by a staff such as those used by shamans. Examples of such staffs featuring coiled snakes in mythology are the caduceus of Hermes, the Rod of Asclepius, the staff of Moses, and the papyrus reeds and deity poles entwined by a single serpent Wadjet, dating to earlier than 3000 BCE. The oldest known representation of two snakes entwined around a rod is that of the Sumerian fertility god Ningizzida. Ningizzida was sometimes depicted as a serpent with a human head, eventually becoming a god of healing and magic. It is the companion of Dumuzi (Tammuz) with whom it stood at the gate of heaven. In the Louvre, there is a famous green steatite vase carved for king Gudea of Lagash (dated variously 22002025 BCE) with an inscription dedicated to Ningizzida. Ningizzida was the ancestor of Gilgamesh, who according to the epic dived to the bottom of the waters to retrieve the plant of life. But while he rested from his labor, a serpent came and ate the plant. The snake became immortal, and Gilgamesh was destined to die.  Ancient North American serpent imagery often featured rattlesnakes.    Ningizzida has been popularised in the 20th C. by Raku Kei Reiki (a.k.a. "The Way of the Fire Dragon") where "Nin Giz Zida" is believed to be a fire serpent of Tibetan rather than Sumerian origin. Nin Giz Zida is another name for the ancient Hindu concept of Kundalini, a Sanskrit word meaning either "coiled up" or "coiling like a snake". Kundalini refers to the mothering intelligence behind yogic awakening and spiritual maturation leading to altered states of consciousness. There are a number of other translations of the term usually emphasizing a more serpentine nature to the word e.g. 'serpent power'. It has been suggested by Joseph Campbell that the symbol of snakes coiled around a staff is an ancient representation of Kundalini physiology. The staff represents the spinal column with the snake(s) being energy channels. In the case of two coiled snakes they usually cross each other seven times, a possible reference to the seven energy centers called chakras.    In Ancient Egypt, where the earliest written cultural records exist, the serpent appears from the beginning to the end of their mythology. Ra and Atum ("he who completes or perfects") became the same god, Atum, the "counter-Ra," was associated with earth animals, including the serpent: Nehebkau ("he who harnesses the souls") was the two headed serpent deity who guarded the entrance to the underworld. He is often seen as the son of the snake goddess Renenutet. She often was confused with (and later was absorbed by) their primal snake goddess Wadjet, the Egyptian cobra, who from the earliest of records was the patron and protector of the country.|`|117deabf91c1ed299801ae60363d0378aa	No. But the serpent in the Garden of Eden could talk 6000 years ago, just like all animals before the flood! :)|`|c7pbvYmpaa	only a talking parrot|`|aV3bFchtaa	Nope, no talking snake.

There are though lots of Christians who see that story as an allegorical tale not meant to be taken literally. Then there are the Biblical literalists who take the story at absolute face value.

I guess like so many other things that we know in our guts are right, it will still take years/generations for the stigma to drop.  Far as a statement for encouragement, something Gloria Steinem asked in one of her books comes to mind:  "Why do we take the blame more easily than we take the praise," especially in parenting.  Don McLean's song Vincent comes to mind too, "This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you."  I think it's true too, for surprise suicides of those who gave no intimation, that we can never fully understand another person, just ourselves, and for those who did create doubt before they did it, that nothing we could have said or done could have prevented it, like Spalding Gray.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	there's only this one..."I'm here for you if you need me"....    there's nothing any of us can say or do that will do anything to ease the mind and heart of a parent when a child has taken that road or anyone, really........ just hug them .... and mean it when you say that ....|`|e4kIX7WZaa	Tough one, there are books out there, maybe you can suggest one.|`|ZeKnInbjaa	well in the video that was dedicated to aaliyah dmx said something like "you are really going to be missed here but I can see why God would want you close to him...because you truly were an angel on earth."|`|f9269cf9fa662fc5360d3c82afdf9320aa	May you find comfort in the good memories that your loved one has left you to cherish and remember (him/her) by.|`|ftuE6Mfdaa	I'm with Ron. My best friend committed suicide in 1999 and it still haunts me. I still find myself feeling guilty even though it wasn't my fault. However, no amount of rationalizing, explainging, etc. can help. So many people would say "Well, his pain is over now" or "He's in a better place." That only ticked me off; people say that to make themselves feel better, not to make the bereft person feel better.     The best thing that happened for me was a friend who wrote me a card that said "This really sucks." I knew that she understood and that made me feel better.|`|AA10672774	I am so sorry for your loss.|`|G9FiXGvmaa	Some people just lose their way.

AA11155064	All sounds wonderful... but....    Any one alone may well be sufficient: is going for all too contrived?   Is planning a full day a little lacking in spontaneity .... and not giving him much option for what he may choose to do ?     Maybe he has a surprise planned for you, and conforming to your schedule may mean his preparations/ expenses/ emotions are denied/ wasted/ second tracked? Is there alone/ self-expression time factored in?     As luvs2bhrd says, chocolate making may not be to every male's ideal . Unless they have a prior track record of interest,  it could become a tedious obligation endured through with gritted teeth for diplomacy.

cZRJgQbXaa	Hi! I would recommed that you learn Korean. The only reason I say this (though the argument is pretty convincing) is that Korean has an incredibly easy writing system. Japanese on the otherhand will take you weeks to memorise the most basic characters, and will take you years to be able to read even a children's book or a public notice.(2500+ characters)    Korean uses a writing system called 'Hangul'. It is based on an alphbet with very few characters(about the same number as English), and actually works better than ours! So you will find it easier to navigate around Korea if you actually know how to read.    As far as learning spoken Japanese and Korean, either are quite difficult. One again though, I would have to err on the side of Korean as being easier to pick up how to speak. If you can read well, then get the hang of grammar faster in texts and therefore pick up listening faster.     Here is a link to a site I find quite good (despite its ruggard basic appearance) It will take you through the basics of Hangul.    http://www.langintro.com/kintro/first.ht...      By the way - I am not at all biased towards Koean if you are wondering, I actually have studied Japanese for years, and am up to a high proficiency in it - I think it is an excellent language. I have also dabbled in Korean a little bit (and learned Hangul - in a couple of days) merely out of interest. I just think that from your position, being interested in going to the country without years of learning beforehand, it would be easier for you to pick up Korean. Sure there are less resources for learning Korean - but there are enough. There is always the internet which is packed full of everything that you need.    Whatever you pick, best of luck! Don't give up, you have a hard road but rewarding road ahead!  |`|VIDh3oUVaa	well i know spanish english and japanese.... i suggest u to learn japanese.. its not a complicated language its even easier than spanish or many other languages besides japan is a nice place xD!     i hope i helped xD! good luck!|`|B7C5PPgdaa	you can enrich your Japanese Vocabulary and Kanji at http://japaneseclass.jp/vocablvl1.php its fun! just like playing game  its a good practice  and its free!    http://japaneseclass.jp

Certainly one should not take the Lord's name in vain -- such as ejecting "Oh my G---" or "J--- C---" into a conversation as if they were cuss words. One should not mockingly make the sign of the Cross (as VP Joe Biden did right before his inauguration dance with Jilly) or make jokes about virgin births or the pope or anything like that.     If taking a business associate out for a meal on a Friday, it would be wise to choose a restaurant that offers a fish or vegetarian option. Some Catholics still give up meat on Fridays, while others do some sort of volunteer work or spend extra time in prayer.|`|yQNit56Qaa	sparki gave a good answer.  Some other things to consider:    Expect alcohol.  The old adage, "Wherever you find four Catholics, you'll find a fifth" has a lot of truth to it.  Certainly not all Catholics drink, but Roman Catholicism does not dissuade alcohol consumption.    Generally, Roman Catholics do not have special restrictions of any sort - including Holy Days of Obligation.  On those days they must attend religious service (which normally lasts about an hour) - but there is no other requirement on such days.  On Ash Wednesday, expect to see a dark smudge on the person's forehead.  During Lent, expect that the person might have "given up" something that they normally enjoy (for example, "desserts" or "beer" or whatever).  If I am not mistaken, fasting is still required of adults on Lenten Fridays.

AA11114869	In that morality is a human social construct, - ANY 'evil' act can be perceived as a 'good' act, and vice versa...    There is only one true moral, - and this moral is rooted in man's drive for self-preservation;...  ...man's drive to seek out that which 'pleases', - and avoid that which 'displeases'.  This moral is that which is commonly know as --- 'Good'.    So what, then, is that which we call --- 'Evil'?...    'Evil' is not really the moral counterpoint of 'Good' at all...  Rather, - it is the definition given to those conditions which are brought about by one's failure to avoid displeasure,...  ... particularly when one's failure to avoid displeasure is directly related to another's success in achieving pleasure.    In this,...  ...the idea of theft, rape, murder, etc..., may seem to us as 'wrong', but it is only this way because our natural desire to pursue that which would 'please' us is overridden by our desire to avoid 'displeasure', - the displeasure being that which our society besets upon when we pursue those pleasure-seeking 'desires' which our society has deemed detrimental to the survival of the group as a whole;... self-preservation via social conformity.    Morality, and all of its interpretations, are not fixed; they are mutable...    One man's right is another man's wrong...  One man's pleasure is another man's pain...  One man's good is another man's evil...    ...and one man's God becomes another man's Devil,...  ... when the Devil's name is "Master"...  -|`|lHg9ZqwJaa	According to the bible, if god tells you that you should commit genocide, you MUST obey...

UQTAN7cgaa	what are you implying?    to another respondent - there is no New World Order. 1) the Bavarian Illuminati (whom everyone thinks of when they hear the term) died out within 10 years of being formed, they coined the phrase New World Order, no modern group using this name can claim lineage to that group 2) there was a band in the 80's of the same name, no relation.    freemasonry is not, and has never been, involved in any new world order conspiracy and does not seek world domination.     there is no single person or group that speaks for all of freemasonry, it has no central authority; the founding fathers of the USA, who were freemasons, did not want to form a central, federal government. people wanted to make washington king and he declined.    people who think otherwise are grossly mistaken about freemasonry    that said, there is nothing stopping an individual freemason from being a politician, 14 presidents have been, many members of congress are, but there is no organized plan or scheme for them to unite and control things...|`|Ofx0LpMlaa	i dont know,but i know a good stonemason,he maybe able to help with this ill ring him tommorow if you want,let me no please|`|fkQUCwUhaa	because they try to cover up and deny they are PART of the new world order.|`|rTmYpDTPaa	Is the problem perhaps is that Masons are not giving you the answer you WANT to hear? Could it be that is because the answer you want to hear is not the correct or factual one?  It is difficult to provide much factual information about a premise that does not exist. As such there is nothing to answer about political motivations of Freemasonry. As with matters of faith and religion, the Fraternity has no political position, the choice of both being an individual choice of each member based on their personal beliefs and the dictates of their own mind, heart, and conscious.   Sorry if that disappoints you, but it is the fact of the matter.

G50T2zPFaa	I don't think of people who hold these views as "inhuman." I think that people like you have really good observation of human nature and the problems in the world in comparison to others around them. It's unfortunately not that common, but there are plenty of people like you. I can see why you might think of it as "inhuman"; its almost as if there's a glass screen through which you can see what no one has noticed before, but no one else can see through it. What I suggest doing for now is raising awareness about the major problems in humanity.|`|Ofx0LpMlaa	Are we human or are we dancers?

b9dae40ef8a10998c029b6d46aa0359daa	Buddha means "the one who woke up" or the "Awakened one" Buddhas nature is enlightenment, Maya is enlightenment to the awakened.|`|MzKTLRgpaa	What isn't the Buddha Nature?|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	the state of being like a buddha, or in buddha-hood.    buddha tells us that he is not a god, that any human can be a buddha, thus we all have buddha nature inside us, or at least we have the potential.    buddha nature is non-attachment arising from the knowledge that we are all connected, and not separate. so if we're all interconnected, you can't lose anything, you can't want anything, you're not separate from anything, it's all part of one big system. desire is removed simply because we already have everything.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	The Buddha nature pursues the goal of the belief and what one needs to do to achieve the goal, which is Nirvana.   Although beyond Nirvana is yet another path to actually becoming One with One, or Union with God.    It is a life seeking to become "neutral" or detachment from the illusion of life.  But since one has a Fate Karma that one must complete in this life, one must be about that as well.  Primarily living the Buddha nature is seeking to create no new Karma while accepting what happens as a paying off ones own Karmic "due bills".    This "nature" is largely theoretical and a desire to achieve as most believe it most difficult to maintain outside of a monastery.    Peace|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	It's a similar concept to the Christ Consciousness.    Buddhists define it as pure consciousness, the true Self.|`|AA11736322	Buddha Nature    Buddhata. The Buddha-nature, gnosis, enlightenment; potential bodhi remains in every gati, all have the capacity for enlightenment; for the Buddha-nature remains in all as wheat-nature remains in all wheat. This nature takes two forms: The Noumenal, in the absolute sense, unproduced and immortal, and The Phenomenal, in action. While every one possesses the Buddha-nature, it requires to be cultivated in order to produce its ripe fruit.|`|5FXx0Mymaa	Mu     The whole point of buddha nature is that it transcends labels, among other things, and to label something as having the buddha nature is to defeat it.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G According to non-magical readings of the lotus sutra, and Daisaku Ikeda's explanation, in American terms, the Buddha nature is the awareness of the inseparability of life aspects from a grain of sand to the most enlightened human, and the compassion to spread that awareness.|`|XnQWpUZMaa	This is a term said in Mahayana and Vajrayana schools.    There are two aspects of Buddha Nature:    1) the ability to become Buddha (in future): All Buddhas were once unenlightened lay people, like us. They learned and practiced the noble path, and finally attained Buddhahood. All sentient beings have the same capability to do so, as long as they learn and follow the same path. This ability to become Buddha in future is called Buddha Nature.    2) Emptiness: Buddha is dependently arisen, being so means empty in inherent-nature. All sentient beings are also dependently arisen, and are thus also empty in inherent-nature. These two emptiness are the same emptiness, no difference in them. This emptiness is also called the Buddha Nature.     Regardless of which definitions, having Buddha Nature doesn't mean one is already a Buddha. One still have to eliminate all afflictions, perfect all virtues before one become a Buddha.|`|czXaUPIlaa	Buddha-nature is the inherent capacity of all beings to abide in wisdom and compassion.    In the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism, all beings are said to have Buddha-nature.     However, most human beings don't realize that they have this capacity within them. Our tendencies toward desire, anger, and ignorance obscure our ability to reveal our inherent wisdom and compassion. As a result, many of our impulses and actions produce suffering (for ourselves and others), rather than joy.    We can discover our own Buddha-nature simply by letting go of our self-centered mind-habits. When we do this, our Buddha-nature immediately appears.     Of course, this is easier said than done (for most of us) and so the Buddha taught a series of practices - meditation, chanting, etc. - which, if done consistently and with great seriousness, will lesson our self-absorbed ways of living.    When we fully let go of self-absorption, the resulting state is called enlightenment. This is the state when the light of Buddha-nature shines forth.|`|5fmPj6uEaa	pacifistic, loving and life respecting,being true to the good within yourself and the universe.|`|QXM51gP6aa	I am not enlightened and I am just an ordinary man.

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Seems to have gotten better.  No more pregnancy to worry (or have to contracept against--always had a problem with contraceptives diminishing eveyrthing).  Orgasms are more varied then when younger; sometimes they come on real fast with little preparation or expectation.  At other times they are slower in coming but then go on and on and on and then there's this longish period after when it's like one of those cars even though the engine is off it just keeps sort of doesn't shut off for a while.  What's changed is tightness, even the gyno noticed (like being a virgin all over again) and wetness but there are lots of lubs available (and we don't need to worry about whether they are latex safe).  And time--at night we're usually too tired to do anything but sleep but now we have afternoons and mornings and sometimes all day.  We both know our bodies really well and aren't shy about asking for things or saying "to your left more" or whatever.  There are limitations since the joints won't do as they used to, but in general it's a whole lot better now.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	I'll answer for the old lady I am having sex with.

When does that happen? Seriously, my libido was never greater than when I started menopause.  Post menopause I find it undiminished, granted I entered early but so did puberty.   Periods dictate your sexual life/activity, pregnancy and birth control et al. One is ruled by the calender, the spectre of the "time of the month" the PMT, the sore breasts, the "bloating and water retention".  Where is the sexual liberation in that? Where is the sexual spontaneity?   Menopause, is like puberty,, cutting teeth, toilet training, getting Alzheimer's (lol),it is a natural phenomena.   I have found that those who agonise over nature have a tougher time dealing with it than those who embrace it.   In my line of work I have seen octogenarians have good sexual relations with one another.   Get rid of your preconceived ideas, stop seeing "age" as some sort of disability and recognise that we all need intimacy and love regardless. .  Go with the flow.|`|YA2TzdRxaa	Absolutely! Remember the old saying, "If you don't use it, you lose it?" It's true. It just gets better and better.            A young lover helps of course.

Symptoms like vaginal dryness, moodiness resulting in a lack of sex drive and disinterest in your partner are very common as the natural hormones decrease. It will be a good idea that you get anything you can to encourage your libido so that you can have better sex life.|`|7fHsyHYraa	Let me just say that the old grey mare she ain't what she used to be.

My orgasms are not always as strong as they used to be but I'm still having fun.|`|8G42oyydaa	Initially I lost all sexual desire, it could have been part of the seven breast surgeries I had in 14 months, but believe me, zero interest.     I couldnt even fake it.    That was 4 1/2 years ago , it came back after I had my last surgery, and by then you are well "into" menopause and I guess your body adjusts to the changes and things get back to normal.. My last relationship wasnt meeting those needs either. :-(       It affects different women different ways, there is no "common" experience.  It also depends on your partner and how loving a relationship you have. It could depend on whether you were still fertile before menopause, I had my tubes tied after my daughter was born, two children were enough for me. So pregnancy wasnt a worry before menopause.     Hey Lynn ! You and me, LOL, you are NOT alone after all|`|28eea98fddd54ae673d51f8522541419aa	Yes, The desire increased greatly once the fear of pregnancy was gone. Everything about it seems better.

There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!

If He just snapped His fingers and forgave everyone with the shedding of blood, then He would have punished all the past sinners unjustly.

So, God needed to allow Jesus to die for us because Jesus took on all the sins of the world on the cross when He died, even though He was without sin Himself.  Then, Jesus rose from the dead on the third day and ascended to heaven. Now, when we become Christians, we accept Jesus into our life as our Lord and Savior forever. When we do this, we receive God's Holy Spirit in our life, who raised Jesus from the dead. We then receive God's forgiveness and blessing, protection and guidance as well as go to heaven to be with God forever after we die. Faith in God is a gift from God. If you are seeking God, you can pray for the faith to believe in Him, preferably by praying with a Christian.
AA11471252	Instead of getting her jewelry, like every one else does...do something interesting.     Try taking her out to a local hospital and visit with some of the kids/sick people who are cooped up for valentines.

These are some really great ways to spend quality time together and really get to know one another.     Go to your local veterans hospital and spend some time talking to a few of the great men and women who help keep us safe.    What a great way to show love for one another, and each other.

FyHaU0D6aa	Neither of them is correct, unfortunately. You cannot qualify we with dozens of people in English, as you can in Chinese. Youd have to change the sentence altogether:    Dozens of us ate together, or We were dozens there who ate together. (Its not clear from the question whether there is ONE dozen or SEVERAL dozens of people eating together)    |`|AA10982716	You can't say "dozen of person". Person is singular and "dozens" is plural.    You can say "dozens of people" (means at least 25, probably more like 50 people. People is plural. If it is only twelve people, say "a dozen people"--but people aren't usually thought of in individual dozens. ).    "We dozens of people" however sounds very odd. "Dozens of us ate together" or "We ate together by the dozens" sounds better.|`|fMZWxzaRaa	Hmm... I can see what you want to say, but they're both incorrect. You could say, A dozen people ate together. Or: We ate together. Or: A dozen of us ate together. That last suggestion would probably be the best.|`|nUi1nujEaa	I think it should be---  A dozen of us ate together  AND  Dozens of us ate together|`|0iZrEgSbaa	I believe they are both incorrect.

TneDU9R3aa	This belief is lacking in a few respects:    Really it is desiring or coveting things for materialistic reasons that makes you unhappy.    You might:  Want a gf  Want more money  Want to know more  Want to be dressed better  Want to dance better  Want to run faster  Want to play the piano  Want a faster car..    If you want a gf to make you happy; then you think that having a gf will cover up for your lack of inner contentedness. You'd be reaching outside of yourself to attain happiness, which is materialistic    If you want more money; so you can buy more things; so you can show off, or buy more gadgets; so you can have a better retirement; so more girls will like you; so your kids can go to a better school  than the poor kids etc: All these reasons are materialistic    If you want to know more in order to make more money for materialistic reasons; or you want to impress people for pride in intellect, then your being materialistic.    Get the idea.     What if you do things for non materialistic reasons:  You answer a question on yahoo answers so that you develop your own capability to express your knowledge and help others better.  You get a better job so you can get involved in a project you really think you can make a positive difference to, because of your education or enthusiasm    All things you want in life should be desired for a selfless reason. You may not get what you want always; but if you don't allow yourself to be perturbed by failure or success, then you can say you are above the water (neither sinking in failure or being smashed by a wave of success).

That way, your club can host field trips to museums, theatre shows, cafs, etc.    Are any of the members thinking about having a career in something related with French? If so, perhaps you can invite college professors to talk about majoring in French/teaching the language at the university level. How about writing a French newspaper for the school or putting on French plays?|`|eFYHP24Laa	What about a fashion. France is almost the Fashion Capital of the world. You guys can fundraise by organizing a fashion show using the clothes made by your own culture or the fashion that's being wore in France nowadays. Then you guys would have something to talk about and plan for every sigle week. There would be a reason for the members to attend because they have to practice. How about that? the fundraising part will be in how much you sell the tickets. and Oh by the way, don't forget to collect money at least 5 dollars from the models. That would help a little bit, and 5 dollars is not a big money for the models to complain about. so ya  hope that helped.|`|c0eddd97ccdd030d66f6488679dbb208aa	pretend to be in a resturaunt get a maitre d', a waitress etc and have the conversation   like saying my fork is dirty I'll have steak, can i have a mint wohat would u like as an hor d'oeurves  all in fraincais je sais c'est tres magnifique! je suis une eleve de francais aussi but  i am in middle school
v1zyfea5aa	Sin=rebellion against God.  When we are under the blood of Christ, God forgives the rebellion because Jesus, His son acts as our Defense attorney(if you will) and defeats our accuser, satan.    However, that doesn't mean we don't have to suffer the earthly consequences of our rebellion.  A very simple earthly example is that while God will forgive our sexual immorality, it doesn't mean you won't have the STD the rest of your life.  While he may forgive our murder, it doesn't mean you get let out of jail.  I personally know believers in both of those situations.  The difference is they still can trust God, regardless of circumstance.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	To sin means to fall short of the glory of God    Rom 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;|`|RC5RAzykaa	Sin is transgression of the law    1st John 3:4  Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.     The wage of sin is death    Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.     We are talking about spiritual death.    If by "hell" you mean the lake of fire, which is the second death (the spiritual death)  sin will send you there, unless you confess your sins.    1st John 1:9  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.     Repentance is required as well:    Luke 13:5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.    Acts 3:19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;    But the most important thing is believe upon Jesus:    John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish (the lake of fire) but have everlasting life.    Sin IS a sentence to the lake of fire, except that we repent of(turn away from) and confess our sins, and believe that Jesus paid the price for our sins.    If we continue to sin, we show that the love of God is not in is.  Remember that sin is transgression of the LAW!    If you break any of the Ten Commandments (LAW)and do not turn from this sin, you are in deep trouble    We are under grace, but grace is never to be used as an excuse for sin.  If you think breaking the Ten Commandments is excusable, you show yourself to love sin.  You will die the second death if you love sin.    I tell you the truth.  Many people keep the Ten Commandments in all but one.  The Holy Sabbath is Saturday, the seventh day. break the Holy Sabbath and you sin, you transgress the Law.    James 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.     If you are guilty of failing to keep the Holy Sabbath, and you do not repent of this, you are guilty of breaking the WHOLE LAW!    This means very simply that a person who breaks the Holy Sabbath is guilty of  1 not loving God  2 being an idolater  3 taking the Lords name in vain  4 not keeping the Sabbath (as defined)  5 dishonoring father and mother  6 murder  7 adultery  8 stealing  9 bearing false witness against your neighbor  10 coveting your neighbors wife and posessions    Fail to keep the Holy Sabbath and you are a murderer!  Not my words, but Gods!    The Holy Sabbath begins at sundown Friday and ends sundown Saturday, this has been, and always will be the case.|`|d8XND5ngaa	I am going to burn in hell because I didn't know some guy??|`|LUGWyWrLaa	yes, for the most part.  Unrepented sin is.  A sentence to hell is denying God exists and refusing Jesus as our personal savior.  The bible also says that if we sin after knowing it is a sin, there is no sacrafice to cover it.  In other words, we know it's a sin and we do it anyway, that is not covered by the saving blood of Christ.  Once we recieve forgivness for a sin we must repent of it.  Meaning to not do it again.  The bible also says that all people will have the opportunity to accept Jesus before his return.  We either do or we don't.  Plain and simple|`|AA10556726	Imaginary, just like God or any other gods.

mr0Hb5fvaa	jabez is a famous old testament man who prayed to God very simply. His prayer is good for many situations. It also helps (teens in this case) learn how to pray to god with an open heart. pretty good. =)|`|Xt4n9h40aa	1 Chronicles 4:9-10 is the only place where Jabez is mentioned in the Bible...    "Jabez was honorable above his brothers;  but his mother named him Jabez [sorrow maker], saying, Because I bore him in pain.  Jabez cried to the God of Israel, saying, Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my border, and that Your hand might be with me, and You would keep me from evil so it might not hurt me!  And God granted his request." (1 Chr. 4:9-10 ~ Amplified Bible)    I gave my son "The Prayer of Jabez for Kids" and he really enjoyed it.  Plus when I was Youth Pastor I gave one ("The Prayer of Jabez for Teens") to every teen in my group and they liked it too.  I'd say go for it, give her the book.  It wouldn't hurt giving it to her, but it may if you don't.

HgdQMWuDaa	Life is a common thing in the universe...  look up the drake equation. reasonable calculations estimate 500 intelligent civilizations in the galaxy alone!! There are 3,000 observed galaxies and an estimated 125 billion in the universe...    religion is absolutely bogus as far as using it for anything but cherry picked morality.  i'm sure it wouldn't change anyone's beliefs if any other modern scientific revolution hasn't yet, ie stemcell or evolution.      life on mars, from a religious perspective, may possibly be another bullshit well god did that to test our faith for him type explanation... a molding to attach a worn out dogma of our planet being the only to harbor life, in a god's plan, onto a science when it is incompatible and no longer works.... it won't change anything people love their religions and dogmas. especially in america. much more theist than any other developed democracy. i wish it would, but i do not have much faith in the religious when it comes to science.... they believe their dogmas somehow stand up to the rigorous need for proof and fact that science demands in every one of its claims. they seem to see their dogma as an equal alternative.... when it embarassing-ly so,  is not an equal alternative. religions seem to be slow on the whole science thing and will be quick to claim something extroirdinary like it was a test by god after their denial of the facts of life outside earth are no longer tenable.  i doubt from the moment we find out their is life, not from detailed calculations but from physical evidence, religions will say it is true in the sense that, yes there is life outside of here.    I am hopeful we do find life as it seems to be a possibility.  everything used to be hotter, as it took a long time for the universe to cool down after the big bang. it is absolutely reasonable to think that mars had life during a time in which it had a similar climate to us. an incredible  find it surely would be!|`|AA10311549	I would suppose it would depend on one's specific system of belief.      I find it quite arrogant for people to assume that the entire universe contains us humans as its only intelligent life.    Of course according to the "Manifesto for the Christian Churches" of the Fundamentalists, if the Bible -- in its most literal and inerrant interpretation -- disagrees with ANY other "truth' from any other source, then that other source MUST be considered wrong.    Therefore, if life IS found on Mars say in the form of bacteria or other form -- and through DNA analysis it CAN be determined if it had a separate origin from life on earth -- they would simply refuse to "believe" it as they so determinedly disbelieve all manner of scientific truth.    As for other more rational people (other Christians included) truth MUST be one.  Most people already KNOW that scriptures are NOT to be taken as the literal all pervasive source of all knowledge and has been frequently known to be contradicted by information we have gained from scientific investigation.

However the religious fanatics are sure to find a way to "explain" everything, just like they do with every other obstacle that religion encounters.     Either that, or they will deny it's very existence and/or validity to the bitter end, like they do with the FACT of evolution.

We have martian meteorites on Earth.  There are certainly terrestrial meteorites on Mars.  There are bacteria that could survive both the vacuum of space and reentry.    You would have to show they are not related to life on Earth.  However, if they were, then life could have started on Mars and moved to Earth.

KS2OHXCRaa	The figure of Hope, in this image, was blindfolded (symbolism of unable to see what tomorrow may bring, that there's darkness in life), sitting on the globe (representing the world) and trying to play/make music (music being the sweet things in life) on a broken lyre that has only one string left (representing the final chance that one has).     A futile attempt? Perhaps. But with even just that one chord remaining, if one is willing to try, one may still be rewarded with music.    Watts himself once explained that "Hope need not mean expectancy. It suggests here rather the music which can come from the remaining chord".     In short, one who has hope doesn't necessarily expect things to go exactly how it should be, but things are still not completely impossible even at the darkest/lowest point. Therefore, the audicity to hope. To dare to hope.|`|BC9nPXG7aa	a girl in love with music|`|KvCSSVyAaa	The Man is supposed to be the Woman holding the Scales of Justice.

It's really difficult, if not impossible, to imagine how someone can just exist eternally, but that's the case with God.  He's always been and always will be. We can't wrap our brains around that because we're human and those rules don't apply in the world He created for us.      I also wonder if God has friends, or family. It's hard to think that he wouldn't get lonley if he doesn't, but I guess that just more human thinking.

X8LNbaKQaa	Yes.  Religion is no business of the U.S. government (I assume this is where you are from).  The government should be strictly uninvolved and completely neutral about anything religious (as long as crime is not involved), since that is the only way it can avoid infringing on its citizen's free expression of their own, widely varying religious beliefs.  Every time the government does anything that favors one religion, it diminishes the equality if every citizen who is not of that persuasion.  And that goes against the stated principles the country was founded upon.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|1xMTNTgkaa	Yes. Even though I am a person of faith. It does not belong in a government in a country with so much diversity. It also should not be in schools -except for free time.

The only "irrational" is the fundamentalist enterprise, and it's clinging to old superstitions as a basis for truth....our rationalism should be founded on the same basic principals all decent societies are founded upon - that Justice should guide us above all things.

I don't care what it says on money, in the pledge, or at a courthouse building. If the money works for secular purposes I am satisfied. If patriotism is learned by saying the pledge I am satisfied. If a judge rules by law rather than by bible I am satisfied. The part that bothers me is the special treatment received by the churches. They all have tax exempt status. Churches are businesses too. They should meet the same requirements that other businesses do for tax exempt status. Otherwise they should pay taxes on their earnings as well as the property that they own. This one change could be enough to relieve individuals of unnecessary taxes, which could lead us straight out of recession.|`|z74a7wvlaa	And also ripped the Constitution of America 'cus the founding forefathers signed on "Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven".

To answer your question - He is already removed. There is supposed to be separation between church and state. However, today it is not. Most everyone has foresaken the real God and has now taken own the State as their new Godhead. And it is probably people like you who would turn people like me over to the State to be crucified for a few bucks or a hot meal.

Just discovered, Constitution does not actually say "separation of Church and State" darn, it should have, as that was the intent. Most of the founding fathers, although church affiliated, were agnostic in reality.  If they could see us now I'm sure they'd come back and be more specific.    Let it live on the money, I don't care, but do take it out of our laws and our public schools. 10 Com. is not a bad guieline, I'm all for not killing.

Our ancestors escaped a country where they we're constantly ridiculed for their belief and faith for God, OUR GOD, and here we are today basically saying they did everything in vain! Look around the world of today and of yesteryears, has it occurred to you guys that we are the most blessed country on earth. We are by far the youngest country around, but yet we are the greatest. Everyone hates us for that. It says in the Bible to not be of this world, for this world is of pure evil, so for 200 plus years we have not been of this world and have put God first and in control of this country, in return God has blessed us beyond any other country on earth. If you don't like or agree with how we opened up shop in 1776, then get out! There's a country out there for every type of faith you could ask for, find a country that fits your belief or your taste in government! Just remember over here in the USofA, we believe in the king above all kings, the one and only messiah, our Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ! My advice to you though if you decide to get out, would be pack a Bible, it's nasty out there. Luke 23:24 "Forgive them for they know not what they do". Go ahead call me a radical and give me the thumbs down!|`|84FT1Kznaa	I don't think so because wasn't the country based on religion to start with! that's why our fore fathers came here to the new world anyway..so that they could worship god freely and not be beat or whipped for it and even put to death!the U.S has forgot what we are all about.. we have become to free!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	If YOU can be allowed in rational society WHAT CAN'T ?|`|2Hot9EJiaa	There may be a supreme court in our government, but I can tell you there is Someone who is more Supreme than that.

ALL who truly believe we must humble ourselves and pray, and seek His face, and turn from His wicked ways, then and only then will God forgive our sins and heal our land.     I answer to THE HIGH SUPREME GOD!!|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	Yes.|`|k03dYskYaa	On the contrary, I'm looking forward to the time when God removes the human governments, and establishes an earthly paradise with His Son as King.

yB0nVXfWaa	Since you have had responses from humanists and spiritualist new agers, it seems only fair and right for you to have an answer from a Bible-believing Christian - just in case you thought their answers were the only picture there was.    I don't expect you to take this on board, because it is the fashion now for people to sneer at us when we try to warn you about these things, but in concern for you I must at least try.  If nobody says you nay, then you might think there's no problem.    Firstly, let me say that I really do believe that there are such things you call 'ghosts' but we Christians know them as spirits, and the sort that manifest to people are the evil variety.  They do this in order to entice people so as to get an inroad into their lives and a measure of control over them.    If your grandmother and ggm were both psychics it's not surprising that this has passed down to you.  Psychics are just people who are mediums, through whom these evil spirits work and they seek to pass down the family line to the next one on the death of their host.  Now, they are courting you and I wonder what happened with your mother - didn't she give them any 'encouragement'?    People who open themselves up to these spirits - through seances, tarot cards, ouija, fortune-telling, witchcraft, spiritualism, etc. (there's a long list) - do not sleep well at nights.  They experience things that most of us do not in the spiritual realm, but they are not happy, balanced people, and what they are doing is taking them further and further away from any hope of saving faith, for these things are at emnity with God.      If only you could see how vicious evil spirits are, you would run a mile!  Even though they may put on a sweet and charming front (and some do), surely you don't want this for yourself and your future little ones?  Surely you want to 'walk clear' of such things?  Spiritualists will tell you otherwise, but I am telling you they are lying, and your conscience will tell you which of us is right.    So, you're not crazy.  These things do indeed exist in the invisible, spirit world, but you will be crazy if you let any kind of fascination lead you forward in this matter.  If you want to know more and discuss further, then send me a Yahoo message.|`|1f2movZZaa	You're definitely not crazy, and your definitely not the only one. I know quite a few people who can see ghosts, and I've seen them myself. I've seen bad spirits do thinks like blow doors open (not like a wind... like kicking the door down), tear a silver chain off of my neck while I wore it, etc. But, I've seen good ghosts save people as well. One of my friends, Rachel, slipped one winter on some icy stone steps, and was caught in the air in an impossible position by a good spirit, who we call Ahkra.    Never forget that you're not alone. If you ever need to talk about it, you can always email me through Y!Answers (just click on my name, and it'll give you the option to email me..)|`|WN4gHMLQaa	Okay, to start, Psychics are not real. Let me explain: Psychichs are people who claim they can connect with the dead by using false techniques.(ie: seances, Tarot cards, Ouija boards, and Palm reading) These techniques have been proven inaccurate on way to many occasions to note right now.     Now, to answer your question. You are not crazy. People can see ghosts, you are one of them, that is as simple as it is. Seeing, feeling or experiencing the paranormal is all very possible.     You are very lucky taht you can see ghosts, and if you would like, you can talk to me about it some more(because frankly I'd really liek a good discussion about paranormal activity)    You can talk to me:  Email: manicania@hotmail.com  AIM: manicania
9YMLsk7Taa	I think that Mr. Obama is starting to show his true nature now. How can you expect him to care at all about anything religious when he wouldn't even admit his own religious beliefs?!!!  I am personally amazed that anyone with an ounce of common sense or decency would elect this guy to be our president! And no it has NOTHING to do with the color of his skin, just with the morals he lacks. I'm not worried about it though because i believe that God let him assume power to hasten the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Hey, sounds good to me. Sex and the problems it can create are real. God isn't.|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	Brilliant.    Go Obama!    I'm all for funding healthcare/women's health initiatives and not funding religion.  Separation of Church and State and all that jazz.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	Yep - looks like a good change of going back to the constitution to me.  He won - get over it or leave.  Sound familiar?|`|PsWzUuTtaa	This is the change we have been WAITING FOR! Obama owes his allegiance to the STATE not to RELIGION. You want religious schools, fund your own f**king schools with your own money.Becuase guess what? I have a wiccan friend who wants the government to fund a neopagan school, I wonder what the christians would think of that? This is the 2nd good thing obama has done so far, he still has a long way to go though in my books|`|YQMCVuFiaa	I really do not see where your problem lies? Most (if not all) religious schools receive funding from its students, not to mention dip into the funds of their respective faiths... Where's the problem? They aren't receiving hand-outs from the government (taxpayers) as well?    I seriously don't see it... LOL|`|AA11987172	YES, this is the change I've been waiting for the last 8 years!    ;)|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Thank god for Obama!|`|283tO9j9aa	Well if people can be more open about using protection and getting tested they won't need to have abortions will they? They'll be more educated about sex and so they won't be as likely to do something stupid and get pregnant when they're not ready for a kid. Pretty sure Obama funds abortion counselling rather than actual abortions. I could be wrong, but you know what, even if I am I don't have a problem. Not every abortion is because some idiot couldn't keep her knickers on, far from it.    Your constitution supports freedom, so you know, that includes freedom to have sex and not have your life ruined by a nasty disease.    Also, I thought your laws said that the government isn't supposed to fund religious institutions? For all I know it could just apply to churches, but I figure a faith school is a religious institution. So the government isn't technically allowed to give them money in the first place. They're only allowed to give faith schools money if their main purpose is a secular education- and if it's not, no money for them.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	About time!|`|szsSPSmPaa	Yeah I know.

We could all have been spared your ignorance.|`|eCp0ERSCaa	Finally, a president who believes in rational approaches to real problems.|`|EoPRTJr4aa	works for me.....|`|YYsldZcYaa	You mean he's providing medical support and sex education with funding and removing unconstitutional loopholes for exclusive religious organizations to garnish much-needed tax dollars that can be put to more all-inclusive programs?      Good.|`|rLc1QeVbaa	the government has been funding std treatment  since at least WWII      and frankly...stay OUT of our schools religion!|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	I hope its not a joke.  Because its the sane thing to do.|`|j3fhWQHUaa	and i think hes so right re causes war|`|0r3ceXnjaa	Good.|`|mQ2gLxj1aa	YAYYYYYYY we finally have a president that can read the constitution!!|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Wow, you now have a president who has read (is capable of reading for himself) your constitution, and abiding by it, and who cares about people rather than supernatural entities.    You have a problem with this because?|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	And if he supported funding religious schools you'd be on here shouting that "Obama supports militant Islam training centers."  Get over it.|`|uxfacsgmaa	The government is not in any way, shape, or form, obligated to give handouts to religious organizations.     Healthcare is another matter.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	Woot!

tManvxfQaa	radical islam is being taught from birth to death...and they are taught if they do not comply they will not make it into heaven....imagine if someone told you everyday of your life if you didn't kill the infidels (those who don't believe in Islam) that you will not make it to heaven...What exactly would you feel towards them ? yep probably hatred cause they would be a fault for you not making it to heaven...that's how Islamics are persuading people to join their radical movements !!|`|170DwLM5aa	I have heard alot of conspiriscy theorys but this one is new.|`|AA11282654	It sounds like you are putting words in their mouths to me.|`|WyjRm10jaa	For the poor they don't have pay TAX..  The oil thing is Politic..  like you pay a dime you get your candy..  something like that..|`|rTplTuEdaa	It,s because Allah told them to kill the infidel,s in the Quran|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Both Islam and Judaism are blood-feud religions. That is, an eye-for-an-eye thing. If someone kills someone you love, it is okay to extract revenge on that person or family. The practice goes all the way back to Abraham. Of the Abrahamic religions, only Christianity has forgiveness as a major doctrinal element.|`|j3fhWQHUaa	your dad is so right look at the movie 9/11|`|AA11502346	I don't think it's okay.  Your dad may be misinformed; I'm not sure.  I know that in certain countries long ago, non-Muslims were allowed to do whatever they wanted as long as they paid a special tax.  I don't think this applies to Islamic extremists who want all non-Muslims converted or dead.|`|74RNHyxHaa	The thing your talking, its called Zakat. Basically, its one of the five pillars of Islam that a Muslim should do, its giving charity every year to the poor. It's to prevent greediness, and a love for money. But no, a Muslim can't be killed if he doesn't pay it.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	Fundamentalist Muslim radicals like those who flew planes into the WTC on 9/11 hate everything that isn't Islam.  They (and those like them) have been brainwashed into believing that they will receive rewards in 'heaven'.    They are generally young, and impressionable - which makes it easier to sucker them in.    The fundamentalists consider everyone who does not prescribe to their particular brand of Islam to be heretics (including other Muslims), and think they are on a mission from god/allah to convert the unbeliever or kill them.    This is only one of many examples of how religious fundamentalism (not limited to islam) is a very real threat, and needs to be dealt with.|`|vXA9dxjnaa	Muslims are supposed to give x% (I forget what %) to people less fortunate than themselves as a condition of being muslim (so its a sort of tax; one of the pillars I believe) but thats the other way to what you're suggesting. What you're father is suggesting is to put it mildly, wrong.|`|MpwWwyZnaa	Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al-Qaeda, said it clearly that The 9-11 terror was as a revenge to USA support of Israel killing of  Arab civilians and occupation of their lands. Although I don't agree with him, but he believes that Islam gives him the right of revenge : soul for a soul. This rule which is mentioned in Quran should be interpreted in a logical sense, that Islam does NOT permit the killing of innocent souls and it says clearly that "No soul bears the sin of other soul".|`|ppRPMfRkaa	From best I can figure your father was referring to what happened during the reign of the united Caliphate.   From it's conception till it's destruction this first Islamic state allowed non-Muslims to continue their religious practices and maintain their own faith.  They did however make non-Muslims pay a higher tax rate than Muslims paid.  If a non-Muslim refused to pay this tax they could be executed.  All this ended when Spain expelled the Muslims during the Spanish Inquisition.    Now fast-forward to the plotting that lead to 9/11.  Why do some Muslims think it is okay to attack Americans and Westerners?      Well prior to WWI, Great Britain held much of the Middle East under it's control.  In the aftermath the Allied Powers redrew the map of the Middle East with little to no thoughts about the cultural boundaries already there.  After WWII the Allied Powers redrew the map again, this time they also created a country to be ruled by a group of Europeans who had been horribly mistreated; and thus Israel was born.       Since WWII the West has continually propped up various dictators in the region because they were willing to sell them oil at a reasonable rate.  The region has been the location of proxy wars by the West and the East.    It is certainly true that not all actions of the West have caused harm to the Middle East, and it is certainly true that most Middle Easterners and/or Muslims hold no desire attack the West.  But those that do choose to attack the West do so for reasons.  We in the West need to recognizee that many of them have legitimate problems with the West and until werecognizeze this we will be unable to modify ouforeigngn policy in such a way as to diminish their numbers to point were they could do no real harm.|`|XqpRYh52aa	They probably got it from the same place that radical Christians got the idea it was ok to bomb abortion clinics.|`|8e7e4e34d37381167b8687a36c09ab9faa	He who dies a martyrs death while in the service of Allah will have 70 virgins with good pillows and dates tp eat.|`|hMygg8cnaa	your father   wasn't too far   off the mark.    from the quran   (the "bible" of islam)...    [Pickthal 9:28] O ye who believe! The idolaters only are unclean. So let them not come near the Inviolable Place of Worship after this their year. If ye fear poverty (from the loss of their merchandise) Allah shall preserve you of His bounty if He will. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise.    [Pickthal 9:29] Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low.    i'm not sure about  the whole conspiracy theory   about Americans paying such a tribute   through oil, though.

Oh wait..here:    "There is a little something in the New Age movement called the Violet Flame, a living spiritual energy which you can use in meditation. This is said to be the same energy Moses saw as the burning bush and was described in the bible as 'tongues of Fire.' You can use it for healing, purfication, and Shielding. This belief was reaffirmed by Guy Ballard and recently by three SEPERATE psychic channelers: Troiksa, Jhershierra, and Aurelia Jones    I remember back in November I woke up around 6 in the morning and saw the sky air out with 3 or 4 white Flames, each of them entered my forhead. Right away I began to see auras. At one point, I channeled this gem-like Fire out of my hands. True Story.    So can christians point out why the Holy Spirit is any different then 'Tongues of Fire from heaven?' Can you believe psychic channelers also support this belief?"

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	Not at all.  I love cemeteries, but not for the same reasons as you.    While I do find them peaceful, I enjoy doing gravestone rubbings. There's so much history in the older cemeteries that I feel a need to document a piece of it. I realize how odd this seems.    There are two cemeteries in my little town, and both date back to about 1750. Many of these headstones are so worn that the only way to read them is to make a rubbing.    By doing so, I've found graves of Revolutionary and Civil War soldiers -- ones that would have been forgotten to time, and they are most interesting. One young man was killed in action, and buried by the members of his cavalry unit, who took up a collection to pay for his gravestone. (Yes, this information was revealed in the rubbing.)    Many have the words, "Gone Home," engraved on them, with hands pointed Heavenward. Another has the same words, with chained hands pointing down.  I've always wondered just what it was this woman had done. I suspect she was an adulteress.    I've found entire families who died within a few short weeks, probably from consumption or flu outbreaks.  The heartbreaking graves of children, many of them newborn. And I've found that an alarming number of people pass right around their birthdays.     In Aspen, Colorado, I made rubbings from a Ute Indian cemetery.  While rock cairns marked their graves, I was able to take rubbings because they had headstones. This was strange, as it was the only Indian burial ground I've ever found where I could take a piece of their history home with me.    From the time I was a child I've collected these charcoal images from beaten down, forgotten graves. I realize it's a strange hobby, but I find it fascinating.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	im not uncomfortable at all.

I think it's because I watch too many horror movies.    When I was little, my dad always used to drive by the cemetery at night and I'd think about the dead people rising from their graves.    I have an overactive imagination.    edit: Excuse me for my no-yes edit :).  I thought you said, 'Are you comfortable...'.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	So, you're a weirdo Goth chick... good for you.|`|PM23RDycaa	Depends on the cemetery.

BEyqvqkZaa	Over time, a person's accent may seem to be "controlled," but it is possible to slip out. The accent may fade over time, as seen with children who migrate to a new country as children, and grow up to speak nearly as well as natives. This is opposed to an adult who attempts to hide an accent only a couple of years after s/he is introduced into a new society.    All in all, it is always possible to have an accent "slip."|`|7G0n3junaa	My first language is French and when I speak English there's some words I don't pronounce well not on purpose|`|a0485d6e140f545851f1532083dff0e5aa	I've noticed that when people are drunk,  or around others who speak their native tongue... they're accents get thicker.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	It's just the way it talks.|`|CFsBX9Nxaa	I have been told that i tend draw my words out. and that i have a pretty thick southern accent. but I think it all depends on where you grow up and who you are around!  Like if you grew up in New york then you will probably have that strong Yankee accent.    I dont think Floridians have an accent!!|`|mJAvkGjtaa	our brain picks up things in our surroundings so we automatically learn the accent of those around us. we get used to talking that way and so, yeah, it slips out. we speak that way automatically because thats what we have learnt and what we are used to-also what we are comfortable with|`|5RoYyprkaa	I'm originally from Alabama, and personally, I do have a bit of an accent. It's not that thick southern drawl that everyone thinks it is either. The only times I can tell that I have an accent is when I'm in New York. Most of my family memebers say I don't sound like I came from here.    I know some people that purposely put on an accent... but most of the time, your accent is regional. New York, Boston, West, North... Everyone has a different sound.|`|Bl9u2e73aa	its just the way it comes out naturally    you can make yourself have an accent though|`|1uA5IR0Taa	i'm from south carolina, and i don't notice that i have an accent, but when i go up north, the people i meet tell me it's pretty thick.  i wouldn't know how to get rid of it if i wanted to, so i guess it just comes naturally.|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	you can definitely control your accent. i'm from the deep south and had a very thick southern drawl which i hated. people don't know i'm from the south unless i tell them. although when i'm super tired it creeps out a bit. :)
4147a50109498d46606a694f7b23b512aa	I agree with the previous answer; you cannot tell the AGE but the EDUCATION. Everyone is on different levels, regardless their age. I think that is most obvious in writing styles. In my class, we are all the same age but our essays on the exact same topic are radically different on so many levels.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	The only thing that you can derive from their writing style is their level of education.    Even that gives no definitive answers.      Oh, and by the way, sexual preference, whether it be in a relationship or personal goal to become, is nothing more than a choice. No one is "born" trans-anything, nor gay, nor lesbian, nor rapist, nor sexual predator..... It's a conscious choice that is made.    Claiming such as this would be as silly as saying;   "I have a cat trapped in a dog's body".  It just doesn't make sense.
g0lKlQGnaa	There is no logic.  Many atheists seek only to mock and make themselves feel better in the process.  But then again, many atheists respect the views of Christians and are open to constructive discussion    We need to get rid of the labelling system here.

Why should we have to put up or "respect" such blatant fairytales?    It's sort of like "The Emperor's New Clothes"...us militant atheists are the first to stand up to all the hypocrisy and tell the emperor that he's really naked!    You confuse our indignation with "hatred", because it galls that you can convince people that "one plus one equals three" through this so-called "faith".    Finally, you and your ilk use your religion as a mechanism for taking away people's rights (including ours) - whether it be women's reproductive rights or marriage equality or civil liberties or the Separation of Church and State.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I think a lot of the Christians on R&S act pretty hateful and are an incredible turnoff from Christianity myself.

Becoming a christian has to do with accepting Jesus as your lord and savior.    I don't know any atheists who try to "deconvert" people. I do know that both christians and atheists are capable of rude, mean-spirited behavior, just as both groups are capable of kindness and generosity. We're all human.

I have found atheists much nicer. See? works both ways. And I'm not an atheist because of the way Christians or atheist have treated me. I'm an atheist because I have no belief in god. Shouldn't the reason for being a Christian is because that's what you believe? and not how people treat you.|`|sFAtAWE8aa	I ask the same thing to 75% of Christians, who try to belittle, guilt-trip, and harass atheists. As for MILITANT atheists; reconsider your choice of words. Militant supposes that we are grabbing guns and killing Christians. I would be the first to stand up for a Christian being ganged up on by obnoxious atheists, and vice versa.  There is no logic to using anger and hatred to alter religious views. Humans must be able to peaceably discuss their ideas while having open minds to find the truth.|`|iqwBSPWwaa	I suspect that they are tired of telling people to give their heads a shake, and want to shake it for them. so many times you end up with the same results you would if you were to shake a baby to get it to stop crying.

Leave me out of it, get your conversions points some where else.|`|zlHgIltOaa	No one is really a militant atheist these days.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_at...

They have actually run game theory simulations of this type of thing.  The only way it survives is if the skeptics show it some measure of respect.  We don't have to talk someone into not believing, only get them to think about it.  Ridicule is very effective at that.|`|R4RsQxJEaa	I don't think atheists are looking for converts.

He also gave the story of the arguement between the storm and sun.  The sun being God.  They have arguement who stronger so wind blew stronger and stronger and its friend called rain joined him blowing so the man wrapped his coat around him and held onto his cap.  Then the sun said let me have a go, the sun got warmer and shone down on the man, he took of his hat and coat, and un buttoned his shirt he found a fresh stream and sat down beside it and relaxed, took his shoes off and washed his feet on the stream.  So whom is stronger.    Love covers a multiple of sin|`|wR1XyyrUaa	personally I do not like Militant Atheists either. They are just like Fundi's and Radical Muslims. They are so insistent on forcing their beliefs down everyone's throat, they do not stop and think that perhaps there is some benefit from communicating with theists, and treating them as human beings, and not a quota.    Personally I don't mind Christlike Christians in the slightest. In fact I admire them. But then there are "Just Christians" who believe in the message of salvation, but are still pricks. I find them hypocritical, but that is their choice. As long as they do not try and force their beliefs down my throat, or into law books, i have little problem with them. Then there are the Fundamentalist Christians, that feel the need to convert everyone they see. They wish to put their beliefs into law books,  and restrict my freedoms because something offends their beliefs. I do not like these people, and will fight every effort they make to put their beliefs into legislation.    But on the opposite side, there are Agnostics and Moderate Atheists, They simply do not believe, or are not sure, thus, I have no strong judgment towards them. There are the Philosophical Atheists like myself that do not believe in gods, but have given ourselves reasons to live, and believe that there is a self driven purpose and meaning one can have in life. Then there are the Militant Atheists, who are just as bad as the Fundamentalist Christians, and while I agree with many of their views, I will also fight their efforts to restrict the freedoms and beliefs of theists.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	They are attacking our beliefs, and those who have little faith will believe them, and will fall away, its just like the parable of the sower, those who are thrown on the bad soil, and believe for a short while, but then are tested will then fall from the faith.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	"became a Christian largely because the Christians in my life treated me"    What is the logic there. Being nice as nothing to do with truth.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	You know, fundamentalist Christians are just as belittling and ridiculing, just to point that out.    I'm sorry you have a negative view of atheism.  Most of us are really nice.  But really, basing your beliefs on who's nicer isn't really the way to go.  Maybe you should think for yourself.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	The logic that you would believe a man was born of a virgin and ascended into Heaven after his resurrection simply because people who believe that way are nice to you is flawed.    Atheism is an admission of the what should be obvious, there is no evidence of a god, thus no reason to assume one is there
E9chZY74aa	Changing everything written does not make it honorable.  Marriage is between a man and his wife and the only place sex is honored.  In any other way it is a sin.|`|NWopkX4baa	And marriage only use to be between people of the same race. Definitions change all the time.    Not that long ago in our legal system, white people and black people could not get married. Hence, the definition of marriage changed.    I think you're missing the point. My dictionary lists 5 definitions, one of which states a union between a man and a woman. Definitions change, and if your dictionary only states marriage as a union between a man and woman, then yes, you should throw it out because its outdated.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Sure, I learned a lot from Fundi's on how to boycott literature.

Did you know they make newer editions with adaptations when necessary?    What now, are dictionaries a liberal conspiracy?  Will you boycott the newer editions when they are changed?    EDIT:  Wow, with all that racial intermarrying going on in the Bible, then this "Christian Nation" never did have laws on it's book clear up until the 1960s outlawing interracial marriage, huh?  And when a white Baptist minister warns a white and black couple that they are "unequally yoked", he's just being un-Biblical, huh?      Suddenly, I can think of another book that could use a re-edit...|`|tXfkyh5Qaa	Hi bro, when you say pro Gay advocates do you mean this has a organisation or as a church?    If as a organisation they should do what ever they feel that they have vision.

Paleo-Pagan refers to Paganism uninfluenced by Christianity, like the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, or Native American tribes, whose cultures developed independently of any Biblical influence.  Meso-Pagan refers to Paganism combined with Christianity, like Obeah or Santeria where African Tribal Religions are intertwined with Roman Catholicism.  Neo-Pagan refers to various efforts, dating back to the 17th century, to recreate/reestablish the Paleo-Pagan traditions in the modern day, such as Wicca or the Modern Druidic Movements.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	One ritually sacrifices live rabbits while chanting bizarre incantations.

Neither of these are [i]exactly[/i] like the Pagan faiths of olde.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	"Pagan" is an insult-word, created by Christians  to describe non-Christians. It means "country  dweller" (i.e. a hick). It has come to refer mainly  to the pre-Christian polytheistic religions of the  Mediterranean region.    Much of the old religions were lost as a result of  persecution by the Christians, so modern religions  which are based on the ancient ones are often   called "neo-pagan". I don''t like the word pagan,  and prefer to use terms like "reconstuction" or  "revival".     Another sort of religion which is often confused  with a revival is an entirely new religion which has  been created from pieces of previously unconnected  old ones, plus possibly some brand new stuff.     Wicca might fit that definition. I prefer to use a  word like "eclectic" for things like that. Naturally  other people may use different terminology.    Jean|`|YkseyT7zaa	the new uniforms

They are mostly normal people, just struggling to get by.  I think most places have pretty strict rules regarding behavior, especially if it is a religious organization.  So nobody will act negatively towards you, and drugs or alcohol should not be a problem.  In fact, most will be very nice and grateful that you are there.  Some will be very sociable.

Some see darkness and the ones who do not have any neurological impulses occurring or who were born completely blind do not see at all. If we define "see darkness" to be "not seeing anything", then they do see darkness, but this would insist that we never see darkness for it would be the unseen.|`|P3JsbI7gaa	lol i wondered this too.  but i think u might be in the wrong section, this is lgbt.|`|kpcJNDtLaa	dead people|`|HiNJTyJGaa	I've no idea... maybe you should ask a blind person (in a sensitive, respectful way mind!)    although... i think your in the wrong section lol.|`|a7IAkpJtaa	dark|`|K1dqsTKoaa	I wonder this too.

YUZKgeLtaa	This verse explains that the Jews rejected Jesus and they desired to live by old tradition of keeping the law. The Jews heard the message first and many chose to reject Jesus as the Messiah and for His free gift. The Jews thought they had to earn it by way of keeping the laws. They did not feel that spiritual worth in a price paid in full for Justification.     The Gentiles took the teachings of the Gospel from Paul and accepted that free gift and therefore were worthy of receiving everlasting life by way of Jesus Christ.|`|cYsYDaLmaa	hello.

I was baptized Roman Catholic, but didn't agree with many of their customs - especially as to women.      My adopted parents were Lutheran, so I basically grew up Lutheran.  Later I went to an Episcopal Church and immediately felt "at home."  As a music major, this church uses mostly classical music - which is a must for me.  I can't stand gospel music.      More importantly, their liberal views went along with mine.  Also, they do a great amount of charity work and build homes for people who are mentally  challenged and can't live by themselves.  It's all free for them.  If someone needs food - we have a room of it in the church to give them.       They don't go door to door.  If you're interested - you'll come to us.  We don't slam other faiths.  We invite people from other faiths to come in and have meetings with members of the congregation so we may learn more about them.  The more one knows - the less fear there is, and less misunderstanding.  If we all understood or at least tried to understand other faiths, there would be a lot less trouble in the world.      The priests (yes, they marry) have an extraordinary education.  First, one must have a four year university degree in religion.  Included in this is learning Ancient Hebrew and Ancient Greek.  Then they are able to read directly from old scrolls.  Oh - add Latin to that.  They also learn the customs of the times so they may better interpret scripture for the times we live in.  Then there is seminary - which may be 2 to 4 years.  They learn the languages within the context of the time written - which may be very different from today.  A word then does not necessarily mean the same thing today.

Because Jesus was going to come from heaven and live a period of his life on earth, Jehovah told him that he would have brothers of flesh and blood who would participate with him in the new government over earth's affairs - what we refer to as God's kingdom.    Jesus knew this would be a "little flock" as compared to the "great crowd" of earthly inhabitants. And the number of this little flock as revealed in Revelation 14 to John is to be 144,000.    The selection of the 144,000 began with the faithful 11 apostles, and expanded on Pentecost to number 120 and then thousands more. Paul hinted at the number in his day in 1st Corinthians 4:15.    Selection to fill this number has been going on till this very day. Romans chapter 8 makes it clear that Jehovah's holy spirit is integral in letting a person know that the sealing has occurred. This is an initial sealing - not a once saved, always saved. Integrity to death has to be maintained.    When the holy spirit does the anointing, it is not a physical feeling, like a hot or cold, or a breathless feeling, or a rush of adrenaline type of thing.    It is an IMMEDIATE awareness, a mental clearing of the mind, a change of thinking from earthly thinking to heavenly thinking. A person is aware of a refocus of their priorities of life. You know the second it happens and you know what it signifies.    All earthly attachments, husband, children, parents, friends, are to be left behind to fill this position. It is a sacrificial position. Your responsibility to be an ambassador for Christ becomes the dominating factor in how you live your life, and what decisions you make on a daily basis and in the long term.    The holy spirit was instrumental in the creation of the universe, including the writing of the Bible. It inspired prophets, split the Red Sea, raised the dead.    That same holy spirit bears witness to the Christian that his future is no longer to be on the paradise earth with family and friends, but will be in heaven serving in the government to help bring that paradise to the earth. There is NO doubt.    There are privileges and blessings from Jehovah for either future. We do not do the selection of where we will spend our everlasting life. Jehovah, in his wisdom, makes that selection.     He picks all types of individuals, men and women, to be part of the 144,000. Jehovah knows his reasons for the selection. Even those selected are not aware of a specific reason.    They do not stand out in a crowd. Most have been a Christian for many, many years. They have all gone through trials, serious trials which have tested their integrity. They have a good knowledge of the Bible, and are excellent teachers. They are humble, kind, and Jesus said they would be "pure in heart".    I hope this has helped, at least a little.    And yes, it is red wine in the cups. The same that was in the original commemoration. Along with unleavened bread.|`|9S6xT3Onaa	If you have to ask if you are one of the 144.000 you are not one when Jesus gave the commandment to partake of the wine and bread he was talking to his disciples and they are part of the 144.000 1Cor 11:27 say that we are not to eat the supper unworthily and any one who is not part of the 144,000 is not worthy|`|5H4SAVlIaa	I'm not a JW and in fact don't attend church, although I did spend 12 years in a Catholic school. I do remember that Jesus said " Take ye, all of you for this is my body etc.    I always thought the JW's seemed a bit  "uppity"  but that's got to be the ultimate!|`|bTA5ndeMaa	This teaching that only a limited number may partake is in error.  The New Covenant was given to all Christians.  It is as Jesus gave it, a covenant for as it says, (Matt 26:28) "for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed on behalf of many for remission of sins."    When baptism also is for remission of sins in Christ (Acts 2:38) "And Peter said to them, Repent ye, and be immersed each of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins . . .,"  we can know that one follows the other.      If Christians do not partake they are seriously disobedient and actually reject Jesus' ransom in a sense.    That does not mean that all Christians have the heavenly hope or will go to heaven when resurrected!  ------------    How does a Christian know if he is born again?  Paul tells us that a person is moved by Christ's spirit to know this.  The scripture in Romans here tells what goes on.    Rom 8:15-17, ACV, For ye did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.     ***16 The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are children of God.***     17 And if children, also heirs, heirs indeed of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer jointly, so that we may also be glorified jointly.|`|VgPG5WMsaa	Start giving them money.

They commemorate Jesus' death date, but they do not celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	There are some who are distressed by doubts as to whether they are entitled to partake of the emblems. This question sometimes arises in the weeks before another celebration of the Lords Evening Meal. Frequently such inquiries are made by some who have recently become associated with Jehovahs Witnesses. Are you one who has had doubts of this kind pass through your mind? How can you determine the right course to take?     Paul recommended regarding the Lords Evening Meal: First let a man approve himself after scrutiny, and thus let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup. (1?Corinthians 11:28,?29) Did you notice that Paul says you are the one who is to do the approving after scrutiny? Of course, it is not wrong to talk over such a?serious matter with a mature Christian, but you alone must determine your personal relationship with Jehovah and his Son. God leaves none of the 144,000 in doubt. We are assured: The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are Gods children. It is Gods spirit that awakens in the heart of any member of Christs body the conviction that he is one of Gods spiritual sons. The chosen one knows this and does not have to ask another in the congregation for confirmation.Romans 8:15,?16.    With the foregoing in mind, we say to all those who have recently become associated with Jehovahs people and who may have made some claim to being one of the anointed class: Examine carefully your relationship with Jehovah. Ask yourself, Is the heavenly hope that I profess to have somehow a holdover from a previously held church teaching that all church members go to heaven? Is my hope in any way connected with some selfish desire or emotional feelings? Paul said: It is impossible for God to lie. (Hebrews 6:18) Nor can the holy spirit of adoption lie. Therefore, anyone genuinely begotten by Gods spirit is not continually disturbed with doubts but is able to testify in all good conscience that he is one of Gods sons.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	I have asked some of the 144000 how they knew...they said they have no feelings of wanting to live on earth as the rest of us. They have a yearning, nagging to be with Jesus and the others and accomplish the tasks they were asked to do.    They also realize that Satan is after them. He wants to test them and break their integrity. So they have to be strong and stalwart so as to be ready for any onslaught of the devil.    They are holy in thought and deed. They try harder and know they have lots to lose if they stumble.    Short Answer..they say...I just know.

AA11440601	Not much.    Jesus describes heaven many different ways through parables. Many times, He compared it with a great feast. (Matthew 22:1-14, 25:10, Luke 15:23)    Heaven is pictured as a wonderful banquet, filled with happy guests, and filled with the warmth of love and friendship.     "Behold, I have prepared my banquet, my calves and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready; come to the feast." (Matthew 22:4).    Heaven is eternal life with God; communion of life and love with the Trinity and all the blessed.     Heaven is the state of supreme and definitive happiness, the goal of the deepest longings of humanity.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1023 through 1029: http://www.nccbuscc.org/catechism/text/p...    With love in Christ.|`|97d2a2d9ef8fc8e73e2d9c8436cd4609aa	You might try using Biblegateway.com and do a general search on heaven.      Heaven is a place outside of our universe since heaven existed before the universe was created.  Since time is a manifestation of space-time, time does not have any power in heaven, so from the Throne of God, you can see every moment of time on earth, past, present and future all in the same instance.    In the book of The Revelation, the Bible speaks of a "new heaven and new earth"  This suggests that there will come a time when all things will be remade anew.  Whether or not they are stating that the new heaven is synonymous with the new earth is still unclear, but I think you may be right about that.

Firstly, Jesus died awhile after He caused the flood, and He did that because all the people were evil and none righteous except Noah.  Read Genesis 6-7 and you will see He had a definite purpose, then put the Rainbow in place as a reminder to Himself never again to kill all living things with water.  Next will be Fire.  Yay!  Our God is an All consuming Fire!!!|`|ZJ6Nwbv3aa	so many stories you all love to make|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Noah's Flood happened many centuries before the Jesus tale took place.
nQEiNGkeaa	I think it's about time that Americans realised how far they are behind the rest of the world and stopped acting as if they are the best people on this earth. Get real. Europe is so far ahead of you as far as accepting gay people is concerned|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I think you're vastly oversimplifying things.    First off, I agree that our gender constructions are far too binary, where someone can only be male/masculine or female/feminine.  I wish there was more openness and acceptance for expressing all sorts of gender identities.  But at the same time, your call to lose gender altogether forgets how important gender is to a lot of people- INCLUDING those who identify as genderqueer in some way or another.  There is nothing wrong with gender; the only time it becomes something bad is when it becomes oppressive and people are expected to adhere to it.  I myself would personally be devastated if I could no long look at people as gendered individuals.  What about the beautiful butch/femme lesbian dynamic?  (Or, for that matter, the femme/femme or butch/butch dynamic?).  What about the wonderful sense of myself that I get from understanding myself to be female?  What about all the fun that I could have in genderf*cking and doing drag and roleplay switches?  What about transsexuals, whose very existence says very strongly that gender is incredibly important to understanding ourselves?  What about acknowledging social and cultural inequalities towards men and women (i.e. you can't address the fact that women still get paid less for equal work unless you believe there is a concept of "woman").  A world without gender is not a utopia.  Utopia is a world with gender and the freedom to explore gender- or reject it for yourself personally, should you so choose- with repercussion.    Also, you seem to really misunderstand sexual orientation.  You talk about it as though the brain has nothing to do with arousal when, in fact, all arousal begins in the brain (which sends chemical and nerve impulses telling your genitals to swell with blood, lubricate, orgasm, etc.).  To say that a penis or clitoris is simply stimulated and responds is incredibly untrue, or else doctors and gynecologists would be giving orgasms left and right.  Your mind has to be engaged in order to create arousal, and you're right- your penis or clitoris has no eyes.  But YOU do.  We could talk all day and night about what makes a man straight or gay, or a woman straight or lesbian- whether it's genes or choice or formative childhood experiences, nature or nurture.  But in the end, it IS what it is.  You feel attraction to one sex or the other or both, because that's what sex is.  Sex is attraction and arousal, not merely your genitals responding to stimulation blindly.    I hope that helps explain a little bit.|`|iTyLs2S6aa	If you don't feel like a girl then you shouldn't feel awkward walking around in men's clothing should you?

I know that I'm gay for sure because I've never had a crush on a girl and I can't imagine having a relationship with one.    It's perfectly fine to feel like you don't belong to either gender. I'm sure loads of people feel like that, but there are also plenty of people who feel very male or very female. I agree that gender shouldn't be such a big deal. We shouldn't seperate and judge people based on their gender, the world would be a much better place if we didn't!    =]|`|QNSnnyLiaa	Oh I agree with you completely!

AA11923447	"Have there ever been any instances here on Yahoo! Answers where an atheist made a point about something, and you understand their point of view?"    Many times. I frequently find myself siding with atheists, and they form a good section of my YA contact list. In real life, most of my friends are non-Christians. Many are atheists. I have been to quite a few atheist/freethinker meetings now, and have come to respect atheism, even though it is not my philosophical preference. My atheist friends are moral, intelligent, and fun to hang out with. They tend to be quite bright; I don't have to explain every little reference to them during a conversation, which is nice. I think it's interesting that they often voluntarily steer the conversation toward theology, and when they do, we end up having really intriguing discussions.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	I dont treat athiests any differnt than i do christians satanists buddhists wiccans etc.     And i do understand their point. doesnt mean i agree with them though.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	I think that Athiesm is a lack of faith, and it is just as respectable as any other religion.

Atheism, in my view, is an incoherent philosophy.  It affirms nothing, provides no bases for moral thought, and ultimately denies the meaning of our existence.  If this all sounds canned, like I got it from an apologetics web site, you misunderstand me.  I understand the atheist point of view completely.  I was an atheist before my conversion to theism.  I'm describing my own experience.  There are perks to being an atheist.  I am well aware of them.  No guilt.  No striving against impulse, at least not in the absolute sense.  And the freedom to think and do whatever your power and courage permit.  These are appealing.  The problem is that pleasure and self actualization are not enough.  Pleasures pale over time and defining the self becomes hopelessly problematic.  All that remains is emptiness and triviality.  Even this can be endured, if not enjoyed.  What I do know for a fact is that atheism gives you nothing to live for.  Why else do you guys spend so much time here sniping at religion?  The answer is obvious.  You don't have anything else worth doing and so you continue to define your existence in the light of theism.  Opposing it gives you a grand cause, makes you feel like you are part of something bigger than yourselves.  But again, you gain nothing from it.  You're just marking time.  Oh yeah.  I've been an atheist.  But unlike you guys, I meant it.  I left God completely out of my thinking.  The last thing in the world I would have done is waste my few precious hours of existence picking on silly believers.  There's just no sport in it.      peace|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	I'll betcha ten bucks you don't get one original answer from any of 'em ;-)|`|qvW5ZYruaa	They hate your guts.

If it is something like the FSM then I enjoy the joke as much as the next person.    Some atheists  go out of their way to be provocative. I should skip those questions because they push the wrong buttons. Sorry if I have offended anyone. Hey I am only human.|`|evStsOQiaa	God put the first stop to atheism with Noah's flood. He then warned His people to keep atheism from flourishing in His nations societies and established the death penalty as part of The Mosaic Laws for those who openly rejected the existence of Yahweh. Atheism has once again been allowed to flourish because of Christians thinking we are no longer under The Mosaic Law to stop it. What do I think of atheism in general? The same as God thought, which is it is a cancer that will destroy a God fearing society if allowed to. There is nothing an atheist can say that will change my view or God's view of them.|`|V8qVsKhRaa	Yes, I agree actually, with some atheists especially when they talk about Christians shoving their religion down other's throats, lol. I'm a Christian and forever will be, but we can be VERY pushy-- and sometimes I think the JW's keep saying "Oh, no, we're just like Christians" and I want to grab there ear and yell "SHUT UP! NO you're really not, now go run along and knock on someone else's door!" They are so annoying then claiming to be like Christians doesn't help our name. On one hand, I think it's stereotype, but then again, you have a point, and the Bible says don't stand in the way of the sinner which I take to mean don't nag them about "Ooooh, you're goin' to hell now!" b/c truth is, they probably did the same thing yesterday and then they're gonna come judge other people, and the Bible says also about take the speck out of your eye instead of theirs.     And I don't know what I think about Atheists, we're all human, but I guess when I think "Atheist" I think of sarcasm and witty. Which makes me kinda....jealous b/c I can never think of ANY good comebacks besides "Your mom!" and then run away before I hear the next comeback....  And then again, I also find some annoying, heh, not mentioning names, but ehhh, I don't know about you, you seem actually like a nice atheist, but I don't know, but some make my blood boil, like, okay, I'll say it "Alexis" makes my blood boil soo bad. She and a lot others are so hateful towards Christians, and yet still, in the media, we're considered the haters! I find it insane, actually. I think them hating us makes them 10x as hateful to hate us, we're not hateful. We can be VERY judgemental, and it shows the wrong impression but the intention is very loving, b/c we believe in y'know, I don't know how to say anything delicately, so I don't say it, but we want to save others from what we believe, and we want them to find God b/c just like a good food and my picky brother, it's like I know this is a good food so it's like "Aaron, I'll give you a dollar to try this food!" b/c I know he'll like the food, and I don't know what point I have with this, besides just it's like we want them to know God or in my example, how great the food is, but whatever. Lol.  No, I'm not a foodaholic, that's just the first thought b/c I just finished dinner.   Hope it helps(:|`|31M2IDw2aa	When I see a prostitute on the street, I feel sorry for her.

Their pimp of course is Satan.    Yes, of course there have been many times when an atheist has made a good point.  Never forget, Satan is a cunning, highly intelligent lier.

If one can't see/prove God scientifically, then they said no God. In contrast, some back pain or neck pain still can't be proved by today's technology, or other people can feel it, can one say it's not exist or call it a fake even if the patient likely to become an analgesic addicts.    When it come to logic, we all know every argument based on assumptions, without them, it's just idle talk, not even definition of terms can be established. And assumptions is based on one's experience, knowledge, senses which are variables(although some are relatively permanent), eventually you need to reach a decision by vote(not necessary explicit) and call it mainstream(science).    I think every coin has 2 sides, so you got to understand what are advantages and disadvantages of being atheists, at the same time, the advantages and disadvantages of theists. My experience is atheists only focus on the advantages of being an atheist and the disadvantages of being a theist.    Hope this helps.

Consider the accounts  fabrications at your own risk    I found myself praying another fateful prayer: "God -- I'm having a hard time believing an all-loving God would allow people to suffer in a hell of torment for all eternity. Yes - I believe your Bible doesn't lie . . . but God - I'm having a hard time believing. If Satan is causing this unbelief, please show me.  I'm asking and trusting You to show me the reality of hell, even if you have to take me there to prove it." ...About a year and a half later, my wife, Kathleen, began talking about a book on hell going around at her place of work.  I asked her to bring the book home so I could look at it if she could get her hands on it.  A few days later she brought the book home.    That next morning I started reading the book at 6:00 AM.  My eyes were glued to every word. I finished reading it by 10:00 AM. Upon finishing it, I was stunned! I felt like someone had swung a 20-pound sledgehammer at me and it was lodged permanently in my stomach!      The author of the book shared that Jesus had actually taken her into hell 30 different times and gave her a detailed tour of it. She claimed that Jesus gave her this extensive tour of hell over 30 different nights to write a book about what she saw and experienced so others could know of the reality of hell and would not have to go there.    At that moment -- in stunned shock -- I said out loud, "God . . . is this book real ... or is it make-believe?  Did this woman fabricate this account ... or did she really experience what she has written about?"    The Holy Spirit answered very quickly by asking a question of His own: "What do you believe?  Does anything she's written contradict scripture, as you understand it?"    I had to answer Him, "No." "But maybe the devil inspired her to write this book. Did he?"    He replied, "You think Satan would expose himself in a book like this the way the author has exposed him?"    I knew he wouldn't.  What she shares about Satan and hell and the torment of suffering lost souls there and why they are there . . .  he wants no one knowing!    Then I asked the ultimate question: "Are you trying to scare people into becoming Christians, Lord?"    Suddenly concerned that my question may have offended Him, I felt greatly relieved when He shared this reply:    "Fear will never cause people to develop a love-relationship with Me.  Appreciation for what I'm sparing people from will."    There was a brief interlude, and then these strong thoughts went through my head.  "You prayed a prayer nearly a year and a half ago. You asked Me to show you whether hell is real or not. This book is your answer."|`|yj3GT7jOaa	If they are not God, don.t believe it.|`|yywRjouyaa	Great, can't wait to meet him.

What is interesting is that the Christian Conservatives use your line of thought to argue that because America accepts people being free to live as they choose that our culture will collapse. What the Christian Conservatives fail to take into consideration is that it is economic decisions that are leading to our collapse.  For instance our need to have two incomes per household leads to a breakdown of our family structures.  So say that we need only live more simply so that one spouse may remain at home.

If for business, it is acceptable that one should try to contact the other person through more than one meansi.e. email, telephone, and snail mail.    If its for social reasons, then its a different story.  Traditionally, from the standpoint of etiquette and social graces, after writing another person, one should refrain from trying again if there is no reply.    However, these days, because so much communication is through electronic (and therefore not always trustworthy means), "blips" and "quirks" may all too readily occur, meaning that the person might *never have received* your message.  Giving the other person the benefit of the doubt, I would wait a solid week before repeating my call/email message, but that would be the absolute end of it, unless they replied in the interim    From a social (but not business) standpoint, even if you have questions to which you desire a reply, repeated emails/phone calls/text messages or whatever are considered to be sent by someone obsessed, desperate or neurotic (and possibly even possessing stalker tendencies).  So, from the social standpoint, if you havent heard back in a week, I would let it drop cold.

EVby6dGCaa	Whether a person goes to Heaven is up to God.    And the folks you mention are just a tiny handful of the Christian denominations out there.    The Christian Church started as one church, but almost immediately it split into factions. If you read Paul's letters, you get a little taste of it even though he is obviously trying to minimize it.     Constantine decided he wanted one church, period, and assigned the job to a church council. They tried, with limited success. Could not agree on the nature of Jesus (Is he wholly God? Wholly human? Partly God and partly human? Consisting of two essences, one human [observed on earth] and one divine? And a few others I don't have time to go into here).     The big fantasy is that there was one church, when actually it has always been a loose confederation of small sects and cults and even personality cults.    Big break comes along in a very short time and the church splits forever into Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Roman Catholic, not the same as Catholic, by the way, although at this time, the two are almost the same).    Come Reformation time, and Martin Luther tacks his Theses on the church door and starts a revolution. Voila, here come the Lutherans, and not far behind, the Calvinists and the Church of England.    Everybody wanted to get in on the act, so at this time we have lots of lay churches popping up all over, whose main claim to fame is that most of their founders tested how well the human body will burn. We know them today mostly as the Plain People (Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, and on and on) and Friends (Quakers).    In the USA around the Revolution, some radical folks wanted no governing body to dictate to them what they should and shouldn't do, and they became the Baptists. Methodists are a reaction against the Church of England's upper class roots, and the need to have a religious response to the needs of the very poor, of which there were a lot in industrial Britain.    There are hundreds of national church bodies, separate Roman Catholic churches for different slavic countries, for instance.    What do all of these different folks (many of them are practically mortal enemies and don't talk to each other) have in common?    They all worship the Risen Christ -- Jesus of Nazareth, and they are all Christians.    You will note that I have not included Mormons among the Christians. There's a good reason for that, and it stems from a sad reality reflected in the previous sentence.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Christians who say their religion is the only way to go are bullshitters.|`|fWrygrgMaa	Wow, you mentioned some I have never heard of before, prodesent, baptis, luthren, jahova.

We do know the truth that those who will be in heaven will only be there because Christ made the way for them.

Heaven is God's kingdom going to heaven means going to God, Going to God means going to heaven his everlasting kingdom. If you accept what God did and live for God you are with God. Christianity,Islam/Judiasm is not a religion but a ife style. Find the truth by seekin God.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi,Hi, First it is a human problem. It is what we have done with God's message. There is only one Bible but the  original was in Hebrew and Greek and there were small variations in the texts back when they were written  (NT near 2000 years ago and OT up to 4000 yrs ago). Some of that was doctrine difference. The book of  Mormon is not a bible. It is totally false copied human production. See errors of Mormonism.  The Bible has  been translated into 100's of languages and many versions in English. English is a living language and  changes over the years so there are updates. The first printed Bibles were about 1600AD one being the King  James. This was Shakespearean old English with different words and meanings to now. Some insist this is  the only correct Bible because it was translated from the only correct early copies. New versions often pit  some texts into doubt. This is a very small problem. I like to have a Bible I can read easily. They all really  say the same but in easier words except the NWT of the JW's who changed it to suit their errors. The  message is really the same. Now we really need to look at church history. Christians  were thrown to the lions, burned on stakes until Constantins won a battle carrying a cross and declared  Christianity the state religion just after 300AD. This started the decline in truth. Then it was an advantage to  be Christian so unbelievers, pagans etc all joined. Over 1000 yrs later it was so corrupt that Luther a Roman  Catholic priest read the Bible and started the reformation. He taught the b  Bible truth of Galatians 2:8-9 By grace are you saved --, it is a gift of God not of works least any one should  boast. He taught that sins could be forgiven and could not be paid for or made up for. At this stage the RC  church was selling indulgences(tickets) to have sins forgiven. A money making scheme they sold Bishop  areas to favourites or the highest bidder.These 100's ofyears are called the dark ages. The evil crusades wer  in this time too. The Christian religion had become a corrupt political organisation. Christians(Followers of  Jesus) were separated from this and extremely persecuted. Luther and many others were persecuted and  burned on stakes for haveng a Bible or translating it or teaching it. The reformers then had to establish the  Bible doctrines and variations started because on emphasis on different texts. A few 100 yrs later now we  have more human strange ideas added to or taken from the real Bible teaching to the extreme of some  claimimg to be Christ.   The real message is that God creation was perfect. Adam and Eve chose to follow the evil deceptive god  called Satan(a rebellious fallen angel). God promised a Saviour Messiah on the OT. His birth place, family,  miracles and dying as a substitute to redeem sinners and resurrection were all prophesied. Jesus Christ is that  person historically. Now if we accept Him we can be saved and know we have eternal life.   If you are  seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to  believe Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life.  Be  willing to turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word  the  Bible and owning Him before others. May God bless you as you seek the TRUTH.  Hope this helps and isn't  too long. nev r|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Yes. I think Christianity has been pushed a bit too far. There is a lot of history that you have to take into account with Christianity and the Bible. Christian is a generalized term for anyone that worships the new teachings of Jesus Christ. Jesus was jewish and followed those teachings, but with his ministry he expanded the ideas and taught his own ideals and ways of life. Lo and behold, the new testament arose thanks to many of his followers. Paul(Saul) took the liberty to write and preach what Jesus taught.     With Christianity today, you see so many different interpretations of the Bible  that it makes your head spin. I don't trust the Catholic church whatsoever, who has the right to take away purgatory or limbo? That's beyond me, you can't just go and change the rules of religion.     I think that God doesn't care whether you are part of a religion or not, just as long as you believe in Him and have faith then you will be fine.|`|8a906efd946b4332e1f334ccdb5a4a8faa	I once met a mullah in Malaysia and he told me he didn't understand why so many religions are so intolerant of each other. He said that yes, there is only one God. But all religions worship that same God in different ways. I immediately had a greater respect for Islam.
e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	The Holy Ghost is an old name for the  Holy Spirit.  Ghosts are spirits.

It comes from the KJV translation.  It is far from an up-to-date terminology.  "Ghost" ......good God, what a stupid expression!  Try Holy Spirit, maybe God's active force.  It refers to God's might (or power) to accomplish something.  Ghosts are associated with God's adversary, the Devil.|`|EVby6dGCaa	I'm not sure how a person can say they don't believe in ghosts. I guess it's the same thing as God. I haven't seen him, so ergo he doesn't exist -- as if it's all about me.    The term Holy Ghost is an old way of saying the Holy Spirit, and that is a sort of notional way of speaking of one of the aspects of how God is felt by us in the world. When you see someone, and they are not feeling well, and you suddenly get an impulse to say something to them, and it's exactly what they needed to hear, but you didn't know that, a lot of folks would say that was the Holy Spirit, working through you.

This is not according to the facts:  the fact is that when a person dies they either go to hell or to heaven, they don't stay here.    The Holy Ghost is an old phrase describing the Holy Spirit, not many people that I know of use this out-dated term any more.  The Holy Spirit (or Spirit of God) is God, not some departed spirit of a human being.    What some people call ghosts are nothing more than "familiar spirits" masquerading as people, in reality, they are demons.|`|peO8bwA5aa	No, ghosts are not ghosts exactly.  The Holy Ghost is translated in modern English as The Holy Spirit.  The Holy Ghost or The Holy Spirit is God, the third person of The Holy Trinity.

The ghosts who inhabit places are demons or fallen angels.|`|8a906efd946b4332e1f334ccdb5a4a8faa	Ghosts are supposed to be spirits of dead people.

8ubAwaGCaa	A lot of people presume to know or have a good idea of the eventual destination of some others.  I am glad that I don't have to judge anybody, but many other Christians seem only too eager to do so.    Those statements appear to be the belief of the person who stated them, unless they are a convenient fiction he tells himself to scratch some merciless itch.    Certain facts exist, and they exist independently of observation.  Life on other planets can exist without our knowledge or preference.  It's certainly not going to go away just to please us.  You think I am reasonable for stating this, but you think I am unreasonable for applying the same logic to God's existence.  Isn't there a double standard here?    It is neither logical nor illogical to believe in God.  It is illogical to reject the possibility of God's existence.  However, it is more logical to believe than not, because the only available evidence on the subject is in God's favor.  If the testimony of honest, intelligent, and basically sane men and women is good enough for a court of law, it ought to be good enough for everyone.  The problem is that the honest and intelligent ones are not always the loudest or most outspoken ones.    The reason I reject your statements is because you appear to be claiming, without support, that there is no good reason to believe in God or to think that the Bible has important truths in it.  My beliefs are not made out of whole cloth.  As time goes on, some of the things that I chose to take on faith have been verified through spiritual experiences.  I have also found that many of my assumptions simply didn't stack up in the end.  The process has been so positive, so influential, that I look forward to discovering more truth.  I will never be satisfied to only believe, nor to assume and then pretend that I know.  I just don't know everything yet, and I am not surprised if the process takes pace according to God's timetable instead of mine.|`|ORFXYTj6aa	He has heard that before and has not varied from it,so at least to him its fact.Who am I to judge anyone including you?To me,myself,I believe hes correct in his statement.That's only me.|`|EVby6dGCaa	You, very politely, say, "Now that is a typical answer. Tell me is it absolute fact, or a belief? This person seems to think he knows this for absolute fact. Is he correct?"    Good grief, I'd ask him what the heck he's talking about!    What "revelation of God" is he attempting to talk about?    He will need to unpack the bit about a revelation through someone's spirit too.    I would not, if I were you, waste one moment trying to tell this inDUHvidual that he might be mistaken. He won't hear you, and even if he does, he will totally discount and reject anything you might say. There is literally nothing you can say that will have any impact on his viewpoint. If you agree with him, fine. If you disagree, you are either deluded or an instrument of the devil, and either way, he will just ignore whatever you say.    However, what he said, as you quoted him, is just double speak gobbledegook.     Such sadness. These folks do so much damage to others and so little help for themselves. But they'll never hear you try to tell them that.|`|gpwI2sbvaa	There is a difference between guts and arrogance.|`|2yk2QmeOaa	Christians do not judge, yet, and i quote [Matthew 19:24]    "Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God."

Everyone thinks they are rational but after awhile you look at them and start to think they are a little crazy. I think people are a little crazy because they still believe that they are going to a mystical place after their death. What most people don't realize is that heaven is a latin derived word which stands for universe and sky. I think if most people were to replace the word heaven with universe or sky in the bible that the bible would make a lot more sense.     For example Rev21:1-2 says, "1) Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. 2) I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband."    Try and replace the word heaven with sky or universe: "1) Then I saw a new sky and a new earth, for the first sky and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. 2) I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of the sky from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband."    If we use correct translation it clears up a lot of mysticism and actually becomes very realistic. Our destiny, according to the bible, is not to go up into heaven (the sky), but instead to live on the new earth.    Certain passages in the bible say we may go up into heaven to be with Jesus but also replace heaven with sky or universe in that translation. Replacing the word heaven with sky would say that when we die we go up into the sky or universe where the spirit of Jesus has gone. We have found other planets and nearly habitable planets within our universe, so it is very possible that this is what they mean when they say this. With the knowledge we have of the universe now it is very possible.
8a906efd946b4332e1f334ccdb5a4a8faa	Okay first we have to suspend disbelief and assume there is God and the devil. The devil is only doing his job, but he loves his job and he hates humanity. If he didn't like his job he could resign. But he wouldn't resign, because he always wanted to be equal to God. People blame God for allowing all the misery and suffering in the world, but they forget that it's the devil who is causing it. Okay, now it's time to re-engage disbelief.|`|E9chZY74aa	He is the enemy of God.

But I agree, people shouldn't have un-heeded hate towards him.

In the final day, Jesus will say "depart from me, I never knew you" even to some who spoke in his name.     I see no evidence of salvation in the lives of the WBC members, no manifestation of love.

mU2eMSi3aa	No, "Unlawful sexual conduct is a demerit.  Lawful sexual conduct is merit." - Words of Buddha from the Buddhist Bible    Edit, it is one of the Merits and Demerits of Buddhism, I'll try and look up the exact page for you and get back to you.    Edit: The sutra is called, "The Word of the Buddha" and I found it in the book "A Buddhist Bible" Edited by Dwight Goddard.  Buddha explains the Noble Eightfold Path.  This path he explains is the Middle Path so you are free from extremes on either side.    Step 2; Right Mindedness warns to keep thoughts free from lust.  While step 4; Right Action explains this means, "unlawful sexual intercourse."  He explains that this is, "intercourse with such persons as are still under the protection of father, mother, brother, sister or relatives, nor with married women, nor female convicts, nor even with engaged girls."  Engaging in or thoughts of these things are one of the three things that can bring you bad karma.    Sorry, one more edit: In the 2nd step Buddha says to keep thoughts free from "unlawful lust, ill-will and cruelty - this is called the Mundane Right Mindedness, which yields worldly fruits and brings good results."    Also in that same sutra you are given under the 1st Step: Right Understanding all of the merits and demerits.  Basically the demerits are the opposite of the merits and the merits are: To abstain from killing, stealing, unlawful sexual intercourse, lying, tale-bearing, harsh language, frivolous talk, covetousness, ill-will and wrong views.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	It distracts you from reaching nirvana.|`|UV6osJh8aa	It teaches that your sexual energy should be in balance with the rest of your life.

But remember Buddha also taught the middle path. We shouldn't eject love (even sexual love) from our lives, but neither should we be so consumed by it that it affects your life in a negative way.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Buddhists seek to detach themselves from most desires. Lust included in most cases.|`|sFAtAWE8aa	Yes. I am pretty sure it is one of the basic statements of the religion.|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	Buddhism is actually a religion, so it can't say anything.|`|tGkFPA82aa	Depends on the branch really, and the person interpreting the message.    Lust is physical, so you can either embrace it as an aspect of our imperfect existance, or deny it as a distraction on the path to universal oneness.    So you really can go either way. Do you embrace the fact that you're alive, or strive for a higher state of being?|`|FmbwIbtzaa	I have never read where the Buddha had addressed lust but this is what Jesus had to say about it.    "Cheerfulness and gladness are the rewards of deeds well done and to the glory of the Immortal. No man can rob you of the liberty of your own mind. When the faith of your religion has emancipated your heart, when the mind, like a mountain, is settled and immovable, then shall the peace of the soul flow tranquilly like a river of waters. Those who are sure of salvation are forever free from lust, envy, hatred, and the delusions of wealth. While faith is the energy of the better life, nevertheless, must you work out your own salvation with perseverance. If you would be certain of your final salvation, then make sure that you sincerely seek to fulfill all righteousness. Cultivate the assurance of the heart which springs from within and thus come to enjoy the ecstasy of eternal salvation. Page 1447-1|`|AA11043053	Sexual abstinence is only required of Buddhist monks, and in Buddhism, one does not have to make a life-time commitment to become a monk.    Lust is a form of longing, and since longing is the source of suffering, Buddhism teaches that fostering lust is fostering your own suffering. So it is not that Lust is bad or good, but that it shows a lack of skill in dealing with life. However, the same could be said for extremes in any form, including hunger & thirst.    One cannot stop your biological processes, but one can manage them and not allow them to rule your life.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	It's considered a version of sufering, and that's bad

EFjrJmdXaa	Honestly, to tell you the truth, I don't believe helping people out financially actually helps people. I feel the bible would actually want us to, if anything, use the money to buy necessities such as food and then give the food. Honestly I think God does not like the world we have created because it implies that the world God created for us isn't worth much. I believe God wants us to live in the world God created for us: nature. I don't believe God likes our social system, materialism, or capitalism. I honestly think God frowns upon roads, cars, buildings, and all of the ways we build over Gods creation. The world we have built is only sustainable by humans, and it is doomed to fail. The economic problems show how exactly our creation is doomed to fail. Chances are we could end up building streets everywhere, buildings, etc, and then have our economic system fall through the hole and we would end up in chaos and starvation. Why? There would be no more land to grow food, the soil will be unable to produce good food, no one will know how to live off of Gods creation. People will end up killing one another for food in desperation. In God's eyes we are foolish and have built our own hell. God knows our system is destined for failure. Only God has the power to feed nations through Gods creation which is self sustaining: nature. You eat the fruit, plant the seed, and more food grows. In our system you can only grow food on certain land. Yeah you can make your own garden but chances are it won't be enough to survive if our system failed. God, in the beginning, created a self sustaining system, the perfect system, where there is no fear of hunger or shelter. Our system only survives with our own stress, blood, and sweat. Honestly I think God thinks we are putting stress on ourselves to build a system that is vain. Nothing man makes will last. Gods creation, nature, is built to last forever. We are trying to play God and build a system but like I said our system is only sustained through our own blood and sweat and is doomed to fail. Gods system is perfect and our world is a vain attempt to replace Gods creation with our own which we think is better. Healthcare? Doctors? They can only give you time, but eventually you will have to leave anyways. A doctor can't save us from our fate, so to God we are behaving vain and desperate to try and stop the inevitable. A doctor can make a persons life more enjoyable but most of the time people have physical ailments due to bad nutrition or lack of exercise.|`|aBxdyqShaa	Lottie Moon Missionary fund.

"And the Poets  It is those straying in evil  Who follow them:    Seest thou not that they  Wander drastially in every  Valley?    And that they say  What they practice not?    Except those who believe  Work righteousness, engage much  In the remembrance of Allah,  And defend themselves only after   They are unjustly attacked.... "    You see, the answer is in the last verse of surah 26, beginning wih the phrase, "except those who believe." Among the poets and their followers who are lost, you will find those who are not lost and who are true believers. The true believers among them are granted full acceptance by Allah. It is about the content of the music and the content of the character of the people who produce it and consume it. That's according to Qur'an.

ncdTxID9aa	Yes especially when black women say they don't want dark skin babies.  Or when some of the guys who aren't about anything cat call(something like that) then get mad and disrespect you for not giving them the time of day. Or when some of them feel being black is being ghetto.  I hate a lot of things people do in general.|`|iad9mqaXaa	I just do. This complaint of theirs is so stupid. I'm sure Michelle O. wore what she wanted and didn't think about their race. I don't see them complaining about blk on blk violence, high incarceration rates, high oow birth rates, low marriage rates, health problems, and high AIDS/HIV rates. You know, the important things.|`|uLdmXx3faa	LMAO.  Of all the things.... they complain about some dumba$$ dress.  I also want some muslim folk to stfu too lol|`|281f6e86bdcd64de98851a9e758ddb76aa	YES! Lol Especially when blacks start talking about having good hair. ALL hair is good except excessive pubic hair :)|`|DQZK3eKfaa	Oh my God.   This is one of those times!   You should check out Chris Rock's Black people vs Ni**as|`|CcgDj9GIaa	Yes    And the source is just despicable.  Who the **** cares about wearing a dress from a black designer?  Seriously?  Who gives a crap? This is a time for equality, and as far as I'm seeing from this article, they're being selfish.|`|N8GLJpdlaa	i sometime want to but i dont i am a pacifist if you would call it that but i hate when i go to the movies and loud people always talk|`|d4051d51dfeeaffbacc0cefba16f3210aa	YES! & this is DEFINITELY one of those times!|`|92iuiuZKaa	LOL. Yeah thats pretty pathetic they got mad over that|`|StRaKUf6aa	Too many times to count, and I have told them to STFU when so possible.  I tell everyone to STFU when needed.|`|PvPPivLJaa	Yea, I knew this black lady who was about 50. She was cool but she was extremely abrasive and would start ranting about how bad white people have treated her (mind you she dates white guys) and this would be right next to white people. She would talk on and on, loud and I just wanted to tell her that. But, I would say Please first...|`|5e4192d684cd7ce865e36c9c44a4352caa	YES!  I tell my friend all the time to STFU, he always complaining about how bad white people are to him but he only date white girls!!  I know him from 5 years old and no white man has done anything to him to justify his complaints.  His WHITE boss just loaned him $3k!|`|uQfJukisaa	All the time. What does the race of the person who design the dress have to do with anything. If the dress looks nice then it looks nice end of story.
A8ht05FXaa	a person that wants to claim attention, so it is dressed all black and seems depressed sometimes they cut themselves just for fun and to see if someone pays attention to them but the question is if we are making something for them to act like this, and the answer is YES, as I have  said before we paid them some attention because they look so horrible that they seem to need a friend and you worry for that person so just dont be EMO hahha
h5q89E3Haa	You can call your self Catholic but you can not share in the Eucharist until you are officially Catholic.    You must go thru the RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults) and you will really enjoy it.    Welcome Home and Peace be with you.|`|tVoMXFDRaa	according to the catholic church, No. However, if you are a Christian all you have to do is accept Jesus as your savior and you are saved. Baptism and confirmation and all that other stuff is just tradition, if you read the King James Bible you will find out that most the stuff Catholic's do is not from the Bible and is just man made.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	If you go to the Catholic Church, and believe in it, then yes. But those sacraments are necessary in becoming a better Catholic.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	You can call yourself anything you like.  Weather or not the church recognizes it is a different story.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	Sure you can as your attitude right now, should something happen and you should die suddenly before you have the chance to do it officially, qualifies you for the Baptism of desire.|`|ScmAk5EVaa	Yes because at the moment you would be considered to have a Baptism of Desire and Intent.  I echo Guido Welcome to the Church!  Peace be with You!|`|B6r56Nr7aa	I guess you can call yourself a Follower of Catholicism. But you are not baptized Catholic. :-)|`|AA10696542	Organized religion=bullcrap.  Work on you're relationship with Christ. Catholics have many false teachings. Such as: You need to work to get to heaven and Purgatory.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	i don't think you need to prove to anyone else what you are or what you believe in because God knows and that's the most important thing|`|G6ein0naaa	I'm sure you can call yourself Catholic. After all, Catholic means "universal". I don't think it would just be limited to those that have been baptized or confirmed. I would recommend taking one of those actions though, because it is really just a traditional practice.    And don't listen to what the Protestants say about Catholicism being a false religion. They seem to not realize that Protestantism came about when Martin Luther took out 7 books from the Bible to make it look like the Catholic church was false. So don't pay any attention to that. I just thought I'd share this relatively unknown history lesson.|`|3nw2Pwu8aa	To God is not great: you make it pretty obvious you don't know that much about the bible, the bible says faith without works is dead.    Look, the catholic church has some teaching i don't agree with and/or don't understand....but you'll find that at any church really. Being baptized with water is not a necessity|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Because you are covered under the 'baptism of desire,' you are counted as one of the Church's members.      I recommend you identify yourself as 'Catholic, preparing to be baptized.'    Welcome to the family.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	Since you are preparing for baptism, and I suppose you are still learning about being Catholic, you can be considered a Catechumen.|`|AA11796124	>    If you do in fact, beleive "it all" then you are already far ahead some Catholics who are Baptized and Confirmed.      >    If you are being forced to stay away from the Sacraments against your will, then you ARE a Catholic by Virtue of the Baptism by Desire.  That said, this is NO REPLACEMENT for the actual reception of the Sacrament of Baptism.    When you do turn 18, see to it that you are Baptized and Confirmed.|`|pgWv8VaLaa	Can I call myself Catholic if I have been confirmed and baptized, but do not believe it all?  .|`|ptIIkqq0aa	Yes, you can. Even though you are not baptized, that does not mean you cannot call yourself a Catholic. You have a Desire of Baptism, and your intent shows that you are have a true passion to come Home.     Glad to know you are serious about it, welcome to the family!

fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	I think it's hilarious people take mythology seriously.  Since the beginning of time man has tried to understand the world.  The Egyptians believed in Osiris because Christ was even in the picture.  Now with all the technology we have we are beginning to understand it without having to rely on our imaginations. And literally believing in books that were written thousands of years ago is still common place.  Have we really evolved and wisened up?  Makes you wonder...  I can't wait for the day when mythology is just appreciated for it's fascinating yet silly plots and characters.  We are in fact grown adults who should be a role model for our children.  The belief in hell is insane and the idea should be abolished.|`|qKSn0AVsaa	Everything you have asked is part of his plan!   He has given us a manual so to speak, so we can find these things out, his word the Bible.     Do you really want to find out the answers? If so ask one of your local JW's for a Bible study to learn of Gods will and purposes.    You did ask!|`|qghDpQlNaa	Very good question.    In fact, God has already made plans to destroy the Devil.  Right from the first book of the Bible, God has made arrangements for this to happen.   (Genesis 3:15) "And I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel."    The promise at Genesis 3:15 indicates that immediately after Adam and Eve sinned, Jehovah determined that his symbolic woman (His heavenly organization - the angels) was to bring forth a seed, or son. Jehovah also foresaw the result of the enmity between his woman and Satan and between their opposing seeds. Although Jehovah would allow the Seed of God's woman to suffer a bruising in the heel (God's son put to death), in God's due time, the Seed would bruise the serpent, or Satan the Devil, in the head (destroy the Devil forever).    This point is made clear in the following scripture:  (1 John 3:8) He who carries on sin originates with the Devil, because the Devil has been sinning from [the] beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, namely, to break up the works of the Devil.    But when would all these take place? Why so long? To find out, please click on the website address below. Thanks for reading.|`|L6E6lDGKaa	He created us to do that work. It's your opportunity to shine so hop to it. Instead of complaining, get up and do something. If God does all the work leaving nothing for us, then what purpose is there in life other than wasting the air others breathe.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	The only reason why Satan was called evil was that he disagreed with god and told some ***** to eat the fruit... Soooo evil!!!

There is a plan to kill the devil, well to put him away for eternity anyway - so basically dead. Do you have evidence to support that everyone who prays, prays for only materialistic things? Again, you dont seem very familiar with the Bible or know really what prayer is about.    Prayer is communication with God, not to make wishes.    God does help the people in Africa, He uses His followers. Alot of the problems caused around the world (like in Africa) are man made. For example, many cultures who say they must have at least 8 children, etc. Having 8 children but lack the food or money to support them - that's not very wise. So what happens is the children end up starving, resorting to crime etc. And so the cycle goes.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	You have a rather juvenile concept of GOD, & Prayer!  Solving the problems of children in Africa is our job.  If we love GOD, we'll show it by the way we treat others.    GOD allows the Devil to rule in the Earth, to give us real choices.  GOD made us to have a loving relationship with Him forever.  But he will not force anyone to love Him, that would be unfair.|`|WJqL8Tglaa	But then who would he masturbate with?|`|HRvPoQzKaa	How can he? He doesn't exist.|`|ad6XOMliaa	Every great novel has a villain, a problem, and a hero.|`|mLccTAhLaa	He`s too busy killing babies.|`|dl97DmmYaa	His plan to permanently kill the devil includes answering your petty prayers.  He wanted to use you and me in that plan by providing our petty needs and then both of us will be used by the Lord to confront the devil.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	The Devil is only powerful if people listen to him and give into the temptation.|`|kHv0CuaMaa	"Evil" is indefensible.

"How can 127 million people be so advanced, yet be so wrong?"  -Let's give them another 40 years to see where their civilization is and then we can decide if they have all the right foundations.    "Could it be because the Japanese were able to PROTECT THEMSELVES from invading Europeans?"  -I dont think so.  I think they had already put up a wall to protect themselves from all outside cultures, not just the Christian ones.  Rome did not convert in a day.  It took 400 years and they were an open society.  Japan has really only been opened for about 100 years.  I am proud of the strides we have made so far.|`|K24JFTOcaa	the word of God is being told throughout all the world, it is a sign of the end times|`|tv8ywUH1aa	I don't think He did ignore him.

I may be mistaken or ignorant, but I am thinking not.|`|ZNo1Ah5taa	Some old Orthodox gospels but mainly alot of gnostic texts that the church labels as heresy and some of the scrolls have never been made known to the public leading to theory's about the churches suppression of texts that could be deemed as damaging to mainstream christainity.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	the dead sea scrolls are bits and pieces of o.t. scriptures , written in hebrew ,some tattered and torn , though one is a complete roll of isaiah, and strangely enough, particles of the apocrypha books (in hebrew) which were rejected by the palestinian jews in the 2nd. cent. because they couldn't verify the books as written in hebrew, but the church still put them in the bible, until martin luther fouled things up
Asyn8sLkaa	Christianity is more of an opinion, as are all religions. Religions are untestable and relative. But I think the you're on to something with the "theory of god".    Also evolution, while probably and likely, has not yet been proven to the degree that it can be called law. There's still a lot of unanswered questions that we need to look at a lot closer but I think we're getting a lot closer to the answers. I'm sure that evolution will become a law though.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	The majority of people these days are undereducated and don't understand what a "theory" actually is, in scientific terms.    Essentially it's a "possible explanation" for observed phenomena.    We have a theory of gravity. And a theory of electricity.    But even though those are just theories, no one denies that gravity and electricity still exist. Just as evolution occurs (we can see that plain as day, thanks to the way all the different animal species are "grouped", etc). just because we don't know for certain HOW and WHY it occurs, doesn't change the fact that it does.    Now, on the flipside, there is no "observed phenomena" that the God theory works into, so therefore religious belief isn't even worthy of the term theory. You were generous to even allow them that.    EDIT: Sorry, wasn't trying to lecture YOU, I was meant to be explaining how retarded other people are, but got carried away :P|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	I agree 100%|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Scientifically it doesn't even rise to the level of hypothesis.|`|u6tO3gdhaa	Actually the word 'theos' and theory are closely related.    Therefore, if psedoscience is belief based; then how is that not hypocritically the opiate of the people?|`|EepiLrmZaa	how can christianity even be a theory. there is zero evidence to support a theory. all the so called evidence consist of second hand accounts.|`|07xfGetvaa	Why?  Because Christianity is the real way. It might not have science proven facts, but people who ONLY depend on those to believe in something.... really need help.  The Bible has all the facts needed in the world.    so yeah.. we're made from apes  HAHAHAH :)  IT SHOULDNT BE A THEORY ANYMORE.. YEAH WERE ALL MONKEYS!!!|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	No no no no no.    Creationism isn't even f*cking close to a theory. Not even a hypothesis because there is no phenomena that was observed originally.    Creationists already have their answers and try to find "proof" to validate it. It should be the other way around. Creationism--excuse me--"Intelligent Design"--doesn't deserve a place in science.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Christianity is a failed hypothesis.    A scientific theory is NOT a weak term.  http://notjustatheory.com/|`|uXQcDsiAaa	i agree. it's more of a theory.|`|SqhGr6e3aa	A scientific theory is basically the same as a proven fact.    Religion is an unfounded hypothesis.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Ancient man had his Gods  (religion) and modern religion is the evolution of those religions up lifted by Epochal and Personal revelations over thousand of years.    The word you looking for is Theology. The answer is yes but that does not invalidate God in fact it supports the truth of God. The myriads of planetary systems were all made to be eventually inhabited by many different types of intelligent creatures, beings who could know God, receive the divine affection, and love him in return. The universe of universes is the work of God and the dwelling place of his diverse creatures. "God created the heavens and formed the earth; he established the universe and created this world not in vain; he formed it to be inhabited."|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	yes, and thank you!|`|WmU7jhObaa	why dont Atheists then walk on there hands and act like Monkeys if they think they came from them?

Here Monkey heres your Banana Catch!!|`|mPTBU0QDaa	neither can be proven, bottom line. both require faith.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	I studied this with attending Harvard University.  The Bible, Torah, and Qur'an do not deny evolution. It's just simply not spoken about. Muslims, Jews and Christian believe in the Big Bang. No one says that we as humans did not evolve from Gods first creation, Adam and Eve. Lets put logic together. The last 'cavemen', Neanderthals, probably lived about 20,000 years ago. Adam And Eve lived in approximately year 4004 B.C BUT the carbon dating experiments of prehistoric skeletons and artifact show the fact that cavemen actually lived 10,000 B.C - If that's true than Adam and Eve could have not been first (by scientific law) That throws Christianity off of their theory of when Adam and Eve where in existence by 5,996 years. In Islam and Judaism it is not spoke about what date Adam and Eve lived. We just simply believe that they were first. There is no true date. Christianity carries a lot of errors to their religion.     What I personally believe is who's to say that Adam and Eve looked as we look? If Caveman are proven to be REAL than just image how Adam and Eve looked like. I believe that we evolved from Gods first creation Adam and Eve. I believe that our bodies evolves to the living standards that we obtain in our everyday lifestyle because it is proven that many years B.C humans actually did not stand up straight.|`|faT4MyVkaa	No, it's poorly written fiction, not a theory.
o2sgh1fVaa	Well, religion can change the beliefs of many people. It can also make them more aware of what they are doing, like they should wear certain clothes or go to a special meeting. It can do a lot to many people and it can be sometimes very noticeable for any religion.
XN0cYCATaa	So you are saying that Life and Death and eternity in hell or not is not a big deal ??|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	I, and my religion, think there is truth in all faiths.  However, some have more truth than others.    We profess we have the fullness of truth as it is revealed by God to man.  Following a religion is good, but following the best of all that God gives us is really what we need.|`|vV425TqZaa	i don't i am atheist i don't believe every ones "non exist ant god" i believe evolution and if anyone disagrees with me ill make you cry. it is pretty much a war and im on the side going against the muslims, hate those bastards they bombed us.|`|lOzbR6tvaa	Simply evidence that a lot of humans fail to live up to the potential that evolution has managed to culminate in one species.|`|WiKJ6AlGaa	yes ,go to jungal , stay alone you will not need that . when  you come and stay with other  you need not other way|`|aaQUMXUzaa	to me any faith you may have should be personal and private.  Religion overall seem to cause a lot of wars, hatred and death.  Buddhism teaches not to harm anyone or any living thing. It would be totally against there belief to judge others, be involved in a war, harm anyone, any animal, or damage nature. Nor do they try to push there beliefs on anyone else. We could all learn a lesson from there actions and non-actions.|`|cYsYDaLmaa	hello. I think that religion is such a big deal because its what we believe in. I think some people go to the extremes because they are so caught up in the lies and they can't come back unless God intervenes. They only true religion is Christianity... and that's a fact. And that's not because I'm a christian. Look up all the evidence for Chrisitnity and then all the religions that pretend to be the answer to all your problems. Hope you see my point.

UmcMfBvjaa	I am 4 marijuana, not society's zombies who are brainwashed by tha government into thinking its tha devil. Tha only reason it's not legal is because it cant be taxed because it can be grown anywhere and there will be no profit in it. Think about it, why is alcohol and cigarette's legal when they kill people everyday?. Because there are very addictive and will make a lot of profit unlike marijuana which is not addictive. That just shows what kind of government we have because they would rather have money instead of human lives. A lot of people don't know the true facts about marijuana so they decide to believe in tha government who have done so many cover-ups you cant count it with both hands. Marijuana does not kill brain cells, this myth was made up  by scientist who literally suffocated a monkey with marijuana smoke. Deprivation of oxygen will kill brain cells so this can just be thrown out tha window. It does not make you lazy because michael phelps is tha exact opposite of lazy. There has not been a case of it causing cancer so don't even try it. It's not a gateway because i have been smoking 4 seven years and not thought about doing any of tha other drugs. Its not addictive. It makes a lot of freindships. It does not make you stupid because i have a 4.0 and i know a lot of college students who do it and are not dropping out or failing classes. Sorry 4 tha long entrie but i had 2 cover all tha lies. Think 4 yourselves, dont let tha government do it 4 you.    Stay high|`|jNypcSqzaa	against. It's pointless and stupid. It kills brain cells there's really no point and the fact it smells really bad.|`|np58wJjsaa	FOR.  seriously its no worse than alcohol or cigarettes. in fact cigarettes are worse. the reason it isn't legal is because the government wont be able to tax it b/c its so easy to grow that people will grow it themselves.|`|W4Dek41Jaa	I'm against marijuana.  This is because it ruins people.  It changes them, it ruins your brain.  It's disgusting.  And it affects young adults that are still developing who think it's okay, and people who encourage it should just I don't even know...but I think it's terrible.  So if you want to feel like your in space for your entire life GO AHEAD, and ruin your life.  It's not real, it's fake.  It makes you feel fake. It's just bad all together.  I think that whoever does it should go to jail for years, and have to spend their life educating people on the affects that it has on you.  And whoever thinks it's ' cool ' can go kill themselves, I could careless.  But I do care about all the people who think it's okay but just don't know that it's not.  I don't care what anyone says I know it ruins your body, and that it ruins your life, and that's it's bad. End Of Story.     P.S. I don't look up to Micheal Phelps, or basically anyone whose a sports star.  Because wow he can swim fast?  Um, is that something we need to spend our time and money on?  The Olympics?  Please.  Also, I don't really care about him or what he does because like I said I don't have like any respect for sports stars.|`|AA10802202	I'm against, for a few reasons, all of which have to do with health:    It is, like drinking, often used as an 'escape' from reality, or a break. It is far healthier to face what you're 'escaping'.    It is a chemical that is foreign to your body. People often defend it by saying "it's natural"... yeah. There are lots of natural things I wouldn't smoke. Like poop. THC is a natural chemical, but it is NOT a natural chemical your body knows how to deal with-- hence the high.    Long-term use leads to memory problems.    More tar is ingested smoking joints than cigarettes-- people hold the smoke longer, and tend to breathe deeper, allowing for more complete penetration of tar in their lungs. Basically,weed will get you lung cancer faster than camels will.    As for the pain management argument: There are other ways of managing pain. Allowing the use of marijuana because it has the capacity to be used to prevent pain 1) operates under the delusion that nothing else can do that, and 2) simultaneously allows marijuana to be used for purposes that are FAR less legitimate. It's not worth it, on the whole. Alcohol can also be used to reduce pain, if you get drunk enough-- but even if you don't consider the hangover, no one's clamoring for hospitals to legalize the use of Jim Beam for cancer patients.    As for the "it's no worse than cigarettes or alcohol"-- see above lung argument for cigarettes. As for alcohol, it may be no worse, but it's no better. Think of how many things we could create if we never strove for anything better than what we already have! My! The possibilities are endless(ly apathetic and complacent)! Why in the world do we research medicine at all, if our goal is only to do 'no worse'?

mMo2hwUBaa	This is actually in the Heavens.  The sign of Hercules has his heel upon the head of the serpent.    Just part of what is described.      But note that what is most important about this prophesy is that it refers to the "seed" of the woman.  Women don't produce seed in ancient religions.  This is therefore referring to a virgin birth.  Normally a man gives a woman the seed and she provides the egg or the fertile ground which is implanted.  Since Moses penned the exact account it would normally be impossible for a woman to have Her seed bruise the head of satan.  But, since Jesus was born without the seed of man, He became the seed (note: singular not plural seeds, therefore only ONE).  He bruised the serpent who betrayed and tricked Eve, when he defeated death which was the serpent's child.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Christ came to put satan under His feet    Gen 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.      The antagonistic relationship between snakes and man in this verse carries spiritual connotation as well:    the relationship between satan and Jesus (and His church)|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	Women eggs hurt snakes.|`|H7jy99NOaa	What translation did you get that text from?

The Jewish Perspective of Genesis 3:15       Using strictly the Simple Reading (peshat in Hebrew) of Genesis 3:15, the following conclusions may be drawn:      The woman (Eve) is the female progenitor of mankind.  [The Jewish Sages accept the notion that homo-sapiens existed before Adam & Eve, but that these were not endowed with the soul that G-d breathed into Adams nostrils which, in a sense, renders them as being sub-humans, or of the animal kingdom].        The enmity between snake and man, from mankinds perspective, stems from the fact that in general, snakes are pests, even dangerous pests.  From a snakes perspective, it is an animal without the ability to reason and, thus, it acts on natural instincts  it must eat to survive, and its main job is to look for sustenance while protecting itself from predators.          The respective references to seed, i.e., offspring, point to mankind relative to Eve, and the family of snakes relative to the serpent.          This is not a messianic prophecy by any stretch of the imagination.  Nothing in this verse refers explicitly to the Messiah other than in the generic sense, that the Messiah will be a human being who descended from Adam and Eve, i.e., someone of mankind.  Other than that, this verse describes the general notion that  people will have a dislike for snakes and hit them in the head, while snakes will bite people in their feet.       Taken from:    http://www.messiahtruth.com/gen315.html|`|AA11002471	The woman is God's heavenly arrangement (angels, cherubs, seraphs).  They 'produced' a seed .......Jesus.  He came out of heaven and was born on earth.  Satan bruised Jesus in the heal .....that is, he temporarily had Jesus dead.  Jesus will eventually 'bruise' Satan in the head .....that is, do away with him.  Or, as Romans 16:20 says it:  "The God who gives peace will crush Satan under your feet".|`|3aVxJYf6aa	Very simple but important    (Genesis 3:15) In this first prophecy of the Bible, Jehovah alluded to his purpose to have his heavenly spirit Son come to earth to live as the perfect man Jesus and then diebe bruised in the heelin that sinless state.    In pronouncing his judgment against Satan, Jehovah revealed a new expression of his sovereignty, a means by which he would restore peace and order to all his realm. To Satan, God said: I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel. (Genesis 3:15) Thus Jehovah revealed that it was his purpose to empower a seed to crush Satan and his forces and to prove the rightfulness of His sovereignty.Psalm 2:7-9; 110:1,?2.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	The Serpent in Paradise tempted the humans to disobey the rules of the Creator.

The serpent's seed includes the Jews and all non-white people; Adam's seed refers to white people only.     Cain was the son of the serpent and Eve, and, after he murdered his half-brother Abel, intermarried with the Pre-Adamic people of color in the land of Nod. All non-white humans are descended from Cain.     After Abel died, Seth was born to Adam and Eve and became the ancestor of all white people.     The serpent's seed (Jews and non-white people) are evil; Adam's seed (white folks) are good. And God forever "put enmity" between them in Genesis 3:15.    edit; so nev how do you know mine is wrong, it could be right, but of course every one will say it's wrong cause they don't like the message, got this of of the skeptics bible, and they have as much chance as being right as anyone else    here have a butchers what they say  http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/interp...|`|t4YoOX1paa	The seed of the woman is talking about Mary and Jesus, And the serpent is Satan, Jesus defeated Satan on the cross, This is a prophetic message in Genesis about the coming messiah and what he would do for us on the cross to conquer death and Satan .

As you ascend through worlds yet to come you will be given the opportunity to provide the things you have that will be of help to others and this will help you grow in life as well.    We cannot fully understand how God can be primal, changeless, all-powerful, and perfect, and at the same time be surrounded by an ever-changing and apparently law-limited universe, an evolving universe of relative imperfections.

I would consider that I have always been a "free-spirited" individual who likes to think outside the box...hence perhaps why I was naturally suited to a science background.

This is where a saying (hadith) attributed to Prophet Muhammad (salallahu 'alayhi wa salaam) fits in nicely I feel:    "Seek knowledge even if it be to China"     ....now many literalist Muslims may have said this is a weak or fabricated hadith. I beg to differ because what I think it means is keep an open mind in your search for knowledge because no one people on earth have a monopoly on knowledge for starters and knowledge could be attained anywhere because it is Allah subhana wa ta'ala that directs us towards something or some situation specifically in which there is scope for our learning and then inspires our soul. This could happen anywhere on the globe insha'Allah.     "To Allah belong the east and the West: Whithersoever ye turn, there is the presence of Allah. For Allah is all-Pervading, all-Knowing." [2:115]    For me personally the following sayings attributed to Prophet Muhammad (salallahu 'alayhi wa salaam) also make sense as this is how I came into Islam [alhamdulillah.....a long and unconventional story :) ]:    "Whoever follows a path in search of knowledge, God will guide him into a path leading into Paradise"    and also:   Seeking of knowledge is incumbent upon every Muslim... ~     Alhamdulillah.     [Qur'an verses 20:114, 26:83-84, 58:11] and more...    Now I am still the same person I was before I became a Muslim.....no different in personality and in my thirst for knowledge. I also do believe that the knowledge we are directed to seek pertains ultimately to knowledge of God: 'Al-Maarifat'.    You need to be able to think in the box ....this is guidance from Allah subhana wa ta'ala that is from Al-Qur'an and its commands and prohibitions for instance. You need to be able to think outside the box too as we are not robots and need to be flexible, adaptable, tolerant and accommodating and this is also taught in the Glorious and Noble Qur'an too.     I do not believe every hadith I read by the way as they of course have to uphold what is written in Al-Qur'an and of course the Qur'an comes first and foremost. Hadiths (though certainly not all) are divinely-inspired; Al-Qur'an is Divine. In those hadith books there are clearly a few that have come by way of the enemies of Islam....astaghferullah and they stand out a mile (so to speak) !!!. As Believers always hoping to be walking the path of 'Al-Maarifat' towards Allah subhana wa ta'ala, we should be able to know what is genuine and what is not insha'Allah.      Thanks for asking :)    Glory be to God most Great and Worthy of Praise  Subhana Allahi azim wa bihamdi.    ? Salam.
FZKFLTyLaa	Rather impractical from my point of view..
PsWzUuTtaa	Yes most likely, billions of people are following a circular arguement so yea just make it dramatic and $hit and once in a while throw in some superficial logic in there and over time you'll get followers. Just make me a saint or druid in ur religion :p|`|Gsd4VD13aa	Only if I were as gullible as Christians.|`|TBPzDU2vaa	I think you should follow your own SELF!  Your mind seems to be going in a circle...go slow, never fast in this predicament!  Take care.|`|K24JFTOcaa	no, Jesus can speaking the truth|`|1cGlucXyaa	We don't talk in circles, no.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	If I lie enough like you do, will you start beliveing it?|`|lOzbR6tvaa	No, it would just make me either sad or angry. Sad that you suffer a mental illness called religion or angry that you are a con-artist interested in personal gain or power.|`|zjKBp7Gbaa	Christians don't talk in circles, though the specific person you ask might not know exactly how to answer your question. Any given Christian cannot possibly know all of the answers to all questions concerning Christianity just as the average American does not know everything about the entirety of America, its history, its demographics, its geology, its native species, etc. It would be absurd to expect it of anyone.    Also, one cannot "make" people follow religions, such is a personal choice. For Christians, Christianity is what they, personally, believe to be the truth.     Holding all of this true, your question is unanswerable due to the erring first part of your statement.    Ignoring all in your question before the comma, your answer is no. No, you could not simply "make" me follow any religion at all.|`|PDUoC5Zsaa	You are talking in circles, I would not follow you anywhere. If you want to teach me something about Christian or another religion, first read up on that religion.|`|E9chZY74aa	We only speak linearly.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	Jeffy Jeffy time for your nap

AA10633378	It depends on the provider.  I've got life insurance and I'm gay and I've also gotten it for many of my clients who are gay as well.   I don't know what state you're in, but here it's illegal to ask the second part of the question that you state.  Obviously any carrier is going to be concerned if any individual, gay or non-gay, is HIV positive, but in California, at least, I've never, ever seen anything that asks if you have sex with men.    I can't and won't solicit business from outside my state, but I MAY be able to refer you to someone in your own state or province that MAY be able to help you. You can contact me thru Yahoo Answers to at least see if that's a possibility if you wish.  I've spent too many years of my life fighting discrimination, I don't want to give in to it now.|`|AA10953937	I have a feeling I have been around longer than you but some things have not changed.  However, what is different is how I deal with them.  I tell all my straight friends the name of the company and tell them do you know this company asks question that discriminates against people.  Give them the question and tell do not buy from that company.  I believe that is only way things will change.  As long as there are people who support the business they can do as they wish.  Until we do something as individuals and then collectively things will stay the same.    Good Question|`|PVYBLGFuaa	As you can see, the era of discrimination is still not yet over. It's kinda sad...
Rpd4nG6Yaa	you're not ****** up and you don't need counselling! i have a tendency to hate people for no reason at all, and i'm not a big fan of large groups, sounds awfully familiar =/ but really as long as your happy, and its not affecting anything else then the answer is no, you don't have to get along with everyone. Its just natural for some people, not everyone has to be very social.|`|ShXW6zEfaa	If you are happy with your life then thats fine.But if you think its a problem then i think you have a Social Phobia & you may need councilling for that.|`|9q7MZUpeaa	This is a good question. You don't need to get on with people, if you did, then you wouldn't be hating everyone. You are likely to be much more mature and more intelligent than the people you have come across in your life.     You certainly should attend counselling sessions if you find a NEED to get on with people. If you really find this a difficulty then please do see a counsellor.    All the best :)|`|qvW5ZYruaa	You don't need counseling. Don't let them tell you that. Nobody can force you into liking people. If you don't like them, fair enough. Personally, i prefer my own company to other people. I hate going to parties and other social event. But do i think i need counseling? No.     It's your personal preference. If you think that you need to get out more and meet people, and you feel like you need help doing that, then go for it. But if you like things the way they are, **** what they say.|`|xpP1PsAoaa	I HATE EVERYONE   and with no good reason whatsoever I think its natural somedays:)

Do you ever consider the Feelings of the women you use for your pleasure. Sex is not a sin but the way you are so cavalier about it is.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	actually the bible says if a man looks at a woman without intentions of marrying her then he should pluck his eyes out|`|bce49af4b285a96d81e7186b9e756de9aa	if you are never getting married then it's only biblical then you aren't having sex either    here's the deal. the new testament condones not marrying but the said "messing around" is only allowed in marriage. otherwise it is a sin. shoot, paul, the literal extreme christian, was never married. BUT, he was a virgin till he died.|`|QL0FOQMmaa	First of all, sexual intercourse is a gift given to mankind for marriage by God as the most intimate thing two people can share. "The two become ONE flesh." It was never intended to be a sport for one's temporal gratification and fulfillment of the lust of his flesh. God does not command you to marry, but if you choose to remain unmarried, you must then remain chaste unto the Lord, and be celibate. If you refuse to be celibate then you cannot avoid the fact that you are practicing sin if you are committing fornication (which is sex outside the bonds of matrimony).    "Flee sexual immorality! Every sin that a man does is outside the body," but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. 1 Corinthians 6:18    KJV says it this way, "Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body."    STD's are evidence that God's Word above is true, as STD's are the result of 'sinning against our own bodies' by using them in the way God did not intend them to be used.     Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10|`|603754877c948533f683edbbdee32e41aa	Sex before marriage is a sin and you're doing that, so who cares, go the distance.

1hciyvKdaa	Good question. I used teleflora. I ordered solid purple flowers just like the ad showed, purple roses are the rarest, they should never of advertised it, what they do is say, is ok to substitute if were out. I said roses, well ok, but you must provide the purple vase at least. I called right back and said NO substitions, she assured me shed fine the store in the area that had them. They sent out a cheap non all rose boquest in the right vase. I asked my daughter to send me a pic and they were NOT anything near a lovely bouquet, had it been really nice Id of been ok. So I demanded a second one sent, this one was a lil nicer but no roses. I demanded a real one just like the ad, all purple one it took three times to get them. I demanded the one on the website removed in good failth and they did!  Just look at the websites, then google maps your address put in florist and then call the ones that match the site you liked an arrangement from, ask them if they will honor the special price and option or ask if they want direct business and offer it lower. That way you know its in stock, what your wanting and the florist if its a direct purchase makes more money.
g0lKlQGnaa	No    I don't believe that people should be taxed more and forced to contribute to a charity of the government's choice.  Many wealthy people give a great deal to charity to begin with and I don't think it should be mandated    Many of us don't consider large government to be very effective in achieving its goals|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	i wouldn't recommend it, as the government tends to waste things|`|fEkKuGlEaa	If it really went to the poor, yes. I'd pay more taxes myself if it really went to help the downtrodden. Unfortunately, tax money seems to end up in a lot of useless places.     As to why--a society is best judged by how it treats its weakest members. But I would feel this way whether Christian or not.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	I just don't like the idea of the government getting their little grubbies on the money before they dole it out to anyone.    Have you noticed just how pathetic the government is when it comes to handling money!?!?!    If more Christians had money, then they could cheerfully give the money to the poor themselves and leave the government out of it period!|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	I support feeding the poor. Where that money comes from is up to politicians. The majority of the wealth that exists in the US is in the hands of the middle class and for that reason it is the middle class that pays the majority of taxes. I don't believe it is right to punish the wealthy with exorbitant taxes but they should pay according to their ability. I hope this doesn't sound like I'm dodging your question but simply increasing taxes on the wealthy would only make a small dent in the needs of the poor on a global basis.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Yes.  Absolutely.  I'm not wealthy, but I'm more than willing to give my taxes to feed people who are hungry, instead of building bigger war machines designed to kill my brothers in Christ.|`|EAigtBDBaa	I would support feeding the poor but if we over tax the wealthy, people will lose their jobs    We all should give whatever we can give. I would rather have a good tax break for people who feed te poor|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	i think you mean to ask liberals|`|u3KhqAVvaa	From THIS Christian's point of view, absolutely not.    That's criminal.  Stealing money from one group of people (the wealthy in your example) isn't right.  Even if the suggestion of the end result is right (feeding the poor).    First, the poor don't create jobs.  The wealthy do.  If you're in America, you know that we've had politicians create such horrid conditions that many of our work is offshore now.  Why?  Because our politicians have taxed our companies to death.    The wealthy pay taxes that pay for the poor.  Yes, there are many ways to minimize taxes, but what they pay is much more than you and I.  And, they create jobs.  The poor don't do that.      If you steal from the rich to feed the poor, you ultimately have everyone with nothing.    America is a wonderful land, or used to be anyhow, that allows anyone to get out of being poor.  We can work our way to a better life.    There are reasons socialism doesn't work.|`|r3sg5Xsdaa	I would be against it.  The poor don't want our handouts, they want to be self sufficient.  Have an equal part in the global market.  Feeding the poor is good, but that is just a temporary solution.  I would rather not tax the wealthy more (what is wealthy?) and instead have them invest time, skills, business, trade, and commerce into impoverish nations and areas.  Instead of a business running off, and closing shop because it is in poor neighborhood encourage them to stay.    I want the poor to be independent and not dependent on the dole.  _______  There was a major grocery store in a poor area of Vegas.  Because of internal and external problems they closed up.  Too bad, because it was like the stores in the suburbs of Vegas.  I  think it lasted about 3 years.  Sure there were problems, but I think the gov. should of encouraged them to stay.  Now it is an empty lot.|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	You ask a vague question.  Define wealthy.  With taxes for the poor, we already pay them.  It's called welfare, Medicaid, foodstamps, etc.  I have no problem with these programs, but I do think limits should be placed on them.  For example, I think a person should be allowed to enroll in them for 6 months but not more than one year.  After that, the benefits would cease, and they could not reapply for another 2 or 3 years.  1) A person should be able to find SOME type of work within 6-12 months, and 2) limits would stop the abuses of the system, like those people who enroll on welfare and stay on it for life.    Should the government tax my income at a higher rate in order to disburse that money in the form of free checks to people who are "poor"?  No.  That's just wrong.  If the government did that, what incentive do the "poor" people have to ever get off welfare?  All they have to do is keep their income level low, and they will continue receiving free checks from the government.  It's not even Christian to do that.  Even Jesus said that if someone wants to eat, they should go to work.    So, no, leave my income alone and teach those people how to fish instead of giving them free fish.    God bless.

sq4BcGbIaa	je vous manque|`|Tn1bMQ3Aaa	The verb Manquer switches the placement of the pronouns when you are missing someone. Not when you miss something.  It's tricky for us English speakers. As you see in the 1st post we naturally want to use the pronoun "je" first. However, the person being missed actually goes in the subject pronoun position.  The person doing the missing will go where you would normally put the object pronoun.     te me manques  or  vous me manquez    je vous manque actually means "you miss me" "did you miss me"

1j8mlvkkaa	* Make him a candle lit dinner for 2, with romantic music so you can dance to it after you eat. Cover the room with christmas lights, turn the lights off so the christmas lights and the candle lights are the only light. Cover the room with silk rose petals. (This is what i did for my boyfriend last year).    * Get a cool little jar and a bunch of red strips of paper. On each strip of paper write one reason you love him, then use the paper you wrote on to make little puffed up origami hearts (there are youtube videos that show you how). Put all of the hearts in the jar and give him the jar. You could also make him origami hearts with pockets in them and put the reasons you love him in there. That's what I'm doing for my bf this year. http://www.dltk-kids.com/world/japan/mor...    * Make him a scavenger hunt to find his gift, put a hershey kiss with each clue.    * Make him coupons (my sister did this for her bf last year. She included a "Get out of fight free card" (if you can do it, I wouldn't be able to shut up, but my sister could apparently))    * If he likes puzzles, go onto thinkgeek.com and get him one of those Magic IQ Gift Boxes (http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/games/... Put the coupons inside it, or put the reasons you love him inside it...or come up with something else cool to put in it. You could put gift certificates to go on a date in there, or make 1 of those little origami hearts and tell him it's your heart or something. :-) Either way, it'll be fun to watch him struggle to get into it!   Good luck!|`|e4c6c6101ab139227f89d47b6a66324baa	candy
th4eHIrTaa	Yes, I think you should get him something else. You don't want your gift to be just another "add-on" from his previous girl.     If money is an object, make him something special. For example, a sweet card, a delicious dinner, or yummy dessert. :)    If money isn't an object, go for concert tickets, game tickets, wallet, or his favorite cds or dvds :)    Hope it helped!
DIj072Sqaa	The strife between Hindus and Muslims date back to the 16th century. After the Mughals took over India, there was relative peace for some time between the Hindus and Muslims. This harmony between these two groups broke down, with the harsh Muslim rule at the end of the 17th century. Under the strict Mughal leader Aurangzeb, Taxes were imposed on all Hindus, after they had previously been abolished, Hindu temples were destroyed, and Hindus were forced to convert to Islam. By the 18th century the Mughal Dynasty had fallen apart, leaving the Indian subcontinent open and defenseless.    Consequently the British moved in, yet as the British were gaining control, both Hindus and Muslims came together and fought against British rule. Tensions grew higher as both Hindus and Muslims were refused high-ranking jobs in the government and the military. By the end of the 19th century the Indian National Congress, had been formed. The Indian National Congress was comprised of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, yet it was dominated by Hindus because of the huge numbers of them. People backed by the Indian National Congress began to make demands for equal rights and freedom from colonial rule. During the 1920s Hindus and Muslims banded together in a non-violence resistance lead by the head of the Indian National Congress, Mohandas K. Gandhi. In order the stop the resistance the British transferred some political power and more equal representation to the Indian National Congress. In the 1930s Muslim leaders lead by M.A. Jinnah, felt that the Indian National Congress, which was dominated by Hindus, was making all the choices for British ruled India and were basically excluding any Muslim leaders from the decision making process. The Muslim leaders felt that in order to protect the heritage of Islam, they must have their own state to rule over. In 1940 the All-India Muslim League under Jinnah declared its want for its own state called Pakistan, meaning "land of the pure." Both sides started to become uneasy thus deteriorating the relations between the two. On August 16, 1946 in the demand for separate Muslim state, the Muslim League called for "Direct Action a day where thousands of Muslims and Hindus clashed violently. As a growing unrest started to sweep the country, the British felt that it was their time to leave. On midnight, August 14, 1947 Pakistan celebrated its independence, the very next day India celebrated its.    Despite the independence of Pakistan, this did not solve or put a damper on the conflict between Hindus and Muslims, the old problems still remained. Some may see the conflict just as a dispute between two different religions ideals. Although the conflict is much more complex than just a difference in values. Violence is the only kind of relationship that these two religions have known of for some time now. This violence has been perpetuated over the last few decades by various incidents. One of the more recent incidents was the destruction of the Babri Masjid mosque in Ayodhya, in North-central India. Fanatical Hindu groups claim that the site that the mosque was the birthplace of Ram, an incarnation of one of the Hindu Gods. In 1992 a mob of Hindu zealots destroyed the 18th century building. This touched off riots across the country that has killed thousands in the past years.    In recent years Muslims have been at the hands on the Hindu controlled Indian government. Wherever one looks, the obvious signs of the governments non-partisan can be seen. Possibly the most visible pro-Hindu policy by the government is the official name change of Bombay to Mumbai, a Hindu goddess. The political party currently in power is the Bharatiya Janata Party. This party has formed a coalition with a out-spoken anti Muslim party. The Maharashtra state government dissolved the State Minorities Commission a public body set up to help maintain the rights of minorities.    The Indian government policy has this far been ruled by the feelings of partisan Hindu nationalism, a reserved stance on the problem, oppression of Muslims, and a basic lack of energy put to rectifying the problem. The Indian government has only aggravated the problem and made the future look even bleaker.    Hindus and Muslims have lived together on the same land for more than a thousand years. The future does not look bright for this conflict, tensions are on the rise, people not being educated to what is really happening, and most of all, people not understanding each other. Breaking a long history of violence is hard to do, but it can be done.

JuRHr9g9aa	"born again" is just a modern day american "christian cliche lingo" term.  it is no where in the bible.  it implies that you now have a life with meaning  rather than living without meaning.    birth 1 - physically born into the world, but a slave to your own sin  birth 2 (born again) - spriritually born into what you were created for, which is glorifying God    i don't like the term because it gets misused a lot and there is a massive amount of background to the term.|`|XqpRYh52aa	You have to start with a lobotomy|`|ewWUFWyWaa	YOU HAVE TO DIG YOUR PRIMITIVE ROOTS TO GET THERE!    Before his conversion Saint Paul was instrumental in the death of countless followers of Jesus Christ. He must have left behind a lot of widows and orphans. He never repented, but he is "born again!"  After his conversion he doesnt have people killed anymore, but he still has a special hatred for certain people. He doesn't like gays and lesbians, he hates women, and he doesn't like Cretans. He hates widows, especially the ones that he left behind in his past DUNG life as he call it. So he is denying any church help to any widow and no apologies, either.  He hates escaped slaves and he orders them to return to their masters. In fact, he dedicated the whole book of Philemon to teach escaped Christian slaves to return to their masters.    Titus 1:12-13 (NIV)  (Saint Paul writes) Even one of their own prophets has said, CRETANS ARE ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS. THIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE! Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith    Saint Paul wrote the bulk of the New Testament. He laid down the basis for the new Christian religion. Apparently he doesnt like the people of the Island of Crete. He is accusing them on hearsay evidence that they are ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS! Christians ought to know that the "born again" idea and the transforming power of God the Holy Ghost has no effect on the Cretan Christians. The Cretan Christians need to be rebuked sharply that they are no good people.  If a Cretan fills out a job application anywhere the hiring manager is tipped off that they are ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS! So good luck all ye Cretans Christians! What if Saint Paul would have made the same statement in the Bible about the American Christians?    I know I know Saint Paul was moved by God the Holy Ghost to write what he wrote and he was not aware of it According to the fundies the Bible is 100% the Word of God.|`|HBp5r76haa	Yes, in a way, except, you don't just pretend:    When, upon hearing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, you feel convicted and repent from your sins, and you believe that Jesus is the only one who can save you, as He *is* Savior, and He died for atonement of your sins, then you are "born-again" - which literally means you are born "from above"by the power of the Spirit of God.   Therefore you are a NEw Creation - your sinful nature is gone and the blood of Jesus Christ has washed you white.  It doesn't mean you will never sin again, but it surely means that your relationship to sin will change. If you are sincere in your repentance and the Spirit of the Lord lives in you, you will no longer love the world as you did, but you will realize that God is all you have and all you need.    God bless you|`|AA11282654	Right. It just requires a "falling away" from the Lord so you can come back... as many times as you want.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	No. You really become a new person. Your old self is washed away. Your sins are forgiven and you walk with the Lord.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	I don't like the kind of emotional spasm that the phrase has come to mean, or its association with all that is worst in conservative Protestantism - switch your brain off, worship the Bible, sing dreadful choruses - but I also think the question is unfair.    To come to faith, however quietly and undramatically, involves a change of heart and direction.  I was that kind of person: now I'm going to be this kind of person.  I used to take that attitude, but I now realize I was wrong and from now on I'm going to take this attitude.  I used to be me-centred, now I'm going to be centred on something greater than me, much more wonderful than I could ever be.  I used to be a pig, a drunk, a bastard: not any more.  I really have stopped beating my wife.    If you are also part of a community that will nourish and support you through your drastic switch in lifestyle, you stand a healthy chance of sticking to your promises; that community will also hold you accountable.  Alcoholics Anonymous and Weightwatchers understand this perfectly well.  When you become a Christian it's not just your eating and drinking habits that change (although perhaps they should: obesity = gluttony, a sin? discuss!) but your whole life.  I don't think this is such a difficult idea to grasp.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Jesus forgives ALL SINS past, present, and future, no matter what those sins are, so long as you believe the truth about Jesus.  :)     THAT'S the kind of salvation that Jesus gives!  :D    Only faith alone in Jesus alone saves.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

9mLjDa5kaa	Because people misunderstand the verses about works.     Here's the bottom line:     Salvation is by FAITH ALONE IN JESUS WITHOUT WORKS    Works are only for rewards.  And even if you don't do any works, you're not saved by works anyway, and you can't add works to Jesus's perfect salvation.  You're only saved by faith alone in Jesus without works.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	We are not saved by works because we can never be or do anything to be good enough to have salvation in our own right. But when we are saved by the grace of God, we follow this with showing others what it is to live for God. Our lives show what we truly believe and will be the "light in the darkness".  Actions always speak louder than words, and we are to be Christ-like in all we do or say. We need to show a lost and dying world that there is hope, and where we found it, and how it changes us because He is Lord.|`|L6E6lDGKaa	You don't have to do good works. You should want to do good works. It's the natural outflow of a Christian life. It's the evidence of being a Christian. If your motivation is avoiding punishment, then you have misunderstood God.

It does not say that you have to work to get salvation or to keep it.   Salvation is a one time thing. If you get it-- you can not lose it.  Rahab (v.25) did what she did "BECAUSE" she believed- not because she wanted to believe.  Abraham (v. 23) "believed" God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.    No where does the Bible say you have to work to be saved. That is a Catholic teaching, and is not held by any Christian denomination.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	Lol funny notions. God saves us by grace as long as we worship him for all eternity. It almost deserves a facepalm    However there are better "questions" you can ask to disprove Christianity, not like Christians will accept that there religion has been debunked a long time ago.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Because we have to cooperate with God's grace. He saves us by grace and we make His grace a apart of us by loving our neighbor. We can't just sit back taking it all in and doing whatever we want. Neither can we earn our way to God by rushing around trying to earn brownie points. It's both: grace and works.    Read the bible passages from James that the first guy posted. A lot of people tend to downplay this book of the bible, or to ignore it altogether, or to thumbs down answers that refer to it.|`|Q1XUe0PDaa	Because you have to do works. Any one with any reading skills and comprehension who reads the Bible knows this.  All those people who run around skiping that part and think they got a free pass to heavan from magic grace with no work of their own are screwed.   Thats just an excuse to be lazy, selfish and to continue a life of sin.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	This seems to be on many peoples minds tonight.  We are saved by grace and because we love Jesus we will do good works.  Thus, as Selah has provided, faith without works is dead.  If you say you believe something and do not practice it or the reverse you are a hypocrite and the truth is not in you.|`|tv8ywUH1aa	In my opinion, this either/or business is off. I believe Grace/Faith and Works go together. It's not one or the other, it's both. They work together. I believe we are saved after all we can do. If we do our honest best, God takes care of the rest. We do works as best as we can, but it won't be good enough to earn our way into heaven, that's when grace steps in.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because the true Grace of God lead to works.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) why does the bible say we ARE SAVED BY GRACE.and then later on make it sound like u have to do works?    I think that it's because we are saved by grace, but later on we have to do works....      2) if it says u are saved that should be it    SO, if someone hiring you says that you're going to be paid $500 a week, that should be it, right?  No need to show up for work, right?      3) u shouldnt have to spend the rest of your life racing the clock worrying about not messing up or making sure we witness before we die etc.    Well, you (that is, we Christians) DON"T have to do these things.  Salvation is NOT earned by works, by sinlessness or by evangelizing.  However, AS  A CHRISTIAN, you *need* to live a Christian life.  That *of necessity* includes works and obedience.  These are *evidence* of your love for your fellow man and your love for Jesus, respectively.  They are not *requirements* in the sense that your salvation is dependent on them.  They are requirements in the sense that if you are not living in this manner, you have not really obtained salvation.  Let me put it another way:  salvation necessarily results in love for Jesus.  Jesus said (roughly) "if you love me you will obey my commands" - not "you better obey me or you're toast".  Jesus also instructed us to love others.    NOW, if we do NOT obey Jesus, and we do NOT perform good works, that lack does not necessarily cause you to lose your salvation.  Rather, that lack is evidence that you have not obtained salvation!    Consider the thief on the cross.  He died without the opportunity to perform good works OR to be obedient.  Jesus told him, "you will be with me in paradise".  Works and obedience are requirements of a Christian *lifestyle*.  They are *not* requirements of salvation - they are merely visible results of salvation.    That being said, there *are* sins that can separate a Christian from salvation, for example  http://www.bible-reviews.com/separating....    However, salvation is not earned by obedience or good works.    Oh - and anything good we do, no matter how big or small, is never enough.    Jim|`|dGeXw0I4aa	As someone who has received salvation, you should follow what God has planned for you. If that involves "works" of any kind, then as a loving follower, you should be willing to carry them out.    However, it's not that your salvation is "revoked" if you don't. However, if your mindset is such that you hate the idea of, or can't be bothered, to carry out God's will, you have to ask yourself if you've really given your life to Him in the first place.|`|TNbhUSAIaa	Saved by grace.

The age of spiritual striving. When evolving mortals have passed through the physical, intellectual, and social stages of development, sooner or later they attain those levels of personal insight which impel them to seek for spiritual satisfactions and cosmic understandings. Religion is completing the ascent from the emotional domains of fear and superstition to the high levels of cosmic wisdom and personal spiritual experience. Education aspires to the attainment of meanings, and culture grasps at cosmic relationships and true values. Such evolving mortals are genuinely cultured, truly educated, and exquisitely God-knowing. Page 577-4|`|EAigtBDBaa	We are saved by grace, but we need to do good works to keep our faith alive.  Paul tells us how to get saved and become Christians. James tells us about our Christian requirements.    Think of it as a marriage. Would you want to get married if you do not perform acts of marriage?|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Good works are the result of faith. The two usually go hand-in-hand, but faith must come first, in order to have empathy and compassion for others.     " We are saved by grace, through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the free gift of God. "    "Faith without works is dead."|`|rx20pKgOaa	I think it means that no matter what we do we cannot save ourselves.  It is our faith in Christ that saves us.  But it is up to us to do all we can to show our faith in Christ by our works.      I don't race against the clock or worry about messing up, but I do try in some small way every day to do good to others as Christ would have me do.  Never-the-less, no amount of good I do will save me, only Christ can save me.  But I show Him my love by doing what he would have me do.     Faith, without works, means nothing.|`|cukK4LrOaa	It can be confusing but its more simple than you may realize.    Faith and Works are parallel meaning that they move with each other. You cannot have faith without works and expect to be saved but also you cannot have works without faith and expect to be saved.    Works are the natural response to our faith in Jesus. Because we are faithful we do works to glorify His name. We definitely don't have to "earn" our salvation but if we truly believe we will do those things that are called "works" as a natural response to his Love.|`|tjXOuw2Zaa	Kim loving the Lord is a free choice.  Good behavior is usually a character trait of someone that believes in God.  No Christian should feel he is pressured to out do his neighbor in good deeds.

All this "salvation confusion" came along when the Original Kingdom gospel Christ taught was abandoned for Paul's blood for sin gospel.

Believing isn't enough it's the only thing you need to be saved, but would you jump of a cliff after you got pulled up this question is exactly what is being implied. You were saved from your sins and you have help to not do them with the Holy Spirit not to sin. You witness because you love the people you witness to. It makes no sese to let people believe lies when you know the truth.|`|7c1571dd44766a175ba75b4aae07cf04aa	we are saved by grace through faith alone.  please do be uncertain on this point, because the bible is clear.  (Eph. 2: 8-9)(Romans 3: 20, 28)(Galatians 2: 16)  However we must remember the def. of a christian and remember what jesus said in the great commission, these two reaffirm (james 2: 24)  faith without works is dead.  a true experience and relationship with jesus will cause fruit (works) in your life; you'll want to witness, live holy and so on.  i pray this answers your ques.  please check out www.carm.org|`|C8b3KsrGaa	A youth pastor put it to me this way a few years ago......... Okay, say you are driving down the road doing 70 in a 50 and you get pulled over by a cop. He comes up to your window and you begin talking over the incident. You both know you deserve the ticket. But he graciously lets you slid by with a warning(we all know this would never happen, but that would be the grace that saved you). Would you go over to your friends house and say nothing to them or would you be telling them about what happened. The works doesn't necessarily mean that you have to "work" at it. The works can mean showing Christ through your every day life and how you live. By holding the door open for an elderly lady so she can get through, or giving a simple smile. Everybody does things differently. My mother spends at least 4 hours a day in prayer and devotion and takes every opportunity to witness to anyone who will listen to her. I, on the other hand, spend about an hour a day in prayer and devotion, and I witness when I have the chance to, but my "works" are simple things such as watching a friends kids for free so she can go to work on Saturday. Everyone is different, and nobody is the same. ;-) The Bible says faith without works is dead, but everyone "works" in a different way. As for the racing the clock thing, when you get saved, you are under God's grace. That means He will help you along your walk, it doesn't mean that he will take the temptation away from your life. My mom used to tell me....pray for patience and God will not give it to you, He will give you the opportunity to be patient. If you are trying to stop cussing you usually dont just stop(though that would be nice for some). You have to train your mind to say something else ot think something else instead of that cuss word. It is something of course that has to be worked at, but the end result is usually the better one.|`|hQDapmICaa	Sister, please don't be deceived. The scripture clearly states that all fruitless trees will be uprooted and burned in fire.    When you are under GRACE, you are not under LAW. And it is written that Love fulfills the LAW and the Prophets.    But God is expecting true love, NOT Love is words only. This is what we call 'WORK' here.    This is how the sheep are distinguished from the goats (Matthew 25:31-46)    This is what James said when he taught that Faith without works is dead.    Peace!|`|bae05fc0b937cc0c315763576b05e5d7aa	Eph 2:8-10  WE are saved first and then we do the good works because we are saved.
RC5RAzykaa	You should keep the Sabbath (which is Saturday), not out of worry, but because you love God (if indeed you do).    1st John 5:3  For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.     The Commandments are the Ten Commandments (The Law), to break them is to sin.    1st John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.      Your fiance needs to decide where his allegiance lies, with money or with God.    Matthew 6:24  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.     Mark 8:36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?    Its a hard decision, as is tithing ten percent of what you earn is a tough decision.  But it is the right one, and God will bless it.      Sabbath Day is about to start (sundown Friday to sundown Saturday), I will e-mail you later, drop me an e-mail to remind me please, for we have much to discuss about the Holy Sabbath,  I tell you now, it is the sign of God in the foreheads of the people of God in the end times, but we shall discuss that later    Jesus is God, God bless YOU!  It would appear He is already doing so by working on your conscience, otherwise this important truth wouldn't concern you.   I am glad it does however.  What a mighty and awesome God Jesus is!!!!!    p.s Kevin Thompson has lied to you and misquoted the Bible in his answer to you above, here is the REAL verse.  Colossians 2:16  Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:    Notice the "sabbath days" is not capitalized, it refers to the new moon sabbath days, that we as Christians, are not to keep.  Even if this verse was in reference to the seventh day Sabbath, it would be saying no man should judge you for KEEPING the Sabbath, for you would be doing what is right.    I'm sorry, but people who add their own words to the Bible and by so doing pervert the truth completely disgust me.  Mr. Thompson has perverted the scripture.  "or for not celebrating " are words completely of his own creation.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Kim, for us Christians any day and every day is the right day to rest in the Lord.

So the Jews chose Saturday for some reason and many Christians choose Sunday in honor of Jesus resurrection.  The important thing is to set time out together and apart to renew yourselves with God.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	I believe the Bible has contradictory messages about this. Jesus lives his life in a manner to suggest it is right to observe the sabbath, yet I think some verses teach not to observe it. Otherwise, the NT only teaches not to partake in the sacrifice of life.     It is ignorant for Christians to abandon God's other earlier teachings in the new testament, but seeing as the OT teaches to murder gays and that shellfish are an abomination, I'm not surprised they left those older practices behind.    Funny how they reject every commandment in the OT except for the extremely few they actually like, like the 10 commandments. One of the commandments is to "Keep holy, the Sabbath Day" as pointed out earlier. Apparently Christians even choose between the commandants. They also pick which part's of the Bible they want to be metaphorical (like the creation story). Truly theirs is a pick and choose religion.|`|AA10471892	The sabbath requirement is found within the confines of the old covenant which was a legally binding agreement between God and the children of Israel, and that covenant was tailored to them and their condition, being a stiff-necked, rebellious people, devoid of faith.     The sabbath was the sign of that old covenant between them.  It was a shadow of the true, spiritual rest one can find in Christ, even as the sacrifices were a shadow of the sacrifice of Christ.  We have the reality: Christ. There is no need for the shadows, and you cannot be held to the conditions of a covenant you were never a party to.    That covenant ended, and with it went the requirements of that covenant.  If either party to a covenant dies, said covenant ends, just like a marriage covenant.  Did Jesus die?  Was He not the God of the old covenant? Scripture says He was.    The apostle Paul warns Christians not to be convinced or tricked into going back to the old covenant and the bondage / yoke found there in places like Galatians 5:1.    The new covenant has no requirement to observe days like the sabbath. The physical works of the law are replaced by the spiritual realities.  Circumcision is not of the flesh, but of the heart, for example.    .|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Romans and Colossians say not to keep any sabbath|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Jesus is our Sabbath. We rest in Him.

Sounds like something a devout Christian ought to do.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	I'm not going to go by the bible on this one. I am going to go with common sense. In today's society we need our jobs for survival. If they say work...then work....We have been without a job for the last seven months. Last year was hard. Hubby is now working again thank goodness.  You know...the church doors open more than just on the sabbath. You have Wednesday night service, revivals, other fellowship time. God wants us to do what we have to do. Being in the church is not a guarantee to heaven...it's how we act and feel. If I can find the verse about praying in quiet instead of praying just so everyone can hear...I'll let you know. Stay with God, your prayers and in your prayers ask God for the time that weekends wont be a necessity so that you and he can once again worship together on the Sabbath|`|LLey4VRzaa	First of all it is a Commandment...Ex 20:8 -   "Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.    Second Jesus said,"Keep my Commandments."    Third, it doesn't matter what day you serve, as long as you take at least one day for the Lord.    Colossians 2:16-23  16 So don't let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new-moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. 17 For these rules were only shadows of the real thing, Christ himself. 18 Don't let anyone condemn you by insisting on self-denial. And don't let anyone say you must worship angels, even though they say they have had visions about this. These people claim to be so humble, but their sinful minds have made them proud|`|hQDapmICaa	To be perfect, we must follow Jesus' steps, right? So, what did Jesus do?    He did good on the Sabbath (not only on the Sabbath but for the whole week). You do likewise. And this is the work we must do to be saved (Love in action not in words)      Peace!|`|vuAD59egaa	Hi Kim,      I do understand your predicament. I have been in a similar situation regarding working on the Sabbath or lose my job. Years ago I made a very tough decision because of my religious conviction regarding God's Holy Sabbath. I decided to give up a very good job to be true and obedient to proper Sabbath observance.  I prayed after I quit my job and ask God to lead me to a Job that didn't force me to work on Saturdays. God answered my prayer in a wonderful way. I got hired on by a much better company, with more pay, and the company did not require me to work on Sabbath.      I have had many friends challenged in this area time and time again. Sometimes you can have your Pastor to write a letter and explain why your Church forbids Sabbath work, and most Employers would work with their employee for religious reasons.     If you need further guidance in this area, feel free to contact your local Seventh-day Adventist Church, and they should be able to assist your Fiance if he desires to get Sabbath off.     I hope this helps.    Take care,|`|LlurBCwnaa	We shouldn't worry about it because HIS COMMANDMENTS ARE NOT GRIEVOUS, THEY ARE NOT BURDENSOME, THEY ARE NOT A HEAVY YOKE OF BONDAGE... ;)    We should rather be obedient cos we love Him and want to honour Him and glorify Him.    He has given a plain commandment with a thus saith the Lord.  Do we dare go against it?    Also for those who say that Jesus is our Sabbath is like saying that the Queen of England is England.  Makes no sense.  Jesus is not the Sabbath but He is the Lord of the Sabbath.    Another way of seeing this: Faithful people in the OT times knew that in God was their rest (Psalm 37:7 etc) yet they also were able to distinguish between this rest in God and the weekly 7th day Sabbath rest.  Likewise, Christ is still our rest but that doesn't contradict the Sabbath rest!    Think of it this way.  There are 2 institutions that God gave to our race before Adam fell: the Sabbath and Marriage.  Both alike are attacked today.  Now as for marriage, both the OT and NT Scriptures liken the relationship between God and His people to MARRIAGE.  BUT DOES THAT MAKE MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN OBSOLETE????    NEVER!    SAMETHING  - THE SABBATH IS NOT RENDERED VOID BECAUSE JESUS IS OUR REST!      Those who use Romans 14 - read it carefully.  The whole chapter is about DISPUTABLE AND DOUBTFUL THINGS (verse 1).  Concerning virgins, Paul said he had no commandment from God and therefore gave his opinion (1 Cor 7:25).  The principle is clear:  WHEN THERE IS NO COMMANDMENT FROM GOD (ie when the thing being considered is DOUBTFUL), then do not pass judgement BUT Psalm 111:7-8 says that God's Commandments are VERY SURE AND STAND FAST FOREVER!!!    Think about it - He spoke it with His own voice and wrote it with His own finger.  His commandments are a plain THUS SAITH THE LORD, are they not?  Therefore they cannot be what is being controverted in Rom 14.    As for Colossians 2, read Leviticus 23.  Listed here are the Sabbaths that were shadowy.  These were abolished and they are besides (verse 38) the 7th day Sabbath which will continue for eternity.

God will not move only on your saying "God please answer my prayer."
yQNit56Qaa	1) If you believe the stories of the OT bible are true, then why did God stop interacting with us?    Who told you that he did, and why did you believe them?      2) Where's our burning bushes?    Well, in the 1500+ years described by the bible, only once did an angel appear as a burning bush.  I think that was a "one off".      3) Why doesn't God personally reprimand each and every one of us when we do something wrong?    Again - you fail to comprehend the chronological span of the bible.  In the 1500 years mentioned, exactly how many people heard directly from God or from an angel?  30, perhaps (excluding those crowds who heard Jesus speak)?  Well, if only one guy every 50 years - on average - all over the world - hears from God directly, what makes you think that you would?  Or that your neighbor would?  Or that you would even be aware of such a thing?    The truth is, there are far *more* claimed instances of people hearing God directly in modern times than there ever were in the bible.

Married 10 years this May. :)|`|AA12360579	Never been in love.|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	I love my husband. I think that there's a love beyond being "in love".  I equate "being in love" to teenagers. I think the deeper kind of love is when you have stuck through hard times with your partner, sickness and health especially, and the bond between you is something more than just a love feeling.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	yes, and she had better know...she married me :-P|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Yes and have been for the last decade with the same person.

Mx07dTipaa	well people everywhere are different and look different. even in the same country, no two people look alike. im japanese but i look more korean. my cousin looks more russian-mixed because his father is russian, and my sister is "too tall" to be japanese. but we are all Japanese. but to answer your question, japanese people are usually medium in height. many of the men and women are slim/slender and have long or wavy black hair. skin is usually yellowish-white, not like chinese people who have yellow skin. and many have eyes that are small and/or slanted.|`|BRg8RNPjaa	Slim, slanted eyes, pale skin, some are masculine.|`|sIqXCXoVaa	BOIINNGGG!|`|z93tSvKxaa	Soft squishy dumplings.|`|8zXJ06evaa	curly blond hair  big blue eyes  large genitalia
f9HltlEwaa	Cephas (?)    John 1:42    He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John, you shall be called Cephas", which is translated 'Peter'. (New International Version)   1 Corinthians 1:12    But I say that each of you says "I am of Paul", or "I am of Apollos", or "I am of Cephas", or "I am of Christ".     Galatians 1:18 NRSV    Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him for fifteen days;     In these passages, 'Cephas' is given as the nickname of the apostle better known as Simon Peter. The Greek word is transliterated ?? (Kphas).    The apostle's given name appears to be Simon, and he is given the Aramaic nickname, kfa, meaning 'rock'. The final sigma (s) is added in Greek to make the name masculine rather than feminine. That the meaning of the name was more important than the name itself is evidenced by the universal acceptance of the Greek translation, ?? (Petros). It is not known why Paul uses the Aramaic name rather than the Greek name for Simon Peter when he writes to the churches in Galatia and Corinth.[4] He may have been writing at a time before Cephas came to be popularly known as Peter. According to some Church Fathers, such as Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius, there were two people named Cephas: one was Apostle Simon Peter, and the other was one of Jesus' Seventy Apostles. Clement goes further to say it was Cephas of the Seventy who was condemned by Paul in Galatians 2 for not eating with the Gentiles.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	It is Aramaic which means "the rock"    Simon Barjona (or Simon son of John) was renamed Simon the Rock (or Simon Peter)... the rock on which Jesus' church would be founded.|`|0A7xLrz2aa	Cephas or Kepha means rock.  Probably Aramaic.|`|9cd8c6b665801fa3741c5e0688ea8edaaa	Peter   [A Piece of Rock].    This apostle of Jesus Christ is named in five different ways in the Scriptures: by the Hebrew Symeon, the Greek Simon (from a Heb. root meaning hear; listen), Peter (a Gr. name he alone bears in the Scriptures), its Semitic equivalent Cephas (perhaps related to the Heb. kephim [rocks] used at Job 30:6; Jer 4:29), and the combination Simon Peter.Ac 15:14; Mt 10:2; 16:16; Joh 1:42.    Peter was one of the earliest of Jesus disciples, being led to Jesus by Andrew, a disciple of John the Baptizer. (Joh 1:35-42) At this time Jesus gave him the name Cephas (Peter) (Joh 1:42; Mr 3:16), and the name was likely prophetic. Jesus, who was able to discern that Nathanael was a man in whom there is no deceit, could also discern Peters makeup. Peter, indeed, displayed rocklike qualities, especially after Jesus death and resurrection, becoming a strengthening influence on his fellow Christians.Joh 1:47,?48; 2:25; Lu 22:32.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	It means rock. It doesn't mean a little pebble. or a bit of rock. It means rock. Like El Capitan in Yosemite is rock! Pax Christi|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	It means stone, or rock.   The root word "keph" ( pronounced key-f ) is Aramaic.     See John 4:12|`|Xt4n9h40aa	Cephas is Aramaic for Rock.    Cephas in Greek is Petros which in English is Peter, which means Stone.
CmJwqeJ5aa	DO IT! Let me tell you a little story... when i was 16 i had a crush on a seinor we shop together which was also our home room(vocational school) talked on our school email....well our school sent carnations on vday to people..you could buy one and write a card and send it to someone and they would get it in homeroom... I sent one.. and wrote from your secret admirerer but since I was helping hand them out i didnt get to see his face when he got it.. I got a email later saying "did you send me the carnation?" and i said"maybe:)" and he wrote another one back saying"well if it was you thank you it was very sweet!" lol.. i ran into him 4 years I graduated and he proceeded to tell a mutual aquaintence about the carnation and how it was the sweetest thing anyones ever done for him.... lol.. i blushed soo much..but the point of this LONG story is... maybe..just maybe it will make his day!  If it was me i'd buy a funny one....somethign cute and flirty yet funny|`|8qfo3FvYaa	You should definatly get him a card.  If you want you could make it anonamis but them he may think it's from someone else  but you never know what he thinks unless you ask  good luck|`|NUvu9vMDaa	im not the one to ask, if you think it will improve your chances then go for it! youll never know till you try!|`|MGEYaehVaa	Definitely make him one yourself.

1f2movZZaa	I've had to be creative with gifts for quite some time, since I'm in college, and therefore have little if any money to spare. Here are some of the things you could do which cost you nothing or very little (I tend to do a few of these to "pamper" my friends and loved ones as much as I can). Most of these ideas are for girls, but some work for guys as well.    -Photo album or scrapbook full of old photos and memories. Especially of the two of you together. You can put in photographs, little notes to each other, or other sweet little sentimental items.    -Bath salts (these are pretty popular - everyone loves to be able to soak and relax in the tub), bubble bath, fancy soaps, body wash. You can also make bath salts very easily. For every half-pound of epsom salt (pretty cheap), mix a couple tablespoons of baking soda (for the fizziness), and a couple of drops of essential oil (make sure its essential oil rather than fragrance, because the second one can cause allergic reactions). Some of the popular oils are rose or lavender. You could also add the appropriate dried herbs in with the bath salt (lavender for the lavender bath salt, or rose petals for the rose bath salt), but make sure to put them in a little pouch to keep the petals from clogging up the drain. To do this, just take a small square of fabric, something that water can pass through, usually a transparent fabric works best for effect. Place about a fourth of a cup (or a little less) of the salt into the center, and tie it with a fabric ribbon. You could even make a few of these, and all she has to do is toss the bath "tea bag" into the tub. The salt will dissolve and the herbs will fill the air with heavenly aromas.    -Baked goods, and chocolate. You can't go wrong. Depending on your cooking abilities, you can make anything from chocolate chip cookies wrapped up nicely, to my favorite, anise biscotti. You can find a multitude of recipes on www.allrecipes.com, sorted by rating. Biscotti isn't actually very hard to bake at all, so if you're feeling courageous, its a huge hit. Use vanilla and anise extract for flavoring, throw some crushed almonds into the batter, and when its all cooked up, dip the bottom in chocolate and let it solidify. Brownies or Blondies are also great.    -If you're going to be at home, set up an at-home date. Decide what kind of dinner sounds delicious, and buy all of the ingredients for it. Don't forget dessert, too, and maybe even an appetizer. Buy some nice candles, and wine or champagne, and have a genuine candle-lit dinner.    -If you're thinking of a more laid-back, casual sort of way to spend the evening, you can always watch a movie. Make some popcorn at home, and snuggle up in a blanket.    -If she has a favorite author or loves reading, get her a book she'd like. A great compliment to this gift is to make a bookmark. Spend a few bucks at the local craft store on a couple different sheets of scrap-booking paper (It's about .50 to .99 per sheet where I go), some nice beads, and have some string or ribbon on hand. Figure out which paper you'd like as the background, and cut from it about the size you'd like your bookmark to be. Next, from another type of paper, cut a strip that is the same height, but slightly narrower, so that a fourth of an inch or so will show of the paper behind it. Glue it on top. Punch a hole in the top, tie the ribbon or string there, and decorate the end(s) with the beads. The more important part is that, on the back of the bookmark, write a little note to her about how much you love her.    -If she likes music, and if you have any blank CDs lying around, burning a CD is always an easy thing to add to the gift you give her. Pick out her favorite songs, or songs that remind you of her. Either use a CD label for the front of the CD, or using a sharpie, give it a title and write her a little note.    -Love Coupons. On some of that nice paper, cut out small strips of it. Write a little favor on each of them. Some ideas are: breakfast in bed, a night out, a kiss, etc. Anything you can think of. Make a nice stack of them and tie them with a ribbon.    -Write her a love letter. Or a poem, if you're up to it. Pour your heart into it, write it on nice paper (but make sure to hand write it - don't type it). I guarantee it'll be the gift that she'll never forget. Words are very powerful, and shouldn't be underestimated.    -Flowers. Everyone gets flowers for Valentine's, but the thing to remember is that you can do this many different ways. You can get cut flowers; roses are the norm, but try to think outside the box. Stargazer lilies, for instance, will sweep her off her feet. Also, try a living plant. You could get her something fancy like an orchid, or something a little more simple, like potted forget-me-nots. If she's big on culinary stuff, try some chives or basil.    -February, around where I live, is the coldest part of the year. It's a perfect time for hot chocolate, mochas, coffee, and hot tea.|`|RlxzbfAGaa	I dig the idea.  I too need help with this.  ._.    I'm planning on baking cupcakes for my boyfriend, and instead of getting Valentine's Day themed cupcake wrappers, I'm taking plain ones and writing personal messages on them with a food coloring pen.  I am also using my artistic talent to draw a really detailed picture of the two of us.  But then I also need to get him an actual present, or want to anyway.|`|FhqXSckZaa	Sex|`|HLmZxVdeaa	WELL GET HER A NICKLE OR PERFUME GO OUT WITH YOUR  FRIENDS OR BOYFRIEND IF YOU HAVE ONE AND JUST HAVE FUN
J02pqH84aa	Cuando era una nina, mi madre tenia problemas de abuso de drogas illegales asi yo vivia con mi padre y cuando el se murio tenia que vivir con mi madre. Despues de su muerte, ella empezo a usar drogas mas, no tenia trabajo, si no estaba usando drogas estaba durmiendo. Asi, yo sea una nina independiente, yo caminaba a la escuela, caminaba a la lavanderia, yo cocinaba comia para mi, y mas. Despues de dos anos, cuando tenia doce anos, sus hermanos y hermanas se dieron cuenta de que necesitaba ayuda y me ayuderon. Nosotros mudamos a la casa de mi abuela. Alla, ella seguia durmiendo todo el tiempo para un mes, hasta mi abuela le forzo encontrar trabajo. En fin, ella encontro trabajo en un supermercado y ahorro bastante dinero para comprar nuestro propio casa otra vez. Ahora ella tiene trabajo bueno y por la mayoria del tiempo, no use drogas, pero ella se depende de mi para hacerle muchas cosas. Ella quiere que yo le maneje a muchas lugares, y todavia cocino a menudo, tambien yo limpio para ella y mas. Tambien, cuando ella se pone enojada, ella me pega o me tira algo y cuando esta muy enojada ella se va a mi cuarto y se quita todo de mi guardaropa. Yo trato de estar orgullosa de ella y toda que ha hecho, pero tengo mucho resentimiento.
1NtwIeLyaa	Only God can change  your mind, sweetie, and if you have hardened your heart to Him, He won't.  I'm so sorry for your fear and can feel compassion for you, but must say that in Yeshua (Jesus), there is no fear because He gives eternal life.    Be blessed,    Harmony|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	It's true, religion is for people that can't grasp that at the end of their lie, they die. People are scared.    No god, no false hopes    Edit: And yes people did just come up with Christianity, because there i no evidence outside of the bible.|`|q5rTjkjgaa	if someone in y/a changes your view point on god then you are a sad soul not trying to be mean but that is one most likely not going to happen|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	Think for yourself for once.|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	don't change your mind, become a atheist|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	You're on the right track my friend.    There is no evidence of a higher power or afterlife.|`|6t76bgS3aa	somebody didn't just "come up" with christianity.  there is manuscript, archaelogical, prophetic and statistical probability evidence to back it up.  go to a christian bookstore and buy some books on apologetics or talk to your pastor if you really want an answer.  you'll probably get a bunch of answers from atheists that will say it is a myth, that's what the government-run school system teaches nowadays, but this ignores history.    edit: the idea that there is no evidence outside the bible is simply absurd.  there are all kinds of archaelogists and people like that who do research on this stuff.  again, go to a christian bookstore and get a book on apologetics.  Josh McDowell is good.|`|TY8Td3Bmaa	Welcome to the land of the myth free...|`|rytl3lYiaa	i used to be like you, i then relised that even if i myself didnt have a belief in god it didnt make me any less of a person i just relised that it was my understanding of life. just live a good life and help people whenever you can, thats what i do and even if there is a afterlife or not il still knw i spent my life making it count|`|EM0kiImHaa	Here is a few links that may convince you.    http://www.gotquestions.org/questions_Go...    http://www.gotquestions.org/Does-God-exi...    http://www.gotquestions.org/is-God-real....|`|QOG1iTOuaa	Atheists are more scared of death so they hate Christians who seem so cozy with it.    And atheists aren't cozy with death yet b/c they have't forgiven the wrongs that've been done to them and haven't been able to see the wrongs they have committed.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	First Cause: every effect has a prior cause, this leads to an infinite regression which is logically impossible. This requires a First Cause that is itself un-caused. That means either an infinite being (God) or an infinite universe.  The Big Bang Theory shows the universe began from a single point, it isn't static.    Modal Argument: An all powerful being is either impossible or possible. If it's any bit possible, it exists because it is all powerful.      I should also point out that you're "to feel better" theory doesn't fully work. Ancient cultures had gods to explain natural phenomena, an after-life was independent of them.  I mean you could argue people made up an after-life to feel better I suppose...|`|0fYzvVk2aa	I understand where you're coming from.  From a surface viewpoint it does seem like it would be highly improbable to have an afterlife, BUT the reality is that it is even MORE unlikely that life was a complete accident and that all matter suddenly sprang into being from nothing. (Scientist claim a small peice of dust or matter triggered the Big Bang, but they cannot answer as to where that first peice of matter came from).  When you look closer and don't ignore the unanswered questions of science, you'll can see that it's actually far MORE likely that we were created, by a creator.  So then going back to your question about death, since it's more likely that God DOES exist it is more likely that there is an afterlife.     As far as Christianity being a myth, there are endless sources of non-religious evidence for Christ living and being crucified. Try searching terms like "historical Jesus" or "Christianity evidence" if you want to learn about the facts and evidence that are accepted by even non-beleivers.      Don't apologize for asking your question, you want to beleive and you have some good questions that need answering.  There is no sin in seeking answers to your questions! That is the only way to conquer doubt and become secure in your faith.  Just make sure to not only seek answers from non-beleivers, the Christian answers to even the toughest theology questions are out there, you just have to look in the right places.   Seek on!  =)        Feel free to email or IM me if you have any more questions or want to talk :)|`|2MfMyh4Maa	You say you believe that "someone came up with the whole myth to feel better..."    A belief is an assumption of truth that is an assumption because it cannot be proven.  And we make these assumption because we want to achieve some sort of goal.  A belief is always associated with achieving a goal.  For example, I believe in God in order to seek God.    Why then did you assume that someone invented God?  I think the underlying reason is that you want God out of your life.  God is like your parents in that He is watching and judging and we all hate that.      Sit down in a quiet place and sort out how much of your belief is due to your desire to be free of God.  You're here on this forum trying to get self assurance that rejecting God is okay.  By not proving His existence, God has given you the option of rejecting Him.

That's the ONLY way a person is sent to hell. Nothing else does it.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|De0p3aP9aa	going to hell all depends on the big guy.  if you lived a good life and a good person.  first you have to accept that jesus died for our sins.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	According to Catholics, just get born.

Every person on this earth is born a sinner. Everyone has told a lie, or cheated on a test, or did something they knew they shouldn't have done. So if sinners go to hell, and everyone on this earth is a sinner, does that mean everyone is doomed to hell? Nope, not at all. The good news is that Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God, came to this earth and lived a perfect life, never sinned, then was beaten and nailed to a cross to take our sin away from us. He took the weight of everyone's sin just because he loved us. Since he died on the cross for us, our sins are forgiven, which means we will go to Heaven if we believe. The only thing you have to do is accept all this as truth, ask for forgiveness, and invite the Holy Spirit into your life.

You can pick it up in Wal-Mart. Read it! Also, consider asking Jesus as your Savior, we never know what can happen in this crazy world.

Read with discernment:    Rom 7:14   The law is good, then. The trouble is not with the law but with me, because I am sold into slavery, with sin as my master.    Rom 7:15   I don't understand myself at all, for I really want to do what is right, but I don't do it. Instead, I do the very thing I hate.    Rom 7:16   I know perfectly well that what I am doing is wrong, and my bad conscience shows that I agree that the law is good.    Rom 7:17   But I can't help myself, because it is sin inside me that makes me do these evil things.    Rom 7:18   I know I am rotten through and through so far as my old sinful nature is concerned. No matter which way I turn, I can't make myself do right. I want to, but I can't.    Rom 7:19   When I want to do good, I don't. And when I try not to do wrong, I do it anyway.    Rom 7:20   But if I am doing what I don't want to do, I am not really the one doing it; the sin within me is doing it.    Rom 7:21   It seems to be a fact of life that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong.    Rom 7:22   I love God's law with all my heart.    Rom 7:23   But there is another law at work within me that is at war with my mind. This law wins the fight and makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me.    Rom 7:24   Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin?[fn3]    Rom 7:25   Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God's law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin.|`|AA11002471	Backsliding is unwanted.  Backsliding is to be expected.  Backsliding is not the most important thing.  The most important thing is:  Do you get up and try again.  Not giving up is the most important thing.|`|Xt4n9h40aa	If I tell you, "Don't push that big red button" what are you going to want to do?  Touch the button of course.  You'll think about that button until you get to touch it.  The same applies to sin.  When you give your life to God you are a new creature in Christ.  You are forgiven of your sins.  When you keep focusing on the sin that used to hold you in bondage you are doing just like with the button.  Give it over to God.  Let Him fight the battle for you.  Read His word daily and talk to Him daily.  Put all your trust in Him and He will not fail you.  It won't happen over night, but He will fix you.|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	You are still holding out,  and are not fully committed yet. As to whether you are Christian or not if you sincerely prayed to God asking forgiveness you are Christian. You are a baby Christian and you need to be in church, reading your Bible,  praying, memorizing scripture to hide in your heart, so in those moments of weakness you can call on God to give you strength to resist the temptation you face and His word will carry you through. Your afraid to take that last leap of faith, but trust me Jesus will be there to catch you and you will never regret it. God Bless|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, In john Ch 15 there is a story about a shepherd loosing one of his sheep. Being a good shepherd he searches until he finds it. Jesus is the good shepherd. If you belong to Him He will search for you until He finds you like the shepherd searched because the sheep was his. Read the Bible more will help but remember Satan is out to make you fall like he did to Job. The closer you are to the Lord the more he will attack but the Lord is stronger. Get in circuit with other Christians. nev r|`|vvgodUChaa	you need to go into the word of god and study on the new covenant that christ ussered in at his death,once you are born again of the spirit  you can't fall away,or as you call it back slide,remember where chirst said they went out among but were never a part of us, hope this helps!

ErN3pbTeaa	Hmm, this is hard because I was so young and I don't remember the very first time I thought I liked a boy. But I do know that my first boy crush was in Pre-Kindergarten day care. I had romantic (wasn't sexual) dreams about this boy, and I would get flustered every time I was near him. I had a major thing for boy's shoes. That's how it started. A nice pair of Nikes on a boy and I would be like "wow". The boy from "Free Willy" triggered that I think.    Free Willy came out in 1993. That would've made me either 4 or 5 years old. So that's when I kind of knew I liked boys. I didn't know the term gay until much later, so I hadn't labeled myself gay yet.   I told my mom "I might have been gay" when I was around 8-10, but I took it back. I "for real" came out to her when I was 18, and then I had sex with a guy for the first time. So no it didn't take a sexual experience for me to know...I just always knew.|`|PEvWgIkVaa	when i started imaging me kissing and having sexual relationships with other girls, and when i accidently kissed my friend(whos a girl) at school|`|pd2GnHnIaa	when i accidentally kissed a guy at school >.|`|TjgBuLHFaa	Well,  I knew my whole life that I was lesbian.

So that was pretty much when I realized it. its kinda funny becasue I still like that same girl. Also I noticed it because my whole life I was always attracted to women.

It appears that your reply was offending to this "Christian girl"... you could have let it end there....but "NO".... you had to keep it going by adding "fuel to the fire."    I don't know you, but before you start pointing your finger at others, you need to take a good long look at yourself because your response of criticism is no better than hers.

Blind faith in evolution is no evidence that it is true, and neither is just repeating it over and over. Fact is, the theory of evolution is just that, a theory. It hasn't been raised to the status of law except in politically correct circles behind closed doors. All anyone can say is that change happens over time, but nobody can show the mechanism or incontrovertable evidence for their dear darwinism, and nobody can explain how anything at all exists without a necessary being such as God.

Yoga is one of the rituals that comes from Hinduism. The relaxation techniques help to let the inner man come to peace, drawing strength from "self". Used as an exercise program, even by many church organizations, yoga remains to promote self-realization and provides the first steps into Hinduism and Eastern Mysticism.     Think "idolatry."|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	There's a physical and a spiritual side to yoga. The physical side is good for anyone. The spiritual side discounts the existence of the one true God and favors a god of nature and the universe. So you can see why Christian's would be concerned, fundamentalist or otherwise.

AA11232725	Matthew 4:19  Then He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."    He would raise up disciples to evangelize.    13: 24-43 Parables of the Kingdom declaring the advance of the Kingdom and the separation between the righteous and the unrighteous at the time of judgment.    Mark 8:31  And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.  32  He spoke this word openly. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.  33  But when He had turned around and looked at His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."    Foretold His death on the cross and how the world would not understand and Satan would blind unbelievers.

We only imagine they don't because we have not accepted forgiveness for ourselves and others.

Forgiveness is free for anyone, by simply believing in Jesus alone for salvation.     All saved believers are still sinners.

wVet0QXVaa	There are always some kids at Catholic schools whose families are lapsed Catholics or non-religious.  He probably won't be traumatized for life, but there might be some expectations that you are not comfortable with.  In the Catholic schools where I grew up, all kids took classes on Catholicism until high school, when they got to choose between Catholicism and world religion classes.  It was understood that all would attend mass on Fridays at the school and they make quite a deal out of those who are confirmed through the school.  I don't think this last bit is universal, but you may want to find out if it is.      I suppose what might be a good question for you is, would it be OK with you if they taught your son to be Catholic?  That is part of the purpose of the school and at times it will be obvious.  If it is OK, then you should be fine, if not, maybe consider a different school.    Plenty of the parents in my community never darkened the door at mass, but didn't mind their children practicing Catholicism in school.    Hope this helps.|`|AA11796124	>    That all depends on the school itself. Some Catholic schools will admit only Catholics for students. Others will admit non-Catholics in addition to Catholics.    Either way, part of going to a Catholic school is being taught Catholic beliefs.      >    This school WILL teach your son Catholic Doctrine. However, the school cannot make him believe it. Therefore, the idea that the school is going to "force" anything upon your son is ridiculous.    Let's face some facts though. Since the family is not actively religious, your son will soon know more about religion than the rest of the family. This will most likely cause him to question the religious motives of the family, and he'll probably wonder why the family doesn't attend weekly Church services, especially since you admit belief in God.    If you don't want to "deal" with this, remember - you DON'T have to send him to a Catholic school.|`|AA10281451	Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.    Prov 22:6|`|zGlgehmzaa	yes, I had classmates that were not a Catholic family but were there  for an excellent education.|`|rn7UAtYJaa	Of course not. I go to a Catholic High School and there are atheists, Muslims, Jewish, everyone. It won't cause confusion.|`|0U2FVqRjaa	No!  Thats a big mistake parents often do.  You have to let your children think by themselves, not by a pedophile guy dressed as god messenger|`|QL0FOQMmaa	I have to ask, and please don't take this to be a smart aleck question or anything as I am asking sincerely. Would you send your child to an Islamic school if that was the only private school in your community?|`|NNarvtKjaa	Should be fine. It might be smoother if you don't point out he's not Catholic. Few white lies won't hurt.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Catholicism hopes to be an oasis to the world from which all may drink.  We hope to provide the best schools we can.  One does not have to be Catholic to go.    Any decent school that follows the Church's teaching will make the necessary accommodations for you religious beliefs or lack there of.     Sending him to a catholic school may entice him to pick a religion, but he will do this anyway in college.  In the long run, it will not be a problem.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	I would say it's fine to send your son to a Catholic School. It won't confuse him.    My family were non-practicing C of E, but they sent me to a Catholic School because they thought I would get a good education.    I did not find the religious aspects confusing at all.  I also sent my son to a Catholic School for a good education, even though I am now not religious.       I have never found that Catholic Schools try to enforce their religion on non-catholics in the school.|`|3BXOtPkOaa	it was your choice to be nonbeliever , let him go to that school, and when he will have the right age, he will decide in what to believe. At least he will learn something about that religion and he will have his own opinion.|`|AA11923447	I grew up attending Catholic schools. Plenty of my classmates were non-Catholics. There were atheists, Baptists, all kinds of people. I remember having a Mormon classmate. So I doubt that it would really be an issue. However, if your child eventually decided to choose Catholicism as his faith, it might be confusing to him if you strongly opposed his decision. Remember, it's ultimately his choice. Some of my non-Catholic classmates converted to Catholicism; some didn't.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	My atheist brother-in-law was valedictorian of his Catholic highschool in the 1960s. He said it was fun hearing the priest scold the graduating class. (Pat used religious hour as study hall and kept ahead.)    Non-Catholics are excused from Catholic classses and yes non-Catholics are accepted.|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	Don't. They will force religion on him and he will probably get scared.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	No, rather it will help his relationship with God. I challenge you to become closer to God, for it isn't bad, yet you will find that your life will become much more joyful, as I have.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	No it is perfectly alright as long as there is respect for the religion classes and there is no behind-the-back derogatory remarks to confuse him|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	OK.    Went to Catholic school from 1st Grade to 12th Grade.    Had Mormon and Episcopalian classmates in elementary school. Lots of Muslims were in school with me in High School. (It was a boarding school and when Iran had their revolution and went down the tubes, the one Iranian student we had told his friends it was a safe way to get to the USA so suddenly we had about a dozen Muslims students).    Your son will be welcome.      The only reason you "need to be concerned about the science they teach" is that he will have to study hard to pass. "Science Chick" should use her skills to Google "Vatican Observatory"     Oh wait, I can do it for her...    http://vaticanobservatory.org/    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Obs...    Bottom line...the answers you are getting here are falling into two groups...those people who went to Catholic School and are telling you it is fine, and mornos who don't know what they are talking about.    Ignore the morons and send your son to Catholic School.|`|3oCdTWYZaa	Is it priest-free?  Just kidding, just kidding! )))    But no, no Catholic school for a freethinking young man! :)|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	I'm sure it'll be fine, a lot of people from different religions or no religion send their kids to Catholic School, just because it's better than the local public school.|`|PsWzUuTtaa	Yes that's not a problem. you'd be surprised to see the demographics of catholic schools in terms of believers and nonbelievers lol|`|G6ein0naaa	Sure you can. Just know that there are usually religion classes at Catholic schools. As long as you don't have a problem with him taking those classes, then there's no reason not to send him there. I think Catholic schools nowadays are mainly used for disciplinary purposes rather than religious ones.|`|AA11008046	I do not think going to the catholic school is a problem.  I think one of his parents has to be catholic though.  I haven't studied this aspect of their system for a while so that might be outdated.  If you do not believe in the Catholic faith you may not want your child going there because they will be taught catacisms and that stuff.|`|AA11440601	+ Is it alright to send my son to a Catholic school if our family is not religious?  Yes.    + Is it going to create confusion if he is introduced to religion in school?  That depends on you and your son.    Becoming involved in a Catholic community will have some (hopefully positive) effects on your son and your family.    With love in Christ.

Orders received after that time may be delivered the following day."    I don't know which time zone they are referring to, though!  You might want to ask customer service first.    If you're still on the fence, pick up any bridal magazine.  There's always ads for florists.    A creative suggestion: There is franchise called Edible Arrangements, where they send chocolate-covered fruit instead of flowers! :) They're tasty, but the downside is that I think you have to order ahead of time and it can be on the expensive side.  Here is their website with all the locations: http://www.ediblearrangements.com/locati...
q5lreoiWaa	bad analogy|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	God has taught me how to live my life, and has provided for me whenever I have asked for help. I don't think He is a bad Father, but a perfect One.    Learn some English.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Yes.  Ignorant fundies are young souls who have not matured spiritually.    I believe atheists are old souls because it takes a level of maturity to go through life without the crutch of a god.|`|N8wutNoLaa	God is NOT a bad father.    God is a good father. We have been bad children.  Until you TRUELY see that, then he cannot make you good.|`|6jAVElX7aa	you are so way off track. When you ask Christ Jesus and His Words find room in your heart, He sends the Holy Spirit which will convict you of sin. The holy spirit will also guide you to keep you from sinning, yet if you sin and the Holy spirit within puts to death those sins, you will live.  Yes of course we will all die,but since Christ conquered death, He will also lead us through the valley of death, as He is our Lord and Saviour. It is prayer for someone who wants his heart to be cleansed and the Holy Spirit come and live within their hearts.

AxQmd4flaa	You teacher should not be grading you upon your ability to offend him or not - he shold grade you only upon your skills in writing.     Besides, just because he converted doesnt mean he actually beleives the BS. My friend had to convert and go to classes and even get in touch with his exwife and ask her to annul their marriage just so that he could marry his new wife. And, he is actually an agnotic and doesnt really believe the crap at church.|`|9BeUbORtaa	In his great Satire on Religion, the 17th century Anglican divine John Donne wrote that he could not bring himself to be scornful on such an important subject:     "Kinde pitty chokes my spleene; brave scorn forbids    Those tears to issue which swell my eye-lids;    I must not laugh, nor weepe sinnes, and be wise,    Can railing then cure these worne maladies?"      Satire on religion, I think, should be written in this spirit - passionately concerned, but full of "kinde pitty": Horatian, rather than Swiftian satire.

My advice would be to find out why you have such a tough time accepting it, and work from there.|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	Too bad for you.

oY4vwdjVaa	I heard typing in caps turns you super gay. You should try not doing that.|`|x7uRjwseaa	May be if you stop watching porn online, you'd feel better about yourself and might accept your sexuality?|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Look, chill, already.     Seeing gay pics doesn't make you gay any more than having a car in the garage makes you a good driver. Often it can be arousing because you see guys well-built in all areas, and wish you could be like that. However, the number of males who are hung like a horse, is fewer than 3%. Therefore, MOST are the average or thereabouts.     A bit of a reality check will enable you to see that you might be over-reacting to the idea of being gay. Btw, straight guys sometimes watch gay porn as well.|`|Vu726Q18aa	being gay is normal if you accept it you'll learn to love it|`|AfVSH3ghaa	well if you are gay u can not change it cuz that was the way you where born and it is ok to be gay   hope this helps|`|xsZfN0JHaa	The questionis.

Accept it or a lie will creep up inside you every day.|`|ocy7FEcaaa	I hope that you know that at your age the hormones are going crazy. You sound young. Pornography can be a very bad thing for young people. It can become your only sexual outlet and that is not good. I think you should look for a counslor. None of us WANT to be gay. Some of us can learn to live with it and even to except it very well,   but nobody wants to be gay.|`|YCpDZGH6aa	You are normal, just attracted to men... so? if you like it, embrace it! But if you don't want to, then just stop what your doing ( it's a dirty habit anyways) and live in denial with your wife and children until you die|`|DIj072Sqaa	Very few people who identify as gay ever wanted to be gay. It's not a choice for most people, it's just the way they were born. Looking at pornography, however, is totally a choice and if it's harming you in any way (especially if you're too young to do so) then don't do it.     Gay is normal, don't believe people who say otherwise. The fact that so many gay men and women try to deny and fight their sexuality at a young age reflects this. The pressures of conformity come from society however being 'normal' can make someone seem bland in the long term.|`|2yk2QmeOaa	being gay is not a problem.  it is normal.  okay?|`|ZbhxzgKhaa	just try stopping looking at the pics if u really wanna stop|`|7wqIJbPjaa	the more you fight it, the more you confuse yourself, the more pain you cause, the more frustrated you get, the more you just feel like dying. be who you are and accept it...i did the whole convincing myself straight thing, and it just FU*KED me up mentally. pleassse trust me, and don't go there. be happy you at least can determine your own feelings and you know who you are attracted too....|`|30ZHowVBaa	You could admit it, or fight it for the lulz.|`|02gR3jZoaa	being gay is normal, if you are than there's nothing you can really do but accept it or live a lie.|`|AA12172766	You can't help it because its what comes natural to you.

In 1973 the American Psychiatric Associations Board of Trustees removed homosexuality from its official diagnostic manual, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Second Edition (DSM II). The action was taken following a review of the scientific literature and consultation with experts in the field. The experts found that homosexuality does not meet the criteria to be considered a mental illness."

R4RsQxJEaa	There are dream sequins in the story of Joseph in the book of Genesis and in the book of Daniel. But I don't think I'd go in that direction if I were you. Interpreting dreams is for prophets. You need to talk about having faith in the direction God leads you. This comes from knowing who God is, the God of the Bible. A good verse for a personal calling from God is Jer. 29:11. "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD.|`|vs9WfN2Yaa	The bible contains several accounts in which dreams are described as an important source of infomation--- a form of divine communication.(Judges 7:13,14  1Kings 3:5) For example, God communicated with Abraham, Jacob,and Joseph in dreams. ( Genesis 28:10-19; 31:10-13; 37:5-11)  Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar recieved prophetic dreams from God. ( Daniel2:1, 28-45)|`|XnAq9rd5aa	Joseph (as in the Joseph and the coat of many colors) was a dream interpreter. There are many dreams that he has and interprets in these verses:  Genesis 37:5-11 and 40:1 - 41:57  I actually recommend reading from Genesis 37-41 but if you don't feel like reading all that, those are the most dream-related (including the interpretations and the interpretations being correct).  that's all I can think of at the moment as far as dream interpretation.    There is a great source about how God will speak to you with Elijah in it. God sends a fire and a storm and earthquake and in all this power, Elijah cannot find God. But then there is complete silence, and God is there.  You can find it at I Kings 19:9-18.    I'm not familiar (though I'm sure there is one) with a verse about God's personal call for everyone. I know are general call is that we are to spread Christianity to everyone. You can find an example of that teaching here: Luke 8:16-21  But I'm not sure about a *personal* calling. Though I'm sure there is a verse about it. Sorry!    Hope I helped!  --Katie|`|bYqWHuzyaa	You define your own purpose.

IKb6RYmNaa	It is a misconception based on ignorance. The most misunderstood Satanic Organization is the Joy of Satan and is attacked with the accusations of "racism" due to the founder's European Pride and exposing the Jewish Lies i.e. Christianity, etc.    Those that say that this organization is "racist" are deluded because one of the High Priests of this Ministry was African-American and another one was Hispanic .     National Socialism is racial preservation and the better interests of your country, people and nation and not "hatred".     Also, the beliefs of one member do not affect all of the members or reflect their views.

2PZnXjZ7aa	I'll give you some (not everything. way too much research!) information on why people thing it will end in 2012. Even if it IS true, then there's nothing you can do to stop it. I'm not trying to scare you or anything.    First I'll give you my Christian point of view. Several of the signs in the book of Revelation are beginning to appear, whether many realize it or not. Several prophets have predicted this date. Nostradamus is a notable one. "All the fish in the see will boil." That is paraphrased, by the way. Not only is it one of the signs, but it implies Global Warming.  Then, there's the whole "Mayan Calender" thing. I know that everyone says "Oh, it's just the end of the Mayan Calender." Yes, they had to stop somewhere, but they had a reason. The Mayans were very advanced in astronomy. In 2012, the Sun will be alligned with the center of the Milky Way.It only happens every 25,000 years. (I'm not sure... but it's around there.) Apparently, that's a pretty big. thing to happen|`|i1T8yKhpaa	i will move out and go to college|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	Nothing. Now quit worrying and enjoy life.|`|s9ilTXJKaa	sarah palin isnt gonna become president lol|`|3RkK1Mcqaa	It marks the end of the Mayan calandar and some people believe it will be the end of the world, but I don't believe it. kind of like Y2K.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night". If you believe or not, that is up to you; either way it still comes.    Things to look for to PROVE it to yourself soon:    >Fall of America as an economic power and other ways.

3BHPJweWaa	That's a really Good Question -- & will test out how many people here are willing to try to *expand* their consciousness, to some degree, to imagine & come from that perspective.     You *definitely* appear to be one of the Mutant Minds! ;)    i think, first, to lose the privacy of our thoughts would be the most *horrifying* of things to happen, for most people.  It would be far more traumatic than suddenly being transported into the middle of a crowd,  & finding oneself physically naked.      However, assuming it's happened to *everyone* at the same time -- everyone is in the same boat.    Sudden connection to everyone else in the world as aspects of ourselves *would* be overwhelming.  It would be total mental-emotional *overload* for most people.  Vastitudes would feel like they've gone insane; many would probably go catatonic, to try to escape; it would likely be difficult to impossible to discern between your *own* thoughts & everybody else's thoughts.  Talk about chaos!    How could our consciousnesses *integrate* all that?    What you are describing surely *is* what the "God"/dess Consciousness experiences!  And we *are* all aspects/ extensions of That (or *Her*) -- but *as* aspects we are not called upon to experience the simultaneous Totality -- all at once!    i *do* think -- on the human scale -- that more compassion, more understanding, more cooperation *would* eventuate from this Expanded Consciousness -- over the long course.  But the amount of flipping-out it *getting* there *could* be catastrophic.    Simply look at the problems people have with just multi personalities (the 3 Faces of Eve... Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde... the 19? 21? Faces of Sybil).  Or look at the problems that Voice Hearers have with hearing only one to a half a dozen voices -- sometimes very *tormenting* voices.  Suddenly to "hear" the voices of *millions* of murderers, rapists, war makers & feel they are *yourself*... would simply drive *most* people insanely over the edge.  The world would go *more* insane than it is now.  The suicide rate would be tremendous -- because people would *kill* themselves to *escape* it.    If it is what is actually happening upon death -- then the ones who would suicide out to escape it would then seek utter annihilation to escape it there.    i don't believe it *is* what is happening upon death.  i haven't read of any Near Death Experiences where people have reported this kind of thing... & the 3 people i've know who have died & *contacted* me from The Other Side have made no mention of this kind of thing.  The personality-ego appears to continue pretty much intact.    It would be too much - too soon.  The human ego would not be able to handle it.  i think there would have to be a slowly *evolving* process for consciousness -- growing *into* the considerably more expanded God/dess-Mind.      Multi-personalities -- trying to integrate them... "hearing voices" *could* be evolutionary (baby) steps towards the kind of expansion that you are positing.  But most people, now, consider this kind of phenomenon to be "delusional" & "insane".    After my mother died -- & i was "connected" (telepathically) to her surviving mind -- for a few moments (she was thinking about 3 times *faster* than she'd ever communicated, embodied!) she was *very* upset that another person was receiving her very *thoughts*.        This was considerably less than hearing millions of people's thoughts & millions of people hearing *yours* -- & perceiving yourself as *being* all those people, each of them extensions of Yourself!  Of course, in the latter circumstance, *everyone's* thoughts are so lost in the hub-bub -- & what would basically be the anonymity of so many thought-voices, that hardly anyone will be able to discern unique people one might know relative to *any* of the "Voices".  How would you sort it out to *understand* any of it?  You'd still have to be receiving one group of thoughts/ perspectives at a time -- to move beyond cacophonous *noise*.  Look how long it would take to receive millions of perspectives, one after another.    i think -- in largest part -- most people would just go bonkers!    & if you couldn't sort your own unique thoughts out, amidst the hub-bub -- how would you get anything *done*?  Most of the Work of the World (all those things that are pretty essential to ongoing survival for most of us) would just *collapse*!    Seems to me that when it comes to opening up to the GroupMind kind of thing --- it has to be *gradual*.  Mind-linkage between two people... then three... then four... in time a dozen... etc.  It'll *still* be very disturbing & traumatic, for most (who are rooted in the value of thought-privacy) -- but this kind of pioneering in Extending Consciousness *is* probably already taking place.|`|HBUjnOMEaa	I would then quick-scan the cosmos, contact my future selves and request info on the means of travel to a time-continuum where I could swiftly and easily escape to a parallel universe, as often as I want.    Or, I could smart bomb the evil with the combined spiritual force gained from my contact with righteous minds.     Lastly, I could hit the hyperspace button and roll the cosmic dice, to see where I randomly end up next...      But let my own imagination, or anyone else judge me, paralyze me, or pin me down??? Never! I don't even accept the fears or the imagination as my own, much less let them rule what I do!    Have you ever experienced the complete destruction of the world as you knew it? For me, it was very much like the destructiuon of the planet in 'Williams Defender', where all aliens attack at once. Every being seems to be hostile!     Any good karma you earned, saved and accumulated up to that point is what will get you through that period in your life. Help is where you find it, and when you need it.

Mnm35sjNaa	Free will is only possible with intelligent free agents . . . us.  I'll assume there's no other intelligent life-forms until we discover them.  Anyway, as living beings, we are clearly different than the inanimate objects (stars, planets, comets, rocks, dust, etc.) that make up the rest of the universe.    The inanimate universe operates on principles of physical causality (cause and effect) that locks its destiny into place.    Life, on the other hand, is animate.  Human life, in particular is intelligent.  We are able to understand, anticipate and use causality for our own purposes (sail the seas, explore the solar system, power our cities, etc.).  Our free will is not absolute, we are confined by physical laws and the options they present us.    On the stage of time and space, humanity is an interesting act with a beginning and end.  The universe was here billions of years before we came along and it will be here billions of years after we're gone.  Although we might marvel at our advances, we'll make no difference in the grand scheme of things.  The universe will continue to expand and fade away long after any trace of us has disappeared.    That's how free will coexists with destiny.|`|AA11232725	John 6:37  All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.

We have the gift of Identity by personality, free will and soul all of which is the some of the potential spirit life for our choosing. This is our destiny but few chose this and have to adjust to what ever we can make out of our choices if we are to survive. If we fail it matter not for it will be as though we had never been. God can not know anything that is not spirit so if we don't become spirit we are not know by God.    Consider the plants and animals.  The life bestowed upon plants and animals by the Life Carriers does not return to the Life Carriers upon the death of plant or animal. The departing life of such a living thing possesses neither identity nor personality; it does not individually survive death. During its existence and the time of its sojourn in the body of matter, it has undergone a change; it has undergone energy evolution and survives only as a part of the cosmic forces of the universe; it does not survive as individual life. The survival of mortal creatures is wholly predicated on the evolvement of an immortal soul within the mortal mind. Page 404-3|`|AA10020540	Simple, I was predestined to have free will.|`|j7H7QHLGaa	The two though seemingly oppositte in understanding when looked together at the same time, make sense when one is seen as causing the other. You do not know your destiny, what you have is free will. Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Geeta says "You have access only to free will and action, I have to the results (destiny)". The great Hindu saint Swami Vivekananda said "Man is the maker of his own destiny". When he said this he was referring to the deeper Eastern understanding of the Divine, being the source of the conciousness that exists in each of us. Do read two books by Eckhart Tolle, "The Power of Now" and "A New Earth". They will throw a lot of light on this question as well as on many other unanswered aspects of our lives.  Here is an excerpt from a question and answer session with Sri Sri Ravishankar  Q. I no longer understand the role of human beings. Are we given human will for a purpose to will something? When do we use God's will to do something?  ------------------------------  Sri Sri : This is a question about "what is free will & what is destiny"? Right? God's will & human will, right? Now, what is a "will"? It is a thought, right? When your thought is in alliance with what is happening-whatsoever is happening-you call it free will. When your thought is in opposition with whatever is happening, you call it destiny.Big volumes have been written on free will and destiny. Free will and destiny it is very simple. One is whatever is happening: another is your thought process When they are in alliance, you call it free will. "Oh! I have this, I willed this," The thought comes to you-free will. When your nervous system is clear, the thoughts that come are intuitive thoughts. Intuitive thoughts are those which are in alignment with whatever is happening. So you call that free will. Whether you have absolute free will or absolute destiny it is the same.
AA11232725	Perhaps he is a very immature Christian or perhaps he is a Christian in name only. He certainly sounds bitter and not like a defender of the faith. Could be a "tare" that Jesus warned would get into the church when the servants in charge of the field are asleep.    Matthew 13:24  Another parable He put forth to them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;  25  but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way.  26  But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared.      27  So the servants of the owner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?'  28  He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants said to him, 'Do you want us then to go and gather them up?'  29  But he said, 'No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them.  30  Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn." ' "      Matthew 13:36  Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."  37  He answered and said to them: "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.  38  The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one.  39  The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.      40  Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.  41  The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness,  42  and will cast them into the furnace of fire.

AA12270622	It was not "forty days and forty nights".  According to Genesis, that's just how long it rained, not how long the flood lasted.  Let's take a look at the text, though, to see how long it says the flood actually lasted.    Genesis 7: 11-12...    "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of the second monthon that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights."    Genesis 8: 14-16...    "By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.  By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.      Then God said to Noah, 'Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives'."    * * *    So, the flood started on "the seventeenth day of the second month" of Noah's six hundredth year, and Noah was commanded to leave the ark on "the twenty-seventh day of the second month" of his six hundred and first year.     That means according to the book of Genesis, Noah and his family were on the ark for exactly one year and ten days.|`|E9chZY74aa	Just a little over a year.

Genesis 7:11  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.     Genesis 8:13  And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.   :14  And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.   :15  And God spake unto Noah, saying,   :16  Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.

87e7b956696278de07838481b900732caa	Here's an article that may help explain it:    http://www.patoche.org/alone/aujourdhui/...
SaQ5d420aa	First decide whose opinions are worth your trouble to consider as a valid appraisal of who you are.  Is there anyone outside of yourself who qualifies to tell you how to live your life?  If you say yes, then you have given yourself over to "The Others." A very dangerous way to live ones life.  Are you really sure people are calling you gay? All people?  or just the kind who have nothing better to do with their lives than throw disparaging remarks. Though, if someone called me gay that would not be disparaging, since I am gay. People may say it in a voice that is intended to hurt me. But, again,  those kinds of people don't get my attention nor get the satisfaction of a response.  Second, if you are unsure of what it is that gets peoples' attention, ask someone you trust to be honest with you.  Maybe there is something about you that needs to be changed to live a life in a way that will bring you the quality friends you want around you.  You just might be out of step with the locals who buy brand names and you don't; dress in colors that are not flattering to you; walk without confidence. Characteristics that are unimportant to defining who your are but people read too much into them.  Also, there could be a quality you do have -- like being very smart -- and some folks are trying to 'bring you down.'  If nothing above leads you to want to change yourself, then don't.  It's your life and you are not responsible for what other people think.  Get out there and enjoy yourself with people who really matter to you.  Good luck.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Just ignore them, that's all you can do because people will do whatever they can to maintain their image of a person.|`|Vu726Q18aa	stop cheeking out guys are staring at them lol.

If you try to act "less gay" you are just affirming you aren't secure and that you really are (in the eyes of your peers). Just be comnfortable with yourself. Also yo ucan go get a girlfirend if you really are that paranoid|`|VnrdIXnGaa	It could be the way you act in general, your voice and choice of language. You may seem more feminine or just the way you dress. So maybe you can dress more like a guy unless your happy just the way you are. You shouldn't care what other ppl think of you, their opinions shouldn'tnt matter.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Here's a bit of a shocker: what others think of your is NONE of your business, and vice versa.     The more you worry about it, the more likely they are to 'accuse' you of being gay. See, it's also that horrible law: Like attracts like. Meaning, when you think negative stuff, that's what you create in your life.    I am also reminded of a story one guy said that stopped the worst offender in his tracks: when he went on and on about being gay, the gay dude looked in straight in the eye, and said in a loud voice: 'Do you want me to suck you?' and the tormenting guy said quietly, 'not today, thanks.'|`|fm2ba4ubaa	make out w/ a girl.|`|WLApi1Uraa	who cares what other people think of you.|`|02gR3jZoaa	Just ignore them, I had a lot of kids tell me I was a lesbian.... it turned out to be true, but as I'm still in the closet I would just laugh
mKeGGDqDaa	LOL. Im in the same boat. But heres what Im doing. A love letter! Those are always very personal and its something you can keep and look back on whenever you need a little reminder of how your partner feels. Also, since we're being cheap about it (jks) baking some valentines day cookies together or cupcakes seems like a good way to spend time together, and make a nice mess in the kitchen. A romantic movie or two couldn't hurt either. But make it one that has something to offer both of you. I suggest Pearl Harbour cause its got action for him, and gushy romance for you both. And last, but not least, make him work fr his gifts. Make it fun. Tease him a little and build some suspence. That alone has got to kill at least 10 minutes or so haha. Good luck! Hope you have a super awsome Vday!

Abandon all ideas of dinner in a crowded restaurant where couples will be jostling for space. Plan a special time for two either on a patio over looking a garden or on a boat sailing down a moonlit river or sea. Choose to pack a picnic basket with foods that triggers off memories. For example perhaps the two of you had enjoyed chocolate donuts one day, or a pizza with toppings both love, or a cookie specially baked by you. Take along music or compose a song to sing to her. Serenade her like knights used to on bent knee.    2. If you have gathered many pictures or video clips of your time together then put together an album with specially written captions and a witty heading. You could even say this gamine grimace enchanted me, be original and let your imagination and sense of humor take wing.    3. If you are going to be away on Valentines Day meet online for a special chat. Make it a cyber datethe World Wide Web will close up the distances.    4. Avoid the run of the mill activities and plan to go to an amusement park or fair. Have a rollicking time on the roller coaster.    5. If you know of a movie she has been dying to see get it and plan an evening enjoying the film.    6. If she loves gizmos get her a digital camera or video phone.    7. Don your apron and chefs hat and cook a special meal.    8. Pamper her by gifting her a session at a spa she loves.    9. Plan a weekend get-away and take her somewhere special.    10. Pot a special plant for her. One that will grow and bloom along with your relationship.|`|rr5fcF3taa	why are you going out just do something at your place cook yoursel

Whether you believe in them or not you are impacted by them.|`|NqxYL9aKaa	The number one lesson I have learned over many years of seeking a truth was to keep an open mind, because being judgemental towards anything blocks one from learning a truth, and what I have found is truth is simply an individuals belief that what he has heard, said, done,or saw, and dose not always constitute a factual truth, so when one says there is a true God that's not factual truth that is simply an individuals belief that it's the truth, and when one swears on the bible that also dose not constitute factual truth. so one could go on forever analizing the word truth and never ever find the truth.|`|PsWzUuTtaa	I'd have to write a book to give you that answer.

6645fec6d8799737e024f54f2e868937aa	No, because worry indicates doubt.  He knew without doubt, all He knew, because He had been with the Father from the very beginning.    D1|`|CnqGu1Taaa	no,but at the rock Jesus sweated tears of blood|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	He did. His worry showed at the garden the night before his crucifixion. His worry was for the future trib to befall the people of the earth.       Matthew 26:39   And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].     The cup mentioned was the cup of wrath to befall humanity. NOT His crucifixion..|`|PkBMMvqTaa	No He didn't.  That night in the garden was no worry, as the writer below me stated. Jesus in fact allowed Himself to be taken, for He knew there was no other way. He felt the same pains that we do, but He didn't worry about it. He kept walking towards that cross.  The pressure must have been great for He would for a moment feel what it is like to have the worlds sin resting upon His shoulders, and to know He would experience the darkness that comes when the Father would turn away.|`|1cGlucXyaa	Yes, we have to remember that Jesus was 100% God and 100% man. The Bible says He wept, He was tempted, and He was tired. It's great knowing we have a God that we can relate to.    But anyway, back to your question. Yes, look up Jesus last hours. Specifically when He is in the garden of Gethsemane. When He prays to God He asks if they is any other way, remember Jesus knew what was coming up, but he relied on god and said "let Your will be done, not mine".

TLLklriUaa	Actually the ring is nothing more than a way for some teenagers to follow a fad and announce to others that they are not having sex.    I did not feel the need to announce the fact that I was not engaging in sex to total strangers.|`|yywRjouyaa	Cool..You sound as if you really thought this out and have great reasons.  Please don't get the ring though. It just makes you a targeted challenge for horny guys who like to talk in the locker room.   Being a teen you already have lots of peer pressure, don't add to that by getting a ring.   The promise is to yourself. Surely you can remember it without the ring.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	The conservative school system is lying to you.|`|Gsd4VD13aa	Then do it.    No, I didn't save myself for marriage and I'm fine with that. Being sexually compatible is just as important as being emotionally and mentally compatible.    There is no reason to turn sex into something it isn't. Its not something to be afraid of, and it shouldn't be made more of than it actually is. Yes its fun, but its not the be all and end all of all life.    Don't wear those stupid rings. There's no need to go announcing it to the world. Its a private choice.    A ring is just a ring, dear, nothing more.    I didn't go announcing it to everyone when I had sex for the first time, there's no reason for you to go around announcing that you aren't going to have sex until married.    Oh, incidentally, you can make the vow now but you'll probably break it before you get married. Its a known fact that abstinence programs don't work.    I wear my wedding ring and an engagement ring. For one thing, its an announcement to would be suitors that I'm taken so they hopefully won't make any moves on me and I won't have to hurt anybody by turning them down. For another, the engagement ring used to belong to my dead mother. Its my most prized possession. I rather like the idea of people seeing that ring because it belonged to my mom whom I loved very much and was my best friend when she was alive.    Edit: rock'n'roll nerd is right.|`|AA11232725	I've been an abstainer since I became a Christian, but I didn't become a Christian till about 7 years ago.     Reasons why?    1. Honor God with my body    1 Corinthians 6:18  Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.  19  Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?  20  For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.    2. Honor my future spouse    Imagine the scene at the wedding reception. The groom is walking by a group of male guests who don't see him and he overhears one of them talking about how he used to go out with the bride and describing what she was like in bed. Then another one chimes in and says that he used to go out with her too and and adds his own story. Or the Bride has the same thing happen to her only it's a group of women.    3. The wedding night    How much better to have something that only your spouse and you have ever shared with another person, that is, with each other.    4. All of the things you mentioned like unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, and things you didn't mention like having a broken heart when the relationship ends, lowered self-esteem because you gave yourself to someone and then they rejected you.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	I was abstinent until marriage.  I did not wear a ring... I just decided that's what I was going to do.  It's ridiculous to think you need the ring to promise to abstain... :P    Looking back, I can say that I strongly believe that it helped me in so many ways.  It let me actually finish growing up before making sexual decisions, choices that really are meant to be made by adults not teens in school.  I strongly hope that my daughter and any other child I have will choose abstinence.     I believe that sex is best in marriage.  I believe that by a relationship not having sex before marriage, the marriage is based more in love and understanding than anything else.  Most of the "sexual problems" that people have in marriage is due from not being honest with one another and not being willing to work it out.  No one I know who abstained has ever had sexual problems because they were also honest.    If someone wants to have sex before marriage though, then I strongly believe they should at the least wait until they are 19-21.  You're less likely to make a stupid mistake by that point.  No matter how mature you feel, teenaged brains are doing a LOT of growing and are not finished growing entirely, especially the area that helps them recognize and interpret facial meanings, interpersonal relationships, and control impulsive decisions.  I'm not putting teens down... this is just how the brain is.  Logically, it just makes so much sense for teens to wait until they're no longer a teen.    Add:  Oh, and btw, the best time to make a choice like this is LONG before you start getting involved with the opposite sex, so this is the perfect time for you to decide.  I chose when I was... I don't know... young. Younger than 10.  I watched my siblings make the mistakes and decided then I wasn't going to do the same things sexually they were messing up.    And... there is no way to protect yourself from diseases 100% except for abstinence.  HPV vaccination only protects from a small number of cancers and it's effectiveness is strongly questioned (if you've had it, you probably will need it again in 5 years.)  And birth control pills are not good for you.  Point blank.  If you do use safe sex practices, and I strongly suggest studying about it since you've got the time to, use condoms and methods that have very few negative side-effects.  There's far too many... myths... out there.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	People, like me, need to test drive ;)|`|7mhRDbvsaa	nothing is ever necessary|`|SqhGr6e3aa	How about you abstain until you become responsible and find someone you really like? If you do it right (use a condom, get your HPV vaccines, or get on the pill), there won't be any problems.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	Well, I made a promise to myself that I was going to abstain from sex until I knew 100% without a doubt that I was ready to have sex, and I was completely in love with someone. And that is what I did. I fell in love, I waited until the point where I knew I was ready, and I had sex. It was great, and I dont regret it at all.     I suggest that you do what you want to, but if you aren't sure, just promise yourself that you will wait until you know you are ready. But the MOST IMPORTANT thing for you to do is, even if you plan to abstain, make sure you know EVERYTHING about safe sex. Make sure you know about condoms, you know how to get on the pill, you know about the morning after pill and whether you can get it where you live. Just be informed, because you never know what might happen. Its so important that you know about safe sex     the ring means absolutely nothing, they're just a fad. You dont need to tell your parents your intentions either. Its a very personal issue and a personal decision. So you dont need to tell anyone but you.    I think its great that you have given this thought. Its good to be ready and know where you stand before you find yourself in situations as you grow up. And you're right, abstinence is very safe. Best of luck in the future!|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Rings are irrelevant.

I think though, that 13 is too young to make a decision to be celibate forever, just as it is too young to make a decision to actually have sex.  Personally I would wait to make this kind of choice until you are older.  I actually think that by making an absitence pledge you will actually be putting thought of sex into your mind more often than if you just don't worry.  I don't beleive there is anything wrong with sex outside of marriage, after all marriage is just a legal document, a piece of paper and makes no difference to how much you do (or don't) love someone.  I would urge you to wait until you emet the right person and if that is your spouse then fine. But you will know when the time is right for you.    Personally I think you are too young to make this choice yet. Wait and see how your views change as you grow older. Do not have sex until you are of legl age, and when you do make sure you use a condom.|`|KR64fnHjaa	13 is simply too young to start having sex.  And way too young to start making pledges about how long you will be abstinent.  Studies recently have shown that teens that make these types of pledges are more likely to have premarital sex!

I myself don't see the entire importance of it.   You need to spend this time making the choice of your heart. How you want to live, how you want to present yourself to your husband one day. You already know that STD's and pregnancy is a part of having sex and or multiple partners. You have answered your own question. Don't depend on others to validate what you want for yourself and your future. If you start that now, then you will ask others should I drink, should I start drugs, should I ....should I....should I.....

IF YOU love each other, is it all right? Or should you wait until youre married? Im still a virgin. Is there something wrong with me? Questions like these abound among youths.    Nevertheless, It is the exceptional young person who has not had sexual intercourse while still a teenager, concluded the Alan Guttmacher Institute in its 1981 report. Eight in 10 males and seven in 10 females report having had intercourse while in their teens.    And why not? you may ask. After all, it is only natural to want to feel loved. And when youre young, your passions can be powerful to the point of distraction. Furthermore, theres the influence of your peers. They may tell you that premarital sex is fun and that when you really like someone, its only natural to want to be intimate. Some may even say that having sex proves your manhood or womanhood. Not wanting to be viewed as odd, you may thus feel under pressure to experience sexual relations.    Contrary to popular opinion, not all youths are in a hurry to give up their virginity. Consider, for example, a?young single woman named Esther. She was getting a medical checkup when her doctor matter-of-factly inquired: What method of contraception are you using? When Esther replied, Im not using?any, her doctor exclaimed: What! Do you want to get pregnant? How do you expect not to get pregnant if youre not using anything? Esther replied: Because Im not having sex!    Her doctor stared at her in disbelief. This is unbelievable, he said. Kids come in here 13 years old, and they are no longer virgins. You are a remarkable person.    What made Esther remarkable? She obeyed the Bibles admonition: Now the body is not for fornication [including premarital sex] .?.?. Flee from fornication. (1?Corinthians 6:13,?18) Yes, she recognized premarital sex as a serious sin against God! This is what God wills, states 1?Thessalonians 4:3, that you abstain from fornication. Why, though, does the Bible forbid premarital sex?    The Aftereffects    Even in Bible times, some engaged in premarital sex. An immoral woman might invite a young man to indulge, saying: Do come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning; do let us enjoy each other with love expressions. (Proverbs 7:18) The Bible, however, warned that pleasures enjoyed today can cause pain tomorrow. For as a honeycomb the lips of a strange woman keep dripping, and her palate is smoother than oil, observed Solomon. But, he continued, the aftereffect from her is as bitter as wormwood; it is as sharp as a two-edged sword.Proverbs 5:3,?4.    One possible aftereffect is the contracting of a sexually transmitted disease. Imagine the heartache if years later one learned that a sexual experience has caused irreversible damage, perhaps infertility or a serious health problem! As Proverbs 5:11 warns: You have to groan in your future when your flesh and your organism come to an end. Premarital sex also leads to illegitimacy (see pages 184-5), abortion, and premature marriageeach with its painful consequences. Yes, one engaging in premarital sex truly sins against his or her own body.1?Corinthians 6:18.    Recognizing such dangers, Dr.?Richard Lee wrote in the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine: We boast to our young people about our great breakthroughs in preventing pregnancy and treating venereal disease disregarding the most reliable and specific, the least expensive and toxic, preventative of both gestational and venereal distressthe ancient, honorable, and even healthy state of virginity.    Guilt and Disappointment    Many youths have further found premarital sex to be bitterly disappointing. The result? Feelings of guilt and diminished self-respect. Twenty-three-year-old Dennis admitted: It was a big letdownno feeling of good or warmth of love as it was supposed to be. Rather the full realization of how wrong the act was hit me. I felt totally ashamed at my lack of self-control. Confessed a young woman: I came back to reality with a sickening thud.?.?.?.?The party was over and I felt sick, cheap, and dirty. It didnt make me feel any better to hear him say, Why on earth didnt you stop us before things went too far?    Such reactions are not rare, according to Dr.?Jay Segal. After studying the sexual activities of 2,436 college students, he concluded: Dissatisfying and disappointing first [sexual intercourse] experiences exceeded those that were fulfilling and exciting by a ratio of almost two to one. Both males and females recalled that they were greatly disappointed. Granted, even married couples may sometimes have their difficulties when it comes to sex. But in a marriage, where there is genuine love and commitment, such problems usually can be worked out.    The Price of Promiscuity    Some youths feel no guilt whatsoever about having relations, and so they go all out for sensual gratification, seeking sex with a variety of partners.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	I was a virgin at 18 when I got married.   It was the best thing I could give my husband...and he as well was a virgin.   We never had to worry about unwanted pregnancy or diseases...we were both healthy and happy.    God doesn't require a ring. He requires a good conscience and a chaste person.    The ring will be a challenge to guys who will try to break your integrity.|`|RKLv4agEaa	I don't know anything about those rings, but you can certainly make the commitment to yourself and to God.  I applaud you in your decision to stay pure until marriage.  One thing to remember when peers try to pressure you:  You can become sexually active whenever you want, but you can never be a virgin again.    There is a book you should read, it is called "I Kissed Dating Goodbye" it is written by Joshua Harris.  Another one is by Elisabeth Elliot, called "Passion and Purity."  These are very good and God centered.    Way to Go!  Thank you for standing up and doing the right thing, even though others might not think the same as you, you are doing the right thing!!!  Keep it up and stay strong!  Flee sexual immorality, the Apostle Paul tells us!  Way to Go!!!|`|6rwIm5Gnaa	I am a male and I waited for my wife. I can tell you God rewarded me in a way that I basically know God is real. Greatest gift I could have and no one needs to prove to me God exist because I know God does.    Ok, I made the decision for the same reason you did. I wanted to be close to God. But most importantly, God placed it in my heart and thats where the burning feeling came from in waiting. However, there is going to be some man or kid that will be a really hard temptation for you. Fight it, because it will be a spiritual fight with the flesh. Its going to happen. I say this because Satan did this with me to an extreme and when I overcame it God showed me he was real. But it was a 3 to 4 year battle.     I was friends with everyone and it was hard knowing how people were having fun but I didnt see their fun as rewarding. You have to know rewarding the flesh is vanity. For me, this was so hard to do because of the isolation I felt with my friends since they were so happy at what they did. The biggest mistake I made here was the fact I didnt surround myself with Godly friends. But, I had friends from all walks of life and included all the stories of partying ect..    The longer you wait the more you will respect yourself. At the same time, it can drive you mad that others are having sex like a handshake. This is where you have to let God be the judge of others. Dont get caught up in why people do things. It will tear you apart. Just accept people for who they are and pray to God about it and let it go in Gods hands.     Make sure this is a secret between you and God. Dont let others know your doing this because people will turn into wolves. You and God will have this special secret. So dont wear a promise ring. God also likes it when its between you and God and no one else. Trust me on this...God loves this because its your bond between God and God knows the war your up against. This will both be your holy place bond.    Do all this for God. Dont get caught up on shows like Maury or Jerry Springer where one person waited while the other slept around even when he or she met the virgin. This will be told to you all the time. Its people who live by the world and are more worried about themselves then a relationship with God. Do this all for God, dont do it for your future husband. I say this because then you know God will bring you to the right person. The person may have things which will make you question God later. Dont worry about it. Just simply do it for God only.     Stay busy, exercise, read or whatever. Just stay busy and find friends that like the same type of things so you wont feel outcasted. Stay Busy.    The war your up against is so huge. Movies, tv, and magazines all support worldly things. You have to know why your really doing this. You are going to get closer to God based on your sacrafice. It will be a trial. You need to be spritually strong. You will think of things that will go against you spiritually. It will be through your mind or lust in the heart. You biggest enemy will be the unknown of experience. You wont experience things others do. You have to be spritually stong through God. Pray and pray more. Just remember, it is so true, that worldy things are vanity.        Main points..    Know all is vanity, read the bible on this    Surround yourself with Godly people    Dont Judge others but let it go in Gods hands    Keep this as your secret between God and you as a holy place would be    Do everything for God only, not your future husband    Stay Busy.    your going to get closer to God based on your sacrafice.
2nSyfXyBaa	Many people argue over who the true Messiah  Is Many religion's have some form of Messiah.  Yahshua Jesus or Mohammad. But I have a   theory You want too find the Messiah? Look   In the mirror. The Messiah is in each and ever   one of us. We are gods Children and we   as a race have the power too heal doctors   have the power too cure cancer disease.   We have the power too create.Homes  love Take responsibility for our lives    Deal with our   own problems and defeat evil. Evil only   prevails when good people do nothing.   We as a race have the power too Heal the   Planet. Refuse too kill our brothers and sisters   Feed and provide for those who can not   or do not have the resources too provide   for themselves.

I think it is extremely interesting that nowhere are the miracles performed by Jesus ever challenged or denied. In fact the Talmud (a Jewish religious text) calls him a sorcerer and a doer of evil. Had Jesus not performed these miracles, don't you think the Jewish authorities would have been the first to deny them? You also have the empty tomb. Had Jesus never have risen from the dead, wouldn't the Jewish authorities have been more than happy to open the tomb and provide a body? Instead of providing His body the authorities claimed the body was stolen. Since the tomb was guarded that is hard to believe.     I find the fact that Jesus' miracles were acknowledged even by His enemies in their own texts is hard to ignore. There are many, many more things that lead me to accept Jesus as the messiah. Actually, there are too many for me to list in this short response. If you would like me to ellaborate further, just ask and I will gladly do so.|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	Jesus is the Messiah in Islam and Christianity.|`|FmazIF6Maa	I don't know what you're talking about.

The father of secularism was the narrow-minded and godless attitude of nineteenth- and twentieth-century so-called science--atheistic science. The mother of modern secularism was the totalitarian medieval Christian church. Secularism had its inception as a rising protest against the almost complete domination of Western civilization by the institutionalized Christian church.  It required a great power, a mighty influence, to free the thinking and living of the Western peoples from the withering grasp of a totalitarian ecclesiastical domination. Secularism did break the bonds of church control, and now in turn it threatens to establish a new and godless type of mastery over the hearts and minds of modern man. The tyrannical and dictatorial political state is the direct offspring of scientific materialism and philosophic secularism. Secularism no sooner frees man from the domination of the institutionalized church than it sells him into slavish bondage to the totalitarian state. Secularism frees man from ecclesiastical slavery only to betray him into the tyranny of political and economic slavery.    We have just witnessed the secular movement in action and are living with it as our Congress set its agendias . Secularism can never bring peace to mankind. Nothing can take the place of God in human society. But mark you well! do not be quick to surrender the beneficent gains of the secular revolt from ecclesiastical totalitarianism. Western civilization today enjoys many liberties and satisfactions as a result of the secular revolt. The great mistake of secularism was this: In revolting against the almost total control of life by religious authority, and after attaining the liberation from such ecclesiastical tyranny, the secularists went on to institute a revolt against God himself, sometimes tacitly and sometimes openly.|`|I11BEwi5aa	In my opinion, Scientifc revolution is the devil's work.

b6rBHPMlaa	I would imagine it's because when a baby is in its most early stages of life, you can't see it in the shape of an actual child as much as you can when it's in the later stages of the pregnancy. Rather sick, really, that you can think that form indicates life and feelings.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	I go with what she said.|`|O1QBA5XSaa	Because a fetus in the third trimester is completely capable of surviving outside the mother.    Why not just deliver early, and let someone adopt? Plenty of couples would be willing to fork up the cash for the hospital bills.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	I'd say that the fact that terminations procede in different ways depending on how far into the pregnancy they take place is significant, not least because different methods have more damaging effects on the body of the woman herself.  There is also the fact that the viability of the foetus itself improves throughout the pregnancy - it is, you are correct, tough to draw a line at what point it becomes a 'person', but that is why we constantly review the various cut-off times.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I am pretty sure that the longer you wait the greater the risk is. As far as I know doctors advocate ASAP once you have had time to consider the options.    I don't know why you would need one later, unless of course it is a medical issue. It is a tough decision but that doesn't mean you get to wait 5 months. If you were too scared to go tot the doctor until you were 6 months along, then it may be time to just suck it up. I won't take away the option, but I still put some responsibility on the women to make up their mind in a timely manner.|`|FDVCYENLaa	Spiritually speaking, why do most who describe themselves as 'pro-life' support the death penalty?|`|v7hkYRDLaa	Better question, why are so many pro life people pro war? pro guns?  As an adoptive parent, I personally wish pro lifers would shift focus and put all of their effort into the millions of orphans on the planet that need homes.     But seriously never answer a question with a question.  Many people would say the baby is fully formed and quite large by the sixth month, making abortion more upsetting for the pro life people.  The embryo might survive if born premature at this point as well.    The goal appears would be to create a compromise, the woman controls her body and decides if she is going to give birth/give life to a human. When this embryo is inside her, the embryo is without rights, if it can't live outside of her body. If it could live outside of her body than possibly it deserves the right to be born and adopted. But at the same time if a woman does not want life inside her, she should be allowed to end that life. It is her body. She is not killing human life outside of her body, but ending the embryonic life inside of HER BODY before it is born. So many people believe this decision belongs to her.|`|283tO9j9aa	See, I consider myself pro-choice but I would still put a limit on it. But I would say that limit is the end of the second trimester- partly because that's the law here in the UK and it seems to be working reasonably well, and partly because a recent debate about that law meant that I learned something. After the end of the second trimester, the chance of surviving outside the womb is okay (not great, but okay) whereas befoe that it's negligible. Mind you, if there's a medical emergency in the third trimester I'm not going to say a woman has to die so the kid can live. I'd rather save the woman than potentially lose the kid and her too.|`|AA10240238	Choice is Choice.  It should be up to the woman and her Doctor.

I'll have to remember that.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Good question. Because they are hypocrites that's why. In the UK you can have an abortion at 24 weeks gestation. And on another ward they have a 22 week old born prematurely in an incubator. Now tell me how an abortion at 24 weeks is not murder again? If someone put a pillow over the 22 week old babies face in the incubator they would be charged with murder would they not? Of course they would.  Lets see how they try to justify this one.....      http://msnbcmedia4.msn.com/j/msnbc/Compo...  22 week gestation baby born prematurely.   http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/...  http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/trul...  21 weeks and 6 days.      @Alexis 30 weeks abortion is fine?????Are you serious?????What a heartless b*tch! Could you go and put your hand over those babies faces and kill them? Because that is what is happening to babies just like them when mothers get abortions up to 24 weeks and you would want it up to 30? I take it you dont have children.....    Oh no need to explain I see you have no morals and for your info sentient perception is shown as early in some fetuses as 7 weeks.    "Early studies by Hooker showed that cutaneous sensory  perception appears around the mouth of the human fetus in the seventh week of  gestation and gradually spreads to all skin and mucous surfaces by 20 weeks."    "Opioid receptor labeling in the brain stem of fetuses 19-21 weeks gestation  demonstrated very high densities in supraspinal centers associated with sensory perception"    ""consider the treatment of comatose patients. We would not discriminate against one merely for rarely or never having been sentient in the past while another otherwise comparable patient had been sentient. ...In such cases, potential counts for everything."[3]   Why should sentience in the past be the decisive factor in deciding whether an entity is fully human when the presentient human being "is one with a natural, inherent capacity for performing personal acts?"[4]   Since we have already seen that one does not have to experience harm in order to be harmed, it seems more consistent with our moral sensibilities to assert that what makes it wrong to kill the reversibly comatose, the sleeping, the momentarily unconscious, and the presentient unborn is that they all possess the natural inherent capacity to perform personal acts."    Sorry but you can stick your "sentient" argument where the sun dont shine......|`|8ytLLHV4aa	because pro-choice people are rational.    There is a line of when something is alive, and when something is just a blood clot inside a women.  most of the scientific and medical communities agree that the first trimester is a good line, because sometimes people don't know right away that they are pregnant.    the line isn't conception.  the line isn't "NEVER GET AN ABORTION IT'S MURDER".  the only people allowed to draw that line of when it's okay and when it's not, are doctors, most suggest 1st trimester.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	a choice should never be able to be made that makes a baby die because someone does not want a child.- first trimester, 2nd or 3rd trimester.|`|AA11849917	Of course, you are actually correct on what you're suggesting (*SHOCK!*).    If someone accepts abortion as a legitimate means to deal with a problem, then if we draw that out to its logical conclusion, we would have to allow the mother to abort the child up until the day SHE (the mother) dies with no time limit.    If you move the line once, then you can't complain if someone else moves it again, and there is no end to the mess we get ourselves into with this kind of thinking.    But, in my own personal opinion, I don't think ANY one should perform an abortion on an unborn child until they've tried it on themselves first, even after the fact.  Otherwise, it would be hypocrisy to carry out an abortion if you aren't willing to abort your OWN life first!    It is hypocritical to say you believe in abortion if you've already been born!|`|12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	I believe in responsible choices. Terminating a pregnancy when the child (I won't use the word fetus--it's a child) is able to feel pain, or developed enough to survive on it's own,  is cruel and inhumane as far as I am concerned.     Am I going to protest abortion clinics? No, that would make me a pro-lifer. I am neither pro-choice nor pro-life. I am a mid-liner.    I feel that abortion should always be an option in cases of rape, incest, and serious illness involving either the child or the mother.     But after 12 weeks, abortion should be off-limits except in the most serious of the above-mentioned cases.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	It is a question of individual rights.  once a fetus is viable as a separate individual (and that age keeps falling), you are dealing with conflicts between the rights of two individuals, the mother and the child.  You extend each person's rights to the point where you have to restrict someone else's.      So it comes down to when a fetus is old enough to be considered a person with rights.  People have different opinions on this.  You can probably find someone who thinks that sperm cells have rights, if you look hard enough.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	If the Fetus is viable outside the womb then take it out and give it to adoption...if not, tough|`|V8qVsKhRaa	A lot probably don't even agree with abortion, they would probably say they are pro-choice b/c the media promotes it.   If not, then ohhh, is there conscience finally getting through to them?|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Well come on now. Now you are part of the problem too! You are continuing to limit the mothers choice to gestation. Surely if you believe that if a woman should have the choice she should have it throughout the child's life!|`|WalnRzfGaa	its a belief.    they believe that just as fro lifers beleive it should never be done.    no point in questioning it.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Health risks increase after the first trimester. Perhaps a time limit should be set for the sake of the mother's health.|`|AA11297267	Because it's not an easy issue, that's why.    *Clearly* a small undifferentiated lump of cells a few weeks along into dividing is not a human being, and as such doesn't meet the standards of protection under the law we afford to human beings.    Equally *clearly,* a fetus in its 7th month of development, and capable of living on its own outside of the womb, IS a human being and as such merits the protections given by law to human beings.    Most of what's in between those two is open to debate, and there's little social consensus (I'm not talking about religious superstition here, just social constructs) as to when a developing embryo "becomes" a human being.  So there's a bit of a tightrope to walk in having our society decide when the rights of the mother or the rights of the fetus take precedence.      At least for me, the first trimester is a reasonable compromise.  That's enough time for a woman to have known for some time that she was pregnant, enough time for her to make a thoughtful decision...but not so far into the pregnancy that there's any possibility of the embryo surviving if it were born, so it's clearly not yet a human being.  I happen to think that's a reasonable balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of what might become a human being.    Yes, it's a compromise, but it's one I think most of us can live with.  The supreme court agreed.  The only ones who can't are the rabid radicals on both sides of the debate.    Peace.|`|8f295aef87b9e8de8081a2868c2aa68faa	a fetus feels pain after a certain length of development. if youre going to abort it, do it while it has no brain nor nervous system to speak of.    i do have a problem with late-term abortions... but i dont have a uterus of my own, so its not my call|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	It is a moral compromise.... or more properly an immoral and illogical compromise.    These people don't want to see themselves as "bad", so they don't want to be against abortion (TV says only close minded Bible thumper idiots with thick Alabama accents are against abortion, and all the people that support abortion are progressive, warm hearted, educated liberals. Didn't you see Dirty Dancing?  Remember how cool the Doctor/Dad was when he helped out the girl that had the abortion? Didn't you see Cider House Rules?   They want to be understanding and not have poor innocent girls who gave into temptation "punished with a baby.").     Look how some of the people here run from the term "pro-lifer."    However, neither do they want to be for abortion, because they understand that it is the killing of an innocent human being. Anyone who has been pregnant or known someone who had a baby can see that.    And they may have had an abortion, or know someone who had one, and condeming abortion would make their friend, or themselves, a bad person.    So they compromise, so they can feel better.    It's not intellectually honest, and it's not logical...(there is no difference between killing a three week old child and a 12 week old child, as you rightly point out) but then again very few people are intellectually honest or logical.     You see this with juries a lot. Half the jury thinks the defendant is guilty, the other half thinks he is innocent, so they compromise and find the guy guilty of a lesser charge that NOBODY thinks he commtied.  For example if someone is killed in cold blood, and is obvioulsy pre-meditated first degree murder, and the jury can't decide, they will find the defendant guilty of second degree murder.  This means half the jury agreed to send an innocent man to jail, but only for half of the time he might have gotten, and the other half of the jury agreed to let an obviously guilty man get off with only half the punishement he deserved...but the main thing is the jury members get to go home to their families in time for the weekend. That's their real priority.    It's stupid, but it's how a lot of people think.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Bluntly?    Hypocrisy.|`|ulwXFrrJaa	i mean, sh!t or get off the pot, you know what I'm saying?      you had plenty of time in the first trimester to make a decision.  if you were unable to make a decision in that time period, you did make a decision.  apathy is a decision and has its consequences as well.|`|RedEGIfZaa	I support elective abortion until the 26th week of gestation.    After 30 weeks, the fetus is a sentient being with rights that need to be considered.      Addendum: She said - Viability is irrelevant.  The ability to exist in an oxygen atmosphere does not give a being value.      Addendum II: She said - People have value to me.  People.  If you are aware, if you are conscious, if you can think, you're worth something in my book.    If you are a mass of tissue and fluid, you're a mass of tissue and fluid.  Physical beings hold no value to me.  Only sentient beings do.  I don't cry over a head of lettuce, and I don't cry over a 20-week fetus that has the exact same perception of the world.    When a person goes braindead, you pull the plug.  It is the *mind* that is important.  You're emotionally distraught because a fetus looks like a baby.  It isn't.  It doesn't have a mind.  It's a mass of tissue and fluid.  Until it has a mind, you can kill it.  You aren't killing a person.  You're preventing one.    All that matters is whether the fetus is sentient or not.  If it isn't, no person has been created yet.  You can kill it without moral qualm.

The Church quickly became a patriarchal organization and "airbrushed" from its history the vital contributions of its female leaders.    Junia (Romans 16.7) was probably a woman in a position of leadership, but this didn't suit the hierarchy so she became Junias.    As for Mary Mag, on her first appearance in Mark's Gospel she appears WITHOUT INTRODUCTION - like: Mary Magdalene? Aw c'mon guys, you don't need me to tell you who SHE is!    Unfortunately, we do now and it would be fascinating to know.  Was she a prostitute?  Magdala, the town of her birth, was somewhat notorious for loose living but there's no other "evidence".  Was she Jesus' lover/wife and later widow?  The jury is out.  Did she write "John's" Gospel?  (see link).  Was she the "beloved disciple"?  I have seen altarpieces in Norway that depict her as such.  All very interesting.|`|0vmQNf0oaa	What do you mean? Nobody worshiped Mary. Nobody prayed to Mary. Mary was a believer just like everyone else.

Some of the traditions of the church say that Mary the mother of Jesus was cloistered in her home, and hardly went out, although she did make the stations of the cross to commemorate His suffering, and also at one time, was assisted by angels to help a dying or dead man...just a story I read, I'm not sure what the reference was or where I read it.    Also read up on information regarding the home of the Holy Family, which was taken to Italy by mysterious means.  As well, it is said that the Blessed Virgin travelled to Spain and Portugal using the grace of bi-location.    Early church tradition says that Mary Magdalene went to France to preach the Good News, and her bones are said to have found a resting place in that country.    The other Marys I'm not sure of    But I think that the main purpose of the gospels and epistles was to let us know about Jesus.  Everyone else's role was downplayed because of their beleif that "vainglory" was not a path of humility...they were very reluctant to say anything that would give them any honour with all honour and glory belongs to God.    I think it's about humility in the end...although if you dig around, you find out stuff.  "Good things come to those who wait" and all that.

Founded on made-up stories and doctrine.  Has as "sacred scripture" two completely made-up books (book of mormon and pearl of great price).  A nasty history of polygamy, blood atonement, murders, racism.  Teachings that women are nothing without a priesthood-holder husband.  Temple rituals based on masonic rites that (until recently) included symbols of gruesome ways life can be taken if ritual takers ever reveal the temple secrets.  A history of hiding anything contrary to church teachings, firing or excommunicating members who bring up inconvenient facts in church history or doctrine, making up supposed "archeological evidence" for the book of mormon...  Lots more.    So sure, there's an upside -- but have you actually studied the church history from an unbiased perspective?

Our beliefs need to match reality. There just is no concrete evidence outside the Book of Mormon that the events took place or the people existed. Archeology, linguistics, geography all point to the events not happening.    Since the historical accuracy of the Book of Mormon is seriously flawed, I question the accuracy of the doctrines as well. Especially the ones that contradict the Bible, which has evidence that it's historically accurate.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	The problem with Mormonism is that it contradicts, modifies, and expands on the Bible. Christians have no reason to believe that the Bible is not true and adequate. To truly believe in and trust God means to believe in His Word. And all Scripture is inspired by God, which means it comes from Him (2 Timothy 3:16).    Joseph Smith was a polytheist. History of the Church 6:474 records Smith stating, "I wish to declare I have always and in all congregations when I have preached on the subject of the Deity, it has been the plurality of Gods." Joseph Smith declared that "God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 345). This is clearly not the biblical God.    Galatians 1:6-7 says that people may be "turning to a different gospelwhich is really no gospel at all . . . trying to pervert the gospel of Christ." And he pronounced a curse upon them for doing so. In Romans 1:16 Paul tells us that the gospel is "the power of God unto salvation" - that's pretty important. Did Joseph Smith teach a "different Gospel"? Yes.    this is "the plan of salvation according to the Mormons, [that] embraces all of the laws, principles, doctrines, rites, ordinances, acts, powers, authorities, and keys necessary to save and exalt men." In other words, the whole of Mormon theology. In the Mormon gospel we see belief + repentance + baptism + laying on of hands + temple work + mission work + church ministry + tithing + ceasing from sin + abstaining from the use of intoxicants and strong drinks and tobacco and caffeine + confessing Joseph Smith as Prophet + temple marriage + baptism for the dead + genealogy research . . . the list could go on and on and on. Only upon completion of all these things may Mormons attain to the third and highest level of heaven thus achieving the ultimate goal of the Mormon gospel - godhood. (see McConkie, Mormon Doctrine 116-117; Book of Mormon [3 Nephi 27:13-21]; Doctrines of Salvation 1:268; 18:213; The 4th Article of Faith; Smith, Gospel Doctrine pg. 107; Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 3:93; 3:247; 9:312; Gospel Principles 290; Doctrine and Covenants 39:5-6; 132:19-20). In essence, Christ's death means nothing more to a Mormon than the gaining of the ability to be resurrected so that their works may be judged.|`|BtygS0Hraa	Nothing!  I am a Mormon and I have never had a single doubt about the religion.  I love this Church, it's people, and especially it's center- Jesus Christ.|`|AlybkawCaa	All religions that believe in Jesus Christ have value. As a long-time Jesusonian Christian, I believe and teach that our Mormon (LDS and RLDS, now called CoC) Brothers and Sisters in Christ are fully Christian by Divine-Human Relationship to our Sovereign Creator Son of God Jesus Christ.    A great strength of LDS belief is their strong belief in continuing Revelation.  We Jesusonians and others also share this belief.    Now, I do not believe all of the "The Book of Mormon" which I have read carefully; neither do I believe in all of the Bible which I have read carefully for over 33 years to date. Being highly eclectic, (picky) I only believe and teach from the best parts of all books. My favorite verse in the BOM is: "Jesus Christ is both God the Father and God the Son." That is absolutely True; as Jesus Christ is the Eternal Creator Son of God Who made and is sustaining and improving our universe here.  As mankind perfects; our universe will also continue to perfect.If Jesus were to make all of His universe all perfect; there would be nothing for us to do; and we would become very dull and lazy now. Making nature a little rough at first is very good overall.    The LDS going door-to-door is a strength and is a main reason why the LDS are growing in numbers worldwide.    The LDS have some great pictures of Jesus and His Life Teachings and Doings. I use some of them on my Gospel enlarging website.    Peace and progress !|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	They have too many kids, and it is a closed society.    Joshsybs:  Did you give me that thumb down?  hmmmmm.....well, I will respond to you anyway.     I believe that we have a responsibility to mother earth and our finite resources which means we reproduce conservatively.  Overpopulation is one of the biggest problems modern society is facing, and Mormons do not want to think they are part of this problem or solution.    Mormons have a history and reputation for doing business with their own kind exclusively.  They own Utah, and if you are not a Mormon, you are an outsider. It is difficult to thrive in that kind of environment. This is part of their history as well.     They send out their children for two years to convert people to their religion.  It is a presumption that their religion is best for others.  That is not open...that is just a superior attitude. They are not exhibiting respect for differences in that manner.       Is that enough for you?|`|5CwL5wauaa	It's another eccentric right wing religion.|`|4acef5ace8722980d0dcb0fc7f33bdd9aa	Well, my boyfriend is Morman, as is his family and I absolutely love them all.  They are all "normal" people just like everyone else I have ever met, with the exception that they do not push their religion or beliefs on anyone.  I find that very refreshing.  My boyfriend is probably one of the most kind, generous, warm people I have ever known.  Being Morman, I don't even know what that means!!  I have been to the LDS Temple (outside)in Salt Lake and I must say it is one of the most beautiful and peaceful places I have ever had the pleasure to visit.  And the people there were also kind, warm and friendly.

Y8rB9iuHaa	Technically... weather conditions are not a legitimate reason for absence from the workplace.  This means that absence for this reason is unauthorised under contractual law.

But I think you should do an hour extra everyday to make it up, and then dont take it as a holiday|`|AA11510511	I agree with you.  They should either take it as unpaid, take it out of their holiday entitlement, or work it back.    The snow is an act of god, which is not the fault of the employers.|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	No, I think being snowed in is an act of nature and shouldn't cost you a sick or holiday, since there is nothing you could do about it.|`|xm0kLvnLaa	No, why would they?

Furthermore, the inability of many people to get to work today is caused by    1. Employers paying such low wages/salaries thus making their employees have to live tens of miles from their workplaces just to be able to afford housing. I know a lot of people in my home town (Harwich-Essex UK) who commute 57 miles to London to work)    2. Despite enormous local taxation (community charge) - very little is spent on maintaining an infrastructure able to cope with snow or freezing temperatures. This is not the fault of the average worker, be they bricklayer or barrister- this is the fault of the Governmant.    3. The abilities of the railways to cope with these conditions has been seriously undermined since privatisation. I'm an ex Railwayman (they got rid of me 3 years ago) and I remember crouching, with a driver, under a train which had frozen brakes, at 04.30, playing blowlamps upon the brake-blocks to unfreeze them. (I was Stationmaster at the time)  At the same time, Permanent Way (track) staff were going from turnout to turnout lighting the propane gas point heaters. All trains ran on time that day - why can't we do it nowadays.    Simple - divided responsibilty = no reponsibility, no guts, no movement.|`|82cb85yBaa	Not if its genuine - but lots of people who stayed at home probably could have gone in if they wanted to!|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	How would you feel if you couldnt get out of your drive way and there was no public transport running cause of the snow and then someone says tough - no holiday|`|FavaF3ioaa	Yes, the majority of calls are not genuine... it's just an excuse. Today's snow is nothing to what it was 10 years ago or so.    It's not fair on the people who made the effort and trekk into work.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	One is paid by an employer to work. If kept from work by bad weather, the reasonable options are: Holiday, unpaid leave, work from home or work the time back later.    An anomaly arises in companies that have generous sick pay schemes. An employee struggling to work in bad weather may get ill and take many days off work recovering so employers in such organisations must be careful to set the optimum policies.|`|si1ySTNEaa	if I had not gone into work because of the snow it would have been the same as telling my employers that I am not coming into work because I do not want to. Not only would it have been taken from my holiday I would have been given a disciplinary warning of misconduct.                     On the subject of snow I do not remember being allowed to stay home from school because of snow when I was a kid.Did teachers stay at home as well today. Never mind we already have a credit crunch/economic crisis why dont we all stay at home until the snow stops|`|jI85GYGoaa	No way - your'e forgetting lots of people get time back if they fall ill during an arranged holiday period and cant enjoy it.    And that's true that is - Unbelievable but true.    Best wishes|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Maybe if they live somewhere that only got a light dusting then it's a poor excuse but if I lived somewhere with heavy snow and ice then I'd take the attitude that I wasn't about to risk my life just to keep my employer happy.  It's funny how people seem to act as if they're the property of their bosses and that their own lives are secondary, a lot of employers certainly see it that way.  So, my answer's clearly NO.|`|hBmafVYoaa	I'm not sure everyone had to.|`|8ZgwtbwEaa	I'm waiting to find that out myself.  There was no transport running where I live and I don't drive so I couldn't make it.

kSWgbH9gaa	Why an individual won't accept rebirth or any "esoteric" values is the same as why some buddhists won't give up meat.    They just don't understand it yet or they are just unable to accept it yet. A kindergartener would be completely overwhelmed if you tried to teach him calculus. Not everyone is at the same level and ready to accept just any ideals or notions. In fact, even an arhat that chooses to remain as an arhat, would utterly think the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas were nuts to tell them to keep cultivating when they don't really need to. These arhats and Pratyeka Buddhas choose to stay where they are because they've ended the cycle of rebirth and suffering. They don't feel the need to continue on and become full-fledged buddhas. The buddhas and bodhisattvas tell them, "This isn't the end... there's still more to go to become fully enlightened." The arhats think it mad and THAT'S WHY these kinds of arhats don't budge. They can't accept what the Buddha is telling them. And they are extremely enlightened! Inconceivably greater than we are!    So when even a buddhist cannot accept rebirth, it's nothing strange. Even the arhats have contact with buddhas and bodhisattvas directly, and sit within the assembly of buddhas and bodhisattvas... and EVEN MANY OF THEM cannot accept everything that the buddha says just yet. To them it's,..."THE CYCLE IS OVER! I'M RETIRED! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I'M DONE CULTIVATING!"    Also consider certain sutras in which the buddha spoke ONLY to bodhisattvas and higher. The Buddha knew that this extremely high level of knowledge would fall on deaf ears for anyone else because anyone lower in enlightenment don't have the high level of wisdom and understanding and experience that is absolutely necessary to understand these particular sutras. The lowest level bodhisattvas could only glimpse the meaning of this sutra. The midlevel bodhisattvas would kind of get it, grasp it sort of, and gain a greater encouragement and experience for continuing their cultivation. the highest level bodhisattvas that are so close to becoming buddhas will immediately grasp the meaning of the sutra and immediately come to full and equal enlightenment of buddhahood.    There are novice buddhists that don't yet have the long-enough-time of studies and experience to accept/understand rebirth. There are buddhists that don't understand karma either and still eat meat.     If we all were at the same level and all notions of buddha dharma can be accepted immediately, then we all would not be here and we all would have become buddhas in many many mahakalpas ago. So just be patient with people.|`|AA10276712	Actually Jack, according to the teachings of the Buddha, the Hindu notion of reincarnation, that is the shedding one human body and the immutable self being reincarnated into a new body but containing the same self is wrong. The fundamental core teachings of Buddhism revolve around rebirth. There is a significant difference. The Buddha taught two core principles that differentiated Buddhist reincarnation from rebirth. 1) Anatta (anatman) or "not-self" or the absence of limiting self-identity in people and things. 2) Anicca (anitya) or Impermanence. Without a permanent self, there can be no reincarnation. Rebirth on the other hand is different. Buddhism teaches that Vijnana, or consciousness, is like the flame of a candle. While it may appear to be one flame without end on a candle, the truth is that the flame is always changing as the gasses of the candles fuel burn away. The same is true with us. Our "consciousness" is made up of all our skandhas (aggregates[form, sensation, perception, mental formation and consciousness]) A change in one causes a change in all. NONE of these are unchanging. When the body dies, the skandhas break apart and are reused. Form sensation, perception mental formations are all gone, what consciousness is there? Just as the body fades into water and dust to be reused by other living things our consciousness goes it own way either to the higher realms, the lower realms or we return as a human...and when we attain enlightenment, then we leave it all behind and achieve nirvana. First as a living breathing being and then as a Buddha or bodhisattva. However, it is perfectly clear that Mr. Jack does not die and come back and Mr. Jack 2.0. Once the body is dead, that which made the person Mr. Jack is no more and he is gone forever...but the consciousness that was Mr. Jack...that was 1/5 if Mr. Jack moves on. Just as the flesh rejoins the Earth the consciousness goes on to form a new being. Reincarnation is the rebirth of the self in a new body. Rebirth is the continuation of the Vijnana (consciousness) to a new form. And while the difference may seem minute, the significance to Buddhism is enormous.     Or so are the teachings of the Mahayana schools of Buddhism.     (Now keep in mind, that often, a  Bodhisattva who chooses to be reborn in the realm of humans is sometimes referred to as being 'reincarnated' in the English language, but that is still not accurate since even a Buddha has no self and thus there is no 'self' to be reincarnated.)     I hope this helps.|`|TLLklriUaa	Perhaps they are heeding the words of Buddha  Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Some Buddhists actually believe that they shouldn't cling to even the doctrine of reincarnation. Zen Buddhists are big on this type of meta-thought.|`|SqhGr6e3aa	Buddhists are usually not big on disowning people for not believing one thing. Didn't you know that?|`|mSFjbetxaa	I don't know any Buddhists who do not believe in reincarnation.    I agree, though, Buddhism is not big on asinine religious dogma, so each person can follow their own path.|`|AA12059478	You're right. They can't. It denies the concept of cyclic existence.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	Enlightenment is the pillar of Buddhism. How can some Christians believe in Trans substantiation and some don't?|`|EFjrJmdXaa	Well in buddhism your goal is to not be reincarnated, but they believe in reincarnation. If i'm thinking right I think you are asking why buddhists look forward to reincarnation. Well, buddhists don't exactly practice their religion correctly sort of like christians don't practice their religion right. In Buddhism your goal is supposed to be, ultimately, to not be reincarnated. Yes, buddha said we all have our own path so essentially it is ok to want reincarnation but I feel that buddha only agreed with that idea because he felt deep inside eventually down their path they would realize true happiness is only found when you are not reincarnated because everything is an illusion and happiness can only be found within ones self. Buddha felt that our requirement to have material things to be happy was a self deception. Buddha felt that "things" don't make us happy, but we make our selves, subconsciously, happy when we attain them. Because we feel happy when we have objects that points to the idea that the root of happiness is in a persons mind and that they can meditate on that feeling to feel happiness without needing any material objects to trigger that feeling. Once we are aware that we can trigger our own happiness we can let go of the material universe. Like I said it isn't that "objects make us happy" but that "we are happy as the result of objects". Buddha felt that because of this material had no real tie to happiness and that happiness can not be found in objects, and the idea that we can is just a self deception. So Buddhas main concentration was taking control of ones self and instead of letting objects control our happiness we control our own happiness. It is said that once you can tap into this energy within ourselves we won't need material objects to tie our happiness to. Reincarnation is the pillar of Hinduism though. Buddhism is supposed to be about finding that separation from mind and matter. Most common day people do not practice buddhism the way Buddha intended. They still tie their happiness to material things and that is why they desire reincarnation. Buddha believes that they will actually just be chasing themselves from one life to another. For example, people see others doing things and they are happy so they do them and do not find happiness in them. It is because what people don't realize is that happiness is self emulated. When you chase material things to find happiness all you are really doing is chasing yourself. Because happiness is rooted within our self.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Jack, you continue to persist on this question apparently without listening to the answers.  You surely realize that theological Buddhism (like theological Catholicism) is different than the popular form it takes. Buddha was asked about the soul; he refused to comment. He then tried to explain how one life leads to another as if one fire was lit from another - clearly not the same fire, but clearly also quite similar. He also refused to comment on the existence of deities, yet popular Buddhism has many of these. And, as you well know, people don't always practice what they preach.
UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU READ OR WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD OR BY WHOME, BUT BELIEVE ME DEAR, IT'S TOTALLY WRONG.  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|WJjfrf0Caa	I say "kill them all and let God sort them out." But that's just me.    Just realize these 2 things.     1. There is a lot of killing in both the Quran and the Old Testament in the Bible.  2. Islam is in fact a peaceful religion just as Christianity is a peaceful religion. But some people stretch the meaning of the religious teaching in order to justify violence. Terrorists are zealots that twist the meaning of Islam. The same is done with Christianity. The KKK is a Christian organization that twists the meaning of the religious teaching in order to justify violence.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yeah, mainly because they are misinformed. It's just a matter of time before the middle east comes here.. It has already started.. Look at the UK and other places...anyways.. some Muslims mean well but when you look into their root core or foundation you will see a lot of violence and blood shed for others not converting :) Good morals other wise, and few are friendly but... yeah.. still a very destructive religion, all religion for that matter, that is why it's important to have a relationship w/ the 1 true God..and know we are in need of a savior ( and so we preach Christ Crucified) :)    Blessings      Keep Looking up for Jesus !!|`|LhcN7Ygraa	i'll tell you whats peaceful...the military.|`|lgyPxg26aa	Islam is a peaceful as Christianity.    They do have the same God, after all.|`|uxfacsgmaa	I hate to agree with you, since one of my best friends is Muslim and I absolutely adore her and her family - but I'm afraid I do. I've read both the Qur'an and the Bible, and I can safely say that they both advocate violence and hatred for 'infidels', in their own special ways.     Sorry to all the peaceful Muslims out there, but it's time you took a good long look at what your book is telling you.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	I think most religions can seem either way. People are capable of viewing it that way and living a bad example of it. Those types are generally of an unfavorable mindset to begin with.    The bible has plenty of awful things in it, but how that's seen I think comes down to where people are. The Middle East DOES seem to be a more violent and unsettled part of the world. If Christianity was largely still located there instead of seeming to have shifted to the U.S., there is no doubt it would very possibly still be practicing the bad things in that book.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	I'm a liberal Democrat, and I agree.|`|nwdwKnS7aa	The words kill, slay or punish, referred to the non believers is repeated throughout the book over 100 times.|`|Lol0iLfgaa	Have you not read the Bible?  It is just as bad as the Quran.|`|bzbH2C1Aaa	yh these people are dum  Islam is why terrorism started  not being racist just pointing out a fact  who agrees with me?|`|Gsq05hXCaa	I don;t necessarily believe Islam is violent, and I;m a republican. However, I havent done much reading up on it, but as long as they just do their own thing and leave me out of it, I'm fine. Maybe the liberal media has me conned into believing it isnt that bad. gotta stop flicking passed CNN and MSNBC. FOX NEWS ALL THE WAY BABY!!!|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Most liberals are dull about this particular issue. They also thought they had made peace with Adolf Hitler just before WW2. You know, Winston Churchill crossed the floor over to the conservative side.|`|5436ebd85cea70ce327c74d3cfdc1597aa	are you really such an idiot? islam is no more violent than christianity is.  many atrocities have occurred throughout history in the name of christianity. god, youre stupid. okay, i shouldnt say things like that.  but really, stop generalizing.  jeeze.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	What context are you talking about?  I mean, do I want to ever live under some Muslim regime?  Hell, no...but should I automatically assume the guy that lives in my apartment building and does his prayer rug religiously has a violent streak in him?    I was a dispatcher in Ohio when the planes took out the Twin Towers - the psychotic reaction of John Q. Public was disgusting and accusatory everyday for a year...not one Muslim was ever found to have done anything wrong, and yet they had to everyday put up with assorted harrassment from the little minds that had access to a phone...most Holy Texts are "violent" because they are rigidly anti-everybody else - when you live in a mindset that they "other" intrinsically has something wrong with them, you adapt that sort of shallow narrow-mindedness.  The best way to lead people out of that dark wood of error is not to automatically assume they have something wrong with them or alienate them with the quickest slander you can think of...the Jewish Bible is one of the most violent works known to Mankind...do Jews fill you with terror when they walk down the street?  Or even Christian Fundamentalists who take every word as literal?  You may disagree with the foundational documents they hold up as authoritative, but I doubt you blanket them with the moniker of terrorist because their holy text is filled with violence and justifcations of such.  Treat the Muslim with at least that much respect.|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Have you read the bible?    Same basic concepts.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Why do morons generalize?|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	It's not the religion that's violent....it's the people who read it and act on violence.    The bible has some pretty horrific stuff in it too, you realise.|`|czf6uhIraa	You have obviously never met a real fundamentalist Christian...|`|bce49af4b285a96d81e7186b9e756de9aa	NOOOOOOOO. you might hurt a Muslim's feelings!!!!!|`|AwEspXiiaa	Uhh idk?|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i have not read the Qu'ran, no. i've been meaning to, though. i just want to see where they're coming from.     i think it IS a peaceful religion though. there's a few extremists in every group that gives the rest a bad name.|`|edOU65xAaa	Liberals like to bash the establishment.  They like to be counter-cultural.|`|llDXCv4raa	The Quran and Islam have shown no more violence than the Bible and Christianity as others have stated.|`|PHY2vd6baa	have you read it? besides people have killed in the name of the holy bible...they were called the HOLY CRUSADES....dont go bashing other peoples religions its not right....'cept for satanist....satanic bastards..|`|FmbwIbtzaa	The strength of Islam has been its clear-cut and well-defined presentation of Allah as the one and only Deity; its weakness, the association of military force with its promulgation, together with its degradation of woman. But it has steadfastly held to its presentation of the One Universal Deity of all, "who knows the invisible and the visible. He is the merciful and the compassionate." "Truly God is plenteous in goodness to all men." "And when I am sick, it is he who heals me." "For whenever as many as three speak together, God is present as a fourth," for is he not "the first and the last, also the seen and the hidden"? Page 1051-4|`|tPwihMCaaa	If you are a Christian, you had better study your own faith's history before slamming another.  We've had 8 crusades with the "Christians" beheading any Muslims that don't convert on the spot.  Same as Islam did.  Then there was the Spanish Inquisition - now that is something of which to be proud - NOT.  How about the witch hunts where hundreds of thousands of innosent people were burned to death after being tortured.  And the Serbs of a few years ago - Christian terrorists who murdered thousands of Muslims - men, women, children, babies - and dump them into mass graves.  Due to the media - they stopped.      If you read the OT - it is FULL of wars, incest, rape, murder, etc.  So study your own faith before you start slamming another faith.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	I've lived in Muslim countries and know many Muslims over seas and in the United States.  Have you ever visited a Muslim country?|`|1ycL4PZ8aa	Excuse me, but your ignorance is showing. Of course there are violent passages in the Quran. They're all over the Bible, too. Does that mean Christians are extremists? We're all just humans. We come in every shade of color and I don't mean necessarily skin color. Extremists are named that for a reason. Furthermore, extremists never follow anything correctly other than their own perverted beliefs.|`|Xd6YzVYkaa	sub hanallah like it bsays in  the quaran that the a minority of the muslems are evil the seven eleven attack where pereceived of JIHAD which means fight for ISLAM but not nessarily PHYSICLY the prohet MUHAMAD PBUH always tried to deal in the most sofest of ways. A minority represanmt ISLAM in good but sadly the majorit are doing nothing in the middle on know ones side, the reason why the United nations were  m,entione  in Barak Obamas speech because we wetre ones standing up to Israel and the mighty America. We believe in the after life were we would been told by 2 angels three questions, Who is your Lord, what is your book and who is your phrophet. We know the answers but if you dont have that fear in your heart or are not a beleiever you would be smashed by a hammer and thrown into hellfire. But Allah the most gracious the most merciful would give heaven to the believers. The Bible and Torah were changed by christians and jews to there own standand what they wanted more. But Quarn has special blessings that if a person who is wanting the truth who has a religion or not will find Islam and those who worshipped people, idles the moon and sun would follow there so called gods that were meant to help them into helfire. All but Isa or Jesus. He would say on the day of judgement infront of everyone whoever existed that he is not a god and was not asked to be worshipped. If thewres anyone who wants to convert to Islam, dont wait to it to late the dead line is when the sun rises from the west and your death bed. and already some of the signs of the judgement day has already  or a passing like the comfortability of transport or the major increase in globalization.  Peace|`|i8TxPRdGaa	islam is peace! but since the whole world is not peacful and perfect of course not every aspect of islam will be peaceful..for example quran tells us how to deal with enemies in war...well this is not peaceful but it has to be done u know??...and also penalty for adultery is death..well the adulterer was not being very peaceful so u see it really is peace..its the world that is not peaceful|`|4JFjxElyaa	cause they have sand up there ***|`|AA10116612	because they are being politically correct !!!!!!!    Islam and Christians do NOT have the same GOD.    Misnomer.|`|AA11717111	I don't class myself as being politically correct, but I do regard Islam as being a peaceful religion.|`|qPzxKhrlaa	A great many muslims are trying to move their religion into a more civilized arena so they focus on those scriptures which promote peace and kindness. Christians have done this, Mormons have done this, it isn't a new concept. This should be encouraged, not criticized.|`|AA10733606	Because PC people are wimps. They are afraid to ruffle someones feathers and hurt their feelings.|`|14Mxe74Uaa	It just like when everyone says homosexuals are all peacful loving individuals when in fact they comprise a very large percentage of violent criminals including several serial killers.  John Wayne Gacy, Herb Baumeister, Ottis Toole, Henry Lee Lucas, Andrew Cunanon, and Jeffery Dahmer were all homosexual.  People are just too afraid of being labeled politically incorrect to speak the truth about things|`|AA11922229	Keep asking questions like that and you'll get yourself out of the fear and loathing of strange people. Look out though, it may lead to higher thinking which prompts greater questions, like questions about our own shortcomings.    The generalizations which you are making promotes racism, prejudice and ignorance. As you look deeper, these people and ideas don't exist except in your own mind.|`|f2f195fdfbf2881626c83de4ceb66935aa	Islam means peace in Arabic,have you ever heard of the crusades..im pretty sure the people who were tortured and killed in the name of Christianity felt as you do.Every group of people has extremists...|`|EP2QeVgUaa	Islam is very peaceful. It disgusts me to think that i can't be a normal muslim boy living im America without there always being someone so prejudice of our religion. I am a normal person like everyone else here but apparently people have a different view of me just because of my religion which is definately stereotyping. Just because there are some people who have done some bad stuff dosnt that make the whole religion bad. hundreds of Palestinians die everyday yet the have to stop and talk about 3 israelis that died. Don't you find something wrong with that.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	I believe it is because they haven't read it. But it's also true that the entire Abrahamic Tradition is this way. That's why Jesus remarked, "I bring not peace, but a sword." How right he was.|`|0Knjt4G0aa	There are so many ways in which God's word is defiled, unfortunately, by people of all faiths. The root of the problem is humanity's distance from God and a selfish lack of respect for God's creation. All religions from God promote peace and tolerance.|`|ztrq4W7Naa	Go read the bible. Go read the Torah. Jews, christians, and muslims believe in the same god. When things are taken into the wrong perspective anything can be harmful. Every religion promotes peace in its original form. But people twist it around in their own little devious way and make it harmful.
xbw8P3Rsaa	Under church laws, you are not allowed to be the Godfather, but can be a Christian Witness to your nephew.      Heck, the fact that he is your nephew bars you from being his Godfather.    Does the parish know about this?    It will not show up on the roll (baptismal certificate).|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	The only problem would come in if you were to become his legal guardian. By becoming his godparent, you will have to agree to raise him in the Catholic faith. If that is not a problem for you, then you have no problem. Your role will simply be to agree to raise him Catholic and to be a witness.    edit: I may be wrong here. Just spoke to someone who says you must be Catholic to be a godparent. You better have your nephews parents check with their priest.|`|AA10034051	There might be. You have to be a baptized and confirmed practicing Catholic to be your nephew's godfather|`|JDxpjT34aa	That is a problem. In order to be the actual Godfather you would have to be Catholic. You can be a "Christian Witness" at your nephew's baptism but he will also have to have a Catholic godparent.

And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.  And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.  And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,  The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

Do you own study of God and stop listening to fairy tales.|`|d8mvhwbtaa	god is never mad, he just wants you to realize you have sinned and pray to him in apology, you dont have to worship him its your choice just stop questioning god, who created the first living cell and the molocule|`|dIxQ9rV5aa	God created man in His image, so when His image is sinful, it slanderously portrays Him as sinful.    Portraying God's qualities is a big part of the purpose for which He created us.  When we refuse that purpose, we cater to the whims of the Devil, and it is an affront to God.    In this usage, fear means respect.  Imputing evil motives to Him is a typical, disrespectful refusal to be in His image.    It is God's prerogative to decide what constitutes perfection, not ours.  Presuming that He is imperfect, because He experiences emotion is disrespectul toward His authority.    No matter how you slander Him, just because you hate Jehovah, doesn't mean that you can expect Him to deserve your hatred; only that you don't deserve the love He wastes on you.|`|lzZDTM9saa	okay i'm gonna answer the first 2 together.  God is perfect, but he definitely has emotions.  i don't think i have ever heard that "God is supposed to be...not susceptible to such emotions."   He insists that we worship him because, well, he deserves it!  He gave us life and everything else, and He deserves our all.    secondly, God-fearing means......well it'll be easier for you to just read this than listen to my summary: http://www.seiyaku.com/reference/godfear...    God bless, and i hope i answered your questions(:|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Nope, sorry. Nowhere does it say that emotion is wrong, or that God doesn't have it - on the contrary, as humans were supposed to be made in God's image, it follows that He may have an even wider range of emotions than we do. There's nothing wrong with feeling appropriate anger, sadness, etc. (see: Jesus in the temple when he went nuts on the sellers, Jesus in the garden of Gesthemane) - it's what one does with one's emotions that matters.    God fearing means to have a healthy respect for, or an awe for, God. There's some fear in there, but it's the same fear a child has for a parent in a healthy relationship - if I do something wrong, they're going to correct me to help me live a better life. I want to do well so I can please them, because I know they love me and care about me.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	It is said OF God that He gets angry at those who commit sin, but God Himself has not said He gets angry (as I understand it).  I think it's something that is expressed conceptually, not literal.  And you are indeed correct, God is not susceptible to the swing of human passion and emotion.  If anything, we may bring sadness to God when we sing.    Regarding worship...I think this is a very subjective thing.  Christians would argue that we owe Him our thanks and praise because He has already given us amazing gifts.  This is a matter of perspective.  As a Christian I often marvel at people who say, "What has God done for me where He deserves my worship of Him?"  Oh, I don't know - how about the universe and putting you and everyone you love in it?  LOL...    "God fearing" is truly an expression.  It doesn't mean we live in fear of Him.  Rather, it means to understand and defer to Him as authority and guide over our lives.    God bless you.|`|UJtUpWO0aa	Angry?  I believe that God is very hurt when we commit sins repeatedly.  God made man in his image!  That would explain why we possess anger as God does.  Although, I don't know for a fact if God is angry each time we commit sins.  Otherwise, he wouldn't have to give us chances to repent the same sins over and over again....right?       Worshiping God?  I believe here that God merely does not wanting man wasting his time worshiping anything or any one else.  If God is the true God, and I believe he is, wouldn't you think it ridiculous for God to have to observe others worshiping satan or trees, or false gods, when the God of the Bible well knows that all the others can do no good for mankind.        God fearing?  Is a reference we make to say that we 'respect" and "revere" God.  Tell me this,  "If you knew for a fact that the God of the Bible does exist, then you would also know that those who did not repent for their sins or believe in the God of the Bible will be in Hell for the remainder of their eternity and those who DID obey and revere God will be in Heaven for their eternity, would you not have fear of the thought that you might end in Hell for an eternity???  I would think so~!|`|EFjrJmdXaa	Well, not all people feel that God is like that. I believe God is susceptible to some human emotions but under different circumstances. For example, some humans when angry would resort to violence, but not God. I feel that God does not necessarily get angry at people who commit sins such as saying bad words about another person, because God understands that we don't really understand how we are being, but I do feel that God gets angry at people who murder one another in cold blood. I don't believe God insists that we 'worship' God. I just feel that God insists that we take Gods advice such as be kind to others, help others, etc, which is completely different than worship. I think people misconstrue God telling them to listen to him and obey him with worshiping him. Sure maybe there are some parts where God says in the bible that the only being we should worship is God but I don't believe God literally means we should worship Gods being but rather Gods word. There are parts in the bible where God says that a person is damned unless they listen to God but I honestly don't believe that God is the one who damns people but rather they damn themselves. For example if God told a person they should not steal from their neighbor yet they do anyways and the neighbor shoots them. Them being shot is their own fault and something they brought upon themselves. Sure, God may not agree that the other person shooting them was the right coarse of action but none the less God knew that it would happen and that is why God suggests you follow Gods advice. I don't believe people should fear God, rather they should fear themselves and the consequences of their actions. I personally believe that God doesn't punish people but rather God lets them punish themselves by making mistakes and having to deal with the repercussions. To me this is the only way a person can learn form their mistakes. To me God doesn't really need to punish us because in all honesty we punish our selves enough as it is. Also, being perfect has nothing to do with emotions.  Being perfect does not contradict having emotions because perfection is relevant. What makes God perfect is not that God doesn't have emotions but rather that God has a different way of interpreting and acting on those emotions. God may have a more mature set of emotions than us but none the less God has emotions. What makes a being perfect or imperfect in this sense is not that they have emotions but rather how they act on those emotions. Everyone must have the same set of emotions in order for it to make sense. God created us in Gods image so therefore all of the feelings we experience God is capable of experiencing. This does not mean God does experience all of them though because you have to think God is older and wiser. As far as anger goes though I think all beings feel anger when they are treated unfairly and unjustly, even God. It is also necessary for God to express this anger so that people understand that they have offended God, because people need to understand how to respect each other. You can love someone and be understanding of them, not punishing them, and still be upset with their behavior. Lets say your neighbors always make fun of you, one day burn down your house, and write offensive names all over your drive way. Would you be angry at them or not be phased? I would think you would be angry with them because no matter how understandable their disposition that kind of behavior is still uncalled for, and the only way people learn respect is by experiencing other peoples anger when they are mistreated. If you do not get angry what do they have to learn? Nothing, except for that it is ok, since it doesn't phase you. Wouldn't you think God may get upset if someone were to burn down the earth? No matter how understanding God can be that kind of action from someone is still a little uncalled for, unless of coarse everyone was constantly harrassing him. Then God would be understanding. But Cold Blood crimes?|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	"Then why would he get angry if people commit sins? Anger is a human emotion and God is supposed to be perfect and not susceptible to such emotioins."  -You are off here.  God has emotions which is why humans have emotions.  You have the cart before the horse.  God does have emotions and anger is one of them.    "Why would God insist that people worship him. Is he an egomaniac, which again is a weak human trait."  -Because he is God.  Worshiping him makes us closer to him.  A deep relationship with Him is the only way He can save us from the mess we have gotten ourselves into.    "Also, what does the expression "God fearing" mean. Why are we supposed to fear him? Is he evil and out to get us?"  -This fear is different from the contemporary fear we discuss in our culture.  The fear of God is like a recreational sky diver who takes great care, concern and respect in packing and maintaining his parachute.  .    "Why wasnt Adam allowed to eat the apple? Was God a control freak and just wanted to see how far he can push it?"  -The apple was an allegorical story of the human fall where humanity decided to subvert or cut corners on the relationship with God or get ahead of the plan God knew was best.    If the fall was rewritten for today, it would be an athlete cutting corners on his coache's work out plan or using steroids.  It might also be a man giving his fiancee a CZ, telling her it was a diamond then spending the money on hookers.|`|5bf9be535e7647e7d422c7c6e13d899daa	How can you define God and Human traits if you don't believe God exists?  "God Fearing" means that you fear the punishments of God over the punishments of man.|`|yQq1LSyTaa	Who says he gets mad?   "God fearing" is not supposed to be taken literally, it means that you shouldn't even want to sin, as if you were to fear him. Kinda like you shouldn't want to swear at your boss because you fear he'll fire you.|`|fmlwD58iaa	allah!!!!!!!!!!!  jihad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  religion is so cool  the greatest gangster of alll time  if you ask me|`|AA12187979	He don't exist -- so he doesn't get angry, he is not an egomaniac, and he doesn't Inspire fear.

Unlike the wildebeest and quit stupidly in comparison, we pray that we don't et eaten by the lions.        Be thankful you breath and look out for your fellow citizen.|`|z03u3JGXaa	God gets angry when people DELIBERATELY sin when they had the knowledge, will and opportunity NOT TO.    Anger IS justified under the proper circumstances and who says that God lacks these qualities? - NOT the Bible.     "God Fearing" is a term used for respect for authority - You fear the breaking the law because of the consequences, You fear touching a red hot poker because it can burn you. - This is a healthy fear that helps to keep you from doing the wrong thing.     The Bible is right when it says that the world is filled with knowledge but people STILL don't have a basic understanding of simple life principles. - Just check the posts on this board.|`|XnAq9rd5aa	God is angry when we commit sins because it is a direct rejection of his love. When we sin we are turning our back on him and what he wants for us. God is able to feel all human emotion, he created us and we are created in his image and likeness (Genesis 1:26-27) and he WAS a human (Jesus) so he knows what all emotions are like. He is perfect in his way of handling emotion. He is always fair and just. He will not automatically condemn a generally good person for a few sins if they are sorry because he is overcome with emotion. He can keep his emotions in check and at an appropriate level but he feels all human emotion because he GAVE us these emotions. He is perfect in how he handles them.  If you created something and gave it life (lets say you have a child) and disobeys you and when you KNOW what is best for them and you only want them to be happy, then wouldn't you be upset? Yet through the times you are upset you still love them and if they are sorry (and you are being fair) you'd forgive them. That's like God's relationship with us. He knows all and he knows what is best for us. Yet, we like to do whatever we want and do what WE *think* is best for ourselves and sin. Of course God will be frustrated that we didn't listen to him and he sees us heading for suffering. But he still loves us and will ALWAYS forgive us if we are sorry because is always fair and just.    God created us. He deserves worship. Are you not thankful for the gift of life? Then thank the person who gave it to you. It is only what is respectful to thank and love God for everything he gave us (which is everything good there is in the world). Without him, you would not exist. Nothing would exist. He loves us beyond measure and wants us to be happy. Since he loves us and has mercy and patience with us he deserves our love in return. We should respect him and worship him for what he has given us.  Besides, don't you have any manners? Because, honestly, it's just basic common sense and manners. When someone gave you a gift, weren't you told to write them a thank you note (or express your thanks in some way)? God gave us everything on this Earth and for that he deserves flat-out worship in thanks.    And "God fearing" is simply old terminology that means, in today's language, "God respecting." That's all. Nothing scary like "you better love God OR ELSE!"  If someone "fears God" they're just saying (in older wording) that they respect God or that they love God.  EDIT:  All those people above me that are saying we are to in anyway literally FEAR God are incorrect (if they are Christian). I have been highly educated in my faith and that is NOT what it means. It just means respect.  "besonderschatten" phrased the "fearing God" thing PERFECTLY!|`|dXdKSmgLaa	God doesnt do any thing to us.. He gave us free will and he told Adam and Eve not to eat the fruit and when they did, sin entered the world and thats where SELF control comes in.. People are so quick to judge God but they have no idea that its them causeing these problems not God.. People say how come God lets bad things happen, well I will do my best to be the good mother my daughter, to take care of her needs and when she grows up she is going to hate me and blame me for her choices and wrong doing and she is going to fall and she is going to get hurt, but I am here and I love her and I will help her get back up and lead her in the right direction, but she will have consequences for her choices.. God created us and he has given us commands to protect us and to give us life and a future. not to condemn us but he cannot just fix everyting for us just like I cant fix it for my daughter. Anger is an emotion we all feel and the Bible speaks about anger but to have righteous anger for the things of the Lord when things go against his will and you can be angery but do not sin, which is flying off the handle and being a screaming violent idiot.. But be angry if your anger is just and warrented and controled.. and he gives us the ability to control it also..    He wants us to worship him but in the sense of he created us and Jesus laid down his life for you . Awe and wonder and amazment at his creation and purpose. To give your life as he did for you... Yes fear judgement what will happen if you do not know him do you know where you are going and what your purpose is here? did you fear your parents as a child when you did wrong and you knew you did wrong? That is the same. God has grace to give us what we do not deserve and mercy to give us when we do deserve the wrath of God..If you have any more questions please write to me.. God bless
jcrPpPvqaa	I was an atheist, I was arrogant and selfish. I thought that I didn't need anyone or anything. I had a decent career, and good health. Lost both of those, almost lost my marriage. I became an alcoholic, used pills and some other recreational drugs. Lost my job, and  then a couple weeks or so later, I became temporarily disabled due to a freak accident which crushed my left foot and Gained over a hundred pounds. Lost family members. I have a long list....... All of these difficult things seemed to happen all at once.I was suicidal with no where or any one to turn to. My car got repossessed.....My arrogance  became feelings of worthlessness.    These things will make a person question life. The freak accident gave me time to reflect....I wasn't looking for a god to make the hurt go away. In fact I started watching Christian TV and listening to Christian radio to mock all of those people who would worship a god that would let all of these bad things happen.    When I was at my lowest point, God reached out to me to show me that no matter how  pathetic I was or am..His mercy and love is greater.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	I think I have.    There have been two times in my youth where I fully cried out in the darkness of night to God that I will be and do whatever he wants for my life.  Both were at bible camp.|`|z6T7nznLaa	I have.  And it's an essential part of Christian life.  Here are a few verses to show:  James 1:2-4   2Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, 3because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. 4Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.     In this verse, the author James tells us that trials are essential, so that we may learn perseverance, to mature and become complete servants of God.    Here's another:  Hosea 6:1-3  1 Come, let us return to the LORD.  He has torn us to pieces  but he will heal us;  he has injured us  but he will bind up our wounds.    2 After two days he will revive us;  on the third day he will restore us,  that we may live in his presence.    3 Let us acknowledge the LORD;  let us press on to acknowledge him.  As surely as the sun rises,  he will appear;  he will come to us like the winter rains,  like the spring rains that water the earth.    This verse describes the breaking down that God performs on us so that He may restore us.  Even though we must live through the trial, His desire is that we persevere with him, to come out of it, matured.  The third verse describes the sureness of God's return.  It is not that He has left, but that He leaves us in our struggles so that we may return stronger, to live another day.      I found a YouTube video of one of my favorite songs by a band called Hillsong.  The chorus comes from Hosea 6:3, the above verse.  The song states that, in view of our struggles we have resolved to wait upon the Lord, because he will return.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEPQ1acY...    I have been broken.  But this is not a good thing during the trial.  It can be painful, whether it is sickness, or a death, or job loss.  But we must remain steadfast and wait for the Lord, for he will restore us as we mature to become more like Him.|`|vVJBb9Cdaa	I am still broken right now but healing. I lost my grandfather suddenly on December 27 2008 and that was extremely difficult for me even knowing he was saved and was in heaven. Just the knowing he'd never congratulate me on an accomplishment or go over to his house and just be with him. Then on January 23 2009 I lost one of my first and closest friends because of a freak atv accident at 16. Homecoming was the next week and he had been really looking forward to that. I know they are both in heaven but it did break me in a good way in the end. The realization that God is still in control and this verse really brought me back to reality:    Isaiah 57:1B  Devout men are taken away, and no one understands that the the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.    Also a year ago i was fairly depressed because i had grown away from God and didn't really have any friends i was still close with. Things turned around through the grace of God and i didn't really feel broken but it was the second lowest point in my life.|`|xxijbx4Waa	me  thank you lord for the gift!|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Pretty close to broken a couple of times.

Sometimes God breaks us, so that He can mold us and make us a vessel of honor before Him.  The process might be painful, but great is the reward.

But, you need to cry at His feet on your knees.

Even LaVey's version of Satanism is an attempt to claim that things of Satan are not of Satan but that they come from man.  I'd love to hear LaVey's attempts at explaining how men are inherently born evil... LOL...  Satanists can try to believe that they aren't worshipping Satan, but they're the only ones falling for that one.    God bless you.      ***EDIT: LaVey considers Satan to symbolize man's inherent nature.  Just because LaVey and his followers don't believe Satan is real doesn't change a thing about the fact that they are representative of Satan in our world.  After all, if you think that Satan is the same as our inherent nature, then it doesn't even matter whether Satan is real or not - the bottom line is that LaVeyan Satanists worship that which is Satanic.    It's really not complicated, even thought LaVey tries to make it seem real intellectual and fancy.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Well, first off there are several types    Second, LeVey picked the name specifically to mock the religious and get a reaction.

I happen to be a traditional or theistic Satanist, the key difference being I believe in a real Satan.  The fact that He manifests Himself in me from time to time - I've seen that in others too - is a confirmation to me of that, though no doubt LaVeyan Satanists would explain that as a manifestation of the unconscious mind.  Otherwise we're sort of the same.  Certainly I'd agree with a lot of what LaVey wrote.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Lack of research, I guess.

I came to my senses and realized it was all made up.      I am sure this sort of thing is child abuse and is about as evil as anything short of actual torture one can do to a child.

However, if any true believer of christ does anything to anyone that causes you harm they have a large order of repentance on their plate.  The God I believe in takes a dim view of one Christian abusing another person (Christian or not)  As for just religious people, they owe and dont pay; say but don't do; and so on.

1LUhUdhHaa	In the olden days they increased power by conquering or discovering new lands setting up their countries as power bases for the new markets the discoveries open up such as tobacco nd corn from the new world.  They also granted land and titles to people who must in turn swear allegiance to the monarch.  This strengthened their power base.  Today the Queen of England maintains her power by not using it.  Since the Queen does not exert her royal power (the little she has left) no nobility under her can exert their own feudal power.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	They didn't. For the past 1000 years the Queens ancestors have lost a lot of royal power, although they still do have a lot it has never gone up.    They did regularly produce taxes that pushed the lower classes down.    If anything a monarchs power can be measured by how much their people like them and how much they will let them get away with.

(The human soul or conscience.) That which which goes beyond the mere functions of the brain.That which makes us love, act kindly toward others, hope, fear, wounder. Many will deny the existence of the soul. who will deny the powers that are attributed to it? We should not be so hasty to deny that which cannot be seen.    However just as the sun does not require a Planet on which to produce life in order to validate its existence. God does not need a soul through which to manifest his attributes in order to validate his existence. Although the two can be readily measured on the basis of these functions.    Beyond the Genesis account of creation and the many other biblical references to God's existence, the attributes of the humane soul may possibly be the most accepted measurement for the existence of God. That is to assume that we are not robots.   You could also go into the less widely accepted and valid measurements such as the miraculouse.

dcfce3e99b39f77803362d8f96deaa4faa	These are the answers I've heard --    "God is simple."  This just defies common sense.  They claim that God is a single substance that can somehow read every human's thought and make sure every atom doesn't fly apart.  Materialists could just as easily claim that the universe is a single substance (energy) so it is in fact simple.    "God is outside of time."  The problem with this is that it suggests God created time, but the act of creating implies the prior existence of time because all acts require a change and all change requires time.|`|NFK3A68oaa	Very sensible question.   A young fellow just asked almost the same question a while ago: "If God created everything, then who created God?" This is the shortest I could answer and do justice to your question. I think you'll find that 90% of it is applicable.     But think about it. When did time begin? What time was it an hour before that? And where does space end? And if it has an end, what is on the other side of that? They go on forever, infinitely, or at least so far that there's not much point in our pursuing the matter.    So there are some things within our everyday experience that are infinite. Space may be curved, but then, if it went straight, where would it go, and how far? Mathematicians and quantum physicists deal with infinity every day. So saying that God is infinite shouldn't be that hard to comprehend, really.     And if there is no God because there is no one to create him, then how did intelligent life come to be by itself? Many top scientists theorize and believe that it did by evolution...So the question is really just a circular question, that is, one that goes around in a circle without ever coming to a definite answer, one that substitutes US for God, because it says that it is possible that we, instead of God, came into being by ourselves.    Problem is, in our universe there is something called entropy, which, among other things, means that complicated things tend to go downhill instead of uphill, if you know what I mean. They don't get better by themselves. and we and every other living thing are very complicated. That's why you have teachers, engineers, scientists, coaches, managers. To keep things from going downhill, and to improve them.  And even something as simple as a fly comes equipped with things that are hard to believe as happening by themselves--self-constructing, self-programming, self-correcting, navigational system that enables it to fly forward, backward, and upside down, self-fueling, SELF-REPRODUCING. We can't yet design ANYTHING like that. Whoever did deserves great respect.    If there is a God, and many people believe the evidence goes that way, He would be on a completely different plane than we are, made of different stuff than we are and possibly existing amid different rules and forces than we are, and any attempt to explain what he is will be like a bacteria trying to explain to another bacteria what the scientist is like who is looking at them through the microscope. Completely different scale of time, size, speed, ability. And vastly different scales sometimes have vastly different rules and forces at work. Can't you just hear the bacteria? "She can't possibly travel that fast! He can't possibly be that big! She can't possibly be that smart! He can't possibly live that long!" Stephen Hawking, in his book, "The Universe in a Nutshell", noted how some of the atomic forces only become noticeable on extremely small scales, gravity only on extremely large scales. People long wondered how the gecko lizard could stick to and walk on the ceiling, without glue on his feet. Scientists discovered that there are forces and rules at work in the tiny fibers on his feet (microfibers) that they hadn't realized existed or were at work. And NOW we have Microfiber cloths, mops, etc. (But who figured out how to grow microfibers on the gecko's feet? And nowhere else?) If we're smart, it seems to me that we need to recognize the same possiblity of as-yet-undiscovered principles, rules and forces with God.    The more I think about it, saying that God has always been here is hard to understand, but no other choice for a beginning of the universe can be said to make any more sense. Starting from nothing doesn't make any sense to me. Where would anything come from? And why? And even the Big Bang assumes a starting point with all of the mass and energy of the universe crammed into it. But how long was THAT there? And where did it come from? And why? And saying that God might have had some sort of beginning succumbs to the fallacy of just pushing the same problem farther back in time. The problem with evolution is entropy, the natural tendency of order and information to disappear, not improve. And that seems to be inherent in the numbers, no matter what universe you might be talking about. Life is very orderly, and anything requiring order or ordered steps has one or just a few possible correct ways to do it, but there are an infinite number of ways NOT to lead to the desired outcome. So random occurences have almost an infinite chance of being the wrong ones, pitifully few chances of being the right ones, for each step. The more ordered steps that are required, the more the deck seems to me to be stacked against random happenings producing the desired steps. And any sort of evolution depends on random changes.     So, while I wish I could explain why God has always been here, I see no improvement in saying that matter, or its building blocks, have always been here. Same proble|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Meh. "Complex" is a relative, anthropomorphically biased term. Unless you have something "not complex" to compare the universe to, then Christians can't really claim it IS too complex.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	To play devil's advocate right back at you?    Complexity is often defined in the terms of information density or entropy.  If G-D has no particles or states, but just simply "IS", then G-D would be of low complexity and yet could source vast amounts of information density.    Given that it would be a deific entity, the violation of informational thermodynamics is within is primary definition (that of omnipotence).    I'm an atheist, but... you have to try just a little bit harder than that.  After all, cosmology does require a prima causa, any scientist who tells you otherwise is either not a cosmologist, a liar, or a fool.  I just don't ascribe unnecessary deific traits to this prima causa.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	We've seen the universe 'existing'. We've quantified the forces involved in the universe and established laws which describe them.    The existence of a god would break every one of those laws. Nothing in the entire history of human existence has ever violated those laws. Any reasonable person could conclude they're not going to be broken anytime soon. So, no he can't 'just exist'. The phenomena that would be required in order for him to exist are just mind-boggling.

I would be much happier and more at peace if I was 1 of 10,000 people in the earth. I would hope at least 500 of the people lived within a 100 mile radius of me.    Psalms 37: 8 - 11:    Let anger alone and leave rage; Do not show yourself heated up only to do evil. ?For evildoers themselves will be cut off, But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace  ----------------------|`|Wt398Yueaa	I would be a bit wary - I would assume that I had somehow wandered into an SF novel.

nXPJ6d7eaa	I don't feel this way at all. My iPod is my escape, and we all need one. I feel like I give so much of my time and energy to other people and things (family/work/recreational activities/friends/other committments) that I really need some time for myself.     Public transport is the BEST place to use one, as you don't really talk to people, have to pay attention, or offend anyone on PT. I used to listen to it EVERY morning and evening to indicate that, no, I don't want to chat, and that I am taking time for myself.     I am not really sure why you feel that you don't deserve this small pleasure, unless it is not a pleasure any more. If that IS indeed the case, then leave the thing at home when you leave the house. You might be missing it greatly at first, but it will wear off in time. Or you could try ruining it for yourself by never charging it/filling it with crappy songs that you don't enjoy. Either way, it's pretty twisted.     Good luck.|`|73zdU7m1aa	I would leave it at home and not bring it on your bus trips.  When you ride the bus, talk to who you are sitting by a little if you know theme or want to make a new friend.  You might also try looking out the window at some scenery as you ride the bus or watch what is going on on the sidewalks, freeways, etc.    If you are tired of the same songs over and over, you could consider getting some new tunes for it via the iTunes Store, buying a CD, or downloading from a P2P network.|`|AA10570173	Just leave it at home. I think you've obviously been giving this some thought. I agree with you at least somewhat. Although I do have to say as long as you keep the music low, the iPod thing bothers me a lot less than people on their cellphones on the bus.    But really, leaving it at home is the easiest way to do this. If you don't have it with you, you can't use it. If it's too hard, try just doing it for one day and see how you feel.    Good luck.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	dont charge it|`|VhrUtQc2aa	Act like someone said they are going to take it off you and you don't want them to so you leave it at home in the draw and you don't take it with you and at home keep yourself occupied with something else other then your ipod.
mjTmQzvFaa	How sweet of you asking a question like this. I am very glad you had a wonderful day. My day was filled with worry because my fiance' is a professional truck driver and he got into a scary situation today on his way back. I was alot better when he walked in the door and we were able to embrace each other. Thank you again for being so nice and posting that simple question , because for me that meant alot and also helped to end my day off well. Take care and have a wonderful week. Hugs to you too.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	I am just groovy thank you. I think it is substantial that you ask. I hope your day has gone well and anything substantial is the good kind.

d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	Church is from the Middle English 'chirche,' which is derived from Old English 'cirice,' that is derived from Medieval Greek 'kyrikon,' derived from Late Greek 'kyriakon,' the Lord's (house), neuter of Greek 'kyriakos,' meaning  'of the lord,' from 'kyrios, lord, producing the equivalent of "The House of the Lord," which is the meaning of 'Church.'    Christians copied the Jewish synagogues rather than the Jews temple, hence the similarities in liturgy, &c.        QUILL|`|bXeHr69Vaa	interpretation from the greek|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Translation process.

Every person dates a prick/***** once in while and they have to learn to deal with it by themselves, it makes them stronger. Just give your friend some time and be loving and supportive even if it doesn't seem to help, your friend will most likely appreciate it. It's not your responsibility to fix your friends life, just offer him support and let him take it if he wants to.|`|2fd065ea057afb57a6ae9b9702ca424daa	Honestly, you need to mind your business. I understand that you care about your friend and don't want to see him hurt but there's nothing you can do to stop whatever they have going on. Some lessons are only learned the hard way and maybe your friend needs to handle this one on his own. You never know, your friend could turn on you for interferring with his so called love life. Be the shoulder he cries on but otherwise stay out of it.|`|Cpr6Ff5laa	spam his mailbox with pictures of naked fat people and send him a letterbomb    edit: i wish i had a friend like you =/|`|H1DrMEZxaa	It's so amazing that he has a friend like you to help him through this tough time.  It sounds like a really rough situation.  I think you have been doing the best you can by the sounds of it.  Just make it really clear to him that this douchebag is obviously NOT good enough for him and that he is far better off without him.  Just be there for him and when he really needs you, he'll ask.  Good luck with everything!
JZxZ8mKRaa	No    Exception may be if you are a fugitive of law - murderer, bank robber, awol from military, runaway from prison - something of that sort.    Because you are going to have to work through situations like this and are going to need all the help you can get.|`|dl97DmmYaa	no|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	No  The bible says ...that is what you were...but you have been washed clean..  Baptism erases your past life and you come out of the water a new person....wanting a good relationship with Jehovah and a new life. You should have already put on the new personality and have put on the complete suit of armor.    What you did before is wiped away....  Jesus said, you are forgiven, Go and sin no more.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Not necessarily, but it's up to you. Your relationship with Jehovah God is ultimately what matters the most as you become a witness. It is to Jehovah that we give our minds, body, heart to and they just want to make sure you are sure you wish to do this.    In the end, it's up to you, but I did not. There were some things I told and many more I did not, but to this day, it is very important to me how I behave each and everyday because I don't want to bring reproach upon Jehovah or his true organization; or myself.     I am going through some very trying times right now because there are wolves within our congregation that "only got their feet wet". This means though they got baptized, they never truly repented of their former course of life and have continued in a manner displeasing to Jehovah while causing pain and suffering to other brothers and sisters. They never truly dedicated their lives to serving Jehovah but only faked it as it were. From these, turn away... we never want to be as these.    So in the end as long as you know you are repenting and putting on your new personality rejoicing in your service to Jehovah, you do not have to confess all your past sins and misgivings. That much is up to you.|`|9S6xT3Onaa	No if it dose not affect you now or your relationship with Jehovah remember the elders are Sheppard's looking after the flock if you tell them they can keep an eye on you and help you to not go down the same road of sin again|`|E7fguoVBaa	Nope|`|MJg0QjQsaa	It is not neccessary, or required to tell an elder of your past sins. There is no confession. It is required to be repentant of your sins, truthfully in prayer to Jehovah God.     The elders primary responsibility is to care for the congregation. So, if you are an escaped convict, or something along that lines ( and I am not implying that you are) then it would only be reasonable to tell an elder so that he can care for the other members of the congregation and be assured of their safety.    I am now studying to be a baptized Jehovah Witness. I have not told an elder what sins I have commited prior to my studying. The elders don't ever try to pressure me into telling them anything. Actually, they've never even asked what sort of things I would do before I started attending and studying. They are still willing to answer any questions that I have about the religion, or the Bible, or about Jehovah Witnesses belief.     You know what I've asked a priest in a different Christian religion a question after his sermon one night, basically just wondered where in the Bible did he see what he was preaching, and you wouldn't believe the disgust he expressed to me. Like I wasn't worthy of looking in the Bible. I didn't think that sort of thing really happened these days. It was the first and the last time that I went to any other religion's church.     I hope this helps.    = )|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	nope!|`|GtazNrplaa	I would tell them noting at all.

YLqVv7Lzaa	This is because certain animals (particularly horned animals such as Rams and Goats) play a part in modern 'Satanic' ceremonies. They are based on the ceremonies of earlier religions such as the Druids and the Celts which often used animal symbols, whether physical animals or animal costumes, in rituals that had nothing to do with 'Satan' but were healing or blessing rituals. Modern wannabes tend to shove anything that looks vaguely occult into a religion in an attempt to sex it up a bit without understanding the meaning or origin of the symbols.|`|AA11521494	It's done for shock value and it appeals to a certain audience.  Most "Satanic" bands aren't actually properly Satanists at all.  As a Satanist I know my beliefs are widely misunderstood so I tend to keep quiet about them.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Because they are marketing to a post-teen demographic who have moved on from swords and sorcery to oh-so-mysterious black clothing and tales of occult derring-do.

AA11232725	I've got the e-sword software with a lot of versions of the Bible including a version by the Jewish Publication Society and the Hebrew Names Version.    The JPS is pretty close to the KJV and the HNV is close to other versions except for using Jewish spelling for names. What did you have in mind since the OT is based upon the Jewish Masoretic texts?|`|f3nwI8ytaa	The old testament is based on the same Hebrew text as the Tanakh.  So I don't really know what you are going on about.    peace|`|Icwz678Qaa	Good point!    A great website that has done just that is listed below.    Be Blessed:-)|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Actually, early Christianity used the Tanakh in an intact form. It was later centuries that found it being mistranslated, primarily for doctrinal reasons. Mistranslation first happened in the NT. The OT didn't suffer major violence in translation until the early 17th century. (Other than the addition of the apocryphal books by Catholics.)|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	God made a strong warning about changing even one word of the bible. We christians wouldn't accept it. So now it wouldn't be the paper it was printed on.|`|yQNit56Qaa	No.  (BTW - the first 5 books of the Old Testament ARE the Torah)    I'm not sure why this "occurred" to you, but whatever caused that occurrence, I recommend that you not get near it again.    It *is* true, however, that there are plenty of biased translations of the Masoretic Text, easily determined, among modern English bibles.  The problem is:  whose translation is correct - the Christian-biased ones, or the Jewish-biased ones?    There *are* some relatively good (less biased) translations of Tanakh available in Christian bibles (RSV, NJB).      Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|6TuyXuJRaa	It already has been corrected.

I once asked if a translated version of the Hebrew Scriptures would be a more accurate source of the Christian god's word, but the Christians told me no.|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	it's fine the way it is.|`|1iKEQ6yYaa	There is no mistakes, just misinterpretation by people|`|Kbry7CnOaa	Hell, let's re-write the whole thing....|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Not quite.  The current Torah was edited by the Pharisees at Jamnia and following to cut out some of the scriptures and understandings that lead so many Jews to become Christians.    Also, the early Christians mainly used the Septuagint, Greek scriptures, which the Jews after Christ later rejected.    Modern Judaism is newer than Christianity.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	I'm not sure where you get your information, but I have a translation of the Hebrew scriptures (published by the American Jewish Publication Society of America) and they are very close to the KJV of the Old Testament. It is an English (Jewish) translation of the Masoretic text. The Hebrew is printed along side the English text and, like Hebrew, reads from the back to the front.
MSFgIuVUaa	I cannot speak for Judaism so I will speak for Christianity.     1) There are many things but the biggest is that He is the eternal Father who sent His son to die for our sins.      2)Heaven for the faithful, hell for the others.     3) Sabbath is a sign between God and Israel, that was never repeated in the New Testament as a requirement for those who are Christians.  Thus Christians do not have to obey the sabbath law.     4) No holy cities, John 4:21-24    5) Dying to the old life and being born again Romans 6    6) Use your freedom in Christ to live by the Spirit Galatians 5|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: both believe in G-d  Christians add Jesus into the mix    Afterlife: Jews believe that, eventually, everyone reaches G-d (whether there's a delay with reincarnation, waiting for resurrection, time spent away from G-d repenting sins - all end up with Him).  The afterlife isn't described in the Tanakh so Jews don't worry about it - focusing on the here-and-now and caring for others and repairing the world.    Christians believe in heaven and hell.  There is no hell in Judaism.    Christians don't observe the Sabbath but tend to say they follow the 10 commandments.  They have religious services on Sunday in honor of the resurrection of Jesus and not on Friday/Saturday, the original Sabbath.    Holy city for Jews is Jerusalem  Holy cities for Christians: Jerusalem and Bethlehem and, for some, Rome    Important life events in Christianity: baptism, communion, death    Duties: spreading "the good word", performing charity (but not required), believing in Jesus as a divine savior|`|L0R92wWeaa	I'm not exactly sure about the holidays and what not, however I do have some useful info. Basically, Jews don't believe Jesus was the messiah. They believe he was a person, but didn't come to save the sin's of the world. If you have a bible, and your interested, you should read Galatians in the new testament. The author of the book, Paul, is speaking his opinion to a group of people called the "judiazers". Which basically means - people who have become Christians, but are holding on to there judiastic ways. Going back to another point, In the old testament of the bible, there are 1000's of laws Jews were supposed to follow. That's where Jesus comes in. With Jesus, if you accept, your sins are forgiven, and your not longer chained to the law. This doesn't mean you can now live your life how you want, actually completely the opposite. God understands we sin, and we all screw up, hence Jesus. Jesus provides a way of forgiveness, and freedom from the pains of life. Since Jews don't believe in the forgiveness of Jesus, they are stuck trying to follow a bunch of rules. So basically Judaism is Christianity before Christ, lol. So the jews believe in the same God, however, not the new testament part. Sab. day for Christians is sunday, holy cities include: Jerusalem, Bethleham, and idk- many more. Life duties in Christianity are basically letting God lead you through everyday life, and surrending yourself to God's power. It's a new and improved way of living! Praise God for it!|`|q9C46Wuqaa	- Jews and Christians = same God (hello! there's only one God!)   - After life.. heaven for both (But very different views)   - Sunday for Christians   - Jerusalem   - Christmas and Easter   - Helping the poor and needy    Edit: Thumbs down!? I am telling her the truth you idiots.|`|LLey4VRzaa	Colossians 2:16-23  16 So don't let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new-moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. 17 For these rules were only shadows of the real thing, Christ himself. 18 Don't let anyone condemn you by insisting on self-denial. And don't let anyone say you must worship angels, even though they say they have had visions about this. These people claim to be so humble, but their sinful minds have made them proud|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	http://whatjewsbelieve.org  http://www.convert.org/Judaism_and_Chris...  http://www.jewfaq.org/moshiach.htm  http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm  http://www.aish.com/literacy/concepts/Jo...|`|RrnMRJ2Laa	idk  idk  idk  idk  idk  idk|`|AQ74jcKEaa	Both religions believe in the same God of the Bible.    Differ on afterlife.    Sabbath Day is observed on Sunday for Christians.    Both hold Jerusalem as their Holy City.    Prayer, duties of helps and spreading the Gospel, are duties for Christians|`|6TuyXuJRaa	1. same  2. Judaism had many beliefs about the after life. from nothing to reincarnation. Protestants have one. Catholics believe in Purgatory (Dante's Inferno)  3. Christians don't have a Sabbath day  4. Jerusalem  5. Many  6. Love and care|`|1gjWcF4gaa	It is a common misconception that Jews and Christians worship the same God. Christians believe in one God in three distinct persons; the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. In John 14:6 Jesus says "I Am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." Christians see Jesus as the Messiah promised in the Old Testament. Jews do not recognize Jesus and therefore worship a different God.    As for the afterlife, most Christians believe that all believers enter the presence of God immediately after death. As for the Jewish belief, I think it depends on the sect. Many Jews do not believe in an afterlife.     Both religions see Jerusalem  as a holy city, and Roman Catholics also recognize the Vatican. Important life events, well, it depends on the denomination. All Christians recognize the moment of conversion as very important, and most also hold the Baptism in high regard. Catholics follow several sacraments. Off the top of my head I do not know them all. Im not sure enough on life events for Jews to comment.    I hope that helps some. Im no expert, that's for sure.

Secondly, if you are unhappy with something, why not share it on here so maybe other real bisexuals can help you.     Thirdly, find a LAMBDA community center in your area and go to a teen meeting. It may save your life.    Edit:  Nat has a point. My gay therapist could not tell me or anyone in my group that she was gay. I found it out by attending a party with my gf. I was actually asked to leave because it was her birthday party and me being there was a conflict of interest. I was happy to accommodate her feelings and didn't feel offended.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	It is actually illegal to hire some one based on that aspect of his/her life.  Further more, would your Psychiatrist need to be Psychotic to do valid treatment? This is not to be smart.  In the rehab I worked in, the clients would frequently insist that they could only have therapists and techs who were in recovery. and so they shut themselves off from a helping hand mostly because change is uncomfortable.  Don't do that to yourself. we are all in this life and world together, let whatever process you are going through work and enjoy the ride. Our emotions are all really very similar, even if the causes are not.|`|qOZashBYaa	I know how you feel and it does suck when the adults in your life don't act like adults. And I actually have the same problem, except for my parents have been trying to turn me straight since the 8th grade. So if yo hear anything, please IM me or something!|`|MrKawS64aa	I've been to a therapist or two for my share of problems. And as far as I know, the therapist has to keep their personal life separate from work. So they could be gay or straight, but they can't tell you that. You're best bet is to tell them that you want someone who you feel comfortable with, that is completely understandable. You could let them know that you want someone who is younger and sane. And you shouldn't have to worry about them changing your sexuality because as a therapist they have to remain somewhat unbiased on certain topics (esp. sexuality). Good luck, I hope things work out.|`|P2kL3apWaa	Have you thought about calling the GLBT youth hot-line they may be able to put you in touch with someone in your area who can help you.    Other than that contact your local pflag they may be able to offer suggestions.    If your parents know that you are dealing with depression related to sexual identity having them request a counselor with these stipulations may help.  If your parents have insurance get them to talk to the insurance company.  Therapists will list what they specialize in.
i0WQzVDZaa	Well depending where you live if you have a fav place to eat. Why don't you and a group of friends all go out for supper and later have a party.

Good luck.|`|IFs6MWDJaa	Well they may wounder what you got delivered..    but places who sale them things are very Private about the Shipping.

If that isn't an option and your at least 18 go to your local adult store and buy it there ( if they sell the item).     Buying adult toys on line is very risky as you don't get a chance to test it and make sure it works like in most the stores who will allow you to open the item and make sure it will work before you leave the store.     IF you do buy it make sure you use a credit card and chk the sellers policy on returns if it doesn't work.|`|ea2StqNhaa	Well, if you are worried about your parents finding out then you are probably not in the right age range to be looking at these "objects". My suggestion is that you hold off for a while and learn how to experience what you have to offer yourself.
OilzDxs2aa	1) "Keinder" doesn't mean anything. Either you mean "Kinder" (child), or "Keiner" (none)    2) HABEN - to have  "ich habe" - I have  "du hast" - you have  "sie/er/es hat" - she/he it has  "wir/Sie/sie haben - we/you (formal)/they have  "ihr habt" - you (plural) have    3) H?REN - to hear  "Ich h?re" I hear   "du h?rst" - you hear  "er/sie/es h?rt - he/she/it hears   "wir/Sie/sie h?ren" - we/you (formal)/ they hear  "ihr h?rt" - you (plural) hear    4) SEHEN - to see  "Ich sehe" I see  "du siehst" - you see  "er/sie/es sieht - he/she/it sees  "wir/Sie/sie sehen" - we/you (formal)/ they see  "ihr seht" - you (plural) see    For more information and help on German:  http://german.about.com/    For German pronunciation:  http://virtualfrenchtutor.com/site.php/s...

6701f7106e5be82f05306047c5a9c5e8aa	Sounds good to me.  rennen = to run, to race    rennen is a mixed verb and plural.  It is regular in all its present tense forms.    ich renne  du rennst  er/sie/es rennt  wir rennen  ihr rennt  sie rennen|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Close but not quite right.      The young girl eats the sweets and the boy reads the book. The girls cry, but the boy smiles and works in the building. I sit not on the throne. The boy runs and plays, but the men work.|`|CiMaltLBaa	Das junge M?dchen ist das Essen und die S?igkeiten der Junge liest das Buch. Das M?dchen weint, aber der Junge l?chelt und Arbeiten in dem Geb?ude. Ich bin nicht auf dem Stuhl sitzen. Ich stehe.

IJZZkDUvaa	Of course they are still valid today!    People are people and no matter how much we think we may have changed in the intervening millenia, we still have the same emotions, feelings, urges, and problems that people in the ancient world had.    I recommend reading Aesop's fables to people, as they are great, short morality tales that teach important lessons. I think that they should be taught in public schools, and in many cases they already are. (They are also a great way to teach/learn Latin!)
3qqvFEsHaa	Whoever said that probably is not very intelligent.  An atheist is just someone who doesnt believe in a god.

However your previous question suggests that you are not open to hearing other points of view.  Atheism, whether you like it or not, is a valid item for discussion on a religious board.  If you want to come to a place like this and only speak to "like minded" people then what is the point?  What are you afraid of?|`|LsJqpTWsaa	I think what they meant was an atheist bigot.
4sh2oRR7aa	I agree 110%! Granted America does not have an "official" language but everything is in English. Anywhere else in the world, Americans would have learn the language of the area and with less resources. America has resources for EVERY language speaker to learn English. If you're an Arabic speaker in Korea, you're not going to have a lot of resources. In America, you can go to free English classes. America is an English speaking country and I shouldn't have to make my life more complicated by having to deal with people who don't bother to learn how to say hello in English. Even people like cashiers at Wal-Mart have to suffer if they don't speak anything but English. You know how hard it is to do a business transaction if the people don't speak the same language? The same thing goes on in the UK as well.|`|Ux9lRTaSaa	I agree.  When I moved here from Germany, should I have expected Americans to learn German so they could communicate with me?  No, I should learn English, it's the language spoken.    I think the problem is that people just let it go.  When my dad went to Miami he only spoke  English(aside from his friends) a couple of times, and they were tourists.|`|HUSFy3i5aa	Because the US does not have a legally defined official language.|`|281f6e86bdcd64de98851a9e758ddb76aa	English is one of the hardest languages to learn because it constantly changes including the slang and people adding GARBAGE to the dictionary doesn't make it easier and neither does the various dialects.    Too, two, and to? I know english speakers who screw that up lol|`|AA12018110	It's like that over here in the UK as well. But our government lets anybody come here without learning English, after all just about everything is translated into at least 15 different languages. Just to get decent service over here you have to speak one of those 15 languages. Yet I can't complain otherwise I'd be "racist".|`|WDUYSViWaa	if you moved to mexico you would still be in america.The citizens of the United States do not own the title of American. America is not a country,the United States are and North America is a continent.|`|StRaKUf6aa	Because English isn't technically our official language, therefore they are not forced to learn it.  Of course the smart ones realize that if they want to get anywhere in this country they need to know the language.    On the other hand, I also don't see why we can't learn Spanish.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	Honestlly, english is spoken in just about every country. We can go to another country not knowing a lick of the official language and get by, because everyone speaks english. They sometimes find it offensive as well. Americans go to other countries all the time not knowing their language. I lived in Germany, ( I was younger) but i remember that was a huge mockery to them, that people 'expected' them to speak english to us, when they were in Germany. But, think abou it...most American-born people only know english. When you look at like that, we can be more understanding.|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Because learning a second language isn't as easy as people who complain like to think it is.  Besides, if its Mexicans you're referring to, the jobs they get and the places they live are predominately hispanic   anyway.  Not to mention the fact that they are BY FAR the hardest working people in the U.S, so when would they have time to learn a different language?  If I you moved to an American neighborhood in Mexico, and most of your neighbors were American or at least English-speaking Mexicans, along with most of the people you work with and for, i doubt you would stress learning to speak spanish fluently.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	immigrants run america and britain.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	You don't have to learn another language to move to another country. There are thousands of retired North Americans living in Mexico and Costa Rica who don't speak Spanish.  Why don't you do something positive, like volunteer to help new immigrants learn English? Also, it is none of your business what language somebody else speaks if they are not talking to you. Get over yourself.|`|2g8m8USQaa	I agree and disagree.    Yes, I think people should learn the language of whatever country they reside in, whether they are native or not. However, English is spoken in nearly every country world wide.    People that move here from foreign countries tend to stick with their own kind, making it easier to continue speaking their native language. At the same time, in order to effectively communicate with the people of said country, they should make an attempt to learn that language as a second language.     It's not just Spanish...it's languages from all over...German, Swedish, Pakistani, Hebrew, Iraqi and on down the line. The same goes for us...if we were to move from the US to another country, we should make every attempt to learn their language.    It goes both ways.    EMT|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	It's NOT OK in my book.  I don't understand it either.  Unfortunately, our government has enabled people like this; they don't really have to learn.|`|Onzxe6ysaa	I agree, but you also gotta think, the country will cater to the majority of the people. There are sooooo many spanish people coming here that eventually they will be the majority. We might have to learn Spanish!|`|vl0TnEjRaa	It drives me crazy! People want to move to America and get all the perks that come with living in such a great country but they are too lazy to pick up an English dictionary|`|cd750eea4217ae61281dfe63b451de8eaa	Your question is not controversial.  It does, however disregard the depth of the issue.  It ignores the fact that some of these people, though certainly not all are trying to learn what is one of the most difficult languages to learn.  It also fails to acknowledge the fact that many of these folks are illegals and do not trust programs which offer to teach them our language, even those which assure them they will not be reported.  Many of these people either do not learn it or begin to learn the language from other who have only the most basic knowledge of it.    I agree immigrants need to learn the language of their host country.  It must be realized though that this is a complicated problem which cannot be resolved with a simplistic approach of 'they just need to do it'.

ca8edf2a66d3abd8c642d9f347f4b0b0aa	I think people need to be exposed to disabilities from an early age before they can form thoughts about this. As the children grow they can learn how to act.    We need integrated day care, preschool, and elementary middle and High schools with well trained and caring teachers that will teach tolerance. We also need parents that aren't going to talk or act mean towards people with disabilities but instead are going to show respect, kindness love towards them.     I think it starts at home and carries on from there.    Until then, I hate to say it but what comes around goes around.|`|037b3afb94b00bdfef7a62639de1add1aa	My mom is completely blind and some people are astounded that she took care of 3 kids while my dad was at work, cooked, cleaned, changed diapers...I swear the only thing she cant do is drive!!   She is amazing and went back to college when we were little and now she is a gifted teacher.    When I see blind people sitting back on disabilty, helpless and thinking they cant do anything I get angry. Because my mom, and quite a few of her also blind friends, have made successes in their lives and did just fine!!   It also makes me angry when people stare.

I have slight paralysis on my right side from a broken neck and although mine is not nearly as much as some peoples and is easier to deal with than many it sucks honestly.

I was left by a girl that spent several years with me but ultimately left because of my physical situation even though she admitted that she was happier with me than any other time in her life she wanted to know as we broke up why our sex life was so awesome and other things that made our relationship so great but wanted to leave this was almost 2 years ago and I am still far from over it and of course single still!

I feel this and the things disable folks deal with are just more obstacles that are put up for people that do not need any further difficulty in life I am well educated with a degree and certifications and I am very smart although I cannot seem to get a job and yes I am a great interview and know that I have not gotten several jobs because of my disability even let go because of it there seems to be no end in site for the disabled in my lifetime I can see. I have tried I am not making any of this up I really wish it was not true but it is an unfortunate fact I and many others deal with. You cannot legislate morality people are going to have to learn yes be better educated about disabilities maybe having so many soldiers with disabilities coming back from the wars will make people see that we are everyone and should not be made fun of because we have an unfortunate circumstance physically or mentally but treated with respect and dignity that any one else should receive until they do something to lose that respect like make fun of someone less fortunate how is that even considered funny?|`|cr2KKT6Naa	first off you say you thought they were funny. now at the end of your questions. you dont think its funny.you just need to work on yourself.|`|QJT5JXf2aa	In my opinion it's not propaganda or entertainment, it's a sick and inhumane attempt at humor.    I'm physically disabled and while I am lucky in that most people can't see my actual disability, they do see a side effect of it: my weight. I am extremely overweight and people who don't know me assume it is because I am lazy, eat too much, etc.     They don't know I have not one but two of the major disorders that cause clinical obesity and that as a result my spine is being crushed. Or that my family is predisposed to spinal deterioration so on top of it all, my spine is literally destroying itself. They don't know the pain I am in every day just trying to stand up or walk or any other activity. And that even though I hurt just breathing most of the time, I still am trying to go to college and be a productive citizen.     They have no idea. They point, they laugh. Little children "whisper" to their parents about "that huge lady". Instead of telling their children "That's unkind, you shouldn't judge people, you don't know their story." They simply say "Shh, that's not nice."    The problem is that people don't educate their children to have humility and compassion, therefore we are in a society that thinks it's fun to laugh at those who are different. The best thing you can do to educate these people is to confront them and tell them about the hardships that disabled people face every day, and yet overcome to lead full, wonderful lives. Show them that disabled people are not just "cripples", but PEOPLE first and foremost.    Good luck. It's a hard road to walk to educate the masses, but someday people will have humility again, I hope.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I had a man kick my cane out from under my at a rodeo.

WftXtCcWaa	Halahen: Salam is arabic for [submission]. There is no word in arabic for [peace]. Please, stop with all of the misinformation.  ---------------------------------  A question very similar to this was asked about 30 minutes ago, go back and read my answer to that one. It's a pretty long answer.     Islam is not a religion of peace. The Qur'an clearly states that [all] good Muslims will wage a holy jihad against all kaffirs [us]. It's their job to convert everyone to Islam. Those who refuse to convert are to have their heads cut off. However, as of this past Christmas they've added a new one, Christians are now to be [crucified].     Their is no such thing as a radical Muslim. They are simply following their Qur'an as it is written. Think about it. Were those Muslims who wanted to kill that teacher over the teddy bear, terrorist? No, they weren't.     A "religion of peace" means in my own opinion what Jesus taught. What is what a true Christian is supposed to be. And each and everyone of us falls short of that. I'm not perfect, not in my eyes and certainly not in Gods. I've got way too many faults.     I feel that if most Muslims were really [peaceful] and against the terrorist, then they'd standup and be heard. They're are supposed to be more of the good ones than there are of the bad ones, right? So then, why aren't the good ones speaking up? And don't give me that, "they're afraid". I just don't buy that. Because myself? I'm more than willing to stand up and be heard.|`|X5gmVvMDaa	Islam is a religion of peace!!! If you really knew anything about our religion and would actually read you would see that..    Ok as for the Teddy bear, cartoon? do you westerners not know when   to stop? you complain that Islam isn't a religion of peace when you people go and slander our religion you make fun of our prophet,draw insulting cartoons, name a stupid bear its common sense to not do that and know it would offend people. does christianity say to go and do this?  You guys are critizing the same God that created you.    our religion in Islam forbids us to do such things like that! it is against our religion to kill innocent people,or to mock other peoples religion. If someone is going to Insult our Creator or our prophets do you expect us to be silent? what you guys are doing is wrong!!!    Violence is against our religion but if someone is going to keep provoking then don't expect us to be nice!         If someone talks badly of your mother are you going to not act violently? No u will defend her honor.... and kick who's ever rear that said something that is not right! and correct the wrong things they think and tell them the truth!      There where some Jews when they would see the   The prophet Muhammad (pbuh)  they would say Asam Alykum which means (may death be upon you) and our prophet didn't get angry and would reply wa Alykum which means (and upon you also).    he didn't do anything but stay calm and he said Gentleness only beautifies What use is harshness where will it get you?    Our prophet was a peaceful and loving generous man!|`|tGf5jTqYaa	I AM TOLD THAT THE KORAN STATES THAT ANYONE WHO DOES NOT CONVERT TO THE PRACTICE OF ISLAM/MUSLIM IS AN INFIDEL AND MUST BE PUT TO DEATH...HENCE, THE CUTTING OFF OF THE HEADS OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS IN IRAQ.

The word "Islam" is closely related to the word "salam or silm" which means peace. Muhammad, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, himself had a very peaceful nature, was extremely tolerant, and highly protective of the non-Muslim minorities living in the Muslim state.    However, there are times when states find war inevitable, but Islam only permits war in specific and dire circumstances. It keeps warfare at a level of mercy and respect for the enemy that no other army has been able to reach. The Prophet sometimes had to fight for the mere survival of his people and message, but once their security was ensured, he immediately reverted to peace and diplomacy.    There is a rigid code Muslims must abide by in deciding when they can fight and how the fighting should be conducted. War itself is despised, and is only a last-resort option when all other attempts at peace have been made.    A Muslim is never allowed to initiate hostilities. "And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but transgress not the limits. Surely, Allah likes not the transgressors." [2: 190].    The only times in which believers are allowed to take up arms are when they are defending their own lives and the lives of their people, when they see the weak being oppressed in acts of tyranny, and when they are prohibited from practicing their religion:    "And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers." [2: 191].    "They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso be cometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter, Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein," [2:217].    Aside from these circumstances, there is no legitimate fighting in Islam.    The conditions placed upon the soldier in battle are of utmost respect for the enemy and for human life. Islam makes a clear distinction between combatants and noncombatants, forbidding soldiers to harm defenseless civilian in any way. The Prophet said: "Do not kill the women, children, aged or the ill." He also prohibited Muslims from harming monks in their monasteries or hermits in their caves. Cutting down trees, destroying livestock, wells, homes or land of the enemy is likewise forbidden. Upon seeing the corpse of a woman in a battlefield, Prophet Muhammad asked his companions why she had been killed, and condemned it.    There is no excuse for any expedition or attack resulting in the killing of civilians, no one has the right to take innocent lives.    For those enemies active in combat and those taken prisoner of war, the list of rights is lengthy. There is no torture, no killing of the wounded or defenseless, and the return of corpses to the enemy is honored. There is no mutilation of the enemy bodies. Even after Hind bint Utbah, a powerful lady of Makkah, chewed the liver of the Prophet's uncle, Hamzah, after he was killed in a battle between Muhammad and her non-Muslim people, Muhammad still forbade his men from disrespecting a creation of God in such a way    The Prophet commanded the believers to treat the prisoners of war with kindness. One prisoner by the name of Abu Aziz told how surprised he was to see the Muslims giving the better part of their meal-the bread-to the prisoners while they themselves just had dates. "Not a crumb of bread would fall into their hands without them giving it to me," he narrated, "and I would be so embarrassed that I would reject it. But then they would return it back to me."    The Qur'an lays down strict guidelines for the declaration of war by a Muslim army, and Muslims are prohibited from breaching any treaty to which they have agreed.  "If you fear treachery from any people throw back (their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms (that there will be no more covenant between you and them), Certainly Allah likes not the treacherous. [8:58].    The extent of the Prophet's mercy can be seen in the Muslim conquest of Makkah, which happened towards the end of his life. The Makkan tribe of Quraish had blatantly violated the significant "Treaty of Hudaybiyya" by supplying men and arms in an effort to attack a Muslim-allied tribe. They had slaughtered ruthlessly, even killing inside the Holy Sanctuary, and knew they could expect retaliation for such a weighty crime.|`|tPwihMCaaa	Just a thank you note for stating only a few Muslims - very few are terrorists.

In other words, people are joining with the Saints throughout the world.    Your biased labeling and name calling probably will have little or no effect.  It will be, as Christ spoke, "A kicking against the pricks"   See Acts 26: 14    14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	It is silly of you to ask such an ignorant question.  There are over 13 million members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Admittedly, probably less than half could be considered active, but that does not diminish the reality of the the church's existence as a viable world-wide Christian religion.    Just because we do not agree on certain points of doctrine does not negate the many other agreeable points of doctrine.  Jesus is the Christ.  He is the Son of God who atoned for our sins so that we might be redeemed from physical and spiritual death.  He calls upon all men and women to repent and follow Him that we might be joint heirs with Him in the Father's Kingdom.  We partake of the sacrament of the Lord's supper on a weekly basis to remember and renew our baptismal promise to keep His commandments.  We pray to the Father, in the name of Christ on a daily basis for blessings that we may need and to thank Him for blessings we have received.  Those and many more points are agreeable to all Christians.    Those of us that belong to the LDS faith desire that the rest of Christianity would display a bit more Christian behavior and embrace that which is good by loving their neighbors as themselves.  We are your neighbors and you are ours.|`|NxPPdCSjaa	Oh it is recognized already!

It is much more intelligent than it appears.  That is due to the way you cleverly disguised it with a cunning mask of schoolboy humour.  I suppose that was to throw everyone into confusion, eh?     It is a fact that every religious faith, sect, or denomination has beliefs and practices that are silly to outsiders.     A few examples:    1.  One faith separates the men from the women, the men downstairs and the women in a gallery for religious services, and the men have to cover their heads and some of them wear paper hats, others sport sombre homburgs, yet others a small cap that covers the occipital protuberance.  Married women must cover their hair.    2.  Another faith has some people dressed in clothing made in the style of the Mediaeval Roman Magisteria, some of the men actually wear frocks, and there is much lighting of waxy rods, incantations, burning incense, and chanting.    3.  If you visited another place you might be surprised to see men and women, and children sitting around on old wooden benches in absolute silence that is broken only by the ticking of the big wall clock.  Now and again someone is moved by the spirit to say something.  This can go on for hours.    4.  In a small chapel somewhere each Sunday in many towns and cities, congregations gather and are led by a leader.  The leader accepts small objects from each person in turn and after what appears to be some serious contemplation announces something intended to be revealing and pertinent to the person to whom the article belongs.  That person is not necessarily the person handing the article to the psychometrist.    5.  In another place the congregation pours in through the doors and greet and are greeted by, their friends that worship together each holy day.  The pastor rises to inform the congregation of the hymn they will sing together, and is followed by a freely expressed prayer made to God, invoking the name of Jesus.  These people evidently believe that Jesus the Jewish teacher is connected with getting them into heaven when they die, and this will astound you, they actually believe that when he was dead and buried he came back to life, and that, later, he was assumed, corporeally, into heaven to be with God.  They also think that at some time he will come down from heaven and sort the wheat from the chaff.    Now, these are but five examples, although I could cite many more gatherings of believers, worshippers, faithful - call them what you will - whose religious antics, dress, customs, rites, practices, symbols, and faithspeak attracts the opprobrious and pejorative term "Silly Cult" from those having no understanding of the meaning, power, or worth of religion, spirituality, liturgies, symbolisms, prayer, devotion, and all those other "silly" things that every single expression of religious belief has.    "Silly" - like "beauty" - is in the eye of the beholder, and especially in the eye of the ignorant beholder who thinks he knows what he sees and hears, but is misled because he fails to honestly and open mindedly investigate to learn about the nature of religious faith, its observances, and its essential value to the devout in steering them through the maze of disappointments, tragedies, and heartaches that typify the human condition.    It is proper that when we speak of someone else's faith we do so with respect, even when we do not comprehend, and even when we think it is silly.      For you information, 'cult' is a very proper English word used to describe any faith, denomination, sect, movement, & so forth.      It is derived from the Latin 'cultus' that has no darker meaning than a common noun used to describe any system of philosophy, thought, belief, practice, custom, and, of course 'cult'ure, a word very close to its origin.     It is a tragedy that pseudo shcolars and - in some cases - pseudochristians have hihacked the word from its normal place and applied to it a pejorative meaning that removes it original value, making it nothing more than a curse word in the mouths of Christians that are long on hatred and short of love.      I thank you for your question, and I am happy to answer it for you.    QUILL      Some other definition wrested from their opriginal meanings by the cynical:    FORK:  An instrument chiefly used for putting dead animals into one's mouth.    VIOLIN MUSIC: Horsehair scraping on Catgut.     BRUTE:  See 'Husband'.    HUSBAND: See 'Brute'.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Too late.

Was it something that someone else said about the church or from your own personal experience?  I would bet it was from here-say that you have established your perception of the church.  Why not find out for yourself?      How?  First come and see what a Mormon church meeting is really like.  Analyze it for yourself.  Next talk and get to know some Mormons.  Not just one, but several.  Men, women, youth. Next read the account of Joseph Smith in his own words.  You can do so by clicking on this link:  http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1      Finally, have the courage to read the Book of Mormon with an open mind and heart.  If you do these things then you can judge with some sense of fairness, not before.    Have you ever considered the motives of those who put down our religion?  You should!  To consider their motives and not take them for face value is the mature and rational way of thinking about things.    By the way, 14 million people who are not forced to think and feel how someone else tells them to is not a cult.  Those who are Mormon or LDS choose to be members.  They have complete freedom, and are even urged to find out for themselves if the church is the church of Jesus Christ or not by asking God in prayer.|`|q0gRmHlUaa	Personally, I hope that one day all Christianity will be recognized as the silly cult it really is!|`|KcHhLsCAaa	The 15 million members think they are real.|`|PKWHLbdfaa	LDS leaders show signs of coming closer to Biblical Christianity, but they do so without integrity.  Rather than admitting past doctrinal errors, they simply start teaching something else and relegate weird doctrines like...God was once a man...to opinion.      Here's the short list of key doctrines that would help the LDS church not only be recognized as a legitimate Christian religion, but would help their members move out of spiritual arrogance to a much healthier place.    Belief 1: God is unchangable.  He didn't start out as an intelligence and grow to be a God, but always was.  He isn't capable of sin.  He is love.  He is goodness.  And he's not an exalted man in yonder heavens.    Belief 2: Jesus is the human manifestation of God in the flesh.  When Paul said that in Jesus dwells the fullness of God, he meant that if you could put God in a body, it would be Jesus.  Again, Jesus isn't the firstborn spirit to Elohim, and exalted man, but God.    Belief 3: Accept Jesus's sacrifice as payment for sins.  Believing and trusting in Jesus is how we put on the righteousness of Christ and become justified before God.  No ritual necessary.  When D&C 84 says that only through ordinances does the power of Godliness come to men, reject that and instead adopt the Biblical concept that those who believe are saved...now.    Belief 4: Your prophets are nice guys who got it right sometimes, get it wrong often, are very fallible, are doing the best they can, but they don't speak for God and have no role in dealing with sin other than administering church discipline in a way that restores people to spiritual wholeness rather than pretending that church membership equals anything of salvational value.  Again, look to Jesus and the Bible for authority, not historically shakey stories of angels visiting Joseph and Oliver to give them authority.    Belief 5: Additional scripture to the Bible isn't bad per se, but the bar for accepting it as real scripture just isn't anywhere close to being met.  Seriously, the Book of Mormon has some deep problems doctrinally, historically, and archeologically to overcome.  The D&C teaches doctrine that no Christian can accept such as obedience to a law brings the blessing from God.  That's not NT teachings.  And the P of GP...folks the papyrus used for the Abraham translation are pagan funeral scripts.  Joseph lied about them.  And speaking of which, his testimony of his first vision hasn't any historical validation, not to mention multiple versions that contradict each other.  He made up the story.

The question is, is it a construct of our brain, or is our brain mainly a means of interpretation for consciousness that may be pervasive throughout the entire universe?    There is no proof that the brain actually "manufactures" consciousness.  It could be argued the other way.   The brain stores memories, true, but there is no scientific way to actually isolate consciousness, therefore it's location remains unclear|`|N3BXYCYUaa	Im not a trendy asshole... do what I want do what I feel like.....don't give a **** if it's good enough for you.... that's where consciousness is|`|wZEGi1EHaa	Consciousness is a word we use to describe a state of awareness experienced by the brain.|`|AA11058044	That's like saying that Windows XP is actually external to my computer, since it had to be put there by a programmer.

You are right that the external is necessary, but it is not itself a component.  Consciousness arises in the brain due to external factors.    Of course, if you want to get really REALLY technical, since there's no clear molecular boundary between where the person starts and ends, one could argue that you ARE the environment and thus don't exist at all.  It's a somewhat deterministic view of course, but completely viable.|`|cUYunFvHaa	i think their are different stages of conciouseness, from the orginazation of enzymes and molecules to create the body and organize the disposition of protien strands in the moments of conception/ building of the hman body from embryo to full baby, the same essence of conciousenes that makes the body heal and thoughts arrive, then theres the organization of these thoughts in a more"tangible" concept of the mind, and what that entails.....storing of memories/events from years and years, weather they be real or imagined, reality or dillusions of, so i'd say that every cell is a microcosm of the macrocosm of our essence and that our conciouseness is a flowing energy, that reverberates throughout the body on such a frequency that its impossible to see or calculate, like trying to see x-rays or gamma rays with ur naked eyes, but the thing im thinking ur thinkijng about it the act of displaying this conciousenes by acting, and interacting, because even a brain dead person will flinch when burned, so its the microcosm essence/conciouseness in the cells /nervouse sysytem that is still preseant but its lost the macro-conciouseness, the interaction of the entire system of its body|`|5aTGdBNuaa	I think the brain is merely the 'processor', with some genetically determined 'rules' for how to process data, corresponding to the way human brains are 'wired'. Take someone out of a sensory deprivation tank after 18 years and their brain will immediately start to process data from their eyes, ears, nose, skin, etc. Even they will therefore have a rudimentary consciousness. But the person who has been living in the world for 18 years will have processed much more data and made connections that give them a much greater degree of self awareness and understanding of the world around them. In short consciousness exists in the brain but the sophistication of that consciousness depends on how much data has been processed|`|tUq6qU3Naa	Consciousness is a state of being aware or awake.  There is a 'switch' in the brain which flips on or off for unknown reasons.  When we go to sleep, it is an instant flip of the switch off for awareness and the brain has sensory interrupt while asleep.  Perhaps you are referring to a 'conscience', which would be a state of mind concerned with ethics and morals.  Standards of behavior that we develop from our parents, and clergy and from our own life experiences.  It is connected with the emotions such as feeling sorry for another.  It is developed out of a need to make a society function somewhat smoothly.  The 'fairness' doctrine, the Christian ethic of 'do unto others as you would have them do to you'.  Many younger people are often said 'they have no conscience'  and are brutal to others  Gang members kill non-members in 'cold blood' as though they have 'no conscience'.  Animals have no 'conscience'.  It is a trait that separates most humans from animals.  Terrorists have 'no conscience' when they blow up people they do not even know, and cause terrible suffering.    It appears that humans are capable of having a 'conscience', but it must be developed by each individual under so called 'peer pressure'.|`|UqgCazhGaa	The symptom of consciousness is the soul.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 2.29    Contents of the Gita Summarized                                     ascarya-vat pasyati kascid enam                  ascarya-vad vadati tathaiva canyah                   ascarya-vac cainam anyah srnoti                  srutvapy enam veda na caiva kascit                               TRANSLATION     Some look at the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some hear of him as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand him at all.                                 PURPORT     Since Gitopanisad is largely based on the principles of the Upanisads, it is not surprising to also find this passage in the Katha Upanisad.                    sravanayapi bahubhir yo na labhyah                  srnvanto 'pi bahavo yam na vidyuh                   ascaryo vakta kusalo 'sya labdha                  ascaryo 'sya jnata kusalanusistah       The fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, in the body of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, millions and billions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly very amazing. Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahma, the first living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.     Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions, relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one's life is successful. The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gita spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Krsna, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krsna can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.    Bg 2.17 P         Contents of the Gita Summarized     This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one's own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul's presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The Svetasvatara Upanisad confirms this:      balagra-sata-bhagasya satadha kalpitasya ca    bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate       "When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul." (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in the Bhagavatam the same version is stated:      kesagra-sata-bhagasya satamsah sadrsatmakah    jivah suksma-svarupo 'yam sankhyatito hi cit-kanah       "There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair."       Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mundaka Upanisad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:                      eso 'nur atma cetasa veditavyo             |`|2FA9qNHzaa	It would be best to describe it in the Hindu culture, The third eye is depicted and even worn as a symbol of such.

9Q6CkSMzaa	First off, I have a lot of respect for you, for the simply fact that you're not blindly following people. You've actually developed a way to think for yourself.    As for my religion, I'm Hellenic Polytheistic. Well, in case you don't know what that is, I believe that "Greek Mythology" is real.    Well, for one, I don't believe in these monotheistic religions, which worship one God. It just seems unrealistic to me. Prior to the development of Zoroastrianism, the first actual monotheistic religion, EVERYONE was polytheistic (believing in multiple gods). The thought of only one all-powerful God just seems so unrealistic to me. On top of that, the Greek beliefs were one of the first in recorded history.     Greek philosophers are still quoted in today's times. The Pythagorean Theorem. Named so because of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras. The Greeks were the first ones to have an organized theater. The Olympics. Boxing, fighting, World Wrestling Entertainment--they are modernized versions of the duels and fights that were common within Greek arenas. All of these things, the Greeks gave to us.     Not too long ago I read an article about a tool for telling time, that the Greeks created. It mapped out the years, the cycles of the moon, etc., and such a complex machinery had not been seen until hundreds of years later. The Greeks were incredibly advanced, yet people don't think that they got their Gods and religion right?    On top of that, the Greeks did not have a name for religion. They just believed. They believed what they knew to be fact.     The Big Bang Theory also, in it's own little way, supports the Greek story of creation. In the beginning of time, the universe was nothing but this big, black abyss--Chaos. Out of Chaos was born Gaia, or Mother Earth. Then Gaia, without help from a male, produced the sky. Gaia also gave birth to the Gods, and Titans, and other forms of life.    The Big Bang Theory: the universe originated from the cataclysmic explosion of a small volume of matter at extremely high density and temperature    When you think about it, the two DO seem similar. Much more similar than some almighty God decided that he wanted to create life, and did so with the snap of his fingers. In both stories of creation, the Greeks and the Big Bang, the world started out as basically this dark abyss, then the world and the universe was formed.     Now, on a more personal level, I believe that each of the Gods have helped me in some way, I'm sure. But personally, I am thankful to four main deities. Apollo, God of the sun. Although he is known as the God of the sun, he is also the god of creativity, and even "inner-light". I believe that he has guided me with this inner-light, and has granted me the gift of creativitiy.  Athena, Goddess of Wisdom and Warfare. I am one who seeks knowledge, who thinks that you can never learn too much. I strive to be wise. Athena, I feel, has helped to give me such wisdom and knowledge, and I am forever both indebted to her, and will continue to strive for her wisdom.  Artemis, Goddess of the Moon and the Hunt. She is also one who is known for protecting women, especially young girls. I feel she has helped me find inner strength, and some other reasons that I won't get into.  Aphrodite, Goddess of Love. I have been given the ability to love. To be compassionate. I have been blessed enough to have been able to love someone with a love so pure, words can not explain it. Although that love didn't last, what I have learned from that leaves me forever indebted to Aphrodite.     Well, I hope that answers your question as thorougly as I can. If you have any more, I would be happy to talk some more. lol|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Catholic Christianity.

For a team to win 89 games and only finish 3 games behind the World Champs has to make you think what could have been possible if there bullpen wasn't like the worst in baseball.    Of course though, you can't change the past. All you can do is look foward to the past. If I could go back in the past though, I'd convince Hitler and Stalin's parents to not have kids, because millions of people wouldn't die. Lots of others will probably think that, now that I mentioned that lol
hHjPFxEdaa	I don't think it's easier on either gender really. If you're not on the same page it can really mess up a friendship. I know more females who have had the problem of a guy friend wanting to be more and her just wanting to stay friends. It's happened to me and it was really awkward because I didn't want to risk our friendship in case it didn't work out and yet I didn't want to hurt him by saying no either and lose his friendship anyway. I had to walk a verbal tightrope to let him down easy and still stay friends.    I've also known girls who had strong feelings for a guy friend and he didn't feel the same. It's not easy for either to go out on that limb and make the first move but if you just flirt a little and see if the friend flirts back that will give you some idea if you should try it.|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	Depends on how attractive they are.|`|da4zS4AOaa	I think women.

Therefore in the Bible it says let the wicked continue their wicked ways and let the righteous be righteous.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	God has provided adequate evidence.  Some people freely refuse to accept that evidence.     In eternity,  Jesus will be ruler of all that is.  The people who accept Jesus will freely accept His Kingship.  Being ruled by Jesus will not be a violation of those people's free will.  They will be ruled by The King to whom they have freely chosen to submit.    The people who reject Jesus will be condemned to spend eternity separated from God.  That will be the consequence of their own free choice.  If people choose to reject God, God will leave them to spend eternity separated from Him, as they have chosen to be.    The choice is a difficult one for many people, but it is not a contradiction or paradox.    I pray that all of God's creation will be reconciled to Him in Eternity.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	I once lacked accurate knowledge also, but you can gain accurate knowledge that leads to everlasting life too.    James 1: 12 - 15    Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving him. When under trial, let no one say: I am being tried by God. For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.   ------------------------    2 Peter 3: 8 - 10    "However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with GOD as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. GOD is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Yet GOD'S day will come as a thief..."  -----------------------    Psalms 37: 8 - 11:    Let anger alone and leave rage; Do not show yourself heated up only to do evil. ?For evildoers themselves will be cut off, But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace  --------------------------    1 Corinthians 6: 9 - 11:    What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit Gods kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit Gods kingdom. And yet that is what some of YOU were.  -------------------------------    Free will is your choice, however there are consequences when we make the wrong choice. Jehovah God is a loving, very merciful God. My goodness, just look at the patience he has had with us all throughout history, but now we are near the end of this wicked system of things and soon there will be judgment. Some adjudged to death and some with everlasting life on a paradise earth free from illness, sickness, sin and the last sin to be removed is death.    Where will you be? What choice will you make?     Something to think about...|`|pMA4xoVEaa	Everybody has or should have freewill.All Jesus is saying ''hey you out there it seems that you are going under let me give you a hand and save you'' now it is up to you to take it or not .That is freewill.|`|QQbBM77Jaa	You have free will to believe and live to worship and honor the Lord for all eternity or to not believe.

1HfLkTrdaa	No, Portuguese is not considered Hispanic.  Those are two separate and distinct cultures.    People of Spanish and Portuguese descent who are born on the Iberian peninsula are usually, but not always, considered white Europeans.      The term Hispanic generally refers to anything pertaining to Spain and the countries Spain colonized in the Americas and elsewhere...or where the Spanish had an influence.    Lusophone or Lusophonic is the term used for anything pertaining to the serious study of Portuguese life and culture whether in Portugal or anywhere else in the world where Portugual has a colony or influence.  Lusitania is the ancient name for Portugal.  It's not a term you hear outside of academia much.  I know the term because I majored in Latin American and Caribbean studies in university...so one runs across it in those studies quite a lot.    Like others said here, Hispanic can be of any race, according to how the US Government and most academics define Hispanic.      In a sense, anyone in the Portuguese Diaspora can also be of any race, too.  For example, people from Brazil, Mozambique, Cape Verde Islands are black in appearance and ethnicity, but are also of Portuguese Descent.  People from Goa State in India, Macau and East Timor have Asian in them, but they're also Portuguese, too.    EDIT    WHY did I get a thumbs down for trying to give a decent factual answer based on the serious study of those cultures, a culture that lead to a university degree, mind you? I don't appreciate that at all!!!|`|LQQAQDkIaa	The Portuguese shared the Iberian peninsula with the Spaniards. Their language and culture are similar, but they are not the same people. Hispanic means Spain is the root of language and culture, so I think Portuguese are not Hispanic. Pax Christi|`|AA10932291	Then you can let me know why Portuguese women are so rude ????? Recently I met 2 portuguese women (they don't know each other), both so rude and miserable, unhappy. I was wondering what makes them like aggressive dogs.|`|ggTx6IR8aa	The Portuguese are technically Hispanic because Hispanic comes from the Latin word that the Romans used to refer to the Iberian peninsula(modern Portugal and Spain).    By the way Hispanics can be black, white, asian, native american, and everything in between.    For example, the ex-President of Peru was Asian, the President of Mexico is white,the President of Bolivia is Native American and the President of Dominican Republic is black yet they are ALL hispanic.|`|DTYeCKAfaa	People from Brazil are usually from what I've seen considered Latino as they are part of Latin America. However, I haven't noticed the same thing about the Portuguese in Portugal.     Also, the Portuguese language is 90% alike to Spanish.|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	No you are not Hispanic  You are an European    Hispanic people are south americans people who speak SPANISH as their mother language........Brazilians are considered "South americans" but not "Hispanic"....|`|rj5KWEtcaa	both Portuguese people and spanish people are considered white europeans , Spanish people are only thought of as hispanic when they have an American passport i think|`|PM32r1rPaa	The Portuguese are White. They are Southern Europeans, just like Italians...    They are NOT Hispanic.    As for Spaniards, they are White too, but technically Spaniards are "Hispanic" Whites because they speak the Spanish language.|`|GiuuV5YAaa	Sabs got it all right. The Portuguese are not hispanic. No idea why she got 2 thumbs down. Some people just don't know what they are talking about.|`|92iuiuZKaa	I consider them Latin|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	Hispanic (Spanish: hispano, hispnico) is a term that historically denoted relation to the ancient Hispania (geographically coinciding with the Iberian peninsula: modern day Spain and Portugal) or to its pre-Roman peoples.    The term is now used to convey the culture and peoples of countries formerly ruled by Spain, usually with a majority population of Spanish heritage, and usually but not always, speak the Spanish language. These include: Mexico, Central and South America, the Greater Antilles, the Southwestern United States, Florida, the African nations of Equatorial Guinea and Western Sahara, and the northern coastal region of Morocco. A Hispanic culture also exists in the Asia-Pacific nations and territories of the Philippines, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Despite their many similarities, Hispanics do not compose a homogeneous people or culture.      Good luck.  ;-)    -edits-  Hispanic used to refer to HISPANIA (the Iberian penninsula), which is Portugal and Spain.  Do you think people from Spain aren't white caucasian? o.O|`|LhCGU3F1aa	Spaniards are white...|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	NO! Hispanics are they, and only they from latin america. A hispanic person can be of portuguese decent, but a portuguese is not hispanic    Edit:  hispanic is not a race, its a cultural ethnic, the hispanics can be everything from fully white to fully black, many hispanics are mixed white, black and native american.

With such a clean-cut society, prostitution, gambling, drinking and drugs wasn't as profitable as the mobsters wanted it to be. So they began to form "Unions" and used the enticement of a "job" in exchange for political activism. Their biggest opponents were the Churches. Now they had a "Union Congregation" to battle the Churches and loosen the morals of the public by any means they could. They worked to ban censorship and loosen the FCC Regulations to stimulate their audiences with sexual temptations and glorified drug/alcohol use.    Before there was television, it was the radio broadcasting that captured America. The mobsters organized musicians unions and got bands and singers work with their "Play for Pay" schemes with local D.J.'s and radio stations. The Songwriters Union wrote songs of rebellion, sexual permissiveness, obscenity and vulgarities.     Soon AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and SAG (Screen Actor Guild) unions fought the Churches by making movies ridiculing religion and making sexually risque' films so they could tempt more viewers and make MONEY from legal films and illegal prostitution, drugs, and at one time alcohol and tobacco.    Knowing that Republicans took the high moral ground, the unions became politically active as well, therefore the unions or "Democrats" fought the Republican high moral ground by using influential Actors and popular Musicians, songs, TV and Hollywood Unions (Including the NWU National Writers Unions which controlled newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, textbooks, screenplays, comedians, media of all types.    Today the Pay for Play was recently the cause of Blagojevich (Chicago Mayor) being prosecuted by the FBI. He's one of the few that got caught. Judges, Politicans, City Councils etc. are all financed by this massive network of unions that are used to control the money being fed to the mafia. Congress feeds them through earmarks (pork barrel). Judges feed them with their decisions (Roe Vs. Wade), (Eminent Domain) and City Councils the their Gov't projects (Casinos, horse racing, Contractors, Public Works & Transportation, Public Service Announcements (our tax $ given to TV/Hollywood & Actors).    Now, through the teachers unions they have control over our tax dollars and our children. The textbooks they read are hand picked by the Unions, many of which are pro communist atheistst that have been the cause of student protests and degeneracy of morals.    FROM "45 Goals of Communists in America" 1963 (Library of Congress)   MOLD THE MIND OF THE YOUNG AND THEY ARE YOURS!  http://www.rense.com/general32/americ.ht...    5. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.  17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda.  Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.  19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.  20. Infiltrate the press. Gain control of all student newspapers.   21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.  24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them "censorship" and a violation of free speech and free press.  ?25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.  ?26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as "normal, natural, healthy."  ?27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a "religious crutch."  ?28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of "separation of church and state."    As you can see - they have accomplished their goals.  Note: The 40 Techniques of the Illuminati are just as interesting!
AA11690436	Ding Ding Ding.  You are correct.      There is only one Race, the human race.  We all share 99.9% of our genome with one another (however, since the genome is composed of three billion base pairs, that remaining .01% does leave a sufficient three million base pairs for DNA fingerprinting.)    The reason why some Jews, as well as non Jews start thinking of Jewishness as a Race, is the attempts by outside agencies to exterminate Judaism.  When the Nazis knocked on your door, they didn't care how much or how little you practiced the religion. They didn't care if you looked even more Teutonic than Der Fuhrer himself.  All they cared was if your name bore a the faintest whiff of some Jewish Ancestry.  The mid twentieth century abomination being only the largest of many historical attempts, these have left us Jews with something of a siege mentality, which lends itself to a mistaken identification with race vs. family of adherents.    But then again, since the whole notion of race is a)incorrect, and b) has a long history of being used by one "race" of people against some other "race", the sooner we all start to recognize our common humanity, the better we'll all be.|`|AA10043552	Jewish is a word that has two meanings    1.

I know it's confusing for people with weak minds or racist tendencies to grasp the concept of a word having more than one meaning, but life is hard.    Jewish can mean to refer to the race. I'm sorry you don't like it.      ""Jewish has one meaning: Followers of Judaism. That simple."""    I'm sorry... is your last name Oxford? No?

If Judaism is a race, then yes, polydactylism should be a race.    Who doesn't love lots and lots of extra digits?    (though, the concept and existence of race itself is a very contentious subject on its own)|`|AA10067344	Judaism is a religion.  Hebrew is an ethnicity.  The terms and their meanings are nearly interchangeable in today's language.  You are arguing semantics.|`|JCfMLFXgaa	See this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew    I'm not a fan of classifying people as different races, as we're all human and ethnicity counts for nothing, but the term Jew does also have racial connotations.|`|6jkusbCgaa	No, we should not. And, Judaism is not a race either.|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	Polydactylism does not constitute race by standard definition. It has approximately a 10 % higher instance in Blacks than Caucasians but is present in both. The problem with the idea by comparison is that it  occurs in house cats and other animals regularly, and that extends it far beyond the margins of race. Being Jewish does not transcend species as some genetic mutations do.     Hebrew as you stated is a language. It is a subcategory of Semitic Peoples . in language and cultural studies, the term also came to describe the extended cultures and ethnicity's, as well as the history of these varied peoples as associated by close geographic and linguistic distribution  Arabic and Hebrew in particular.    It is easy to see that you are pointing out the fogginess about what it is to be Jewish or to speak Hebrew in the minds of many people and also how language and religion as well as other cultural traits do not constitute race.    It would be better if people understood things before they commented on them. We do not live in a perfect world to be sure, but I think creating more categorical errors due to an existing misunderstanding would be of little value with the exception of analogy such as you have done here. That is supposing I did not misunderstand you :)|`|WynOhlMZaa	What people fail to realize is that the word "race" is meaningless biologically anyway.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	We should consider each of us as belonging to one race: The Human Race.

Or my boyfriend, the Italian Jew?  Or the Iranian Jews?  Or the Ethiopian Jews?    And, Serf, "Hebrew" is not an ethnicity.  If you're referring to Ashkenazim, then say so, but for now you make no sense whatsoever.    I'm not sure I'd want a genetic defect compared to a religion that we have the choice of following or not.  You can't convert to polydalctylism.|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	First of all, scientists no longer use the term "race". In the 1950s many of them realized that the term did not apply to the modern understanding of genetics and the human species.  (Even when they did use the term "race" there were only 3 races).    Second, you are right about Judaism; it is a religion. People who practice Judaism are called "Followers of Judaism" but they are not necessarily Jews (though many are).    Third, Hebrew is the heritage. Scientists use the term "population" to describe a heritage group with specific practices or traditions that make them unique from other population groups. It can be a very flexible word. Someone who is a member of the Hebrew population and/or has Hebrew heritage is not necessarily a Jew either (though many are).    Mainly the problem lies with the usage of the term "Jew". It is often bantered about and used in ways that are not its proper usage; governments, censuses (censusi?), advertisements, etc, sometimes even Jews themselves would misuse the term or fail to get corrected. Add to this that Jews themselves still argue and disagree about when an (used to be an) outsider can actually call themselves a Jew.    The term when properly applied has two different conditions that BOTH must be met otherwise the person is just a follower of Judaism or someone of Hebrew heritage but not a Jew.    1) Jew is someone whos mother is a Jew. it is inherited as a TRADITION through the mothers line. By default that means that they are often of Hebrew heritage and a member of the Hebrew population, but it is a TRADITION not a heritage. (There is some controversy that this may have changed of over time, but this is the current definition).  2) Someone who does not follow any OTHER religion besides Judaism; they do NOT have to actively follow Judaism. In fact they may be an Agnostic or even an Atheist.  They may NOT be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Animist, etc.     Someone can become a Jew, but the details of when they are truly a Jew are still contested between different sects of Judaism.  Progressive Jews often say that the person becomes a Jew (sort of) as soon as they convert; the problem is that there are many casual religion changers in the world so that would not be practical for such a close knit group. This is why a convert is not supposed to convert to being a Progressive (to easy) and often must show their devotion by becoming very pias and strictly Kosher. There is often a time limit as well measured in months or even years before a convert is allowed to truly think of themselves as a Jew and not just as a follower of the religion of Judaism.  Conservative Jews have been known to argue for the restrictions on conversion to be decades, or even generations!|`|JpgLxU1Laa	i actually get you. i had a daughter with genetic disorders and i used to think that about her, because all the pics of babies that had her disorder looked like her,,,  i used to say they were their own race of people|`|AA11058044	Depends on how you define "race".    Under certain definitions, I could certainly see where polydactylism is considered a race, or at least a characteristic that helps define the typical phenotype of a race.    In fact, it is used as one of the distinguishing characters of the Key West cat breed - which could be considered a "race" of cats.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	I know you've seen this long answer of mine before and I hope you don't mind my posting it again here so that the confused and misinformed may learn why some of their notions are mistaken.  Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people.  Jews are a nation people, Israel (tribal origin) bound by an eternal covenant of the faith (religion) of Judaism. We are like a huge family and only the family can determine who is a member of it. It is the laws of Judaism, given to the covenant nation, Israel, in the Torah, that determine Jewish identity.  It is not a matter of blood but of self-determination through the laws of the Jewish people.    The Jewish people are considered both a nation and a religion. Our connection is primarily one of faith (religion) through the covenant of Israel, yet membership is also conferred by birth, through matrilineal descent .One may also become a part of the nation Israel by adoption of the faith of Judaism and formal procedures of conversion.    One who converts to Judaism is considered as FULLY Jewish as one born Jewish and their children are Jews. This has been the case since the times of the Torah.    However one can be a Jew and not belong to both. One may technically be a Jew if their mother is a Jew, but apostate to the covenant of Israel and no longer considered a member of the nation if they leave it for the covenant of faith of another religion.     We are Klal Yisrael, the community of Israel, and have a shared " destiny" and history.. Many different and distinctly Jewish cultures and ethnicities have developed over the millennia in Diaspora lands.  The Diaspora refers to the Jewish presence outside of Israel after the destruction of the First and Second Temple periods and the Bar Kochba revolt.     There is no ONE Jewish ethnicity, but a great many ethnicities that are distinctly Jewish. There are the Mizrahi (from the Middle East and North Africa).The Sephardi (Spanish) and the Ashkenazi, (German, Polish, Russian and other Eastern European)that are all slightly different, even within those three designations as to cultural practices and foods, but it is the faith and covenant that binds them all together as Klal Yisrael.     The Jewish nation began as a group of tribes and our connection to one another is still from the perspective of a tribal nation. (example:  as the Lakota nation has tribal procedure and law to determine who is a member of their tribe, who is not, who is expelled and who is adopted, so does Judaism)  One born a member of the tribal covenant nation Israel (Jewish) may not be observant or even believe in God and theyre still a full member, a Jew. They may not be a good member or an active member but theyve not renounced membership by following something ELSE instead of Judaism. An atheist or a secular Jew is not trying to call something ELSE Judaism. That is how one may be an "atheist Jew", they still may live Jewish ethics and identify with their people, but they did not take on foreign beliefs contradictory to monotheism or Torah  Now if one born into the covenant becomes apostate to it through rejection of the covenant by adoption of another belief contradictory to the covenant, they are still be considered a Jew, but for all intents and purposes, they're not given the status of a member. According to Jewish law they're not counted in a minyan,( the minimum number of adults required for certain prayers and other mitzvot), they can't be buried in a Jewish cemetery, they cannot be given honors to go up to read Torah at a synagogue, and they may not be allowed to speak for the Jewish people. They CAN however, return without formal conversion should they so desire and then be embraced again as full members. One who has left the Jewish people for the foreign faith of another people must undergo the steps of TESHUVAH , which means repentance and return to the God of Israel. Some groups may require that the individual also requires immersion in the mikveh before being accepted back, but they do not require the formal steps of conversion should the person wish to return.    Jews are in NO way a RACE..other than as members of the human race. For those of you who want to claim Judaism doesn't accept converts as fully Jewish, how about Ruth in the Bible? She was a member of a nation that was condemned to be separate from God for their evil. However, she was a righteous woman who converted and adopted the faith of Israel and was the ancestor of King David. The New Testament depicts her as being an ancestor of Jesus, too. I like to bring this up when some Christians want to declare that converts aren't "real Jews" or that Jews are a race. (something that isn't up to them to decide one way or another anyway)    It is Jewish law alone, not Christianity or any other entity that determines the status of who and what is Jewish. When a Jew adopts a belief that is in conflict with the Jewish religion, the belief does NOT become a " Jewish belief" just because a Jew chooses to believe in it. THAT is the conflict Jews have with the Christians who call themselves Jews if deceptively try to present their Christian belief AS Judaism. A Jew who converts to Hare Krishna is just as apostate, but there exists no Jews for Hare Krishna or Hare Krishna Judaism evangelic groups spending millions of dollars a year in campaigns to convert secular Jews by convincing them it is a form of Judaism.   You can become a member of a tribe or nation if you meet the criteria of citizenship. And the covenant people, Klal Yisrael, remain as in the earliest days of the covenant..a nation. It hasn't changed.  It is against Jewish law for any Jew to discriminate against a convert to Judaism. Since the time of the Torah converts have been accepted as fully Jewish, and this is the case in all branches. We are not even supposed to refer to the fact that they are converts! It is up to them

Jesus Christ is the mirror image of God of the three persons within the Trinity; and clearly, he is a man with XY chromosomes:  however, woman is created in God's image too ... and represents the creation side of God.    The central thesis of John Paul's Theology of the Body, according to author Christopher West, is that "the body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what is invisible: the spiritual and the divine. It was created to transfer into the visible reality of the world, the mystery hidden since time immemorial in God, and thus to be a sign of it."[2]    The work consists of six cycles. In the first three, John Paul II establishes an "adequate anthropology" that looks at the humans as we were created, as we are now, and where we are going in the eschaton. In the last three cycles, the application of this new anthropology is discussed in the context of celibacy, marriage and fruitfulness.    Some consider the first encyclical of Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est (God is Love), with its exposition of the relation between agape and eros, to be the culmination of John Paul II's Theology of the Body|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	My pastor described God this way:  Your eyes can't look at the sun.

Just think about the artwork you have seen depicting the saints. Their halos represent the so-called Holy Spirits. If your head tingles, it is this phenomena that you are experiencing.

1gjWcF4gaa	As much as atheists hate to admit it, they DO have a religion. Even though they haven't checked every inch of the universe for God they have enough faith in their own intellect to deny his existence. The key word here is faith.

Yet that doesn't stop them from taking the leap of FAITH.|`|SzqCD0G0aa	If christians spend time in the LGBT, does that make christians LGBT?

It is something to admire when someone can set themselves some rules and follow them. They may seem a little boring at times (the music) but also will have a lot for someone to learn from.   I can't really say anything about this person, considering i have never met them. But it depends on the personality too. If this person wants to wait before they have sex, or kiss, it's probably because they feel that that is right, and they want it to more special for waiting.  This person could actually be having a very happy life, and maybe an even richer one than most people.
6ELSwKKvaa	What religion is your mother? I Believe in the Bible and just because a person is gay it is not an automatic ticket to hell. Sadly because of a religious viewpoint, the 5 times same sex acts show up in the Bible, it has made homosexuals feel there is no redemption for them.       In the past there has been a huge amount of promiscuous behavior among gay people but the reason is that 'religious" people have made them feel there is no redemption so why bother. God is fine with a loving monogamous relationship between members of the same sex. He is not so much with sexual promiscuity from either sex!     There is a site that does well in explaining the reason those 5 passages do not apply to monogamous homosexual relationships. The one is called "Someone to talk to" and the woman who runs it is very supportive.    http://www.someone-to-talk-to.net/    Click on "F.A.Q" and then click number 9. "What does the Bible say about homosexuality"      This is a very helpful place for parents to come to terms with this. They need to come to terms with this so that they can help you! If they don't want to have a child who does drugs, cuts, pushes God away, and hates themselves.... they need to get a grip on this for themselves. Most of the negative things associated to homosexuality are due to lack of support from those closest to them. I hope your parents can learn to love and understand you instead of forcing you to try to be something you are not.    EDIT: This website will also let them know that those "Change your orientation" camps are not very helpful.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	You have to tell her clearly an calmly that she can't tell other people and communicate with her. And you are Not, Not going to hell. I'm a gay Christian, and I don't believe God makes mistakes, an I don't believe he makes people fall in love and then sends them to hell for it. Will I go to hell for loving, or will they go to hell for hating??|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	I don't think it was her place to be telling everyone something you told her you didn't want anyone to know. You have every right to not tell people unless you want to, and I can't really understand why she did it.    Just don't freak out. Maybe your parents won't hear about it, or maybe they will give you a surprise by being comprehensive and loving. You're their daughter after all.    About your girlfriend, I won't tell you to break up with her, but I do think you have a lot of things to discuss with her. It'll be hard for you to build up trust in her after such a big betrayal.    Hope everything works out well for you.  Good luck.  ;-)|`|AA11589320	If they kick you out they can't also send you to some religious group.

GuBF5xhDaa	Real vampires are normal people who have a physical need for extra energy because they don't have enough of their own to stay healthy. Sanguines drink small amounts of blood from willing donors, and psychic vampires pull the energy directly from their donors. They are not mental, and they don't have medical conditions like Porphyria. The only reason they use the word "vampire" is because it is the closest word that fits their condition. They don't sleep in coffins, they aren't immortal, and the worst that they get from the sun is a burn. If you have any questions you can ask me.  http://www.sanguinarius.org/  http://www.drinkdeeplyanddream.com/  http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/  http://vampirewebsite.net/   http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm|`|AA11334468	They do   Vampire Bats  Mosquitos  Ticks  All feed on blood|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	I was one when I worked over night...|`|2IBHMk9Naa	I don't think they do, but it is nice to imagine that all these mythological creatures would exist.

Just with different needs.|`|IbrsGV5daa	yup|`|kuiWXTw9aa	No, I don't believe that the kind of vampires you are (most likely) thinking of exist.  But there are certainly humans who drink blood and are sensitive to sunlight.  They aren't immortal or inhuman, but they sometimes refer to themselves as vampires.    I can't prove that vampires DON'T exist, since I can't prove a negative.  I'm just stating what I believe.

66fJYDJaaa	Yes, you need a better lock.    Also, many years ago, my Dad lived in an upstairs flat.  It seemed to him that someone from the owner's place downstairs was sneaking in when he was at work, making long distance calls.  So beige coloured phone, so he put a small beige coloured thread on the phone. Maybe just a half inch thread. When he came home the thread was off on the side somewhere, so he knew someone had been there since he left that morning.     Also, if there's a little space under the door, look at the hinged side of the door, put a paper clip in between door and frame, down low, as you close the door.   So if you come back, before you go in, look down and if you see the clip down there, someone's been in???|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	I had a sister like that, too. Argh.

Invade her space, her privacy, and do not let up. But first, make sure that you give your parents a heads up.. Let them know that if they refuse to take action and set her boundaries, then you have no choice but to retaliate. Hide her toys ( dont lead on to her that you are doing this) hide her essentials, and just when she is about to pull her hair out, stay calm. Do not let her, or your parents knoe that you are doing this. In all that you plan to do, you must be clandestine and calm, and never get caught, or the jig is up. It should only take a week or two if you do it right.|`|AA12317147	Is she a nosy Parker? Then time to tell her to f off.  If she takes liberty with you, that is sis's previlege. But you should put her in her place by telling her that certain domains are out of bounds for her.    She should learn. If not teach.    If she does this to annoy you then somewhere you have let her. Now put corrective action in place. Each and everytime it happens, you need to do a verbal wrist-slapping.    Short of pad locking your door, and seeking your parent's support, there is not much you can do on this break and entry situation.    Good luck.

But mmm looks like experimenting, which is natural really eh!    If either were in a relationship there partner would probably accuse them of doing wrong.    Maybe the church would say it was a sin.    I think it's just human nature, & fooling around really.  Me & my man started off that way.

They are allowed to ask in optional surveys, but one does not have to answer.  It is true that some colleges have sections of dorms geared towards LGBT folks.  They provide this because some LGBT identified people don't feel safe in a traditional dorm setting where they can have hostile roommates or neighbors.  However, this is optional and LGBT people are not required to live in a seperate dorm section if they don't want to.|`|sVkBdQ28aa	No.. it's a breach of personal information.

5OucqEzFaa	All Christian denominations claim they believe in and teach the true gospel of Christ. The reason some accuse others of hating them when they disagree with their teachings is simple - nobody is prepared to back down and even contemplate they might be wrong. Some Christians feel threatened and insecure when others try to prove them wrong. I should know - I spent the first 25 years of my life as a Jehovah's Witness and was absolutely convinced they, and only they, had the truth and that everybody else on the face of the planet was wrong. It's much more useful just to point people to Christ Jesus and use the Bible to back up the gospel message. Then let the Holy Spirit get on with the job of convicting people and bringing them to Christ.    With regard to the example you quote - yes, this is a fundamental teaching of Latter Day Saints. Joseph Smith said 'God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man' (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith pages 345-346).  LDS Prophet Lorenzo Snow coined the phrase 'As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become' (The Gospel Through the Ages, Hunter, pages 105-106). Brigham Young said 'It appears ridiculous to the world, under their darkened and erroneous traditions, that God has once been a finite being' (Desert News, 16 November 1859 page 290). LDS Gospel Principles states that 'God himself, the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ himself did' (1997 page 305).    I am not going to get sidetracked on LDS theology about Elohim and his wife and their children, including Jehovah or Yahweh who became Jesus, or Michael the Archangel coming to earth as Adam with one of his wives. Neither am I going to visit their doctrines on 3 levels of salvation and the suggestion that everybody who ever lived will be resurrected to live on one of those planets, or the notion that they will marry and have children in order to populate their own worlds.    Suffice to say that the notion that God was once a man and that men can become Gods is not in the Bible. Furthermore it wasn't in the Book of Mormon either. Alma 18:26-28 says that God is a Spirit. In 1835 the Lectures on Faith, printed in Doctrine and Covenants, definitely stated that God the Father was a personage of spirit, not a man with a physical body. However, in 1921 these lectures were completely removed. Please don't take my word for it - check out the web links provided below.    LDS can believe whatever they like. However, Christians know that ONLY the Word of God, the Holy Bible, can be used to back up Christian teaching. The suggestion that God once was flesh and blood and that men can become like God stems originally from Gnosticism. And it goes against everything in the Bible. Disagree, throw your toys out of the pram, call me names. I do not care for the opinion of men. All I'm interested in is what God says to us in the Bible. Anything not from the Bible isn't Christian. That is my personal opinion and I'm sticking to it.|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	Mormonism is a false Gospel, and not Christian, but a Cult. The saying that you mention is part of a speech given by Brigham Young, a follower of, and successor to Joseph Smith. The doctrine it exposes is called Soul Progression. A doctrine that is very close to the Hindu doctrine of Reincarnation. Mormons believe that God was once a Man as we are, and progressed in to God, and that they will as well.    When you ask a Mormon if he/she believes in being Born Again, they will say that they do, and that they are Born Again. The fact is, being Born Again means something completely different to a Mormon than it does to a Christian. Mormons believe that we start out as Spirit Children in Heaven, and in order to progress, we must be Born Again as Human Children. That is why Mormons used to practice Polygamy, and why they have large families, to allow for as many Spirit Children to be Born Again as Human Children as possible. A Mormon is never Saved, or Born Again in the sense that we Speak of it. For the Christian being Born Again is mortal putting on immortality. To the Mormon it is just the opposite.    Mormons believe that Jesus, and Satan are Brothers, like Cain, and Able with a similar struggle. Except that they have progressed into the next level. They deny that there is a Holy Spirit, the Third Person of The Trinity.    Absolutely none of the beliefs of Mormonism are consistent with Christianity. They teach doctrines that are contrary to Christianity. Mormons are not Christians.

None of us have ever had a thingamajigger, but we do have a description of it. One guy finds a doohickey and declares, "I've found the thingamajigger!" Another person finds a thingamabob; another a gizmo; another a hickamadodger. Somewhere, someone may actually find the thingamajigger, but everyone has a good argument for why they think they actually have the real thingamajigger, and since no one is sure, the argument over who has the real thingamajigger goes on and on!     I used to be one of the ones who insisted that I had the real thingamajigger. Now, I am realizing more and more that we're not supposed to worry about knowing everything about the real thingamajigger as much as we are supposed to just know that there IS a thingamajigger and be trying to accomplish what the thingamajigger does!     The Bible tells us that there is a God who sacrificed His son on behalf of us. It also tells us how to show appreciation for that sacrifice in how we live our lives and in our behavior. We have to believe that. The rest is just details that we will never agree upon until God sets us straight! That is my current position on this matter, take it or leave it! =P

If you know there is a Heaven from personal experience then you can't be that bad a person or you would never have been able to see Heaven, all you would have seen is hell.    As to why God reincarnated you.  It is a natural process that just happens, and God does not pick and choose who is reincarnated and who is not.   It is the journey of the soul and it happens to everyone.|`|379b50dce4fc66c5c2a45e76914bd311aa	perhaps you are supposed to try to fix the problem.    or learn from it, or something to that effect.|`|XqS5DxR9aa	To bring me coffee|`|uGFzzLYWaa	If you still have that problem, then you need to learn to deal with it before you can move on.

lQIKWXDuaa	Christianity is a religion that is base on faith. I dont believe anyone will go to hell because they dont believe in God. God has giving us free will why would he send us to hell for not believing in him. As a Christian, I am not at liberty to judge you. Jesus did say he is the way. My translation of that is, if you follow his teaching and you are a good person than you will have eternal life.     As far as whether God exist or not. The evidence for his existence is all around you. You can't create something out of nothing. Whatever that first positive energy is I think it is God that created the universe and all that is in it.  Who created God? I dont know. NO one knows.    All I know is 2000 years ago, no one knew about the existence of microbes or that of the galaxies, the milky way,  atoms,  protons, DNA and proteins etc... but today we have the technology to prove that they all exist. Maybe someday we will learn about the other wonders of this universe and maybe more about God. I dont search search God in Church. I search for him in my daily lives. There is so much to this world  and universe that we cannot see.    ss|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Christendom might say you go to hell but there is no evidence of a fiery hell in the Bible.   A God of  love would never torture people in a hell fire or want them to serve him out of fear,he only wants us to serve him out of love.  Jeremiah 7:31  They have built the high places in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire,a thing that I had not commanded and that not come up into my heart.  1 John 4:8 God is love.    Romans 1:20 For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward because they are percieved by the things made even his eternal power and Godship.    Psalm 90:1,2    Everything that we have seen has had a beginning God has no beginning and no end.  For example if a person had never seen anyone give birth would they believe it if told so? Every birth is like a small miracle. But when we look at all the beautiful things around us,we can see God's love,  For instance he could have made all food taste alike,he could have made everything one color.But  there are such beautiful variaties in everything.  Exodus 6:3 Isaiah 12:2|`|IaU6PS23aa	Welcome to the good fight friend.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Aren't you tired of hearing the words...living by faith....but, that's what I do anyway. Yes, there is the proof of the words of the bible. Why do you think there is so much controversy on the different interpretations of the bible by the scholars. Therefore, since the book does exist, I go with the interpretation that I feel the most comfortable with and go with it. Therefore, since I do believe that God/Heaven/Hell exist I don't have to be judged by 12. I am thankfully putting my hands in one judge.|`|IEM4q1sCaa	PLEASE LET SOME ONE KNOW ARABIC TRANSLET THIS PART FROM HOLLY QRA'AN                                             ??? ???? ?????? ??????                      ?? ?? ???? ???, ???? ?????, ?? ??? ??? ????, ??? ??? ?? ????" ???                                                       ??? ???? ??????|`|VDTTzwlUaa	Many Christians see the Bible as an accurate portrayal of the character of God and see that there are proofs that the Bible is at least divinely inspired in some way. Some of the big proofs are said to be the prophecies in the book of Daniel which are very clear interpretations of dreams concerning the rise and fall of empires. Some people date the book about 164 BC while other date it 6th century. It says the Mede and Persian empire will come after the Babylonian one and says that after that the Greeks will become powerful. The 2 horns, with one being longer than the other, correspond to the Medes and Persians collective empire as the Persians rule was above the Medes (thus the longer horn). Then Greece is depicted as a leopard, supposedly representing the speed Alexander the Great conquered so much land. Then there are four heads (or horns I don't remember) that come after that that supposedly represent the four generals that took over his kingdom.    It all seems pretty detailed and accurate, and many people believe that accurate predictions like these prove that the writer was inspired by God. Me, I am not absolutely sure, but it I haven't been able to find a good refutation of it either.

lh8Tn02Naa	An answer from Britain, where the Wesleys came from - we all call ourselves Methodists now:    It accepts them, but ... it wriggles, and has come up with a form of words that says in effect we love them, God loves them, we wish they wouldn't, we know they do, if they don't make a fuss about it we'll look the other way.  Unless it gets in the papers.      We have actively gay members and gay pastors, some of whom are much more open than others.  Some are celibate, and that isn't an issue at all.  We have a pressure group that campaigns for full equality, and another one that wants them all to go back in the closet and lock themselves in.  In practice it all comes down to the attitudes among key members of specific congregations.  As a national body we are all over the place on this issues, and I suspect the same is true in America.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Not sure, but they should.  Any church should accept gays.  Now, passing it off as something other than what it is would be the real question.    But gays nor anyone else should be shut out of ANY church.

6NEPcZFfaa	There are some black people from Georgia and South Carolina who have a different culture and background than other blacks, they are called Geechees and speak Gullah which is a mixture of west African languages and English, but they were around before the Civil war and everything they were just runaway slaves. But I think they've blended in more. But I'm not sure because I don't know anyone from South Carolina, I just read about that.   Louisiana blacks have a lot of French influence and eat Gumbo and catfish and some are Creole, and all that New Orleans sounding music. the blues or jazz came from New Orleans.   Most blacks are from one of the old slave states and each state had different laws and rules, so blacks from different places actually (used to anyways) have different cultures.

1eiPSIydaa	Ok I'm not 70+ but one thing that I've seen change is the explosion in telecommunications. By that I mean everything from email and texting to being able to call people overseas without keeping the conversation down to 5 minutes worrying about the cost.    I used to have "pen friends" overseas.  I'd write to a mate, say in Japan, asking what dates I should visit in the Summer, and it would be about 10 days before I got an answer!   Now it can be instantaneous.  In those days (late 80s/early 90s) I never dared to waste loads of money on a phonecall that even when connected would have a 2-3 second delay. (So you end up talking over eachother!!)    Now, just about everyone has a mobile (cell) phone now.  It's so normal thesedays.  But 10/15 years ago most people would have to stay "by the phone" at home if they expected a call or use a public payphone when out to keep in touch with people.  It meant that if we arranged to meet at a time and place we really had to stick to it.  I've always felt that the mobile phone allows a lot more flexibility (or laziness!) with arranging to meet with people compared to a generation ago.    Mostly though, things don't seem that much different culturally; whether  from clothing fashion cycles, music, the persistence of wars, bad politics and so on  (although I'm optimistic about Obama I'm not too keen on my own Gordon Brown) - it all seems very familiar.  The huge economic downturn/recession/depression we are all experiencing MAY turn out to be unprecedented in it's severity but it's not the first downturn and it won't be the last.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	I am not 70+, but the changes I have seen are integration, changes in transportation, changes in clothing styles and cars, technology, and social mores. When I was little, sex was for marriage and was private. Now, sex is more open although not as open as it was in the late 60's early 70's. Some of the political activism of the 60's-70's died down then made a minor resurgence. Politeness and courtesy has gone out the window, particularly in the political arena.|`|AA10867564	probably the biggest thing is for me (~35) is the availability and cost of technology. when i was young (in the 70's), owning a calculator or a microwave was a big deal. everybody had a TV, but only about 1 in 10 kids had cable. if you had stuff like an ice maker, console game, or home computer, you were pretty rich.     the kids born around 1990 are the nintendo generation...the first generation of kids who started life with at least a nintendo or computer in the household.     i was talking to them today, and polled them about what kind of toys they had. nearly everybody had at least one game console, some had 5 or more. several had high tech toys like the furby, and most had computers.    in fact, i remember when the Internet went online. I read about it in Wired magazine. It started in Sweden or something, and in the early days (circa 1989), there were only a handful of websites online. i remember when you could type "star wars" into yahoo and get only like 20 hits...total.    before the internet, we were mainly using compuserve, prodigy, AOL, or a local dial up bulletin board. if you wanted to connect with someone in another state, you had to dial them directly, and pay outrageous longdistance fees.

EXgoY42saa	There are a lot of different Mahayana "denominations" -- from Zen to Lotus Sutra Schools to Pure Land. Zen folks will practice shikantaza or koans. Shikantaza, "just sitting," is like a combination of Theravadin samatha ("calming" or "stopping") and vipasyana ("insight" or "seeing"). Koan practice is somewhat distinctive of Rinzai Zen.    Lotus Sutra Schools may chant the Lotus Sutra or just the title of it.    Pure Land Schools may chant the name of Amitabha/ Amida Buddha.    And even within Theravada there are actually a lot of different meditation techniques for concentration and insight, including everything from mindfulness of the physical sensations at the soul of your feet during walking meditation, to "altered states" of jhanas practice (an intensive form of one-pointed concentration).    Having said all that, it remains the case that there are a lot of similarities in the most central and basic meditation forms -- especially in the practice of mindfulness of the breath.  .|`|lDEGaK7Laa	They practice different styles of meditation. I forget what the Mahayana meditation style is called, but the Theravadin style is called "vipassana."    EDIT: Theravadins emphasize "mindfulness," but not all of them practice vipassana.

I have average-sized eyes and a pretty sharp nose. Well, just think of it this way, I look Italian/Latino, but I'm 100% Chinese. I look like my avatar. =)    To Doki Doki: Most Chinese have flat nose and small eyes? I don't think so because from my experience, it's mostly the Japanese and Koreans that have small eyes, unless they had plastic surgery, wear circle lenses or eye-lid glue, which is extremely common in both countries anyway. Therefore, I don't think you have the qualification to judge the majority of 1.3 billion people as flat nose and small eyes because I'm sure you've only seen less than 50 Chinese people. Hmm, so much for making a stupid assumption. I'm sure you do know that Northern Chinese have sharp noses and since China has 56 ethnics, Chinese people are very diversed looking.    Besides, out of the East Asian countries (Korea, Mongolia, China, Japan, Taiwan), statiscally Chinese people have the largest population of natural big eyes and natural double eye-lids, whereas eye surgery is extremely common in both Japan and South Korea.
funeSrxUaa	That's a funny analogy.  We become "prepared" in expectation that they will come to us, not that we have to go to them.  I will tell of a time that I didn't even realize that I was witnessing to someone.  Sometimes we may think it's one person, but it turns out to be somebody else that is lead to the Lord.  The Holy Spirit prodded me to stop by a friends house one day.  When I arrived, they were having a little party.  There were 8 adults and roughly 12 children.  When I was introduced to everyone, it was made known that I was a youth minister.  That got a couple of them excited, not because they were Christian, but because they were not Christian and wanted to prove to everyone else in the room that they knew more "truths" of the Bible than one who studies the Bible.  So they started to ask some outlandish questions trying to bait me into a "no win" argument.  (You think some of the questions in R&S are nonsense, these questions were even harsher).  After answering and refuting their questions, and the longer the time past, the more absurd their questions became.  I finally got exasperated and yelled, "Enough!  Since you are only asking questions for the sake of arguing, I will not pander to your  insolence."  I went into the kitchen to grab my coat, muttering to the Holy Spirit, why was I sent there.  When I turned around, there was an eight year old boy standing there.  He looks up at me and in a soft voice asks, "Mister, please don't get mad at me, but I would really like to know about this person that you were talking about."  I quickly apologized and asked for forgiveness from God and I sat down at the kitchen table with this boy.  I talked to him for about thirty minutes, telling him all about Jesus and what he can do for him and his family.  When we finished, we prayed and he went into the living room excited about his decision.    If the story ended there, it would be a great story.  But, alas it doesn't.  A couple of weeks later, I was washing my car.  An older teenager, around 18 - 20 came walking up to me.  He raises  his hand and says, "Daniel, I want to thank you.  You saved my life."  I'm trying to think who he was and my mind is blank.  He then proceeds to tell me, "I was at --- (my friend's house) and I was listening in the doorway when you were telling (the boy) about Jesus.  I listened intently about everything you said, but I didn't understand completely.  I was arrested a couple days later for possession, and while I was in jail, Clarence came to me (Clarence is the head of the prison ministry in town) and sat down with a Bible.  He told me everything that you had said to the boy.  Because of you and Clarence, I have turned my life around and now I follow Jesus."  At that time, I couldn't help but think "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow." (1 Corinthians 3:6)  I wish I could tell you what happened to them.  This happened in 1997 and within a year, everyone at that house had moved away.  I pray that those who came to Christ are still walking with Christ and that they had led their family members to the saving grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.|`|yywRjouyaa	Yes it's like static electricity (of the Holy spirit of course) travels through me so I feel I must ground myself with rubber boots.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Usually.  But a couple months ago, a neighbor I barely knew showed up at my doorstep saying she was ill.  I took her to the hospital just to be safe.  Turned out she was OK.  In the emergency room, she asked me something like "why was I being so nice to her?" (or something like that).  I told her I was trying to act like a Christian.  She asked me some questions and said, "That's what I need!".  She bowed her head right there and prayed.  She prayed silently but I assume she was asking Jesus into her life as her Lord and Savior, since that was what we had talked about.  I'm still in shock over it.  She died a month later.  God is amazing.|`|WjRqYf6naa	I generally shod my feet in hiking boots.|`|4YqL4iCcaa	Well, I work in a low income school, and last year some 6th grade boys were asking me about the gym at my church and then, they asked if they could come with me to church sometime!

It's just a lot of superstitious speculation.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Oh bother, but ever since the MySpace advertisement, this has come up in this forum. Basically, the whole 2012 thing is bogus. People are out to make money on it.    The following is part (toward the bottom) of the wikipedia article on the Mayan Calendar: "The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar forms the basis for a New Age belief, first forecast by Jos Argelles, that a cataclysm will take place on or about December 21, 2012, a forecast that mainstream Mayanist scholars consider a misinterpretation, yet is commonly referenced in pop-culture media as the 2012 problem.    "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," says Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. in Crystal River, Florida. To render December 21, 2012, as a doomsday or moment of cosmic shifting, she says, is "a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."|`|qPzxKhrlaa	I'm pretty sure that the Yellowstone Supervolcano is going to erupt on or near December 21, 2012.

zuZntfiwaa	"It seems like everyone has accepted their sexuality, gay or straight."  (1) You can't expect anything else from straight people. Everyone's rewarded for being straight.   (2) NOT everyone gay, bi, transgendered, et al. has accepted their sexuality. This is another extreme generalization without basis, just like "Everyone hates gay people." It isn't true & probably never will be: some of us will always be in intolerant or hateful families, religions, or societies. We'll always be in a very small minority, although very possibly more & more people will discover they're bi.    "But for me it's a huge deal."  (1) You're referring back to that false generalization, so please be kind to yourself & don't beat yourself up over the big deal of it all. It's still a massively big deal for most of us, & it was far more massive for those who went before you. Many senior LGBT people still aren't comfortable about coming out or even talking about being gay. Don't beat yourself up. Don't beat yourself up. Don't beat yourself up.  (2) You're so YOUNG! You don't have the mental or emotional tools yet to stand up for your reality amidst all the bigotry in your immediate surroundings, which are always the greatest influence on us. There's a natural, extremely powerful, & extremely painful-to-resolve conflict betw/ your family's values/teachings & the reality of who you are. Your family has given you love & succor but then spouts hatred abt a core part of your being. You're already isolated & lonely, so you very rationally fear losing family, friends, & everything you've known & loved by accepting who you are, because accepting who you are means LIVING who you are, & if do that, even if you compartmentalize it from the rest of your life, you risk exposure. Compartmentalizing takes tremendous, soul-sapping energy, & it's still a long way from full acceptance, which is a new freedom, one you've never experienced. New freedom is often scary even to think about.   (3) Besides all these conflicts, you're dealing w/ the grind of being a teenager. These are the worst years of your life. As you take things one day at a time, try to keep one cyclops eye on where you'd like to be after high school & work hard toward that. The more satisfied & independent your chosen field makes you, the easier it will be to find like-minded people, move to areas more gay-friendly, and/or come out to people, esp. family. You sure as hell don't have to do that now, esp. since your family controls the purse strings for college, if you want to go that route.  (4) Your brain is changing profoundly, even more than in your first 5 years. Such changes create confusion, too, & often lead to certain extremes of thinking, blind spots, and a powerful desire for independence. So these conflicts are in the mix. Be aware of this and modify your thinking & behavior accordingly.    "How come I can't accept it 100%...?"  (1) Because of the conflicts I've mentioned. Because of internalized homophobia. Because of the fear of where moving to 51% acceptance of yourself will take you & what it will force you to leave behind. (On this point, you could read Judith Viorst's book Necessary Losses.)  Because as soon as we're born, we're born into ideology about godliness & morality, work & stress, gender & sexuality, etc. etc. Nature + nurture work (or don't!) together, so most people have to struggle toward an individuality they can live with, at least for now.  (2) Because you haven't worked enough on yourself yet. (Go to a therapist.) Because you haven't educated yourself about the struggles & triumphs of LGBT life & history. (Read books and access websites.) Because you haven't helped truths about yourself get through all the noise. (1st thing in the morning, write "Gay is good" @ least 10 times. Feel the words as you write them. Say them out loud. Write other truths out in the same way. These are TRUTHS, not simply "affirmations." I sniffed at this, too, but this WAS helpful when I was starting my journey to self-acceptance.)     "... and just stop caring about people?"  (1) No one ever stops caring about what other people think. We all want to preserve our reputations among the people we love, respect, and/or admire.   (2) Accept yourself enough to come out to ONE person, just one, someone you think will accept you but, if s/he rejects you, won't go blabbing, e.g., someone out of town. You could come out in a letter or on the phone: you might be able to express yourself better and/or won't have to see their reaction or deal w/ possible rejection in person. If in-person, come out in a public place so they'll have to restrain negative emotions. Just have an escape plan.  (3) As you come out more, some "friends" or "enlightened ones" will reject you. But it's so LIBERATING! You don't have to spend energy anymore on them! Your building of self-confidence lifts other burdens, makes you stronger than you ever thought you'd be!    All the best....|`|AyEkA6Flaa	It took me 25 years after college to fully accept my sexuality.  That's right, I'm in my 40s.

The man was supposed to honour his wife. I am going on and on about what man was supposed to do and now generations and generations, man has not followed God's word.

H1DrMEZxaa	I was 17 when I first realized I was gay.  I was just sitting in my room one night when a light went off and I realized that I liked girls.  I laughed for like 20 min.      About you though:    You should only tell your best friend when you are ready.  There is no formula to telling someone you are bisexual.  It's just something that you've got to kind of figure out on your own.  Just make sure you are in a private place and emphasize the fact that it doesn't change anything between the two of you.    It's alright to be scared though.  I just told my friends a month ago that I am gay.  It kind of just came out when we were at a club.  I cried the entire way home because I was so upset.  And you know what?  They were completely okay with it.      You'll be fine.  Just know that everyone might not react the way you think they will react and love yourself for who you are!|`|78kT0KSEaa	you don't have to tell your best friend if you don't think they will be able to take it.... but there right if they cant take who you are they aren't worth it. Coming out is scary, an i wouldn't recommend doing it if you don't have a plan if your family and friends wont accept you. I didn't come out to my last month of high school, and i had an army of supporters. Basically only you know your friend, only you can tell when its time.|`|KBBonf97aa	At 16, you're too young to make a declaration about your sexual orientation because it may not be clear yet.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she had a crush on another girl.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was completely straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget she came to a stupid and wrong conclusion when she was basically a confused kid.    It's common and normal for girls your age to have attractions to other girls that don't have a thing to do with what will ultimately become your sexual orientation.  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to call themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships.  This actually makes life hard for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't an accessory they can wear and discard when it's no longer in style.  Very often, they're used by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity and test their own boundaries.    Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a couple years.  And it's a lot easier coming out of the closet than it is getting back in if you discover you've made a mistake.  Most girls wonder if they're bisexual or gay when they're attracted to other girls, but more often than not those attractions end as quickly as they started.  If you go to your 10-year class reunion, the vast majority of the kids who called themselves bisexual will have grown up to be happily heterosexual (10% will be gay, statistically).    Sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  I'm sure some posters will tell you to experiment with males and females and then make up your mind, but that's stupid.  Gay men can have sex with women and it doesn't make them straight any more than a lesbian turns straight because she has sex with a man.  Orientation has nothing to do with sex acts.  We don't get to choose it, no matter how fashionable a particular orientation is.  If you've always been attracted to guys and the attraction to girls surfaced in the past few years, odds are you're completely straight.  But if you've always been attracted to both sexes, you're likely bisexual.    Don't pressure yourself to tell anyone until you're 100% certain you're right about your orientation.  Sexual orientation always sorts itself out over time and is usually unclear during the teen years.  When you do tell people, it's best to wait for a natural opening in conversation.  If you treat it like an announcement, you put too much pressure on people to react.  Your friends and family will take their cue from you about how to react, so the less of a big deal it is to you, the less it will matter to others.  If you wait until you're completely comfortable in your own skin, you'll be fine.|`|vsk9k1Qnaa	If your friend doesnt approve she isnt worth it.    I realized I was a lesbian when I was locking lips and hips with my best friend lol so she was okay with it.    I was scared at first but now it's just part of who I am.|`|grYkoDaraa	don't tell anyone unless you are Absolutely positive that way you wont have to go through all that drama unless you have to.  the way she reacts depends on how open she is and accepting she is.  i realized that i liked girls when i was 12 but put a name to it when i was 13.  just continue to live your life until you are sure you are bi then deal with it.  if you wish to talk more feel free to email me.|`|a3OCK2iraa	You don't have to tell anyone until you are ready. There is no rush. If she is Truly your best friend she won't care. My close friends that I told didn't care that I was a lesbian.  I have been gay my entire life. The earliest memory was in 5th grade, when I had a crush on a girl and we kissed while I was at a sleep over at her house. But I accepted it when I was 15. That was when I was like I can't fight this anymore, this is who I am and I can't help who I love. Don't be scared. Take your time. Maybe try feeling around the subject to see how your best friends feel about the LGTB community.|`|kvqtmcFQaa	wow .. i think we r twin seperated at birth ,,lol .. but im having the exact same issue.

You were born being it, so the smartest thing for you to do is to accept yourself and enjoy your life.    Nobody can really know how your friend will react since we don't know her, but if she doesn't accept it, then she's not a very good friend, don't you think?    It is normal and ok to be scared of coming out to people you love, since you're afraid they're gonna stop seeing you the way they did before. It's either taking your chances or living a lie. The decision is yours.    Good luck.  ;-)|`|NQ3eETlYaa	1) Tell your friend when you feel ready. This is when you feel totally confident that she should know and you can't hold the secret anymore    2) Depends. Is she homophobic? You should first ask how she feels about homosexuals, then decide whether to tell her or not    3) In second grade, I had two teachers: One guy one girl (I know lol). The girl was my gf's mom, and the guy was...a teacher. I always though the girl teacher was pretty (not in a crush way, though). Soon, I began to have sexual thoughts for the guy teacher. Two years later, I began fantasizing over a sixth grade teacher, some guys, and some girls. (Yes, in fourth grade)    4) Don't be afraid of who you are. Before telling anyone, you need to accept yourself first, if you want anyone else to accept you.|`|vg3ih0foaa	When I came out as lesbian, one of my main reasons was, so that guys wouldn't try and date me. I don't want them. Plus I wanted to be able to comfortably live a lesbian lifestyle. However, I still think that sexuality is incredibly private, and if it didn't make my life and others easier, then I wouldn't have told them. It's not their business. So since you're bi, its up to you if you want to come out, but you really don't have to unless you want everyone to know you're on the market for both boys and girls. Or you could just wait until you date a girl to tell people. But it isn't an obligation, you don't have to. But since she's your best friend, then just tell her that straight up, you like girls too. She shouldn't hate you for it, she might be surprised but since shes your best friend, she should be ok. Good luck!

oDdXpghDaa	First off, it's B.S. the notion that being gay is against Christianity.  If you're a decent person and you spend your life helping others and living a caring life - to me that is the essence of Christianity should be - so don't worry about that part... there are as many pastors, priests etc... who say being gay is NOT a sin as there are for those who do.    Second of all... I know it's really tough to have a crush on someone when you can't tell them you have a crush, or know if they might be into you or not.  But from what you described, to me, it sounds like she's straight and you might be better off being friends and not pursuing a lost cause.  You should decide if your friendship is more valuable than your feelings right now.      I pretty much knew deep down inside when I was 14 that I was gay, but I still tried to stomp those feelings out because I as afraid of getting picked on, afraid of being bullied, afraid of what people would think.  So here's my advice:  Don't worry about anything - you are normal, you are healthy - being a bi or a lesbian is NOT a bad thing, and is NOT something you should never, ever, EVER be ashamed of.  That's the way God made you - and God makes all his creatures to perfection.      I know it sucks right now, but you just stick it out little tiger and one day you'll experience the whole wide world, and you'll realize you're not alone and that there are plenty of fish in the sea.|`|KjY2pANcaa	Talk to Jesus|`|qOZashBYaa	Ah, I remember the days of confusion. They are pain in the *** that couldn't be surgically removed. Anyway, if you are confused about your sexual orientation, let me tell you something. Don't overthink it. SO many people do, and it's not that hard. Me, I am bisexual, and I actually went around that stage when I was...12. And it was my best friend, we were both very curious about it, we just never said anything about it, and next thing you know, we are in a Libby Lou nail painting booth, telling each other we are bi. Time flys so quickly.    And babe, she could just be touchy-feely. Some people are raised like that, some aren't. But if you feel like she may have liked you, or you even liked her, than you need to talk about it. For all you know, she could love you and just be waiting for you to come to your senses.    And about the Christian thing, I have nothing against religion what so ever, but if you do think you are gay, you can't stop it, it's natural, so to me, by saying it's wrong to be gay, is like saying it's wrong to be a different color of skin or religion.|`|vg3ih0foaa	Honey, I wouldn't worry about defining yourself right now. You're young and you have plenty of experience ahead of you. Just do what feels good and right right now, follow what your feelings tell yyou and you should figure it out eventually. It sounds like you could be bi or maybe even lesbian, since you haven't touched on guys I'm not sure. But just do what feels right first, worry about what to tell other people later.   It could be hormones, so who knows, only time will tell. So just be patient and wait and see.   As for the girl, I suggest moving on and see if they are other girls you might be willing to date. That should help you with determining your sexual orientation.   Other than that, a lot of things Christians do goes against Christianity. Everybody sins, and I don't think God would damn you for eternity because you love somebody. Love is a selfless act, how could God hate it? Besides, lesbians aren't even mentioned in the bible. I wouldn't worry about it. Good luck!|`|MT1498npaa	You should never be afraid of being gay if you are Christian, because even though it is "wrong" to be gay, God accepts everyone for who they are, not what they are.|`|57fZyjvgaa	It's okay. It's a strange age... hormones are crazy and wacky and confusing.   You might just admire this girl. Of course hugs would be enjoyable, any physical touch makes us feel happy. You haven't had time to experience boys, so you're clinging to the person who makes you feel whole - your close friend. We all long for that feeling of "completeness" and if she's the one who gives it to you right now, it's okay, but it doesn't mean you are bisexual or gay.   It's understandable that it's hard for you to see her have a boyfriend. If you rely on her, you're probably a bit envious that she will be taken away from you. ANY girl could feel like this about a good friend.  Since you're a Christian, pray about it. God is not going to send down bolts of lightening just because you're questioning your sexuality - He wants you to talk to Him about it. Don't be afraid. He loves you so much and wants you to talk to Him. You can cry to Him, you can scream at Him, anything, as long as you talk to Him.    This is a hard age, but you can do it.|`|9c87de592ced0d4bc675041e01b50a6caa	You could be, or you could just be going through a phase. I was even younger than you when I had a crush on one of my best friends, so believe me I know how you feel. I'm a lesbian, btw, but that doesn't mean you are.  It's not against christianity to be gay:    "The Bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals.  That doesn't mean that God doesn't love heterosexuals.  It's just that they need more supervision."  -Lynn Lavner    Don't believe everything the bible tells you, anyways. Women don't have to submit to men anymore, and we're allowed to wear pants. I'd say a bunch of the stuff in there is pretty null and void by now.|`|QTjP6Nx4aa	Calm down. You are in early adolescence. Many more people than will ever admit go through a "do I like guys or do I like girls" phase. You may have some tendencies but it could just be a phase, or maybe not.

She could complain of their harassment and maybe stalking if they are paying That close attention to her.  If her problems are severe maybe you could help her get an advocate or legal aid.

kZW8xXoKaa	Yes and No...  If life were a race I'd say the "better" looking people get a head start...  However, not so good looking people make up for that usually by having talents and intelligence.   So in the end those with only looks and nothing to supplement them with usually end up in -last place- trying to figure out what went wrong in their lives considering the "initial/superficial" advantages they'd received early on.|`|JZTj5zFKaa	Good-looking people are almost always treated better than uglier people, especially when it comes to how much more a better looking person can get away with something. It's a natural way of human thinking though, people in general tend to want to be around/seek out better looking people to associate with. Because of that good-looking people will always have it easier than ugly people.  I understand that ugly people aren't hopeless in life, but they don't get any advantages, so they have to work harder to get what they want in life.|`|Fpi8im9taa	I don't think so.    There were tons of "hot" guys and girls at my high school, and plenty of "bad-looking" people. They got all the attention, all the popularity, and all the bf's and gf's. Heck, some of them "hot people" even had kids. Fast forward to graduation and college...    ALL of them dropped out. NONE of them even attend a local community college. One's working as a lonely forklift driver, who lives in his friend's mother's basement because his own mother found him to be a burden. A football star that graduated in my year is jumping from friend's house to friend's house.    In short, unless you're one of the extremely rare exceptions, your good looks will only grant you a temporary happy life. I was never "blessed" with those looks, but I feel I'm more privileged to be in a high-ranking university. I'm proud of where I got to with hard work and diligence, even though I was never part of the A-crowd.    Your looks are permanent, so you'll always be smiled down upon by those who judge on looks. But your actions will always overpower your looks; being handsome has nothing to do with success. I've seen hundreds of examples from my high school; don't add to my list.    ADD: Kudos to you. The salutatorian at my high school was also in your situation. But good looks didn't get in the way of his brain.    Thank you for being an intelligent good-looking person. It's great to know that there are people who break the stereotype.

In Britain, most shoppers bag their own groceries into disposable plastic carrier bags or sturdier reusable ones.      Uniform is worn by pupils at nearly every school in Britain, however in the USA not many schools have a uniform.    American television is much more "censored" and conservative.  On mainstream British TV, nudity and swearing is acceptable (after 9.00pm) but in the USA such programmes are normally broadcast on premium cable channels.  When Janet Jackson's breast was bared at the 2004 Superbowl, the British were amazed that it caused national outrage in the USA.  In Britain some national daily newspapers have what is known as a "page three girl", which is a picture on page three of a  girl posing topless.     In Britain, the traditional Christmas day meal is usually accompanied with Christmas crackers (paper tubes that bang when you pull them apart and they contain a toy, a paper hat and a riddle or joke).  From what I've heard, they are not as common in the USA.    Americans typically make up their beds using blankets and sheets with a bedspread or comforter to cover the bed. Most Brits use a duvet (feather or hollowfibre filled quilt) which has a removable cover which can be washed.|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	The source for all the major differences between the two comes from the fact that America is more conservative than Britain.    You could write books on this, Americans are generally more patriotic, religious, and view life more in terms of  win/lose situation meaning think of life as something you can succeed or fail at. Punishment in Britain is also less severe than in America, in Britain, murder can get you as low as only three years, but an average of 5-10 (in America it can be life). I also believed Britian ranked  1 in the most promiscous country on earth, meaning they are a lot more lax when it comes to their sex culture.

Yes it is possible to be able to love a male and a female, and it is not just sexual attraction.|`|le29yexraa	Yes. If the people who claim to be bisexual don't count of proof, you're the one being childish.|`|v4qLlGGhaa	Yes.    I had to boil my attraction down to four areas.    Physical (Holding hands, cuddling)  Emotional (Yearn for them when they are not there)  Spiritual (How you relate to each other spiritually)  Sexual (Obvious)    Anyway, I was not comfortable with my double life so I chose women because I am not emotionally attracted to men at all. I don't care much for cuddling with them either.     Hope this helps.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Not only is it possible, it happens. I am a case in point, I don't like all men and women, but if I find someone sexually attractive it doesn't matter what sex they are, if the return my affection so much the better.|`|D3qXg4tZaa	Alrighty kiddo here's the deal. There is bit of controversy over whether or not bisexuality is "real" or not. Personally I think it is, but as an answer that is neither here nor there. For your question we must turn to science!    First, we must understand that bisexuality does not mean that a person likes both genders EQUALLY, but rather simply likes both genders maybe one a bit more than the other. Now onto the theories about it.    There are two possible explanations that are considered. One being nature and the other being nurture.    The nurture idea is that bisexuality is an idea brought upon and ultimately accepted by someone based on the enviorment that they are in. Furthermore according to Freud, who's studies should be taken with a grain of salt, believed that it was the original sexuality of man and that through society they were made homo or heter sexual.    The nature idea is that bisexuality could be caused by one or many theories based on biology. One such prominent theory is the idea of prenatal hormones. This idea is that depending on the gender one might be exposed to an overabundance of either testosterone in the brain during developement in the womb (females) or that there is a lack of testosterone receptors in the brain of a developing male, leading to slightly increased masculine traits and slighty feminized traits respectively. The other theory is the imbalance of x or y chromosones within a developing DNA structure.    Try to remember that though these are theories, much like evolution, that does not mean that they are random guesses that should be ignored. Though most people believe that theories cannot be trusted because of lack of complete hardcore proof does not mean they are to be discredited.|`|VUK77SrXaa	Yes, it is and I base this on the Kinsey Scale developed by Alfred Kinsey when studying Male Sexuality and published in the Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) by Alfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy and others, and was also prominent in the complementary work Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953).  The scale of sexual behavior is as follows:    Rating Description   0 - Exclusively heterosexual behavior  1 - Predominantly heterosexual behavior, only incidentally homosexual behavior   2 - Predominantly heterosexual behavior, but more than incidentally homosexual behavior   3 - Equally heterosexual behavior and homosexual behavior; bisexual.   4 - Predominantly homosexual behavior, but more than incidentally heterosexual behavior   5 - Predominantly homosexual behavior, only incidentally heterosexual behavior   6 - Exclusively homosexual behavior     MEN: 11.6% of white males aged 20-35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.  WOMEN: 7% of single females aged 20-35 and 4% of previously married females aged 20-35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives. 2 to 6% of females, aged 20-35, were given a rating of 5 and 1 to 3% of unmarried females aged 20-35 were rated as 6.    So, at least as far as behavior is concerned, there are Bisexual men and women.|`|H5CdsnByaa	Yes.|`|EagkCeNHaa	Yes.|`|5787d866dc61b1442c262d4f402119b6aa	Why not?    I'm bi.    its basically like you don't have much of a preference.     You can't help who you fall for|`|w9cYBmiVaa	It is very possible for I am one of those people.|`|TKrirbJ3aa	YES IT IS MORE THAN POSSIBLE!!! WHEN I WAS 13 I HAD MY FIRST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE. I AM WITH A MAN NOW BUT THAT EXPERIENCE WAS WITH A WOMAN!!! I AM BISEXUAL!!! SO I KNOW FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE!!! I AM ATTRACTED TO BOTH MEN AND WOMAN!!! SO IF YOU THINK YOU ARE BISEXUAL DON'T YOU DARE DOUBT YOURSELF!!! FOLLOW YOUR HEART!!! THEY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THE TITLE IF IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN OR A MAN TO BE ATTRACTED TO BOTH SEXES AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THE SEX IS GREAT WITH BOTH MEN AND WOMAN IF YOU ARE A WOMAN SOME TIMES IT IS BETTER WITH A WOMAN BECAUSE US WOMAN KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER WANT AND NEED AND WITH A MAN AT LEAST YOU FEEL SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU SO THAT PART IS GREAT TOO! LIKE I SAID YES IT IS MORE THAN POSSIBLE TO BE BISEXUAL! I AM!!!!!!!|`|bJiE54Qtaa	Well, the way I see it...if i'm gay and have no control over it, and others are straight and have no control of it...who am I to say that bisexual people have no control over it?    Heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality all fall in the same boat.|`|EaQxwjVfaa	Actually I read somewhere that everyone born as a bisexual...it just depend where they fall on the Kinsey Scale. If the person is a 0 its just mean they are straight straight but definitely there gotta be some one of the same sex in the world would make that person turn in s snap. Thinks of Angelina Jolie...I know lots of straight woman would wanna do her in a second.|`|eA8ytUsbaa	guilty ;)|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	I am...of course they can thats whAT the B in LGBT stands for.  i think the question is immature by itself, i mean come on how can you question this???|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	i am bisexual.  i have serious loving relationships with both male and female.    yes it is possible|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Of course.  There are thousands of bisexual people in the world.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Um, yes.  I'm one, and there are millions more.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Yeah, I mean, if you like both men and women...they're both sexes (genders), right? And bi means two.    Seriously, why do people say "There's no such things as bi's."? I just don't get it! If I like both girls and guys, what am I considered? Confused? No...I'm positive I like both sexes. So...they need to back off if they're not part of the LGBT community!! lol :)|`|1469de7bd315f4ada9d0225c451cdd2aaa	Yep.  Almost anything is possible.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	Yes, Someone can like both sex's! Look at tila tequila she is a bisexual!!! I mean some people just can't decide!!!  Love,  chelsie
gy6qb0dDaa	Yes... what the phuck. Be nice. Saying things like that to your little brother can be completely detrimental. He is probably so insecure knowing that his sister doesn't even have confidence in his sexuality.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Yes. If you keep saying that he's gay, a fag, he'll eventually believe it. Nice work.|`|AA10665732	It very well could just be coincidence that he is acting this way not because you're calling him it but maybe he really is gay.|`|vL8JErXNaa	Sure, just like calling a person tall will cause him to grow|`|PyAgEejnaa	How old is he? Why don't you stop calling him names...especially ***, that's so unnecessary. Whether he's gay or not, you're not really helping his self-esteem and I'm sure he's going to eventually hate you!|`|29fDip0Eaa	Good job. If incest weren't illegal, you might have had a chance to save him...|`|78kT0KSEaa	Maybe he is gay and your name calling just made him feel worse and worse to the point where his self esteem is so shot  he doesn't care what you or anyone thinks anymore so he doesn't hide his "signs". Or maybe hes trying to make you feel bad, ether way go  APOLOGIZE!|`|vbmsNq0caa	bad, bad sister..    anyways. he is probably gay..

1LUhUdhHaa	Nada.  Maybe lucky.  I can taste a big difference and Pepsi falls short for me.|`|AjPUD3Jsaa	nothings wrong with you..theres a stark difference to some people and to others they taste the same. For me though, pepsi is sweeter.|`|xubpe9G5aa	nothing.  most people cant.  its mostly because they are basically the same drink, just different brands:)  they do taste a little different, but not to some people.  your perfectly fine.|`|Xic6soQjaa	Nothing is wrong with you. Your taste buds might be a bit weak, but its really nothing. There is a very minor difference in taste between coke and pepsi, with pepsi being more sweeter and coke being a bit more fizzy. I know a lot of people who can't tell the difference, but it doesn't really matter to them.|`|F4iXiZWUaa	Nothing wrong with you! the drinks got some problem thats it.   pepsi is lil sweeter n more aerated compared to coke. anyway both have their own darker side!|`|6kvKi6Sfaa	The senses are made that way; theyre not all equally strong in everybody. In some people sight or hearing may be strong, but taste or smell comparatively weaker. For many other people, the reverse may be true. In your case, the sense of taste is not your strongest sense, so you probably rely on other senses in your everyday life. You may not ever get a job as a taster, for aerated water at least! Should that "wrong" bother you?!|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	you are not a picky person|`|EmV1Kojyaa	There is nothing wrong with you at all. There is only a slight difference in taste between the two and most people can't tell anyway, such as myself. The only reason I know about it is I have a cousin who works in the Pepsi bottling plant in Toronto. She told me that Pepsi is made with 'clove', which gives it a bit of a sweeter taste than Coke.|`|AOBEkqzXaa	There is a definite difference. Coke tastes like you're sucking on a nickel...Pepsi actually tastes like it wont kill you by corroding your insides :)|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	You're taste challenged. Lucky you|`|A6PS0jRfaa	some people just can't taste the difference.Personally,Pepsi is sweeter and my drink of choice.

2liwk8yKaa	Get references from previous place he stayed.|`|GrqsnWtiaa	Lol no dont do that, he might hide a secret side to him, find someone else ASAP!|`|abz98b8Vaa	Did you know your former roommate before you knew her?|`|A6PS0jRfaa	I wouldn't because you never know,people are crazy now days he might seem nice and then cut you up in your sleep or rape you.I'm not very trusting to people,perhaps you could look into getting a smaller apartment? Personally,I wouldn't room with someone you don't know.  I did this with a guy at work who I kind of knew,he rented a room when I was living a house and he was really nice at work and  everyone thought he was a easy going guy.About 2 weeks into sharing the house,he would go into a rage if something little happened like he forgot his keys or they didn't have the right stuff he wanted at the grocery store,he would bang and kick down doors.Long story short,I had to call the police to carry him away after he tore my house up.  Please use caution and maybe think about asking a friend to move in if you must have a roommate.|`|Zj5PJ6mFaa	well its better for u to get to know him first like go out to the movies and c how he acts or just places to get to know him but just dont let ur guard down right away cuz that whole roomate thing that u r letting people move into ur house without knowing them scares me 2|`|JAwizg4naa	Yes its kinda dangerous i think!!!
9z9BW10daa	I think students that aren't already involved in volunteer work should be required to do so, yes.  But I've been involved with the National Charity League for many years now, and to have to fill out all that annoying paperwork is VERY irritating.      Just my opinion.|`|PlxknZV4aa	It works out pretty well for us up here in Canada. We need to do 40 hours. I did mine at a nature museum coercing kids into touching fossilized dinosaur crap. It was very awesome.|`|ub23m7Praa	No, that's bullcrap that they FORCE you to volunteer. Sure, it's for a good cause, but honestly, they shouldn't be able to force you to volunteer|`|aQ8utQOeaa	They should have to do it.  It helps build character.|`|AA12029875	if it's required, it's not voluntary.|`|isA4wtnMaa	Everyone needs a little bit of motivation.  I'm in favour of mandatory community service hours.  It makes students get involved in their community and depending on where they volunteer, they might be so lucky to see the hidden problems of society that they otherwise may never have noticed or cared about.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	It can't be "required" and "voluntary".|`|qGaTcEliaa	I don't think so because they don't have time especially through all that homework.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	It's not that big of a deal.   I had mine all done before the end of grade 9.   Is it such a hardship to give back to the community? Even if it is required by the curriculum?|`|w1RPYXoiaa	I would be a great opportunity to gain experience in different fields and also gain understanding and compassion when working in human service related fields.|`|AA11922229	Absolutely NO!. That by definition is slavery.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	It wouldn't be VOLUNTEER work if it was made MANDATORY. So no. Not like that anyway.      But maybe it would be a good idea to get certain businesses to team up w/ schools to allow kids to work a set number of hours & be paid to give them all an idea on how it all works. I don't see why that shouldn't be a stipulation to graduate. Soem states a kid can't graduate if he/she misses too much school & can't get their drivers license for poor attendance, so maybe that's a good idea too. Maybe the kids could keep half of what they earn & donate the other half to a school project or function. That way when they graduate & get out on their own, they aren't clueless. Some kids are very sheltered at home & have no idea what to do. For some kids, the schools prepare them for way more than just studies, so that would be a good idea.    Besides, if the kids do well & the businesses are pleased w/ them, they may keep them after set   of hours completed & an easy way for many to get jobs.|`|sVrkjixAaa	No. Even the suggestion of it is infuriating.  Volunteer work, is as you said, voluntary. Is it for a good cause? Of course. But since when are morals and ethics supposed to be forced upon teenagers. It's sad how today it's almost impossible to get into college without "voluntary" community service hours. People are now doing it just to make themselves look good for college, and once they get in, they won't touch community service again for the rest of their lives. While this isn't true for everyone, it is too much a majority. The "character" that they learn during these hours is rarely nothing more than the sad reality that appearance matters more than substance, and to make it in life all you need to do is fake an outward interest in what people want you to be interested in.    If you care so much about the character of the new generation, get up and set a good example yourself.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	no volunteer work is if you want to volunteer or other wise it slave labor|`|l2mJxB1Caa	yes, i think so|`|3hqynAFVaa	Yes.|`|Kp9YusZIaa	u should b willing to do it with out being forced|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	I think it should be voluntary. However, If a student had a particular interest in a field they were going to major in, then it might be a good idea to volunteer their time. Otherwise it should be their call.|`|BiNCwoOiaa	If there required it wouldnt be voluteerd work any more would it|`|UT9doii0aa	H no, Volunteer work is wolunteer work, if your school requires you to do voluteer work. Tell them to "F*** off"|`|q3vTZMt0aa	yeaah. i just finished my 40 hours. (im in Canada.. we have to do that thru highschool)  and i think its annoying  but yeahh.. i think they should make us do that.  its only fair we give back too the community|`|PGU04L1Taa	NO, its B S    why do you need 40 hours to gradutate...its sooo dumb    most of the students don't even volunter at places that will help them in the future|`|v6LNWfx8aa	I already graduated but in part of my senior portfolio was to do 40-hours of community service which i think is the same as volunteer work    and no I don't think it should be required I don't think that has nothing to do with school  ...................|`|Us2YN8eoaa	In my school, they provide a small scholarship for students who work enough volunteer hours. An incentive instead of a requirement seems to be a good enough compromise.|`|3D1w7eCjaa	yeah, only for high school students though. i have to do 120 hours for my college program so I can start networking which is okay i guess but definitely in high school.    you need to help the community and maybe it'll inspire you to go into a field that you helped someone with. you'll also meet new people and it teaches you to become a nicer person, especially at that age too.|`|bKYAj1v8aa	I think that it should not be required if and only if that particular student will not be moving on to higher education. I do think that it should be required for those students who are looking forward to attend a four year university.    For those students who think that it should not be required in order to graduate: Think about your future potential employers. The majority of them will pick the canditate with a well rounded resume.|`|OHydEvTCaa	Yes, that's a great idea. Hey we'd have way more things done if this were the case.
LqwlAMJsaa	It depends how fancy the place is.     If yours is a Mom & Pop, it's a less fancy/expensive atmosphere than one of those chic, upscale city salons. I'm guessing your haircut was under $50. Considering the place and the price, I'd say that you could probably tip $5-- $10 at most (and $10 seems excessive, if indeed the cut cost anywhere up to $50).     If the owner cuts your hair, you should NOT tip. This rule holds for any beauty services, including manicures and waxings. The reasoning behind it is that the owner will be pocketing the whole profit of the cut anyway, so there's no need for you to tip.    Finally, do not forget about the shampooist! These people work hard with their hands in soapy water all day, and they get a much lower salary than the hair cutters. You should be sure to throw $2-3 their way and give them a hearty "Thank You."     Enjoy your new 'do!|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Yup.  Same as at a restaurant.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Nothing.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	five dollars|`|hEFthejvaa	if they did a good job an extra few bucks, like $3-5.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	i tip mine 15% unless they do a really bad job tehn i just don't go back there|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	10 or 15% of the total cost of the haircut|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	you dont tip the owner  and same for  a salon  15-18%|`|m7ZjznP3aa	I get my hurr cut by a woman who owns her own salon, she already charges me like 30 dollars, and its kinda hard when you have to pay with plastic, but I would imagine she takes her share, talking about the economy and all she may end up even raising prices.    Don't get me started with nail salons!|`|KHC2oE8iaa	yes the rules apply to any business. you tip the helpers and gratuity is always 15% of what you were charged. if you can't afford to pay then cut your own hair and cook your own food lol.

AjPUD3Jsaa	I think they're only sold to people 18+.

2i1wVB47aa	Dear Mrs. X,         Yujin told me that she cant change her current schedule regarding PE8. Please understand my concerns:         The reason Yujin did not want to take the 1st term PE8 course was because she was informed that PE is much more difficult than it is in Korea. She wanted to take some time to mentally prepare herself for the class. I thought there would be no problem if she took PE8 during the 2nd term. When we visited your office, you kindly helped out with Yujins schedule to get rid of her 1st term PE8 course and ultimately replaced the computer course. However, I realized that I misunderstood PE8.         First of all, I thought she could complete PE8 by taking it in either the 1st term or the 2nd term twice a week, as she has done with the Fine Arts8 course she took 1st term. By the time Yujin got her 2nd term schedule, I understood Academic course searching on the Internet. I also realized Yujin will probably complete PE8 by attending twice a week in both 1st term and 2nd term, according to the information I had received.         Thats why, one day, I told you Yujin has to take PE8 four times a week during the 2nd term. This is so that she wont have any trouble when she is in Gr 9. As you may remember, you agreed with this and Yujin finally has the current schedule.         However, the reason I asked Yujin to visit your office on Monday is because I found a schedule received on Sep 23, 2008 from the office. I thought Yujin might be able to take half of PE8 when she is in Gr.9 because term 3 [2nd term] says that she can take PE8 twice a week as shown below.         I am sorry for Yujin because she told me that she will probably be the only student taking PE8 four times a week and attend PE8 class Mon through Fri. It was my big mistake that I did not fully understand this required academic course, PE8, when we were working on the schedule.          I just wish she could take half PE8 when she is in Gr.9 and take PE8 twice a week during her 2nd term in Gr.8. I always care for Yujin. I just want her to be happy whether at home or at school.

rv2Iy1Y7aa	Latin is a versatile language.  Many words that we use which the Romans would not have used can be formulated by the linguistic rules they employed.  "The Convincer" would be one of these.    "convince" is "persuadeo" in Latin ... I convince.  The noun form of this verb (one who convinces" is "persuadetor".      Using the same thinking and the verb "convinco", you would form the Latin word "convictor", having the same basic meaning.
d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	There are people who eat raw meat as a regular part of their diet.  They feel that it is more "natural" than cooking it, and that our ancient ancestors ate raw meat, and therefore our systems have developed to handle such things.  Personally, I tend to disagree.    However, there are certain food dishes which are raw meat (or fish... i.e. sushi).  "Steak Tartare" is ground, raw meat... usually beef, but can be another red meat, like bison, or horse, even! (see Wikipedia article below)    Our family is of German ancestry, and in Germany there is a very popular variant using raw minced pork called Mett or Hackepeter, which is typically served on rye bread or rolls, with the onions and pepper, but without capers or egg.  But we used the ground beef instead, and it is usually reserved for special holiday celebrations like Christmas and New Years.    There ARE ways to minimize the health risks (two-fold when you're talking about raw meat AND raw EGG, too!), and in all of my family's history, I have not known ANYONE to ever have gotten ill from eating it.    I LOVE "hackepeter" but don't get it very often.      Have a polite day.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I've bee eating raw ground sirloin for decades, I do get ill sometimes but it is so good I risk it every now and then, I also eat sushi twice a month.|`|55nophEPaa	i eat sushi. some types of that has raw fish in it. no side effects. red meat can have alot of bacteria in it though. like saminella. i dont think anyone should eat that...|`|Xce2KvGnaa	Raw meat is contaminated with several types of bacteria and parasites.

As long as it's fresh, it will be processed through your digestive system just like cooked meat.    I've eaten raw meat a few times in a few restaurants restaurants and it's ok but it doesn't taste like much-- mainly it's just a novelty.    Don't leave it up to yourself to decide if it's fresh enough; you can probably only eat it at very good restaurants with STELLAR reputations.    Same goes for raw fish at a sushi restaurant.    And be sure to remember that pregnant women should NEVER eat raw meat or fish because of the risk of even the smallest amount of bacteria on their developing child.    enjoy!|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Raw ground beef is eaten in many places.  In some parts of Germany (Hamburg, I believe), is where our hamburger got its name.  Fresh ground or minced beef, with raw egg.  Apparently it doesn't make all those people sick.  Meats like pork and chicken are more dangerous and I don't know of any culture that eats those meats uncooked.    Steak tartare is also popular, it has a sauce in it which may chemically "cook" it, I'm not sure.    Raw fish is eaten all over the world,  raw shrimp with lime is eaten with chilis in at least Thailand.    Elephant liver was always eaten raw by the African natives.    Our western experience is limited, and wrought with stories of how dangerous everything is, including uncovered toilet seats.|`|6z7ArA7Xaa	I have eat raw chicken,beef and fish,oxes liver but I am very well it is no problem when the meat is raw ,fresh.Japanese chicken is not much salmonela egg too,I have eat raw many times,I like them.
LqwlAMJsaa	It depends on the situation.     A gift is yours PERIOD if it's given for a birthday or just because.     On the other hand, in the case of an engagement (engagement ring) or a wedding (wedding presents), the gifts are given on the condition of a particular event or life change. If the wedding or engagement falls through, etiquette dictates the return of these gifts. For example, a woman gets an engagement ring when she agrees to marry her husband. The origin of this custom is the use of a 'bride price,' where traditionally the family of the groom would pay the family of the bride because her family was losing a source of income (their daughter). A ring is the modern-day 'price' that the groom pays his future wife. If the wedding falls through, then she should return the ring.     Apart from reasons of tradition and etiquette, there are LEGAL obligations to return such gifts to the giver. There have been cases where a woman was forced to return the ring to her finance if she broke off the engagement. For example:    "The court found that if a woman refuses without legal justification to marry her fiance she cannot keep and must return any engagement ring.    "By turning down the offer of marriage, Ms Papathanasopoulos had rejected the "conditional gift" of the ring, the court found. "    Thus, to summarize, a regular gift (for gift's sake) is YOURS to keep, but a conditional gift, given ON THE CONDITION of a certain event or union, is only yours in the condition that the particular event takes place.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Yes, it's yours.|`|AA10574289	When she purchased the gift it belonged to her.

KTKxrP7naa	It means "spring" as in the season but also has other meanings, especially in combination with other characters. It can be used for meanings connected with sex or "wanton". The reason is that the character itself, according to many etymologies, shows the head of an animal as it emerges from the mother goat. Livestock give birth in spring, and this character suggest both meanings.    But, in most contexts, people will thing it means "spring time".|`|4sh2oRR7aa	It's  meaning Spring.

E7fguoVBaa	BEELZEBUB    (Be?elze?bub) [possibly an alteration of Baal-zebub, meaning Owner of the Flies, the Baal worshiped by the Philistines at Ekron. Alternately, Beelzeboul and Beezeboul, possibly meaning, Owner of the Lofty Abode (Habitation); or, if a play on the non-Biblical Heb. word zevel (dung), Owner of the Dung].    Beelzebub is a designation applied to Satan the prince, or ruler, of the demons. The religious leaders blasphemously accused Jesus Christ of expelling demons by means of Beelzebub.Matthew 10:25; 12:24-29; Mark 3:22-27; Luke 11:15-19.    LUCIFER    The name Lucifer occurs once in the Scriptures and only in some versions of the Bible. For example, the King James Version renders Isaiah 14:12: How art thou fallen from heaven, O?Lucifer, son of the morning!    The Hebrew word translated Lucifer means shining one. The Septuagint uses the Greek word that means bringer of dawn. Hence, some translations render the original Hebrew morning star or Daystar. But Jeromes Latin Vulgate uses Lucifer (light bearer), and this accounts for the appearance of that term in various versions of the Bible.    Who is this Lucifer? The expression shining one, or Lucifer, is found in what Isaiah prophetically commanded the Israelites to pronounce as a proverbial saying against the king of Babylon. Thus, it is part of a saying primarily directed at the Babylonian dynasty. That the description shining one is given to a man and not to a spirit creature is further seen by the statement: Down to Sheol you will be brought. Sheol is the common grave of mankindnot a place occupied by Satan the Devil. Moreover, those seeing Lucifer brought into this condition ask: Is this the man that was agitating the earth? Clearly, Lucifer refers to a human, not to a spirit creature.Isaiah 14:4, 15,?16.|`|29fDip0Eaa	Nope, they all owe me child support money, the bastards!|`|VqA8HDbCaa	Their is no difference.I do have an answer to another thing you may not even realize.I believe you are not an atheist because an atheist doesn't believe in satan either.You may however be a devil worshiper but that is yet to be known.  However I once was a devil worshiper but now I believe  in God full heartily|`|SwtaUd56aa	In Christian tradition and folklore, Satan, Lucifer, and Beelzebub are different names for the same figure.    In the Bible, Satan means adversary and refers to a spiritual being who, in the Old Testament, acts as a prosecutor in the heavenly court, and in the New Testament, an extremely sinister, destructive foe to those who follow God; in the New Testament, the name Beelzebub is used to describe this same figure. Lucifer is derived from a Latin word used to describe the morning star, or the planet Venus, which was believed by various groups to be a god; it translates a Hebrew word in the Latin Vulgate in a verse that describes the fall of the king of Babylon. However, a Greek word with the same meaning is also used to describe Jesus (who is clearly not Satan).|`|T4esqtuUaa	Listen they are all the same person satan has many names but the one that he is called the most is a liar and he is the father of lies yes satan is beelzebub.

Beelzebub is like a pagan deity so still in effect is doing the work of Satan. He is only one of numerous pagan Gods. Nimrod, Babel, Babylon are in it too. They will all be destroyed in Rev 17-18 etc This is very brief. There is lots more to this.   If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to  believe Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be  willing to turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word the  Bible and owning Him before others. May God bless you as you seek the TRUTH.  nev r|`|nZdq2GmTaa	ok, this is a confusing thing so i will put it in simplest terms for you    Satan, Lucifer, and Beelzabub are all ways of saying "satan". however, "satan" is actually a trinity. its said in the bible, im not just making this up out of my head.    God's trinity is The father (god) the son (jesus) and the holy spirit. they are all different, but are in a way the same person    the UNholy trinity consists of Satan, the antichrist, and the false prophet. they are also all different, but are in a way the same person.     hope i helped.|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	Nothing, It's just that satan came down as a serpent and convinced man to sin.

Since his Mom has asked Dad to take him out of life for a little while, it may be a perfect time for him to ask to see counselor.  Most insurance will cover this 100%.  If not he needs to see a preacher or counselor at school.  At the very least, visit the self help section of Barnes and Noble.    I was suicidal when I was younger.  It began when I was overstressed at college.  I wasn't even depressed.  But when I got hurt and publicly humiliated by a boyfriend, I yanked the handlebar on my motorcycle in a fit of drunken rage.  I thought that I had put it behind me after that.  Then I got addicted to coke.  Through a friends help, I realized that I was being suicidal in a backdoor kind of way.  I had to have a long talk with God.  I have been clean and unsuicidal for 22 years.    Please remember that God is not just for the sinless.  Having faith in having a purpose in God's ultimate plan can really help you keep going.  Suffering is temporary and meaningful.  Tell him to look hard for what God is trying to tell you.  Learn to get still, pray, and listen.  Listening to God is hard to learn.  You have to learn the difference between what God is saying and what your own selfish desires are saying in your head and heart.  You must learn that you are in control of your mind.  Reject suicidal thoughts as the evil one trying to keep you from becoming what God wants you to be.  Indeed, it seems he works the hardest to get those who are the most valuable to God.  So if you are living in turmoil, think of yourself as very valuable to God.  Tough through it, and talk to God daily.  Learn the Lord's Prayer.  It includes a prayer of protection.  Pray for faith and hope.  Pray for guidance and strength.  Tell him to write down his feelings.  That way he can let them go out of his mind.  He can always look them up again. Value yourself.  Believe it or not, God values you.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	As his boyfriend, the only thing you should do is be there for him. Be flexible, meaning cancel out things just to be there for your boyfriend.

There are people who will help him through this.|`|H1DrMEZxaa	You should talk to him about telling someone he trusts about his parents.  I'm not sure how old he is, but he should definitely not have to put up with his parents if they are abusive and absent from his life.  You just have to make sure that you are there for him in his time of need.  If he is not willing to talk to someone about his parents, he should at least talk to a counselor about the thoughts of suicide he has been having.  He could have depression, which is serious if it is not treated.  Just remind him that there are plenty of things to live for and be supportive!|`|kQX37cSdaa	tell him to look at this website  http://www.thetrevorproject.org/home1.as...|`|YiYA2VYyaa	i would take his suicide threats seriously. stand by him and let him know you love him. he needs counseling badly. do all you can to get him to a counselor who can talk him through this rough time. check out this site:    http://www.sprc.org/

Oll0CHkbaa	Police is based of the word polis (city in Greek). I believe pel?- would be the actual root but I don't have a root dictionary.    Aerial comes from eri(us) in Latin, meaning related to the air.    Empathy (which I have to assume is the root you actually want to know) is derived from the Greek emptheia-- em- as a directional towards an subject, -path- as a version of "to suffer", and -eia for relating to someone else.
AA11359317	How refreshing to find someone who can already see the hidden virtues of remaining celibate on the quest for spiritual knowledge. The law of chastity has been all but forgotten in this world of ours, it seems. But when people decide to adhere to it, beautiful worlds of hidden treasures of knowledge can be opened up. That is because keeping the law of chastity almost automatically frees your mind and soul up to learning more about spiritual things since you are transcending the selfish, natural psyche and putting your focus on the spiritual, intellectual development of yourself.|`|WjRqYf6naa	You are still young. It is likely that your feelings will change over time, but if they don't, then don't worry. It's your decision and yours alone.

If he's like most boys your age, he will move along rather quickly once he finds out there's no possibility of sex.|`|GPn55rjTaa	You are only 19.

Honestly, I'm guessing that will make it easier for him to walk away.|`|PlBYWZ8Saa	If your path is to remain celibate and learn, and you truly believe that to be your cause, then you can't really let anyone intervene with that.  The question I ask, is the celibacy core to your path, or do you merely not want anyone or anything to distract you from your pursuit of knowledge?     At the end of the day, you cannot allow someone to deviate you from your own personal path. Which means if that path DEFINITELY includes celibacy, then that's what it is, and you don't need to include anyone else. If you are merely considering celibacy as a means to avoid distractions in your pursuit for knowledge, well, eventually you might find someone who is willing to join you on that journey, and you can pursue the deepest kinds of knowledge together.     Not allowing emotion to come into the decision making process can be both a blessing and a curse here. But at the end of the day, if you want to end your interaction with this guy, then it is best to be up front with him about it, and tell him "Hey, I like you and all, but where I am in my life right now, I'm not able to sustain this relationship". He might still be hurt, but it is better than leading him on, only to let him down in future.      Edit - LDSMom is kinda right and kind of wrong. You might not ever feel the need for a marital partner, and that's okay. It might come to pass that you DO feel the need for a partner, and that's okay too. But don't ever force it. When and if you're ready for that transition, you'll know.|`|LxxrrKn9aa	Wow your not the only one. Most of what you said basically describes me all the way straight to the neutral part. No joke.

l8yfpyy1aa	I saw a book in the public library that described in detail the hormone treatments, psychological counseling, lifestyle adjustments, and eventual surgical procedures involved in changing from a male to a female.  They sounded very, very drastic.    To me (and I'm no expert really) it sounds more like you're wanting to be a transvestite.  These people are fully-functional males, many of them with families of their own, who just enjoy cross-dressing in female clothing.  Their wives are usually pretty understanding, so long as they do this only in private.     Some transvestites do go public with their cross-dressing, but it's rare, except perhaps in large cities where there are clubs where they can congregate.      We saw an interesting movie, "Kinky Boots" (2005) about a man who inherited his father's shoe factory, which made very conservative men's brougham oxford shoes.  Nobody was buying them any more, though, so he made the audacious decision to make fashion boots and shoes in men's sizes for dancers and transvestites.  One interesting thing about the film was that the people who played the factory workers actually were skilled shoemakers.    Another good movie was "Tootsie" (1982) where Dustin Hoffman plays a man who impulsively tries on his girl friend's clothes in an effort to understand her problems with self-esteem.  He gets more and more involved in this process, although he never loses his male identity.  It's a wry comedy, really, and showcases Hoffman's considerable talent as an actor.    You can look up more about these movies on us.imdb.com (the Internet Movie Data Base, a huge site giving information about thousands of movies, new and old).  Maybe they're still available for rental on DVD.|`|kdCqEgpUaa	It depends on if your 100% sure about that decision. That's a major change. So your looking to become a girl and you still like girls so you would have the surgery's for the organs and breast and then I guess become a lesbian in other peoples eyes. If that's what you want then go for it! People might despise you for it but who cares, just be happy and that's all that matters. Those surgery's are really expensive though so make sure you can pay for it! Good luck =D

YOWnMp0Xaa	I agree. They never seem to want to hear the answer.    Christian: "Why do Atheist believe in EVILUTION!!?"  Atheist: "Well, because there's am-"  Christian: (sticks fingers in ears) "LALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU"|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Well using the logic of some of the Christians who ask questions like "Why are there Atheists in the R&S section?  Is it because they are really searching for God?" - then I would say that the reasons a Christian would ask an atheist a question would be because they really don't have any belief in their system and are searching for the correct answers...|`|1oYjjp0Daa	The don't.  They preach by dressing up their surmons as questions|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Starting an argument or insulting will never be the purpose of a true christian when asking atheists questions.  If you want to make friends with people that are very different from you, the way to do it is to know them more and thereby understand how they view life looking through their eyes.  Before you know it, you have begun to like them.|`|AA11923447	I'm a Christian. I support freedom of religion, which includes freedom from religion. I don't expect everyone else to share my beliefs. I have many atheist friends, both online and in real life, and if I pose a question to them, it's because I want to learn something. Asking a question with the intent of starting an argument is, of course, counterproductive. Why would I waste my time arguing when I could be learning, instead?|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Acceptance of a supernatural claim tends to promote cooperative social relationships. This communication demonstrates a willingness to accept, without skepticism, the influence of the speaker in a way similar to a child's acceptance of the influence of a parent.  By encouraging this kind of behavior where the most intense social relationships occur it facilitates the lack of skepticism and deters more open minded thinking.    They realize that like a parachute the mind has to open to work and therefore they have to ask atheists!!!|`|BPcdVahWaa	Superiority complex or something of the like|`|441GSyaMaa	I wonder how many people will say something like "to spread the word of the wonderful to the non believers" lol     I know exactly what you mean - the arrogance behind it is annoying too

LuN1unJ3aa	Magic is generally defined as the application of an unknown science. Whether it involves illusion (distracting a person's attention away from the item) or a potion (a mixture of chemicals - the product of a drug company could be considered "magic") or just common sense, doesn't really matter.    Only the superstitious and ignorant think it is "of the devil".|`|KWeU8LJtaa	Well see, the thing is...there is no such thing as magic in my opinion, so..white,black,purple,rainbow magic..makes no difference to me personally.|`|HdmlZdyHaa	Not all music.

I feel so sorry for when those fanatics get hold of a country and even try to kill music, calling it Haram or what they call it.    Music is something wonderful.    Magic- I do not think there is such a thing.    If there is, I'd love for someone to prove it to me and cast a spell for me that will come true.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	I like the devil music from the White Stripes.    2002's De Stijl CD  "Why Cant You Be Nicer To Me?"|`|KrTkyc9Faa	The devil confused you... be wary of Chris Angel, he will confuse you, too.|`|jOwH96wKaa	There is no such thing as magic, or the devil.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	i'm so glad you corrected this -- i was going to ask what white music was....

But they say white magic can only be used to protect and never to harm, so I guess they see good in that. And magic does sort of exist, just not in the way of pixie dust, witches, and all that other bologna.|`|ROsPvxTIaa	For a second I was like wtf?    Well, I've never seen magic in real life so I don't believe magic exists, but who knows o.O...|`|LRsd01Dtaa	There is no such thing as magic.

Regarding magic I like to say the same. Not all magic needs to be dark and evil. I know at least one good witch. (She helps people by magical spells.)|`|NjSWQFBYaa	I agree.  I hate easy listening. It must be from the devil. This is why I only listen to rap.        I don't know of any Christians who practice "white magic", as that seems to be a pagan belief, but I'm sure there are probably some confused people out there somewhere.|`|FYQe54Akaa	Uh, no. Not all music is bad and I'm offended since I'm causcian (white). I like listening to Christian, Pop, and Country. That kind of music does not come from the devil. Music is what soothes us; we can not live without it. It comes from the heart and it's uplifting, inspirational, and also related.|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	Wow. What were you thinking about.     I think that what I think about it doesn't matter.
O7SshRl6aa	Marriage is a civil/legal joining of two people.  It is not religious in origin.    While many churches and other religious organizations, have put a religious spin on marriage and perform marriage ceremonies, what makes you legally married?  The license you get from your local city hall.      People married by a judge or sea captain are just as "married" as a couple who is married in the church of their choice.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Marriage is not necessarily a religious thing. It has existed outside religion since before Christianity was around and is found in cultures where it is not associated with religious beliefs at all. So no, I don't feel hypocritical for getting married. It was a promise cemented by a ritual ceremony to always be there for each other my husband and I made with the support of close friends and family. No gods or religions required.    In fact in my country if you want a religious ceremony you have to have second one. The first and legally recognized one is done in the equivalent of what you'd call the town hall or office and is what confers the legal standing and benefits of the marriage. The religious aspect is just for that, the religious beliefs of those who feel the need for religious and god sanction of their union.|`|U8yovU7yaa	The piece of paper bit isn't religious at all, i'd totally agree with that. It's just another wishy washy state law that says your entitled to half of the house when you divorce.     The unity of one man and one woman - the becoming of one flesh is indeed a spiritual thing. Christianity is about relationship not religion, marriage is an example of God's intention to live in community with him.|`|AA11969509	No, humans have been marrying long before there was religion.  In fact we were probably marrying even before we were a species.  Religion has taken over the initial ceremony, but most people remember the secular reception more than they do the ceremony.|`|RNKSq3iEaa	Clearly it's not a religious thing if atheists get married.|`|to8CkYp2aa	No, I don't feel hypocritical, and no, it isn't a religious thing.|`|84nXWNT3aa	No.    Christians didn't invent marriage.

No. I'm not married.     You do realize that people who aren't religious can be married in a civil ceremony, right?|`|IqqaA2wIaa	dont be mean to them..theres also the courthouse.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	so whats a civil service?|`|ViZH5twNaa	Well I've never been married, but I won't feel guilty when I do. Do you know why? Because marriage isn't a "religious thing". The relationship between two people is a "human thing" and in our society it is a "paperwork thing". Some people get married in a church, that doesn't make marriage religious. I have eaten donuts in a church before, does that make eating donuts a religious act?|`|vKmzcZZvaa	*sigh*|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	So, animals that practice monogamous mating are religious?|`|JqHkgWROaa	No, because marriage is not [just] a religious thing.|`|SqhGr6e3aa	Religion does not have the monopoly on marriage, honey.|`|OSz9q1m2aa	Marriage is not a religious thing.|`|W0Ovbpq0aa	They gonna say marriage is not a religious thing|`|rGEZup0Zaa	It isn't.

Theists: do you feel hypocritical when you take medicine, since you don't believe in evolution.  And if you do believe in evolution, how do you reconcile that with religion's historical teaching that man was made by the hand of God from the dirt of the Earth, and women from one of Adam's ribs?|`|GqNZInUbaa	do you feel hypocritical when a priest fondles an alter boy?|`|lQIKWXDuaa	What???

Religions can do any manner of ritual they want and without that piece of paper from the state or county, you ain't married.  Likewise you can get that piece of paper and never do anything at all religious (I was married with a friend officiating at a city park and volleyball court) and be married.  Religion is not even contingent, let alone a prerequisite, for marriage.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Marriage was designed by God, it is not a religious thing...

cNniG2L0aa	Alvis, I'll try to get it into your head ONE last time.    Atheists are NOT anti-'god' cos we don't believe such a creature exists.  That'd be like saying I was anti Thor, anti faeries, anti unicorn, anti tooth faerie.  It's silly to say those things, isn't it?    Well, it's silly to say atheists are anti 'god', too.    Invisible sky critters do NOT exist in my world.    HOW is it possible that a fully grown adult in the Western world could possible believe there are invisible creatures up in the sky sitting about on cloudies with an order form and a pencil just waiting for requests before granting all desires to every body ... especially white USians?  It is nothing short of ludicrous.    Do you smile at the African witch doctor spinning in circles, making incantations; imploring his gods to grant him whatever favour he needs or wants?  Of course you do; you think its just childish, superstitious nonsense thats typical of backward heathen natives.    There you have it  ~|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Absolutely YES!!    No one is anti god or anti Jesus!!    But you amply demonstrate why pople are so anti their followers!!!!    Ask yourself why it is only Christians that get attacked and not the other religions?!!!!    Do you not recognise that Christians are provoking retaliation and repudiation for their terrible attitudes?!!    Perhaps if Christians stopped their intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted postings things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped eschewing education, science, evolution works of fiction and much, much more things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped being the only religion opposing human rights and persecuting gays, pro choice and so much more things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped demanding freedom of religion whilst they deny it to all non Christians and persecute them things might change!! !!!    If Christians rediscovered the god of love and forgiveness and put aside all those terrible human emotions things would definitely change!!!!    Why are Christians so afraid of people who simply do not believe in any god?!!!! Surely it can only be because they are so afraid that atheist are right and they are wrong or it would not bother them!!!!!!    As soon as Christians rediscover the loving god and start acting like it the problem will cease!!!!|`|ulwXFrrJaa	yes.      atheists hate whichever version of God you believe of in the same way you hate whichever version of God you don't believe in.    I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours. -- Stephen Roberts|`|jBYxEX8taa	I think "Anti-God" falls more under Satanism.

Atheists are not Anti-God they don't believe in what society dictates they should believe in.    For example in ancient Rome the Christians (Pro-God) were the atheists because they did not  worship the god Caesar or the pagan gods and goddesses. When Christians came to power the pagans were called the atheists. Atheists may speak the truth.

The Bible says the "..world was void and covered with darkness.."  That tells me it was here just not as colorful and attractive as it is now.  If it was "void" it was like other planets - nothing grew here.  If "darkness" covered the face of it - then nothing could grow here.

The bible doesn't speak to this issue.  Maybe the rest - beyond Earth, is to keep us from thinking we're too big.  The other planets and stars kind of help keep us humble.    Maybe God invented the rest of the Universe as a way to give physicists and astronomers something useful to do with all their Math aptitude.  Even if we're the only life in the universe, the planets and stars are pretty amazing just to dazzle us.    In any case, God did not waste anything, and since He is infinite there is no chance that He will "run out" of creative potential.  Maybe He did it just to show us how amazing He is.  I'm definitely dazzled by the night sky.  The astronomers' and physicists' calculations of the size of the Universe just make me all the more impressed by God.

God also wants to tell us that He is beyond our knowledge and that He is beyond our imaginations and things we know that He can do.    God shows us individually that He is our creator and that He truly exists.    I read somewhere and source I forget that there was once an astronaut who was an atheist who traveled in space.  When he saw the earth from space and that of other planets he started to believe that God lives and exists.      God's ways for each and everyone is uniquely different from others.  People have come to be saints and was converted with just simple things just like a footprints in the snow like that of St. Josemaria Escriva to that of great things beyond the earth just like that of the astronaut who believed when he saw the universe.    GOd knows what can touch your heart and made everything possible to let us know that He loves us.
2gx2LgzEaa	It was wine, not grape juice, your right. but also it depends on who you ask unfortunately and peoples misconceptions for their own holier then thou views, so they take it out of context and make it what they want to make themselves feel better.    The water back then was not fit to drink in a lot of areas, and wine was not only more common, but as with any dinner more palpable and better with food! In fact it even goes on to say, in some verses when the water to wine story happened people were supprised that they served the best last, which most hosts would serve the best first so as the night went on the taste buds diddnt so much so they could get away with the cheap wine..    Anyways =p    there is absolutely nothing wrong with a glass of wine now, nor was there anything wrong then. some people take it to the extreme though; as well other dont serve it in church due to the kids. nut a huge part of it is simply the abuse of somethign which leads to the domonization of it.    goes hand in hand with Psychology 101, all extremes are dysfunctional.    but yeah the actual verse was dont be drunk on wine. nowhere does it say drinking wine was bad. And in fact the people that say they did not have wine considering sugar was not common, doesnt know a thing about making wine.    > Thus my point of taking things line by line and out of context. At the party, the water to wine which Jesus was there, again as i said above it was alcohol. as they said . It references wine all through the bible as far back as Genesis. In fact, a study in Jewish culture and practice reveals that "fruit of the vine" actually was a common way of referring to wine. and that even goes back to greek reference, in regards to Dionysis, aka the drunken god of wine aka "the fruit of the vine"    2nd john    "At a feast everybody gives his best wine at the beginning, and afterward, when his guests have drunk freely, he brings on wine that is not so good; but you have kept the good wine until now."    At the first supper, which was the FIRST communion, it was wine.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	I am still wondering at the morality of a person who would claim a Just Deity would ever have commanded the slaughter of children...either they didn't read it for themselves and are simply parrots for their evangelical overlords, or they are capable of imagining the slaughter of real live breathing babies when it suits them to advance their cause while laying down in front of Planned Parenthood with a political agenda of having their particular faith written into law|`|AA12071655	The whole thing is made up anyway so anyone is free to make it up to suit their own purpose.

Mark 14:25 "Assuredly, I say to you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."  Luke 22:18 "for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."    Please provide another example?

There are many books that were supposed to be included in the Bible but were left out because they contained too much truth. The church didn't want that so they created their own lies to put in and lead people astray. Such as the "apostle" Paul. Paul was no apostle.....he contradicts what Jesus says.   If Jesus said that He was the son of God then no one would believe Him...it's kind of a faith thing...when ppl did asked Him He said that He was the Son of God.|`|lw3AUOM3aa	Mark was the first one who wrote about jesus. we are not sure when he lived but it might be possible that he met jesus.

(i don't know the english word but in german it is called "Zweiquellentheorie") ... John wrote his like 120 years later.  Jesus said that he was the son of god.  the old testament was written way before jesus lived (which is proved, u should read Sueton, Tacitus or the Talmud).

Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, who wrote the four gospels, knew Jesus personally and were with him during his ministry.    Please read John in the new testament.  John was the acknowledged favorite of Jesus.  Read the words that he attributes to Jesus.  The original Holy Bible is a collection of documents written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.  What we read today, in the United States of America is a translation from those languages.  The King James Bible, which was a translation authorized by, guess who, King James of England, was translated to the language of the time.  The newer translations are into the language of our time.  That is not a "change" in the Bible but simply a use of language that we understand now rather than one we can only guess at.  May God bless you and give you knowledge and peace.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	OK first one, some of the gospel writers where eye witnesses, others became apostles to the apostles hence apostolic tradition   Second He did I and my Father are one etc etc..  Third He said quite a few times he came into the world to die for sinners.  There is no judgement for those in Christ, we are already saved, judgement is for the world who rejected him.  Last question The old and new are compiled into one book the bible divided into before christ and after, the old revealed the coming of Christ.  the real bible is the Catholic bible it has remained the same since 404 ad.  The bible has not changed over centuries the dead sea scrolls show this as they date back to the first century.    hope that helps, I know it's confusing looking in from the out side.

As far as the four gospels, it is suspected by scholars that they were written long after the events, probably at a distant place from the events, in a language (Greek) not spoken by the disciples.  It is suspected that the names, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were added by tradition long after they were written|`|ckLlUQfMaa	Those you mentioned DID know and literally walk with Jesus. The timeline for writing the books, one could only guess. Jesus did say He was the Son of God. He commented that it was His Father that sent Him,  & I must be about My Father's business ( a few examples) Prayer was the way God designed for man to communicate with Him. Jesus was a man at this time and His Father was in Heaven, thus prayer being the only means of communication.     You are absolutely right, Jesus DID NOT say he came to die for the sins of the world. That is something that religion has taught. (Keep this  in mind all you folks that want to give a thumbs down.) God DID NOT create a religion). Read the first 2 books of Genesis and you will see God's original intent and it has NEVER Changed. Jesus came to restore our rights to the Kingdom of God. Read all the passages written in red in the Bible and you will see that what Jesus talked about was the Kingdom of Heaven. His death did redeem us that we could be a part of that kingdom.     Unfortunately, Christians and believers are not able to read the original Bible, because of it's location. Again, another one of man's decisions to keep this locked up. It is better to keep it safe and in good condition. There are also several other gospels included in those writings. Not the Apocrypha, but more. It was King James, who was a rebel, that decided to leave out the Apocrypha. His translation was never approved. I would love to read the remainder of the original Bible.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	You are making assumptions and treating them as historical fact     The Bible was written by many writers.  The inspiration to write came from God at the time He chose.    What makes you think He did not say He is the Son of God?  It is recorded that He did.    One of His reasons for praying to The Father was to set an example.    There are many types and versions of the Bible, it will continue to evolve and change and has already become unrecognizable in many cases.    But the Holy Spirit bears witness of the Truth and helps one rightly divide His word.  The ability to discern the Word of God was given not to the wise, but to babes. (Those words are used by Jesus in a prayer of thanksgiving To God and is found in the Book Of Matthew).    His dying for the whole would means no one is excluded from the opportunity to be saved from judgment.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	>     -- The Apostles DID follow Jesus around.  However, the majority of their teachings were not written down as this was NOT the way people learned and NOT the way knowledge was passed on at that time. People learned orally and memorized things. THAT'S how knowledge was passed on. Writing came later by those who directly HEARD the teachings of the Apostles. -- This is very common of ancient writings. MUCH of what is attributed to Historical writers from antiquity was not actually penned by them, BUT was written by close associates of theres. This is true for much of what we attribute to Roman and Egyptian writings. - Many times "histories" or "historical" documents were written several decades, or in some cases hundreds of years later.    -- Paul wrote the most books of the NT and he did so as letters to other christian groups which were sprouting up around modern day Italy, Greece, Turkey and Israel.     -- Jesus is estimated to have been crucified in or around 32AD.  MANY of his apostles lived 'til around 57-70AD.  MANY of the NT books are believed to have been written around 70-95AD -- Within the lifetime of some of the apostles and DEFINITELY in the lifetime of those who Directly KNEW the Apostles.     As stated earlier.. this is actually, in many cases,  MORE authenticate then the information we have about OTHER cultures.  Much of what we believe about the Roman Empire was often times written about 100s of years AFTER it occurred.     >    "The Jews therefore said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?" Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am...." (John 8:57-58)    "I and the Father are one." The Jews took up stones again to stone Him. Jesus answered them, "I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?" The Jews answered Him, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God." (John 10:30-33)    "Do you know what I have done to you? You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for I am. If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet." (John 13:12-14)    " Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us." Jesus said to him, "Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how do you say, 'Show us the Father'?" (John 14:6-9)    http://www.everystudent.com/wires/whodoy...    >    Quite simple. -- An act being FOR an entire group and an act being APPLIED to individuals in that group is 2 different things.    Christ can die for ALL sins..but only APPLY that forgiveness to those who accept it.     The Analogy is THUS.. I can BUY gifts for everyone.. but only GIVE gifts to those who accept them. I can't FORCE my gifts on individuals simply because I bought enough for everyone.  NO,  I have to wait for the person I give it to.... to accept it.-- Otherwise it is not a gift.     Christ's salvation is a Gift,  because of this..he can't force it.  He extends it to everyone and in that way, his death was for ALL.  BUT, it is only "applied" to those who accept it.      >    Ahh.. you are a conspiracy theorist. -- No amount of evidence to the contrary will disprove that the TRUE, ORIGINAL bible is "hidden away" at the Vatican. -- Sorry I can't help ya there..your theory on this is based on a "cover up" and as such NO amount of evidence will disuade you.    The fact is that the Catholic church GAVE the world the Bible when it decided WHAT went into it between 250AD and 397AD (Final Council of Carthage decided the official canon of the Bible in 397).  The Catholic church had no reason to hide the REAL bible from anyone as it was used for instruction and reduced heresy by giving everyone an approved list of texts to use. Up until then..there were several "versions" of the Scripture running around.  One could not be sure what WAS fit for instruction and what wasn't.  Canonizing the bible helped to  Canonizing the bible helped to eliminate "local" differences  OR people who preyed upon the ignorance of others.     The Vatican is very much open to the public and MANY of its archives are open to scholars to use for research.  The Vatican is the largest repository of human knowledge in the world, and thus as, such,  is open to scholarly inquiry.    The Catholic church uses the American Standard Version in most U.S. churches and was the one to commission the Douay Rheims version of the bible which pre-dates the King's Jame version by several years.     The Catholic church still follows the original canon it approved in 397AD, where as NON-Catholic christians follow a copy of the OT which they modified around the 1500s when they removed 7 book|`|AA11924289	q1  these are not the first people to have written in the new testament, st paul was and he wrote in 40-50 C.E.  he was in Jerusalem and spoke with the apostles of jesus and spread the faith.  the gospel writers probably did not meet jesus, they were writing down the stories (oral tradition) which was present at their time.    the stories in the new testament began with jesus and his ministry, next people who met, saw, and knew him told others his story and from that his story spread..    there was not any necessity in those days to write down the story as the people at the time had an oral story telling culture,.. maybe with only 10% being able to read or write...  so it is very reasonable that the stories took so long to be written down.    q2  Jesus did not explicitely state that he was the Son of God becaues that would have been too much of a shock to those around him and it would have been seen as blasphemous.  at Jesus' time there were many differing ideas on what type of messiah there would be, for example some believed in a kingly messiah who would militarily establish gods kingdom on earth, others believed in a priestly messiah who would astound others with his knowledge and explanations of scripture...and others believed in the suffering messiah.  so within this society it would not have been acceptable for Jesus to explicitely state he was the son of god..........  BUT he did state it, look at the I Am (ego emi) sayings of Jesus in the Gospel of John, it is here that he states "I AM God."  on closer reading of the text it is possible to discern other examples which i cannot think of right now.    any way even if he said he was the son of god it would not have been accepted by others as they were waiting on a different type of messiah, they did not fully understand jesus.    it is found in the gospels that jesus said he is god because jesus did claim this.  even though these writers were not around when jesus was around it does not mean that they recorded events incorrectly    Jesus praying to his father is him displaying his human nature.  remember he was both fully human and fully divine, so naturally he can do this.  jesus and the father are distinct, and as such jesus praying or conversing with the father is true    q3  jesus did die for the sins of the world because, from the moment he went into jerusalem on the donkey he was fulfilling scripture.  people at the time knew the messiah would enter on a donkey and he was doing this, it just was that later people were to learn exactly what being the messiah entailed as i said above that they had differing ideas on what the messiah would be like    jesus dying for the sins of the world is not that we are forgiven for our sins, it means this:  we are sinful by nature, and cannot possible redeem ourselves, only god can do this,   so he sent his son who by being human could take on our sins, and by being god could forgive them...there is still a judgement    q5  you do not seem to understand how the bible came to be written down.  yes the bible has been changed in translation, there are enormous difficulties involved in translating from one language to another as the other language may not contain direct translations for words contained in the first.  the new testament is not the changing of the old testament, but rather the fulfilling of the old.    there is not some "magical" original bible locked up in the Vatican as you say. look your question displays much lack of knowledge, if you want to email me some questions r to challenge me on what i have said feel free to do so.|`|WvzS59FKaa	St. Augustine was once a man who had very deep questions about  Christianity, then one night he had a dream.  A child was trying to fill a pit of hole of water from the sea.  He realized that God's ways and thoughts are much greater than that of ours.      God's wisdom is like the sea and our human minds is just like the pit of hole, so small compared to the sea, wherein we would not be able to contain all of God's mysterious ways. That is the reason why faith is significant in our lives.

They did know and met Jesus. But, they did write their gospels years after Jesus was gone. Even Matthew went and completely revised his at least once before his passing. However, this revision is not part of the gospels as we know it today.    Jesus is the son of God, as we are all children of God. We are all one and the same. We all come from the creator, as we are part of the creator. When it is said that Jesus is God's only begotten - it means the only one of the time that actually GOT what it meant to be in a relationship with God and how to live a life according to how God wanted.    No, there is still judgment. Jesus did die for our sins, but not everyone believes in Jesus, or has sincerely asked for forgiveness and made the commitment to living a different life.    I have read several variations on the original texts. There is a new version being created now that goes from the Torah (Hebrew) into English.

Thanks for coming straight to the source. But you have gotten a few facts mixed.    1. The Old Testament was written before Jesus. It never mentions him by name. In the New Testament, most of the books are written by Jesus's first disciples, people who knew him personally, or even just people who met people who knew him personally.    2. Jesus did say he was the son of God. Also, he was in his human "form" so it was like talking to his father, who was also him. God is complicated, and he's not like human. He doesn't have the same limits. He can be two, three and one at the same time,    3. Jesus died for the sins of the world (and yes, it does say that) but we have to ACCEPT him. By just saying you're clean, he's forcing you to believe in him. He wants his followers to be by choice. So, you have to accept him to get to heaven, and to be a Christian and all that.    4. The Vatican is a Catholic place, not Christian. It mightn't be true. But there was always a New and Old Testament. The Old Testament was from before Jesus, the Jewish Bible, and the New testament is from Jesus and after, and a few other things, like Jesus's return and stuff.  The original bible... I doubt it really exists, if you look at how the Bible was made. There are probably a few originals, which were then copied word for word to produce more. This continued for hundreds (maybe a thousand) years, and then it was translated, I think, to Latin. Now it has been (very carefully) translated to other languages.     People are careful with translating. They know how important it is to have it near word-for-word perfect. Also, God will take care of his Word, so I'm not at all worried.    I hope you think my points legit, and realise. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were all Jesus's disciples and spent about 13 years (that was off the top of my head... don't shoot me!) with him.|`|uC0xTgkeaa	those are all good questions,    a lot of people who wrote the Bible were eyewitnesses, everyone else studied the life of Christ intently. Regardless of whether they knew Jesus or not, I believe that everything in the Bible was inspired by God, otherwise there would be contradictions.    Actually Jesus did say he was the son of God. That's what got him crucified. He prayed to his father because prayer is based on a Personal relationship with God. He was simply talking to his dad, which is what christians can do today.    Jesus did die for the sins of the world, but in order to receive salvation, all you have to do is ask and simply accept the gift.God only gives it to you if you tell him you want it.    It is true that there are differences in today's Bible from the original, it has been hand copied thousands of times before there were printers. It has also been translated many times, and there are many debates on how to translate it, but scholars and translaters do there best to keep the meaning the same so anyone can access it.    hope that helps, and if you have more questions feel free to email me.|`|84nXWNT3aa	The original version of the bible is even more hateful that the one we have now.

Peter, Matthew, and John were three of the 12 Apostles!    Jude and James were Jesus Half Brothers!

You need to hit the books Learn Hebrew if you need to. Study the original text. The one not translated or interpreted by some man. You have to look at the bible as both the teaching of Christ and a historical account of Christianity. Approach it like you would approach any history subject. I am not going to sit here and discuss my interpretation of the bible is or spit out of context quotes from the bible like some Christian people I know. Ask for Guidance for spiritual guidance while you discover the stories of Christianity on your own. Maybe you will discover something and share it with others. Just dont be a jerk trying to convince everyone that you spoke to God and he told you to start a NEW CULT for your profit. The people that suffers are the children who will swallow all of your Garbage and then they will blame God for not taking away your free will.     This is coming from a Christian.    ss|`|e566c7b6d9b860034b1ffaf13f380ee7aa	All of your information is wrong.  You are listening to people that do not know.

AA11047076	Synagogues have always existed- they have discovered remains of synagogues that are well over 2500 years old in various places in Israel.  Even when the temple stood, people still gathered in the places they live to pray three times a day and on festivals.  Those who could, made their way to Jerusalem, those who couldn't prayed at the local Beit Knesset (synagogue) which doubled as a study hall most of the time.    The Kohanim (priests) were divided n 24 watches, each serving for a week at a time- those who were not in Jerusalem, lead the prayer services in the synagogues outside of the Jerusalem- the right to do so going to the Kohen whose watch was on duty in the Temple|`|bXeHr69Vaa	originally everyone tried to get to the temple, after it was destroyed in a.d 70 the people built their own synagogues in the various towns , similar to what the christians do when the population builds up.

AA11703455	Descendants of Levi, third son of Jacob by Leah. (Ge 29:32-34) At times the term applies to the whole tribe, but usually it excludes the priestly family of Aaron (Jos 14:3,?4; 21:1-3); thus the expression priests and Levites is common. (1Ki 8:4; 1Ch 23:2; Ezr 1:5; Joh 1:19) Priestly duties were confined to the male members of Aarons family, with the Levites, the rest of the tribe, acting as their assistants. (Nu 3:3, 6-10) This arrangement began with the setting up of the tabernacle, as before this no particular family or tribe was assigned to offer the sacrifices.Ex 24:5.    Taken as a Ransom for Firstborn. The Levites were chosen by Jehovah in place of all the firstborn of the other tribes. (Ex 13:1, 2, 11-16; Nu 3:41) Counting from a month old upward, there were 22,000 Levite males who could be exchanged for the same number of firstborn males of the other tribes. The census taken in the Wilderness of Sinai revealed that there were 22,273 firstborn sons in the other tribes. Therefore, God required that a ransom price of five shekels ($11) be given to Aaron and his sons for each of the 273 firstborn in excess of the Levites.Nu 3:39, 43, 46-51.    Duties. The Levites were made up of three families, from Levis sons Gershon (Gershom), Kohath, and Merari. (Ge 46:11; 1Ch 6:1) Each of these families was assigned a place near the tabernacle in the wilderness. The Kohathite family of Aaron camped in front of the tabernacle to the east. The other Kohathites camped on the south side, the Gershonites on the west, and the Merarites on the north. (Nu 3:23, 29, 35,?38) Setting up, dismantling, and carrying the tabernacle was the work of the Levites. When it was time to move, Aaron and his sons took down the curtain dividing the Holy from the Most Holy and covered the ark of the testimony, the altars, and other sacred furniture and utensils. The Kohathites then carried these things. The Gershonites transported the tent cloths, coverings, screens, courtyard hangings, and tent cords (evidently the cords of the tabernacle itself), and the Merarites took care of the panel frames, pillars, socket pedestals, tent pins and cords (cords of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle).Nu 1:50,?51; 3:25, 26, 30, 31, 36,?37; 4:4-33; 7:5-9.    The work of the Levites was highly organized under David, who appointed supervisors, officers, judges, gatekeepers, and treasurers, as well as a vast number to assist the priests in the temple, the courtyards, and the dining rooms in connection with the offerings, sacrifices, purification work, weighing, measuring, and various guard duties. Levite musicians were organized into 24 groups, similar to the priestly divisions, and served in rotation. Duties were determined by casting lots. In the case of the groups of gatekeepers, the particular gate assignment was chosen in the same way.1Ch 23, 25,?26; 2Ch 35:3-5,?10.    In Moses day it was at 30 years of age that a Levite assumed his full duties, such as bearing the tabernacle and its articles when it was being moved. (Nu 4:46-49) Some duties could be performed from the age of 25, but apparently not the laborious service, such as transporting the tabernacle. (Nu 8:24) In King Davids time the age was reduced to 20 years. The reason David gave was that the tabernacle (now to be replaced by the temple) would no longer have to be carried about. Assignments of obligatory service terminated at the age of 50 years. (Nu 8:25,?26; 1Ch 23:24-26;) The Levites needed to be well versed in the Law, often being called upon to read it in public and to teach it to the common people.1Ch 15:27; 2Ch 5:12; 17:7-9; Ne 8:7-9.    Maintenance. Maintenance of the Levites was mainly by tithes from the other tribes, a tenth of everything produced from the ground and the cattle being given them. The Levites, in turn, passed on a tenth of this to the priests. (Nu 18:25-29; 2Ch 31:4-8; Ne 10:38,?39) Also, though the Levites were exempt from military service, they, along with the priests, shared some of the spoils of battle. (Nu 1:45-49; 31:25-31; see TITHE.) The Levites received no territorial allotment in Canaan, Jehovah being their share. (Nu 18:20) However, other tribes of Israel gave them a total of 48 cities scattered throughout the Promised Land.Nu 35:1-8.    Provided Supporters of True Worship. The Levites supplied some notable examples of enthusiasm for true worship. This was evident in the golden-calf incident and again when Levites moved out of Jeroboams territory following the split in the kingdom. (Ex 32:26; 2Ch 11:13,?14) They were also zealous in their support of Kings Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah as well as of Governors Zerubbabel and Nehemiah and the priest-scribe Ezra in their efforts to restore true worship in Israel.2Ch 17:7-9; 29:12-17; 30:21,?22; 34:12,?13; Ezr 10:15; Ne 9:4, 5,?38.    As a tribe, however, they did not support the Son of God in his work of restoration, although some individual Levites became Christians. (Ac 4:36,?37) Many of the Levite priests became obedient to the faith. (Ac 6:7) With the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple in 70?C.E., the family records of the Levites were lost or destroyed, bringing the Levitical system to an end. But, a tribe of Levi constitutes part of spiritual Israel.Re 7:4,?7.|`|ad6XOMliaa	I understand that "Levi" means law giver; as in the scribes whose job was to study God's laws, and rule on their applicability of things that occurred in the daily live of the Israelites. When the Israelites were given the "promised land", The Levites were given no land, so to be fair each of the other tribes were to give 10 % of their crops to the Levites. -- It was the first time in the Bible that tithing was conducted. (The system comes out pretty close to each tribe getting an equal share)|`|aO4iCwtoaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levite is accurate and covers most of your questions|`|k03dYskYaa	I'll take the Who were they?

C8gLsP3Taa	Paul was led to describe the inspiration of the Bible in these words in Second Timothy 3: 16& 17 "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works" (or thoroughly equipped for every good work.)|`|kD4BBKARaa	Dear Sister - it seems to be because of the way the Bible is written. You see, no other book is like it in the history of mankind. To the Christian, they can go to the Bible, open at page one and find out how everything was created, likewise right throughout all the way to the very last chapter where we learn what eternity future is like. God wrote it and gave it to us in such a way that His people can just pick it up and know it is His inspired Words.     We learn so much about history and how the flood of Noah is responsible for many fossil and geological formations, and it is historically accurate.    We read of the prophecies pointing to Jesus thousands of years before He came to earth and of His birth, life, death and resurrection. And in the Bible so many, many things in one way or another are a spiritual illustration pointing towards our LORD Jesus Christ, He is the nucleus or center of everything in the universe, of everything that is good! For example the rock Moses struck pointed to Christ, the animal sacrifices pointed to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, the sufferings of Job and Prince David spiritually pointed to Christ; we know in Ezekiel 34 the prophet uses David to paint a spiritual portrait or "type" of Christ.    So I think the reason is that most believe that its all good.|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	Lets see what the bible says about scripture and how those people in the bible viewed scripture. Starting with Jesus http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea... and http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo... and http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea... We also find Jesus warning the most religious people in his day that they have made the word of God of no effect with their empty traditions http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo... In Hebrews we find out that the word of God is quick and powerful The words quick means alive http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo... id=65&chapter=4&verse=12&version=9&conte... We are also told all scripture is given by inspiration of God http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo... We are also told that a certain group of people were cosidered more noble because they searched the scripture to see if what they were being told was true http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo... it was also important to Jesus that scripture be fulfilled.http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo... Notice here how Paul warns about those who delver a different message than the one they delivered.http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea... Also do a word search for it is written or as it is written and you will quickly see how important it was to Jesus and the early church that scripture was fulfilled. Clearly God considers scripture important and as much as we can value from men's teaching we have a responsibility to make sure what we are being taught is in line with what scripture actually teaches. And we have a responsibility to reject what scripture doesn't teach. As the apostle Paul if someone preaches another gospel other than what we have preached let them be accursed.|`|762fd848c7be39ffa61d980d33368b2baa	errant|`|yo0uFX9Jaa	Because they view it as the Word of Almighty God.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	It is not protestants but the fundies!!

Before we consider what this means, lets consider what it does not mean.    It does not mean that the Bible is the only place where truth can be found.   It does not mean that the Bible is equally clear to all people.   It does not mean that the instruction of Church is not helpful and authoritative.    It does mean however, that the Scriptures are our only ultimate and infallible authority for faith and practice. We are not talking here however about "solo Scriptura" which might be what we would call those who want themselves to be the only teachers (the "just-gimme-me-and-my-Bible" group) and to repudiate all others. We are however saying that the Scriptures are our final authority and that they are infallible. All other authorities, even though equally as valid, are subordinate to the Scriptures and are fallible.    "14 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,15 and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work." 2 Timothy 3:14-17 NKJV    Central to the question of Sola Scriptura is the question of sufficiency. The Protestant understanding is that the Scriptures are complete and that they are absolutely sufficient for all that we need for instruction in righteousness, faith and salvation. There is a distinction to be made between formal sufficiency and material sufficiency. The first pertains to whether the Scripture alone (apart from instructors, parents, and church discipline) is sufficient for all training. The second concept states that the message or content of the Scripture is sufficient. The Protestant position is that God has given the offices and authority to the Church. However in all cases the content of the Scriptures is ultimately authoritative.    Hope this helps.    Elder Greg  ~SFECU~  pray4revival

Hfej50Uhaa	Confirmation is typically a public profession of your faith.  Usually it is in a worship service, or at least in the presence of witnesses, it is spoken (could be a simple vow, like "I do" in response to a number of questions) and usually there is some instruction or indication that you understand what 'faith' you are professing.  Ages vary within denominations, but the earliest is usually when a young person can properly discern life issues and decisions.    Google: confirmation methodist and you'll find lots of good examples and background.    Link below is our church's form for public profession of faith. (Canadian Reformed Churches)
NFK3A68oaa	Good question.  There is plenty of evidence of an intelligent Creator in the world of living things.    For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.    If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution?     My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance?     Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?    How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"    The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage).     So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"    All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?    This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...

E0lMycUeaa	thanks for asking about islam.i think before answering your question we need to know about verse 7 in chapter 3    here is the context    003.001  Alif, Lam, Meem.    003.002  Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence.    003.003  He has sent down upon you, [O Mu?ammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.    003.004  Before, as guidance for the people. And He revealed the Qur'an. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution.    003.005  Indeed, from Allah nothing is hidden in the earth nor in the heaven.    003.006  It is He who forms you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.    003.007  It is He who has sent down to you, [O Mu?ammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah . But those firm in knowledge say, "We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord." And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.     now answering you Question about the divinity of Jesus in the light of Quran    005.116  And [beware the Day] when GOD will say, "O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides GOD ?'" He will say, "Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.    005.117  I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship GOD ,my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness.    Deuteronomy, chapter 5  7: Thou shalt have none other gods before me.  8: Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:    Deuteronomy, chapter 6  4: Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:    Mark, chapter 12  29: And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:     005.072  They have certainly disbelieved who say, " Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary" while the Messiah has said, "O Children of Israel, worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord." Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.    005.073  They have certainly disbelieved who say, " Allah is the third of three." And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.    005.074  So will they not repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.    005.075  The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.    005.076  Say, "Do you worship besides Allah that which holds for you no [power of] harm or benefit while it is Allah who is the Hearing, the Knowing?"    005.077  Say, "O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way."    i ask Allah to guide you ,me and all people   amen    BR  basem    you choose from Quran what you can wrongly interpret exactly as the above verse (3:7)saying.all what i do is giving the direct verses that you cant change or interpret  in case you think Quran from different sources why not following the challenge of Quran and produce one chapter like it?|`|FpMS47sXaa	You are WRONG.    This reference in the Koran spoke of the angel, Gabriel - being sent to give the messages to Mohammad. Gabriel, took human form (as it pertains to this story).    Jesus was a man, created in the womb of Mary. He is God, as we are all of God, and part of God.        EDIT: I do understand. I have read the Koran. But it seems as if it is you that does not understand. You are making claims in an effort to convert.    Shame.|`|tJBvGea5aa	I think i understand what you are trying to say    The thing is in Ayah 6:9, Allah is talking hypothetically, He is saying that if We were to send a Prophet to mankind who is an angel (althought it is not true and never will be), We were to make him look like a human being so that humans can communicate with him. but this is only hypothetical, it has not happened and never would because Allah sends human Prophets to humans so that we can look up to them and consider them our Role Models not Angels whom we cannot follow.    God Bless You :)    Edit: @ Asker:    it is really obvious that you are having a big misconception. The thing is Gabriel was sent to Muhammed (PBUH) with the Quran, but he was not the Prophet who interacted with humans in order to deliver the message to them. He was a messenger to give The Holy Book to Muhammed (PBUH), but is Muhammed himself (A MAN) who guided  human beings on earth to believe in God not Gabriel.    And again, with Loot (PBUH), the Angels who were aquired human characterisitics came to Loot to inform him of God's orders, but it was Loot himself (A MAN) who guided human beings on earth to believe in God, not the Angels.    And again with Jesus (PBUH), he himself (A MAN) who guided human beings on earth to believe in God, not Gabriel.      So God has not sent angels to guide human beings to follow him or to spread any Holy Book to the people, this is the humans' mission (Prophets). so it never happened and never will...    So, you see i do understand the Quran, it is you who obviously have a serious misconception about the whole thing. I hope you understand...

tpDICzslaa	This is a big question, and it would take a book to list all the differences. The following are just a few.    1. The Roman Catholic liturgy was traditionally in Latin. The Orthodox Churches use other languages, including Greek, Russian  and Syriac.     2. The Orthodox Churches allow married priests. The Roman Catholic Church (with very rare exceptions) does not.    3. The Orthodox and Catholic Churches use different ways to calculate the date of Easter, so that in most years they end up celebrating the feast on different days.    4. The Catholic Church recognises the Pope as having supreme spritual authority on earth. The Orthodox churches dispute this.    5. The Catholic Church recognises a number ecumenical councils which the Orthodox Churches do not (eg Trent, Vatican I, Vatican II).    6. The Catholic Church accepts the 'filioque' clause (Google it) in the Nicene Creed. The Orthodox churches consider it to be an unjustified addition.    Having said this, the things which unite the Catholic and Orthodox churches are greater than those that divide them. Both are in broad agreement on nearly all major points of doctrine and most of the differences between them are cultural,. Cultural differences are not barriers to unity, as there are already many churches (eg Maronite Catholic Church, Chaldean Catholic Church, etc) which are culturally distinct from the Roman Catholic Church yet in a full state of unity with it.|`|AA11690436	The Orthodox traditionally said mass in Greek, and the RC traditionally said mass in Latin.  Also, I don't think priestly celibacy is required by the Orthodox Churches.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Doctrinally, not very much.  The Orthodox churches and the Roman Catholic Church spilt over the authority of the Holy See of Rome, or the Pope.  The Orthodox church thought to Pope was given too much Authority.  The only other major difference bewtween the two is the Holy Trinity.  The Orthodox believe the divinity of the Holy Spirit comes only from God, the Father.  The RC believes the Holy Spirit comes from the Father and Son.  There are other minor differences, but only a religious scholar could realy describe what they are.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	more strict. Only the priest walks on the altar..|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Same category.

Orthodox are not that different from RC really.  One obvious difference is the orthodox allow priests to marry, but if they do they can't become bishops.|`|mfSp38yzaa	Different Popes since the Great Schism (both sides believe themselves to be in apostolic succession). Also, the Orthodox believe in Consubstantiation (bread and wine coexist with the Body and Blood of Christ) and Roman Catholics believe in Transubstantiation (the bread and wine BECOME the Body and Blood of Christ).|`|o9cAl8xhaa	One is Christ's True Church,    The other is a schismatic sect.|`|LqetdhxBaa	The Eastern Orthodox Church split from the catholic church in 1054AD. They reject the authority of the pope and do not enforce any Catholic doctrines made after 1054AD. They also strongly belief they are the true church, thus persecute other religions in countries that are primarily orthodox ie Greece. Despite these differences, they are very like Catholic ie. they worship idols (Commandment  2), they worship on Sunday (Commandment  4)
cAnha6sjaa	Humans are uniquely burdened by foreknowledge of their own deaths. Because of that other animals only taste of death but once, while humans die a thousand times before their deaths.    Religion and denial are a couple ways humans deal with it.|`|WvzS59FKaa	it's sad to hear that you are an atheist.  What is the choice of goodness, sacrifice, and love for without the faith of eternity?  It surely will be a life that will only lead to temporary pleasure which will eventually lead to death.    if you have a loved one and is sick you would rather be with your loved one instead of partying because you know your being beside the person you love and will bring much benefit for tomorrow.  And that act of love brings us to the existence of eternity.    Life here on earth goes beyond, it may be difficult living and surviving today but when taken with a choice of patience and sacrifice- a great reward is given, a reward of eternity.     Ever experience wanting something so bad and when you get that thing you enjoy it only temporarily and want something more and something else?  that is an experience of eternity because our real happiness lives with God alone.    Christianity leads people to reach eternity and teachers people to live a life of goodness here on earth.      Our hearts will be restless until it rests in God - St. Augustine    They say that when you die, your soul will leave your body.  You will be in a dark narrow void tunnel alone and there will be a bright light.  A movie of your life on a huge television screen will be flashed in front of you.  The bad things that you have done will be in slow motion and you will be able to realize the truth about how God loves you.  This realization of knowing how you offended Him will create great pain in your heart.  And you will be given a choice to accept Him or not.    Your choice will lead you to place where you will stay for eternity.  If you choose to be with Him, a high staircase is to be climbed and the strength that you will have to climb that staircase are the things you've done here on earth out of great love, sacrifice, patience, humility and obedience.      Watch an ad of a video of somehow that will happen after death at www.catholicscomehome.org/    Did you know that you cannot separate yourself from Christianity?  This time of the year 2009 is the age of Christ, Jesus died in the year 33.    If you won't find God, GOd will definitely find you in such mysterious ways.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Yes, the end is a frightening prospect, ignorance has shown to be detrimental to how we live, without a book to guide us, how can we find true faith?

From Plato's Republic Book One  (Ask Mommy )    "For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the weakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings."

A time of fasting and prayer is simply a time of intense fortification of one's own spirit and nuturing of faith for a particular matter, attribute or quality of God's word. It is not a way to get God to hear you!  It really has nothing to do so much with talking to God, as it has to do with dealing with one's self. Fasting gives one a rapid intensification of faith in an area where they may be lacking faith or are being greatly oppressed in their faith! Fasting and prayer is a time in which one will devote themselves to becoming pregnant with faith for their vision(goal), so as to give birth to the kind of faith needed for the kind of vision you are praying for.  Jesus said in Matthew 17:21, "This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting," meaning this kind of faith-the kind of faith that it takes to move mountains.

Today, these visions are understood. They're called "hallucinations". The "demeanor" (for want of a better word) of these hallucinations can be guided by preparing your mind through chants or prayers.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Fasting is one of the most spiritual practices you can ever engage in.    Many religious traditions practice it and there are about as many variations of it as there are types of meditation.    I'm not religious and I fast regularly (at least once a month) and some times for consecutive days at a time.    You have to be away from people and the media flood. Outdoors and away from the city is the best way to do it.    Meditation and prayer are indistinguishable for me but like I said, I'm not of any religion.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Fasting is prayer your offering your body to God.  Both bring you closer to God and enlighten you to a deeper level of Spirituality.|`|4fTiCNiKaa	Prayer and fasting are combined in the Old Testament in times of mourning, repentance and/or deep spiritual need. Nehemiahs prayer and fasting as described in the first chapter of his book resulted from his deep distress over the news that Jerusalem had been desolated. The devastation that befell Jerusalem also prompted Daniel to adopt a similar posture: So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes (Daniel 9:3). Like Nehemiah, Daniel fasted and prayed that God would have mercy upon the people, saying, We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws (v. 5).     In several instances, fasting is linked with supplicatory, intercessory prayer. David prayed and fasted over his sick child (2 Samuel 12:16), weeping before the Lord in earnest intercession (vv. 21-22). Esther urged Mordecai and the Jews to fast for her as she planned to appear before her husband the king (Esther 4:16). Clearly, fasting and petition are here one and the same.     There are instances of prayer and fasting in the New Testament. The prophetess Anna never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying (Luke 2:37). At age 84, her prayer and fasting were part of her service to the Lord in His temple as she awaited the long-promised Savior of Israel. Also in the New Testament, the church at Antioch was fasting in connection with their worship when the Holy Spirit spoke to them about commissioning Saul and Barnabas to the Lords work. At that point, they prayed and fasted, placed their hands on the two men and sent them off.     These are some examples of prayer and fasting as components of worshipping the Lord and seeking His favor. Fasting along with prayer indicate the sincerity of the pray-ers and the critical nature of the situations in which they find themselves.     Fasting is a theology of priorities in which we are given the opportunity to express ourselves in an undivided and intensive devotion to the Lord and to the concerns of our spiritual life. This devotion will be expressed by abstaining from such normal and good things as food and drink, so as to enjoy a time of uninterrupted communion with our Father. Our "full freedom to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus" (Hebrews 10:19), whether fasting or not fasting, is one of the most delightful parts of which is ours in Christ. Prayer and fasting should not be a burden or a duty, but rather should be a consecrated celebration of God's goodness and mercy to we His children.    God bless, and may the cry of all Christians be...    "Give us revival Lord, ere we die!"    Elder Greg  ~SFECU~  pray4revival|`|70nLbKKjaa	i like this question, lol    okay, both prayer and fasting are very spiritual things. when you pray, you are right in front of God, and he's listening to you more closely than usual, (he always knows what's going on, but during prayer, he listens more closely) and during fasting, when your body is asking for food, and you still abstain from food, you get closer to God as well. Because fasting symbolizes the poor folk who can't afford to eat on a daily basis, and by us fasting, and seeing how they feel makes us feel more charitable, makes us closer to God,  and makes him very happy with us.     So -- long story, short -- They are both linked because they both bring us closer to God, and he becomes happy with us.|`|VHwM54iUaa	It's a dying to the flesh.  As we are repenting of our sin and dying to the flesh, we are not only cleaning our spirit out, we are opening the doors of blessings by our obedience and humility.

f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	You're probably referring to the story where Jesus casts out the demons, and the crowds mutter that his power must be demonic.  To which Jesus famously responds, "A house divided cannot stand!"    However - a house united in a deception most certainly can.    So Satan empowers Jesus, and Jesus is in on the deal.  Satan sends a few demons to possess a guy.  Jesus comes along and does this whole fancy shmancy "DEMON BE GONE!" routine, then leans in, "hey boys, they're buying it.  Go ahead and head back to the pit now."  So the demons leave to keep up the ruse.    And a bunch of idiots get dupped into thinking Jesus commanded them and was the Messiah, when he was really in league with the forces of darkness.|`|pFZtcix8aa	Probably in some sort of foreign car,  I would imagine.|`|OSz9q1m2aa	By the driven out Satan simply PRETENDING to be driven out.

31cc91292d4acf2ddc9a6d449e86868eaa	I believe abortion is terribly wrong. I actually went to the March For Life last year. Wasn't able this year. I think it's amazing how FOCA has gone by nearly undetected from the public. FOCA requires abortions to be funded by taxpayers, forces hospitals to perform abortions (not exactly "force" but basically if the hospital doesn't change their rules on abortion they will lose gov't funding), and it removes all existing (but barely followed) laws requiring parents to know if their minor daughter is having an abortion. Crazy stuff. I believe that it'll be immediately challenged (actually I know) and will be reviewed by the supreme court. Who knows what their ruling will be.|`|BYTrrqN6aa	I dislike abortion and would discourage it.    However, I am pro-choice. I firmly believe ONLY the mother should make that choice. It is her body first and therefore her choice.    "If you can't state your opinion in a polite and professional manner, please don't state it at all."  "Please don't give me the "I'm not pro-abortion, I'm pro-choice" nonsense. Whether you want abortion legal for the mother's sake or jsut to kill an unborn child, you are in favor of the murder of a helpless baby."    I thought you said be polite and professional? Would it not be great if you followed what you yourself said? Saying someone is in favor of murdering a helpless baby is not true, or polite.|`|5e50c0ab71cc45110b7754fc5ce9ee2daa	There is absolutely no reason that you can give to me that could justify the killing of an innocent little baby for someone else's sin or inconvenience.                    Kp|`|5tMCDu8gaa	I'm pro-choice. I don't "favor" abortion. I simply think it is only reasonable to allow people free choice over their own bodies. We tried making abortion illegal - the result was thousands of deaths and MILLIONS of unwanted children.    A woman's choice to remove a tumor from her uterus is no one else's business. And that's all a 1st trimester fetus is - a tumor.    EDIT: To those saying "deal with the consequences," is that all a child is to you? A consequence? And doesn't a child deserve a mother who thinks of them as more than just a burden?    And don't say adoption - we both know there are millions of children who spend their lives bouncing around foster homes every few months. That's not a childhood.    EDIT: You say you want other people's opinion and want to discuss it intelligently, and then start calling everyone who doesn't agree with you an evil baby-killer?    What is wrong with you? Is that your idea of intelligent discussion?|`|bJnNNpZdaa	Personally, I feel that if you are immature and silly enough to have sex, then get pregnant, then you should deal with the consequenses.

They might go to extrems to terminate the baby like beating there tummies and even suicide.    But as you said "But regardless of the circumstances, I believe that it is wrong to take the life of an unborn baby".  You have to know no woman  walks into an abortion hospital with a smile on her face.      But what about woman who know they cant take care of the baby(already down in a financial problem). You have to relize most women that get abortions early in there life have extrame guilt for the rest of there live so they go through depression especialy if they have a baby later in life(Like they got an abortion in high school or something like that) they get guilty that they picked one baby over another   so you have to rememder abortion is hard for everyone  I hope I helped Sorry if I didnt|`|FhXzlnDOaa	I am pro-life because...well, I think that label says it all, don't you?  Why would I be pro-death, which is what pro-choice is.  It's not allowing a woman control over her body.  It's giving her control over the life that is growing in her body.  It's not a tumor or a parasite.  It's life.    Another reason is because every woman I've known who's had an abortion, regrets the decision.  I know 2 women who cannot have children now because of the abortion they had years ago.  It's ironic that they ended up adopting babies whose birth mothers loved them so much, they decided not to murder them.|`|ScmAk5EVaa	I believe abortion is infanticide and as such is murder and wrong.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	Abortion is murder.    Anti abortion, anti war, anti capital punishment.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	Abortion quite simply is murder.     If there had been no abortions last year, we would have (I think) approx 1.5 million more babies alive this year.      A lot of people will say, "well we don't know when life actually enters the body."      I say, Then how dare you take the chance with something like that?      I hate hate hate the fact that people will say that they will have an abortion because they can't handle a child right now.  First, you shouldn't have been sleeping around in the first place, and second, you being inconvenienced is not an appropriate basis for the murder of a baby.     It's flat out wrong.    EDIT:  Cassie....   "A woman's choice to remove a tumor from her uterus is no one else's business. And that's all a 1st trimester fetus is - a tumor."    That is absolutely disgusting.  It is not a tumor, it is a growing human life.  And yes, it is someone elses business.  It is the defenseless child inside this mother's business.    "EDIT: To those saying "deal with the consequences," is that all a child is to you? A consequence? And doesn't a child deserve a mother who thinks of them as more than just a burden?"    How can you say that and then say, "so just kill it."  In your arguements, aren't you just saying that the child is a "consequence" that they don't want to deal with?    "And don't say adoption - we both know there are millions of children who spend their lives bouncing around foster homes every few months. That's not a childhood."    Very good, so lets kill it instead.  Lets apply that logic to the mentally handicapped.  People have crippling mental handicaps sometimes.  That is a very bad life.  So should we kill them?   NO.|`|FDsopi1Taa	That is a difficult question to which obviously you have already made up your mind and judged those that disagree with you.  My best friend in high school, Brenda K. was 16 when she got pregnant by her boy friend whom she loved dearly. He dumped her when he found out. Birth control pills were unavailable at the time, pregnant girls were not allowed to go to school and unmarried pregnant girls were outcasts. She couldn't handle the problems and took her life. I have never forgotten her. I truly wish she had had the option to have an abortion. Two lives were lost instead of one.   The issue is not as black and white as your tone tries to imply.      I know you gave me the thumbs down.  lol   By "discuss it intelligently" you obviously mean "agree with me".  That's ok.

Those who are 'pro-choice' believe that sometimes it can be the lesser of two evils.    I am 'pro-choice' because I am a man, and I do not have the right to tell a woman what to do with her body.    I am also anti-abortion because in my life I have made sure that no-one has ever had to make that choice because of me. I wonder how many 'pro-life' men cannot say the same.

EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    Only the Holy Spirit can "teach" about spiritual things.  Theological Seminaries can't.  The professors teach you "their" opinions and/or the books "they" published. I know "personally" of a theological seminary that does not require any student to bring their Bible to class, because required reading is on the books "they" (the professors) published.  Man's opinion, doesn't count.    The enemy (Satan and his demonic wrecking crew) have their tents set up on these seminary campuses.    Many mighty men and women of God in the Bible, were "ordinary" people, whom God called...to carry out His extraordinary plan.  He still works that way...today.    Only a person who is "called" by almighty God, has the right to stand behind a pulpit, and even then...they will be held "seriously" accountable for what they preach, because they had better be led by the Holy Spirit; and back up their preaching/teaching by the Word of God.|`|48dkKzYnaa	Paul ???

The parents are going to give their kid the same lifestyle they have, and they might as well "train" them for it. There are stereotypes involved with wealthy children. I have grown up in private schools, and the stereotype of snotty butt nosed rich kids is generally untrue. The kids I knew were mostly very nice and well mannered.

Its altogether a bad idea. I can understand if you want them to go to bed full warm and happy, but there is a way to overdue everything....except for praising and worshiping God..... but other than that, you have to really ask yourself..... who do you want your kid to become.... one that's learned how to work, and make a living,how to support himself even if the market crashes, how to be loving, considerate, and not asking for money when his or her lives fall apart.... unselfish, and giving.......or just the opposite?? your choice....|`|2f64bcbff1164d7d3d76ac0fefcf633baa	I think you are confused. I was raised to take care of things, to be honest, to work and be respectable. My sister was, too. My brothers were not.   The difference? My dad and step mother got increasingly wealthier as the kids grew up.   I got luggage for my graduation from high school, so I could travel back and forth to college.  My sister? She got a used car, so she could drive to work.  My first brother got a full Sears tool-box and tools for his business.   My last brother got a brand new Z-28 for his 16th birthday and proceeded to wreck it and HIT a cop.   We started out lower middle class and got to upper-yacht club class in about 10 years.     My brothers are both drug addicts today, and my sister and I have good jobs, families, and enjoy our lives.  This is not about the content of your bank account, but the content of your character. Working, saving, planning, caring about things, being responsible, kind, and sober is a good idea even if you are Midas-rich.  You do your children a disservice if you do not teach them to be thoughtful, industrious, sober, kind, decent people.  It doesn't matter what their house looks like.
tx4bRDrXaa	Isaiah 2:2-4 Micah 4;4  John 13:34,35   Jehovah's Wittnesses are in every land in nation all over the world.We are considered brothers and sisters one large spiritual family.    How could we go to any other part of the world and kill our Brothers and Sisters,it is not possible.Acts 5:28,29 This is Jesus command to true Christians to love one another.    We visit many times other countries and stay with our Brothers of whom we've never met and  in every land we are united as a spiritual family.    It is true that God had his people fight wars in the Hebrew Scriptures,but the people were deserving of death.  Example Jeremiah 7:31 Says they have built their high places in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire,a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart.    Deuteronomy  18;9-13 Speaks of all the detestable things that the nations were practicing and he warned his people not to become a part of it.  When God directed war it was selective,and he only destroyed the wicked that would not change.In Noah's day he warned the wicked the flood was coming to no avail.  2 Peter 2:5 Also Abraham warned the wicked in Sodom and Gomorrah   Geneses 18:23-29  When man has wars he kills everyone,men women children innocent people,good people.    We are preaching the Good News of God's Kingdom in 236 lands in hundreds of lanuages,uniting peoples from all over the world to live in peace and unity together.    And that is why Jehovah's people would never go to any land and fight in a war because Jesus told us ,you all are Brothers.  Revelation 7:9 Matthew 23:8 Exodus 6:3  www.jw.org|`|AA11025703	I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  I give my allegience to Jehovah, not any one particular national group.

There are several reasons.    First, Jesus told Christians,     "YOU heard that it was said, You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy. 44 However, I say to YOU: Continue to love YOUR enemies and to pray for those persecuting YOU; 45 that YOU may prove yourselves sons of YOUR Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous. 46 For if YOU love those loving YOU, what reward do YOU have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing? 47 And if YOU greet YOUR brothers only, what extraordinary thing are YOU doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing? 48 YOU must accordingly be perfect, as YOUR heavenly Father is perfect. "    It would be hard to do that and kill your enemy, too.    Going along with this, the apostle Paul was inspired to write,    "For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things. 5 For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God;"    So the Bible plainly says that the weapons of a Christian's warfare "are not fleshly."  Jesus, Paul, Peter, and all the real, first Christians waged a warfare only against "reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God."    That is why the Roman emperor threw them to the lions:    "A careful review of all the information available goes to show that, until the time of Marcus Aurelius [Roman emperor from 161 to 180 C.E.], no Christian became a soldier; and no soldier, after becoming a Christian, remained in military service."--The Rise of Christianity (London, 1947), E.W. Barnes, p. 333.    Many churches support wars of their  countries.  They even support BOTH SIDES  OF THE SAME WAR.  Catholic and Protestant churches did this during WWI and WWII.  So they send their members to KILLONE ANOTHER.  Do you see the problem here?  Jehovah's Witnesses were thrown into Nazi concentration camps for refusing to kill an American soldier.  Where were all the German Catholics and Protestants?  Why weren't they in the concentration camps with the Witnesses, for the same reason?  Jesus said,    "By this all will know that YOU are my disciples, if YOU have love among yourselves. (John 13:35)    The Witnesses have that love, and are doing as Jesus also commanded, "Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations," (Matthew 28:19,20).  Since they are in 135+ nations and have the love Christ commanded, they do not kill one another, or others.  But they do risk their life in many lands to make disciples.    A friend helped put this in perspective when he said, "No Jehovah's Witness has ever killed an American soldier.  Can you say the same about your religion?"    Best regards,  Michael|`|47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	I got out of the Military when I read Rev 19:    18so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great."  19And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.       Since Jesus is going to destroy all the armies of this world, why would a christian want to be in those armies.    If a "Christian" is in the military when Christ returns, then he will find himself on the losing side and be destroyed with the rest of the disobedient.    How can 'killing' fellow christians in the opposing army be called 'doing God's will?'    How can 'killing' non christians in the opposing army be called "Love of enemies"?    Christians are suppose to be ambassadors substituting for Christ,      If you are an ambassador of God's Kingdom how can you join an opposing army?    If the ambassador of the US, joined the army of Russia, he would called a traitor.    Why would a soldier for Christ want to join another army?    Philippians 2:25 (New American Standard Bible)     25But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;         .|`|xRJQSNJeaa	Because Witnesses don't believe in the government or anything involving it.

This does not give you right to sin as much as you want.  This merely means that we are not in danger of hell.      That said, you NEED to stop.  I don't want to sound harsh, but Paul said if you abstain from meat sacrificed to idols, and sexual immorality, you do well.  God put sexual sin right next to idolatry.  It's serious!  I had the same problem for  a long time, and it's a tough tough road, but you can do it!    If you're serious, please please email me.  I'd love to try to help in any way I can.

As long as you truly believed in all these things you were safe for the time being.  But jsut because you slipped up does not mean your a horrible person now.  God knows that humans make mistakes and sin.  Adam and Eve did.  But this is why God lets us repent.  Many denominations believe once saved always saved.  This is not true.  Just because you are saved does not mean you can go back to drinking and sinning.  Instead, you need to repent for the sins you have committed.  Doing this will eventually lead you to less sinning because confronting God will be harder.  Especially when you are sinnning and you know you are.  Your self conscious will be telling you not to.  God bless.  Just repent for your sins again.|`|AA12194228	You know, I don't even think the subject should be discussed here. Everyone does it whether or not they admit it.

You must overcome it though. We cant keep repenting for the same sin until we're dead. That to me means not trying our best to stop.

There IS a place where the darkness gets banished to and I can assure you sending someone there is NOT taken lightly. The things that get banished there are things most people cannot fathom. It's darkness beyond your imagination. There IS no light there.      Saying you will go to hell for something as small and essentially stupid as watching porn is fear talking. Think about it. God made us. He made us in HIS image--inherantly imperfect. He knows all, He sees all. We are perfect exactly as we are. Because God is perfectoin. God loves all of his children, and all that he asks is that you be a good person, love your brothers and sisters, your fellow man and do right by each other. He would never, ever send one his children to a place like that for doing what He designed our bodies to do. It's natural, it's healthy. Period.|`|Of9fj6q4aa	If you are saved then yes the Lord will forgive you. You need to repent, ask the Lord to forgive you and go and sin no more. Do not do look at porn or masturbate anymore. When such a thought comes into your mind cast it down in the name of Jesus. And ask God to give you the strength to resist that temptation. As for the good health aspect, I don't think you can bargain with the Lord like that. As Christians we are supposed to eschew sin because we love the Lord not because we want Him to keep us in good health.

Drucker predicts that the dominant factor for business will be demographics: underpopulation, not overpopulation, will pose the greatest challenge to economists and businessmen in the future. Barring unforeseen changes in fertility trends, the underpopulation of developed countries is an accomplished fact, and we will all struggle with the social and economic consequences that follow.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	A "truly" secular United States.... yeah, I can hardly believe it.
