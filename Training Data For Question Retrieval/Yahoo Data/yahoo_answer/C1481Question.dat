20090222164249AAlic5Y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	"Atheists are Evil."?	Would you be willing to join an organization by way of your signature, that states you are are a member of the Atheist Religion in a Church of Atheism in order to be able to have equal rights as theists?      Note: Rights you do not have include:      1.) Labor laws: They do not protect extra days atheists want off but they do protect religious holidays, protect dress code violations if it's related to their religion, protect time off during work hours for religious prayer.      2.) Marriage: Religious people can have a priest marry them, a judge (or legal equivalent) , or if their religion requires they can marry themselves without a priest or a judge. Atheists can only have a Judge (or legal equivalent).      3.) Military: Atheists and theists are taxed to pay for Military Chaplains. In the military many atheists report anecdotes of being forced to attend "spiritual fitness" classes, religious benedictions, prayers, and other classes such as religious marriage counseling. Unofficially they are harassed, denied advancement in rank due to their not being religious, and many other examples of discrimination are imposed upon them.      4.) Cannot hold political offices. Though the United states constitution prohibits it, many state constitutions do not allow for any Atheist to hold any government office.      5.) Taxes: Religions are allowed tax deductions for their representative institutions and their staff. Atheists have no such tax deductible institutions (yet).      6.) No lobbyists: Religious people are able to protect their rights through representation in the government weather by lobbyists or politicians themselves. Atheists, agnostics, spiritualists, and free thinkers more than triple the amount of Hindu's Buddhists and Jews combined in this country but the Congress has only seen one out of the closet atheist EVER.      And many other more examples. Not all of them would be solved by said membership, but many if not most would be alleviated or eradicated by Atheists establishing Atheism as a Religion and founding a Church of Atheism.      Would you join?
20090222164338AAZXzwa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Where are the open-minded?	I'm not religious atheist or agnostic. i'm just simply have an open mind and I accept religion is very real. I'm not debating wether God is or is not real, as that is a matter of belief.         befor i go on i apologise for my bad gramma....      I have been interested in the beliefs of religion and the acult since i was little, not just christianity muslim or acult wise voodooism but on a much larger scale.      I'm going to keep this as short as i can possibly can and only humour you/abbreviate when ever possible.      but looking at religion, to me it is a simble of power,belonging,peace, even war and suffering, other beliefs are odd or unnatural to modern society e.g cannibalism for instance, most tribal cultures believe if you eat the flesh of your prey you will gain there power, or you will kill bad spirits from within and stop them spredding about another. the wierd thing is (dont worry this isn't my main subject) people erm... "normal" people in most cases who do canabilise also believe this and is one of the main reasons why they eat human flesh. the strange thing is non of these people have ever heard of this in tribal communities(just bare with me if your lost) now could there be some kind of genetic or spiritual connection between eating human and spirits?      another factor is common religion i'm going to use christianity for sake of this subject. when speaking to christians i find in the u.k they are open minded they talk about jesus's real capabilities a stride from fiction to non-fiction if you will (no offence tended by any of the above or below) when talking to some christian americans they seem more closed minded they dont seem to want to (sorry im going to have to say question but it is not the world i'm looking for, so try to abreviate my meening thank you.)question the bible they read it as it is and thats that.      athiest will say god does not exist because thats there belief. but when somebody says god does exist or somebody starts talking about god or jesus. then bang they are straight on the defensive and dont even whant to take in a two way convo. i'm sure most will know what i'm tallking about, and the same goes for religious people albeit not all non and religious people are like that.      but talking about religion and tribes that believe in spirits the undead black-magic etc. but could it be possible that all religion and belief could be interlinked with one another and somthing (not god. i say not god because look at every belief and religion and somewhere there is a link and is just been discribed and understood difrently from each diffrent culture, and explained to us in a form we will understand and carry and also comprehend from that time of life then and now) more powerful more mystical more mythical?      another is why are athiests so eager to attack on religion....because it is so easy to deconstruct. but believe it or not if it wasnt for those physical human people you can touch see and feel who tell you otherwise science is just as easy to deconstruct if not easier. you athiests attack religion so eagerly because your simply not smart enough to attack "THEORY" on evolution and the big bang wich havent been 100% proven to be true "YET"      the same goes for religion why are you so eager to preach to non believers that god loves and you should pray you shouldnt have to if one thing culture has tought us is when we are in a death crisis (rehtoricaly speaking) we will all pray no matter what our beliefs.      well if you managed to read this then congrats and if you understood what my somewhat bizzare some what hidden question is then you need a medal......have fun

20090222170007AAnEvuL	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: What is your stance on public or semi-public breast feeding?	On friday I went to my cousins baby shower. Naturally, being that it was a baby shower, only women were invited. Three women at the party had also just recently had babies. While all three mothers nurse their infants, only one of them felt it was appropriate to publicly nurse her young daughter. She did not even use a receiving blanket to cover up. She wears hijab and a jilbab when she is out and about so I found this to be completely out of character. She is also very pious. Is it not haram for her to do that.       I should also state that many of the other women also found it disturbing and she said she was well aware of the deen and she was not committing any sin.       I advocate nursing and think every mother should do it. But my question is only on the Islamic Law pertaining to the nursing of children in public. Is it or isn't it permissible. I should also clarify that I am not talking about women who cover while nursing. I am only talking about those who nurse without covering.
20090222170522AAcrIxB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you no longer exist on the earth..DEAD...Where is NOWHERE located in Death?	With the exception of Jesus Christ....Death is an unknown to human beings, unless you believe as Christians do that death was defeated and our physical death is a temporary manifestation into our eternal exsistence, no Scientist, Doctor, Philospher has ever figured out where death is, saying it's nowhere means somewhere...   NOWHERE means you don't have a clue where you are going.....      How is death explainable if no one has been there and come back to say where they went? You say people are having hallucinations when they are dying having a NDE, but the point is they had no heartbeat no brain activity and just like no Scientist can explain what caused the Big Bang they cannot explain death....      If you close your eyes and just see black what are you seeing? I see many Auras when I do that especially Purple I am not seeing what you might of seen, so again where is the location of death?

20090222165057AAlB95p	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What should be done about marijuana smokers?	I personally think they should be punished as severely as possible. They are more deserving of jail or the death sentence than anyone else because they are hurting themselves, which I believe is worse than hurting another person. Pot smokers are a bunch of yellow-bellied, spineless, laid-back, unmotivated pansy scumbags who have to break the law and ruin their health just to have fun and feel good. Marijuana has been proven to cause lung cancer and brain damage, yet these fools don't care they're messing themselves up. I'm sick of all of these stoners acting all smug and arrogant about how they love to smoke weed and how it should be legal. I also hate how they're sticking up for Michael Phelps and using him as an example of pot being okay to do and how they're boycotting Kellogg's because they're so butthurt about how they dropped his spokesman deal. You know what? **** Phelps! (Or should I say Phelch?) **** the Olympics! Mark Spitz will always be better than him. But getting back to general stoners... I truly believe all non-stoners want to see these walking cesspools thrown in jail or executed. You never hear non-stoners say on TV or anywhere else that pot should be legalized because no such person exists. I also truly believe the world would be a better place if all marijuana users were done away with.
20090222165710AA4Suqo	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Threesomes....is it good for a relationship or does it ruin relationships? Im confused, please help.?	Im not sure what to do. My boyfriend has mentioned a few times that he would like to have a threesome with me and another female. He said its something he has never done ( I did once when I was younger, however, I was the third party and was single at the time). Part of it I think is that hes upset that I have tried it and he hasnt and would like to. We have a very open relationship and a good sex life. But Im not sure if I want to do it for a number of reasons. First, I think seeing him turned on by another woman and attracted to her would hurt, and then seeing them engage in sex would be upsetting. Maybe it is my own insecruity? He has told me that he is committed to me, and would never leave me for another woman. Ive asked him if he is not satisfied in our sex life, if thats why he feels the need to be with someone else. He says no. That is purely a sexual thing, and something he wants to try. Then I worry he would want to do it again. If we did it once, would he want it all the time? He has also said if its not something I want to do, to not worry about it and we wont. He says he doesnt want me to be hurt and cares about my feelings. Ive asked him how he would feel if he saw me having sex with another man and he said he wouldnt like it. So he does understand how it would make me feel. He just always talks about trying it and wanting to. Ive told him to me, that it may be something I would be more willing to try if we were married....and that I would feel more secure about it, that it wouldnt be as easy to " leave" and that if we were married, I would know that he really wanted to be with me. He doesnt understand that and thinks that has nothing to do with it. I dont know what to do. i want to please him and make him happy, but Im afraid I would be very hurt. He also says he thinks I would enjoy it, and that he wants to do it for " me" and to satisfy me, however I told him that HE satisfies me and I dont necessarily need to have a threesome. I want to please hi,, but is it really worth it? Help. Has anyone out there done it and regreeeted it?

20090222183314AAWSteH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists (or anyone) please explain.?	Alright, I believe my house is haunted. Now before you click out of this question here me out, I am an atheist myself, I have tried in all matters to be logical and reasonable with this. But now I am in a midst of confusion. At first it began with the lights. Lights would flicker on but not completely off as if they were being warped of their power source. So I took out my homes circuitry plan and noticed other appliance such as my computer are connected to this same circuitry hence it cannot be power related. So I came up with how it might be some electromagnetic force spectrum in my house or something. Which also explained the very odd voices I would here in the middle of the night. Now this is the hardest to explain, I'm a student and I commute--I usually don't end up home until late at night, but on Saturday at 2pm I pulled up into my driveway and saw an oddity. From my driveway you can see the bay window and there are curtains (long heavy vertical blinds) and I saw them pulled back and something looking at me in my car. I couldn't make it out since it was pitch dark in the house. But it did it in a person form, it had the blinds pulled back a great distance (heavy blinds, nothing the nearby heat vent could do that is 5 ft away from the blinds with no air current in the room). Then it let them go, and then it looked for a second time and then let go and didn't look again, I rushed into the house. No one, nothing. This has happened at least a few times so far. I also sometime fell something is looking at me. Please, be very logical with your answers. I am a stubborn man of science and cannot get a good explanation. But this thing that's lurking me doesn't seem natural but rather some form like a ghost. I don't know every time I see the dark figure (if I can see one since the pure white blinds which can be seen through the window at night are in front of the pitch blackness of the room) I really don't want to go home. It's come to the point where I want to sleep in my car. Please I have NO history of psychological disorders or sleep disorientation. I wasn't sleepy either, this happens when I am fully awake too. I am not dull either, I am an 18 year old UofC student that commute with soon to be no home.

I have been married to my husband for 4 years. He is black and I'm white. We were about to go to dinner with another couple, when we realized that we were short one seat in their truck.   Everybody was joking around and the other guy said that his son who was coming along also, could just ride in the back of the truck. But that being illegal, we joked about having to hide him and that he would have to lie down in order to not be seen. That is when I jokingly said out loud and to my husband that since his skin color was so dark, he could just sit in the back of the truck and no one would even be able to see him. I didn't mean anything with it and I didn't notice anyone else making more out of it either. Apparently when my husband and I left later, he told me how he thought I made a tacky and racist joke about him being black and he was upset that I would even do that.   I am from Germany and I always thought that skin color is a physical fact of who anybody is and not something that when it is pointed out is considered racist. Am I off here and need to learn something or is my husband just overly sensitive in that category?

20090222212403AA3QN6X	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I don't want to be confirmed as a Catholic.?	Okay. So i am 14 years old. Tomorrow, i have an interview with the church for being confirmed as a catholic. also known as "Confirmation"       I'm an athiest and my parents know this, but they're very catholic and are forcing me to be confirmed. I've told them multiple times that there is no point of me being in those confirmation classes since it will NOT change my beliefs.       So there is no way i'm getting out of this. It's just the way i feel that is bothering me.      When i tell the church tomorrow that I am a fully commited catholic and choose to live catholic and all that stuff, I'll be lying.      I am being raised as a catholic. and technically, LYING is against the commandments. So do my parents really want me to "break commandments" in their terms?...      Also, i feel that when i lie tomorrow, it'll feel like i'm denying myself. as in my own personal life and beliefs. and i feel bad that i have to do this just to please my parents and the church...      Trust me, i've explained all of this to my parents. but they are still forcing me to do all of this. I know at 18, i have the right to chose, but right now, it feels like so much and its hard to handle in my mind.          Can anyone out there give me any advice on how to feel, or any way to help me get me through all of this?

20090222204459AAxY4iQ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Continuing from my last question why do you want a religious marriage instead of civil marriage?	it's the same thing or it'll eventually have all the same rights. and to clarify i'm a lesbian atheist but logically speaking i think christians have a better argument, the only thing that's different about a christian marriage and a civil marriage is that you can't marry in a church and why would anyone want to marry in a place that started all the discrimination?
20090222194524AAWh45k	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question about the Jewish diaspora/ exile?	I don't mean to be offensive, if i come of that way, sorry!

I'm not sure if that's how it went down, so if i understood something incorrectly, please do correct me.       Was this the same thing as the "second exile?"...if not, what is the "second exile"??      I know some Jewish sects are against Zionism because apparently God said that they are punished and can't have Israel anymore...Why did God punish them in the first place?   Okay im done with my rambling...im so confused, if someone could briefly explain this whole thing to me, it would be greeeeatly appreciated!

20090222205742AA7Kvgr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My boyfriend won't be home to take me to prom...religious perspective on this?	My boyfriend is in college and he comes down to visit me but for prom he will not be able to take me. I have a few other guy friends who might be able to take me because I want to go to prom but not without a date. I would be spending a significant amount of money on this and I don't want to waste it if I'm not going to have a date and be alone and have a cruddy time. My boyfriend keeps telling me how much he hates prom and how he didn't go to his and how they're dumb and how he saved a lot of money by not going, I am not much of a girly type but I have always wanted to go to my prom. When I mentioned to him about possibly going to prom with one of my guy friends he said he would be really pissed if I went with some one else because most guys just go to get laid for their first time and he said the dancing they do is disgusting (and I agree but I wouldn't dance like that) but I still want to go because it's my prom and I want to have a good time. I explained that these guys are just my friends and I would never do anything with them. I asked him if he trusted me and he said yes but he didn't trust the guy I would be going with and the thought of another guy having his hands on me made him upset, the conversation ended with a "do whatever you want Lindsey I don't care" (the kind that is supposed to make you feel guilty). I didn't bring it up again and the prom is in about a month. I don't really know what to say, I understand he doesn't want another guy touching me but any guy I would go with I have no attraction for and he has none for me, I am sensible and I know how far is too far. I am not going to drink or do anything stupid, I just want to go, have a good time with my date and my other friends. What should I do about this, am I being immoral?

Good deeds done for the benefits of one own self are deeds done not out of kindness and charity, but out of the conviction that if you don't you will meet the hell fires, and if you do, you will see the kingdom of heaven, and to satisfy one's ego, whereas good deeds done for the benefit of others are deeds done not because of fear of god or to make one feel better about oneself, but out of the genuine concern of the plight of others. Does it really matter, as both produce the same result in the end?

20090222222912AAPwKLy	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	What does "fitnah" mean?	This may be a dumb question, but I am an atheist, and have barely begun learning about Islam.  A Muslim friend very recently god me interested.      I saw some sites dedicated to bashing Muslims that said it was believing in any other god, and that Muslims killed people for it.  However, that seems an extremely unreliable source of info, considering that I have very devout Muslim friends who have never once tried to harm me for not being a Muslim.  I have heard some actual Muslims talk about it in a very different context, having nothing to do with other gods.  They were devout Muslims saying that their sexuality could cause fitnah.    What is it? what does it mean?

20090222223221AADR7lR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is religion healthy or unhealthy?	Heres my opinion on this subject.      If you believe that there is a hell , heaven , sins , sinners , gods , goddesses , demons , devils , and angels ; then out of fear of Hell , you wouldn't be able to commit suicide.      Out of fear of hell , you wouldn't be tempted to murder , steal , lie , adulterate , or any other sinful activities.      If you can't commit adultery , then the spread of sexual diseases would be quite low , thus assuring the health of people.      But the fear of Hell could also make one's self  very traumatized...   the fear of hell isn't actually great at all...  to me , it keeps me from doing evil , yet it keeps me from being tormented by the thought of hell.   If you are a Christian , you do good to stay away from hell , yet you know you can't go to hell because you are a Christian. Thats one way to put it.      Another thing...  from the Bible , it clearly states things that are bad:   It is cleaner to wash in running water than a basin.   filthy animals are unfit to eat and posses diseases.   cooking thoroughly kills parasites and other harmful things.         Religion isn't so bad , as long as it is healthy.      Is it healthy to live in delusion??  well it isn't unhealthy.      Like I always say ,    "its better to live in delusion than to live unhealthy"

20090222204528AAf4FQs	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Does anyone else have a problem with fitting in with the gay community at college?	Basically at the college I go to, there's a sort of circle of gay guys that all hang around together and know each other. I'm gay and out, but I don't really know most of them, I tend to hang around with girls and straight guys more.      The thing is, I always feel slightly left out and bitter, because any attractive boy I like is usually adopted into this group straight away, and they tend to sort of dominate the gay community at college. I always sense a hostility from them towards me, and I usually assume it's because I never follow their hierarchy.       It's not just a case of I want to be friends with them though, because I find them all really shallow and contrived. They are all really bitchy and I just have nothing in common with them. Plus I know some of them have bitched about me, and I'm pretty sure half of them have spread a bad reputation about me.       Basically I'm just wondering if this happens to anyone else, because I'm frustrated at the moment, about how most of the gay community at college ostracises me for being myself, i.e not bitchy and "typically" gay.   Is this what being gay is about, comforming to stereotypical behaviour or having gay lads ***** about you to potential guys?
20090222215620AASyM1D	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I have been with my guy for 4 years and now have entered year 5, should I leave b/c no wedding ring?	I love him to DEATH. He loves me to death. We have this great thing going. We have waited so long patiently to do what we're doing b/c my parents have been married for almost 30 years (unhappily) and have been together since age 20, and his have all been divorced multiple times.      After 6 months of our relationship, I broke up with him b/c I thought I wanted more out of my first love and could find that elsewhere. I dated another guy for 6 months, then broke up with him, and got back with the other. Realizing after all that time together each man/vs eachother, how much I really did love guy #1. So he took me back and we have taken it slow. Been living together for years, and it is great.      Dont tell me about the whole "milkin the cow ordeal" because we dont have sex. For "whatever" reasons, ill just leave it at that. It is pure love, but after all this time and no ring? PUHLEEZE...! We have talked about it...etc etc...it just hasnt happened. He's a smart guy, laid back, and doesnt like to rush things. He has great common sense, and I would trust him with any situation. He is my life saver. But at this point. I just feel stupid living together, (its our place together) and I am considering staying with my parents for at least a few days (or until I cant stand them any longer).      SLIGHT PROBLEM: is that I know his money has been tied up, and will be getting paid in full this year. I am just SO IMPATIENT! It kiiiiiiiiills me...Im just really sad...I told him I wanted him to propose to me in December (back in july 2008), then I said no dont do it because I will know that "it" is coming...and there will be no surprise. But at this point I am just burnt out...please help... me...*frawns*

20090222234705AAvZWBe	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Neo-Feminism = Female Supremacy?	Before anyone bites my head off, let me just say that I am a feminist. According to its original definition from decades ago, it simply means full equality between women and men, socially, politically and otherwise. I right on board with that, always have been.      But am I the only one who has noticed that feminism has caused a sort of slingshot effect that is apparent today? Has anyone noticed that a great number of women today actually seem to be female supremacists who regard men as dumb, slobbering, horny idiots?      I've found in my dating experiences and other observations that many women seem to expect so much...simply for being women. I've just noticed this attitude that comes with so many modern women that says, "I'm amazing, you're unworthy, and you're lucky if I accept you."      Has anyone else noticed this trend in young women in particular?

20090222232159AAQ3iSO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For those who think religion is a sham have you ever participated in worship when something beautiful happened?	One soul singer, Irene Stevenson, has experienced what she calls 'real religion' through singing songs of worship. Her definition of real religion is "something beautiful that happens in church when folks don't allow things to get in between themselves and the worship of God."      Now, if you've always avoided church worship like the plague, you just are not going to be able to refute her definition, are you? You might point to sham Christians who give religion a bad name, but that in itself can never prove that religion is a sham. Would you not have to know what genuine religion is before being able to spot the sham? And if some people (a few billion of them) insist they have experienced genuine religion through genuine worship, how could people who never engage in worship gainsay that? And, for those who know what real religion is, what are some of the things you've found that get in the way of pure worship?

Atheism: Atheism, as an explicit position, can be either the affirmation of the nonexistence of gods, or the rejection of theism. It is also defined more broadly as an absence of belief in deities, or nontheism.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism       Nihilism: Nihilism (from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism

Also, the girl she's with a lot (maybe her gf, if she is lesbian) has a picture up of her dancing with some random other girl, and the description is "the night (name here) became lesbian".

20090222232257AAsqmEd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think abortion is ethical in my hypothetical scenario?	Due to the dynamics of this question, it can apply to both pro choice and pro life advocates.      Let us say that in the future there is technological advancements that allow a fetus to be transplanted to a synthetic environment outside of a woman's body.  We will also have a hypothetical situation where technological advancements have produced a means to provide this soon to be child an environment that is loving through means of artificial parents.  In addition this hypothetical situation would be that population growth is not an issue, as technological advances have provided us with a means of living off of the Earth.  And also let us assume that birth defects would not be an issue in such a hypothetical future.      Given that the woman has been taken out of the equation, do you still think it would be the woman's choice to terminate the fetus?  For those that are pro life, would you accept that the mother be taken out of the equation?         Now, this is an entirely hypothetical question.  It is based entirely upon fantasy but at the same time provides me with valuable input.  I do appreciate anyone that plays along with the completely artificial environment I have set for them.

20090222235559AAtfGm9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is wrong with the American society these days?	I got this answer from someone when they posted it before. I thought it was interesting and contained plenty of truth. What do you think?         "You are raising an important issue.       Why was America a fun place in the past? Well, as a ctizen, you did not have to worry about too much social trouble around the world. All you had to do was watch the TV and follow the instructions formulated by the elites. Your interaction with the rest of the world was very minimal, even in your dealing with minorities in US. So, it was easy for you to feel good about life, all you had to do was give money to some charity and hope for the best for the rest of the world.      What is happening now? That old social order world is gone and is never going to come back. With Internet and the greater movement of people around the world, it is hard to stay in your bubble. The challenge america faces is much more greater than you think I would blame part of this on the media that misconstructed many realities in the mind of the american people. Now that the people are communicating directly with the rest of the world, the curtain is coming down and they dont like what they see. Before, the media would tell you there is nothing in Africa apart from misery and wars; If you ever have a chance to talk to an african or watch the african channel on cable TV, you will realize how far off that is. The world as we knew it is never going to be the same again with globalization.       What can you do about it? First of, do not adopt the attitude that "we are trying to accomodate all these...". Trust me, you are not doing it for them because they are beautiful. So, the sooner you realize that you can longer live in your bubble / gated community, the sooner you can adjust to the new life. Welcome to the global community."
20090222225906AAl671w	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Would his sexual preferences be called "homosexual"?	I have a friend who is biologically a female, but prefers a male gender role.  Not a trans man, exactly.  He lives as a male and sometimes it seems like he goes out of his way to be overly masculine, but she also responds when people refer to her as a female and has told me she "doesn't mind" whatever people think her gender is.      Now, his sex is still female but his gender is predominantly male.  He is in love with a man.      Would you call him homosexual because he is of the male gender and attracted to the male gender/sex?   Or would you call her straight because her sex is still female and homosexual means "having sexual and romantic attraction primarily or exclusively to members of one’s own sex"?

20090222230328AArrchh	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Does killing ants make me a murderer?	Insects are living creatures just like animals and people so that must make me a hideous person even if I killed the ants to keep them out of the kitchen in my house because I snuffed out a living breathing life form. I wonder if the size of the ant is what makes animal police track down people abusing dogs but won't arrest someone who used mouse traps or raid to kill bugs in their home. I guess intent has a lot to do with it also in addition to the size of the creatures to notice bodily damage. Ants are too small unless you use a microscope whereas damage to a dog can be seen with the eyes.

20090222224121AA2iM4k	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do religious people feel about atheist?	Being a non believer of God doesn't make you immoral, evil, smug or just a bad person in general, so why do people get so angry at all atheists? I mean there are some jack *** atheist out there, but lets be fair, there are some jack *** religious people too.       I guess what I am trying to say, is that I am Atheist, I don't believe, period. I'll listen to what you have to say about God, and what not, and I won't tell you otherwise. I try to respect others beliefs and never try to make them doubt their beliefs.       There are a lot of good people out who are atheist that don't sleep around, who don't murder, who go to school, get jobs, have families and live perfectly normal lives.      So I guess my question is, how do religious people honestly feel about the "good" atheist?   And why is it every time finds out I'm atheist they tell me I need to be saved or I'm going to hell or something like that when I don't even believe in that?

20060723144838AAHszwp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why did prophet Muhammed try to attack the Roman Empire?	Islamic history tells that prophet Muhammed tried to attack the Roman Empire in what was called Tabouk convoy based on what he said that they were trying to invade Muslims. When prophet Muhammed arrived near the Romans and found out their strength, he returned back and told his companions that the Romans changed their minds and they no more trying to invade Muslims!      This incident raised few questions that I am trying to find some answers for them:   1- How did prophet Muhammed know that the Romans were preparing to invade Muslims (the well-documented Roman history does not tell anything about any preparation for such invasion)?    2- If the Romans were really trying to invade Muslims, why did they change their minds (I don't think they feared Muhammed's poorly-prepared convoy while they were very strong at teh time)?   3- If the Romans had real interest in invading Muslims, why did not they do that earlier (while Muslims were very weak) or even later?

First of all I live in Australia      It is usually female asians and male caucasians (I do see it the other way around too). I don't find it odd at all, I just would like to know what interests caucasian men to find asian women (or the other way around.    I asked my mother and my mother said that asian women are less demanding in a relationship that caucasian women. And these days more and more men are taking home asian women from their homeland (vietnam, china etc.) and bringing them to become citizens of another country.      I know they are silly stereotypes but I can't help but to ask.   I'm not being racist, its just interesting and everyone is equal to me but society is always changing and I'd like to know how and why.

20090222231606AAeoZiA	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I don't understand how lesbians can go with men they don't fancy..?	My girlfriend is a lesbian. And has always been quite certain of this.She has never had a crush on a man, or any sexual or romantic attraction to men.      Yet she has gone with three men sexually in her past.        First one was some guy who took her on a date at age 16, and she already felt quite like an outsider so agreed to go on this date. He was quite dodgy and after first date he insinuated she did a sex act on him, which she did so briefly but found it disgusting and was ashamed of herself.   she then had a girlfriend and started to go to gay clubs more.      Two years later she was ready to come out to her parents but wanted to make 100% certain she was gay and reaffirm it before coming out. So she did some mutual touching with this male friend of hers.       Agsin, she had no feelings for this guy. No attraction, no romantic feelings...nothing at all. Almost like going with your brother.  And she found it to be awkward and gross. She even kept her clothes on to not be so exposed to him.      Later on, her parents wanted her to go into the closet or they would disown her...      so there was this one guy who fancied her for 3 months and one night she went to his room and she lost her virgninity to him.       AGAIN..she had no feelings for him...she was not attracted and it was awful for her. But she felt she needed to prove her parents wrong in her head again.      I cannot understand how anyone can force themselves into sex this many times? just to confirm their sexuality?      wouldn't you assume sex would be bad if done with someone you don't fancy at all? that it would be awkward?      why didn't she try dating these men more? to see if romance came..because normally if romance is there..sex is a natural thing and feels great.      I don't get that and cannot relate...      I am bisexual myself and have only gone with men in the past I have fancied.

20090222235504AA4GP6Z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who's responsibility?	Okay.. i live in a townhouse and one morning I found a large box in front of my garage. Not knowing what the box is, or whos it was I pushed it to the garbage area. The box has now been there for three weeks. Just a moment ago one of the neighbours knocked on my door and asked me what the box was and if it was mine, and was lecturing me on how it shouldn't be there and how it's been there for weeks. He told me that he has seen the box in my garage. Now I know for a fact that the box does not belong to me and I would certainly have put it in the bin if it was. Now I'm not sure how I can defend myself when someone is putting the blame on me for this, and no one will claim for the junk. Should I throw it away myself or should I leave it for the right person to do... The one reason I do not want to do it.. is the fact that the neighbour will think that it was actually mine.

I can not do it by myself, but if everyone pitched in, wheather its money, giving a innocent child somwhere to sleep, or giving the homless on the corner a dollar, that would make a huge difference.  If we have more things for kids to do,force kids to be educated [which is almost impossible], and helping them make the right choices, there would be less gang violence.  My question is, what do you do to help the pepole that are less fortunate than you? Im young [15] but I try to help as much as I can. If we don't work together, it is another life being lost.

I have been sick for a long time now and have had to take a lot of medication after I surgery over the summer, and that added to a lot (too many) problems at home have led to high levels of stress. My hair is falling out in tons, I have lost a lot of weight, and on top of that I have a dry scalp and a lot of flakes are on my head. It is apparent and very embarrassing.      These things are not the problem though because I am getting medical help and am trying really hard to keep up my grades. What makes me sad everyday is how I get made fun of in school. It happens every single day and I never get a break. I get called bad names and they yell "Snowflake" through the hallway because of my flake problem. I go home and cry every night now and cannot help it.      I have tried to ignore it, but nothing is working! These are classmates of mine and people who I thought were my friends. How can I get them to stop? Why do they always attack me? I mind my own business and never make fun of them. :[

20070326145618AADYeRe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is God the evil creation of MAN to control his fellow man?	In the days of old, when something was not understood, it was easy for one to say, "by God's hand" or "By the Grace of God"; but as mankind has progressed he has found many answers that have shown that not by a God but by other factors did these things seem to be confusing.  In General, we men have blamed GOD for our worst lifes consequences and begged God for relief from our suffering.  We men have reached as far as we can to try to convince God to behold man as intelligent and loving; but to what avail?  To where we kill each other because we believe differently.  It is a sad thing that we do "In The Name of God" when I believe it is actually US that sin upon one another because we try to force Gods hand!  IF I DO This Surely God will come forth and show the world he is behind me!  Do you Love God?  Do you Love Life?  Well Life needs Love, obviously God does not otherwise he wouldn't have us so confused living in agony and misery trying to figure him out.  I Love Your Life so save me

20070405163344AA4FQ8w	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So if 4 Easter God makes a world-wide announcement 2 tell us who he really is, or we KILL him to save Mankind?	If you are a Christian every Sunday you are allowed to turn on your TV and watch some Christian Pastor speak The Word! But Muslims are not given fair time, nor Buddists, Hedonists, Pagans or Atheists. We see the broadcasts that we do not want to watch and turn the channel. To me they are a pack of lies, undermine The American freedoms and blasphemy what I believe is THE TRUE AMERICAN SPIRIT. I am told"you are more than welcome to turn the channel and watch something else". OK I want to watch porn, criminal decapitation, live WAR shots and Mass demonstration protests against drugs being illegal. But "Oh No! You can not do that sir, that is immoral and against what The FCC has allowed. Yeah, based on YOUR Christian ethic! It is Anti-FREEDOM of Speech and Freedom of Expression. Porn accounts for the number one money maker on the internet, yet I am denied the ability to watch this on free TV. Because Jesus said so. Jesus is causing me HELL HERE ON EARTH having to live with YOU!
20070222125538AA0RRq5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can Christians call themselves AMERICANS when they follow a KING & desire a Kingdom under Monarchial Rule?	The contradiction is obvious!  America was created by FREE THINKING MEN, who fought to escape the rule of KINGS.  Christ is A KING, God is A KING-they dwell in a kingdom that is governed by Monarchial Rule-A DICTATORSHIP, all things that This Republic stands against!  This religious order however tries to dictate what this country in by popular vote.  It asserts a measure of obedience upon ALL AMERICANS, by the rules that are distributed through The Bible.  The Bible is a corruption of America and the LAWS of The People.  WE THE PEOPLE in order to form a more perfect union ABOLISHED Monarchies, Dictatorships, Kingdoms, Chiefs, and placed the regulation of this country into the hands of THE PEOPLE.  But Christians Muslims Jews and all religious orders would state that this Great Nation is Under THEIR GOD!  Yet as we watch the world go into flames and famine over religious malcontent, you profess "I AM GOD FEARING" and therefore will die for my God!  But are YOU KILLING THE WORLD CHRIST?
20070212183255AAPkAfO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is the Sun & planets & stars & comets shaped like balls?  Does this mean God is playing with himself?	We know that the light that we see from the sun is an original source-it is what gives us the ability to see through the day.  We also know that the light emitted from the moon and planets is nothing more than a reflection of that light. Jesus declared "I AM THE LIGHT", but only by the energy of the sun could ANY MAN SEE HIM AT ALL!  So then he calls himself the SON-but this is in respect to The Father which leads me to believe that he was considerably more confused than those that would follow him.  I AM SORRY, but this declaration is absurd and is perhaps this greatest mistake that he made in trying to convince his children that he was of a greater power.  Could you in your answer to my question, explain to me how any form of matter can exist in two places at one time?  Science has proven it can not.  Science has proven that the stars that most believed were Gods during Jesus' time are round orbs in orbit around the sun.  JESUS BELIEVED THE Universe REVOLVED AROUND The Earth! getreal
20070123151732AApggad	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If We The People-place a free state into existence and allow all religions 2 worship could Israel follow?	Is it our duty as the entity that placed Israel into being-to manifest a more perfect union?  I believe so, do you?  So how do we develop this area of conflict into an area of PEACE and prosperity?  For one-we should call upon the United Nations to occupy this land and allow no one to live there.  One can visit but not reside.  Then we could build a world hospital there for all diseases to be cured.
20070121141500AAfZQ9a	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How come Christians are forgiven by Jesus death-and so destroy resources by using more than their fair share?	What do I mean?  I mean STOP abusing THIS PLANET just because you think you are going to Heaven-I believe if you would sacrifice your religious "I AM SAVED" attitude and realize that NO ONE GETS OUTTA HERE ALIVE-that you wouldn't be so self-centered with one another to talk to to reinforce your KILLING OF THIS PLANET. WHO GIVES A prayer about heaven?  America escaped from Kingdoms in order to form A MORE PERFECT UNION!-More perfect than a KINGdom-a Kingdom of God-God who created everything-including SIN-Evil-Wickedness-Misery-Agony-sloth-a... suffering-do not blame this on SATAN-he was created by God as well-LQQK into yourself and see what YOU CAN DO to make this world a better place-rather than ask God to do it-HE AINT ANSWERING!  Has anyone seen God on Yahoo Answers-I didn't think so!  Has he answered anyone on Yahoo answers?  Strike TWO!  I am alive because 2 people who love one another wanted to show the world proof of their love-HI! Here I Am-so y did God make sAtAn? Proof of whut?

20061229124840AAcGjoa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the killing of Saddam Hussein "A CHRISTIAN MURDER"? Oh no? Bush LIED to get into IraQ!  Set him Free!	We entered Iraq on the basis of two lies-1)Weapons of Mass Destruction, 2)Chemical Agents-If The execution of Saddam Hussein is allowed we will be making a big mistake on the part of The U.S. because he was captured through deception.  Only by President Bush stating that there were "Weapons of Mass destruction & Chemical agents" did the U.S. go into Iraq and for that specific purpose only.  If the Police were to enter a persons house here in the U.S. and arrested the individual on PROBABLE CAUSE; and those evidences were later found to be inadmissable; then this suspect would be considered "unlawfully detained" and released-as should President Hussein! But CHRISTIANS being the majority here in America will see this through-and do not try to convince me that the courts in Iraq were fair and that Saddam was tried by his peers-he was tried by those who would become puppets to Their New Dictator George Bush!  OH NO?  Then let Iraq VOTE 4 U.S. occupancy!  U KNOW they would vote O-U-T!

Yes one day you will see me in the glory of all I have created-including the homeless child-starving aids ridden African child-and much of the suffering that diseased people have had to suffer believing that I would give them a miracle-all of these things I have promised you in the book you hold called THE BIBLE-which is made of the finest paper cut from the finest forrests-and still you do not believe-that I AM KING-Well I AM KING-even though it was a monarchy like mine that the first pilgrims came to America for in order to escape A KING-MY KINGDUMB COME MY STEAK WELL DONE!

What should I do, should i talk to him about it, and if you think I should, will it ruin the friendship i have now with him, or should i let it go? OMG I am so confused.

Who can confirm for me if the Western scientists who of recent discovered 'science' in the Koran are presently practicing Muslims and what they do to defend the screaming attacks on their recent discoveries of 'sciences' in the Koran?      Have the Buccailes any plan to design for the World how to exploit any remaining 'sciences' in the Koran that are not yet known to the Western World? For it would be useless if after a long while a Westerner declares a scientific discovery some Buccailes emerge from nowhere to tell us that "it had been in the Koran"....we want to know all the remaining 'sciences' in the Koran in their fullest details right now!       But, what a minute; why were the less scientifically advanced people of old not able to recognice the Koranic 'sciences' as sciences? Does it not look like the Buccailes just cleverly 'science-nized' some flexible and manipulable words and phrases of the Koran by exaggerating their co-incidental scientific resemblance?

20090203132945AAQeDEv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Muslims, how do you know that when Allah refers to himself as We/Us he's talking about the royal "We"?	Because reading it, it totally ties in with the Christian concept of the trinity:      There is no God but Allah (which christians believe as well)   But Allah refers to himself in the plural (which may or may not be refering to the royal we).      Maybe the concept of the trinity was too complicated (just read some of the responses on this board about any question about the trinity) and too likely to be misunderstood as 3 different gods so it was decided to just keep it simple so that Gods message would reach more people.  After all, God never told us he would tell us the *entire* truth.  But that doesn't mean that the truth isn't there waiting to be discovered (as in the We/Us).            As a christian, I can read the Koran, appreciate it and accept almost all of it. It seems like a holy text, and doesn't contradict my own religion.  Maybe both Islam and Christianity are the word of God, worshiping him in ways that make most sense to different cultures and communities.

Parlami d’amore se    quando nasce un fiore mi troverai    senza parole amore.    Parlami d’amore se    quando muore un fiore ti troverai    senza respiro amore.       Crolla il tuo castello tra la rabbia, sabbia e sole    quando pensi che sian dolci le parole    Mi dici che c’è ancora sulle labbra il mio sapore    quando pensi che sian vane le paure       Parlami d’amore se    quando nasce un fiore mi troverai    senza parole amore.    Parlami d’amore se    quando muore un fiore ti troverai    senza respiro amore.

20071226094240AAgtQuB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Você acredita em "Línguas Estranhas"?	Para mim é tudo fanatismo! Em documentário da BBC, o historiador Michel Dodson fala que as tais línguas n?o possuem nenhuma característica verbial, e só é formada através de repeti??o de vogais ou consoantes avulsas. Os Romanos antigos também falavam-nas, o que é representado por diversas inscri??es que relatam uma certa "Língua dos Deuses, desconhecida e misteriosa"

20080110054459AA0bTdb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Um perguntinha polêmica, vamos falar de dizimo?	Eu sou dizimista  mas dizimo por amor a obra de Jesus.   O modo que muitos tem pregado em rela?ao ao dizimo.   Sera que Deus e egoista ao ponto de querer de volta o que Ele te deu como recompensa pelo seu trabalho honesto   Muitos tem pregado que e uma lei ou obriga?ao voce dizima ou dar 10 % do seu salario mas nao estariam colocando as pessoas na parede tipo ou voce dizima ou vive no pecado e nao sera salvo   Nao seria um terror psicologico que estao fazendo com essas pessoas?   O dizimo de Israel consistia em um decimo de toda a produ?ao anual tanto das colheitas como dos animais que os iaraelitas ofereciam a Deus ( Lv 27.30;Hb 7.1-10 )   O dizimo era usado para o susrento dos levitas ( Nm 18.21-24 ) dos estrangeiros, dos orfaos e das viuvas ( Dt 14.28-29 ).   Embora no NT nao prescreva  o dizimo como obriga?ao e lei para os seguidores de Cristo ainda assim ele e ansinado a ser feito de forma sistematica liberal abundante e alegre leiam     ( 1 Co 16.2;  2 Co 9.6,7 )   Paz do Senhor.

We have them, please look it up on google or anything. There's no denying. We can show clear connections between when amphibians formed and so on. Plain as day.   2) We find certain animals at certain depths in the earth. For instance we never find pre-homo sapien beings after we find humans. No there is a very distinct time line.   3) After 150 years of people trying to disprove evolution, no one has. If someone were to disprove evolution, they would win a nobel prize. There's no reason someone would keep there mouth shut. This whole, it's a conspiracy mind set holds no ground. It doesn't even disprove God. What would be the gain?   4) 99.99% of biologist accept evolution. I believe they had a list of 100 who didn't. After further examination, don exodus showed that all but two where either not educated of evolution and actually accepted it!    5)Go to  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/librar...  or  http://toarchive.org/faqs/comdesc/  These are amazing sites, please do some research and actually learn about our fascinating planet.

I live in Oklahoma, 9th fattest state in the nation, and I was noticing that being highly overweight seems to have lost some of it's social stigma...Most people just consider it normal to pack on the pounds after they turn 20....       While fast food is mostly to blame,  I'm starting to think the glorification of being slightly overweight is also to blame, heading people off down the slippery slope of weight gain.       Everywhere I look I see "big is Beautiful"  way of life, a women having a large rear is in fact more desired by Men.        Being overweight is not healthy for you, I liken this accepting attitude  toward it as being the same as the "smoking is cool" attitude of a few years ago...       So I ask you all, should we not treat people that are gaining weight, the same as people who are starting smoking?

20070614051531AA0WsVg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	God, an important subject to discuss???	Being on yahoo answers for a while, I have noticed that a lot of questions are about the ideal of a "God", or the divine. Correct me if I am wrong, but this seems to be a very important subject. Be it, to make sure we will be saved, or to show proof of his exsistence, these quesitons seem to me to be unanswerable. To be perfectly honest, I don't think ANYONE knows what is really out there (maybe except Almine).      My question is, is faith as strong as proof? Do we need some kind of assurance that we will be "saved"? Is there a Great Mystery (Wakan Tanka) that we will merge with when our souls depart? Or is it all in our mind?      Any comments or answers are totally accepted. I just think this is an important subject to talk about. The Mayan calender stops at 2013, so, should we prepare?????

Kicked out of church when I decided I didn't want to stay with my homicidal/suicidal husband any more.

If he does the least little thing that comes across wrong to me (and 99% of the time I'm the one wrong about his motive - he RARELY means anything bad like I think he does) - I get SO angry and feel so bad.  I get negative thoughts that won't go away and I spiral down quickly.  I know this anger comes from the abuse, but how do I deal with it, feel it, face it and get past it WITHOUT sinning against God or others w/these negative and bad thoughts?  What does "be angry and sin not" look like?

Como podem hoje igrejas protestantes exigirem os 10% de dízimo? pra mim o dízimo n?o tem diferen?a daquela venda de indulgência da igreja católica de 500 anos atrás. Será que Lutero aprovaria isso?

Poque se n?o nos ofendermos mutuamente n?o teremos de oferecer a outra face.      E Jesus passou o tempo todo falando sobre o amor e o perd?o e n?o sobre a agress?o.
20090203133257AAcrZze	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Where is good information about any studies done with children who have BDSM type of desires?	Is there any information relating to children and BDM desires?   There's an 11 year old boy who shows strong masochistic tendencies. He will pinch his self, scratch at his body, pull his skin, bite his self, and purposely anger other children so that they will physically retaliate.   He has been spoken to about correct behavior but he insists on acting up in order to get hurt.   When he is asked why he does this type of stuff he says it is because it feels good.    Psycatrist has said that behavior is not typical in children. I think they pysco is wrong.    My problem is that I can not find anything anywhere in relation to helping him to understand what's right and what's wrong in how he approaches getting his needs meet and without judgement.   He has had the safe, sane and consentual lecture.    Any advice would be helpful. Any links or studies done would be even better.    Thank you for your time.      ps I really want the boy to be at peace with his desires, I don't want him to ever feel like a freak because he's got unusual desires. I also don't want him making life long enemies though or causing himself lasting damage.
20090203134546AAbQrcJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A Christian Question?	My father and I are at odds, and I'm certain that I'm right. He has showcased downright psychotic behavior throughout his life, planning murder and rape with a broom, having sex with thirteen year olds, infidelity, admitting to possibly raping a daughter if he had had one, and many, many more things that I don't have the time to write. Anyway, because of his ways, I have chosen to keep my future family away from him, and he thinks this is a cold move, as does the rest of my family      My question is this: as a Christian, the Ten Commandments (and numerous other places in Scripture) command respect to a parent. I've even been told by pastors that to "honor your father and mother" has nothing to do with if they are practicing Christians or not.      What does "honor your father and mother" mean? What am I entitled to? Where do I draw the line, if I should, in protecting my family and standing up to someone who is bad on the inside but falsely respectable on the outside?

This as the rest of the world watches you ruin what is left of the worlds resources because you will very soon be joined by your God in Heaven!  Well here's the real question?  Will I be condemned to Hell for trying to make Heaven out of earth?  For trying to enlighten idiots that can only ASSUME there is a God and then back this by saying I can not prove there isn't?  Well I can Prove there isn't!  He calls himself a loving God, then WHY does he allow me to see suffering, agony, misery in small innocent children that he calls sinners just because they were born (for all men are sinners) What a worthless gester that is in that it absolutely proves HE WAS CREATED in OUR image not vice versa!

We were watching a movie together and just hanging out. He's 19 and I am 24. Anyway, after the movie, we played a game or two and it was a rough game and I finally won. After he lost, he screamed 'aw darn' and felt to the ground with his head and hands down on the floor, while only being on his knees so that his butt was out in my direction. I grabbed his hips and said "HAHAHAHAHA SUCKS FOR YOU!!!" And then we walked away jokingly and he told me to call him whenever I wanted to hang out again.

I was thinking about this and I am no exception but I try to keep things under control with my comments and I don't like to hate anyone for any individual things. So why do people feel the need to hate different belief systems, and be so blatant about it? Is it the people that are in it, or is it just that one has been hurt by someone of that religion and takes it out on all of the people of said religion? I know some people do it just because they want people to think for themselves but why be so hateful while attempting it, wouldn't that method make people cling to their religion stronger. History shows us that when there is something to fight for there will be someone to fight for it. And the protector, no matter what their views on the topic or thing, will defend it stronger if someone was to fight against it.   So why not just ask questions with an open mind and let others learn freely without judgement, isn't that the true purpose of this answers thing here at Yahoo!?

A exagerada concep??o de "só a Bíblia" levou  o protestantismo ou evagélicos a difundir a Bíblia de qualquer maneira, por milh?es, de edi??es sem nenhuma explica??o orientadora, deixando a interpreta??o a gosto do leitor. Da onde nasceu todo o divisionismo evangélico, do famoso: "só a Bíblia", e da interpreta??o pessoal da Bíblia. A raiz de tantas divis?es na igreja evangélica está na mentalidade com que o evangélico lê e interpreta a Bíblia.

Fui criada pelo meu padrinho de batismo, as irm?s dele me maltratavam desde a infancia, no ano passado eu briguei c/ ele e desenvolvi uma raiva sem motivo aparente, descobri que uma delas colocou a própria filha no meu lugar, como sobrinha/filha morando c/ ele; qdo eu ligava pra tentar conversar, me tratava mal e com desprezo...tudo dava errado na minha vida, o dinheiro n?o dava, fiquei desempregada por meses, qdo consegui um emprego, fui mandada embora com 1 mês e sem motivo, até que uma pessoa da umbanda resolveu me ajudar, descobri que trabalhos foram feitos p/ que eu me afastasse dele (que chamo de pai), uma m?e de santo procurou fazer de tudo para me ajudar, e fez um trabalho, no ultimo dia desse trabalho, eu tropecei em frente a uma loja de produtos místicos, entrei e fiquei olhando as imagens até que vi uma de um homem forte, imponente, confesso que tinha receio de encostar na imagem, mas toquei e tive arrepios e press?o baixa, tudo muito rápido era Xang?, o que isso quer dizer?

20080203055936AAnAPqm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	E' stata fissata la data per la giornata dell'orgoglio pedofilo : 23 giugno..?	Quello che stiamo vivendo e di cui siamo attualmente testimoni, all'inizio del nuovo millennio, non è uno scontro di civiltà ma uno scontro di moralità all'interno della civiltà; più precisamente uno scontro tra il "progresso liberale"  e  " l'opulente etica morale", tra "bene" e "male".   Questo è il risultato di un impressionante regresso nella cultura che non fa onore al progresso della cultura umanistica : assistiamo alla decadenza morale.   Le cosiddette scienze umane e sociali sono impantanate in dibattiti che che apparirebbero assurdi a chiunque, se non fosse che la nostra stessa realtà personale e sociale sta andando alla deriva. Il problema sorge in quanto una situazione sociale presente di tipo prevalentemente liberale e una pseudo-scienza sociale fallimentare coesistono accanto ad un realtà sconcertante.   Fine dove ci porterà il liberalismo?   Fine dove ci porterà l'assenza di etica morale?   Esiste una linea di demarcazione moralmente invarcabile?

Segundo a estrela, ela procurou o local para ter uma conversa com Deus. Rodeada de problemas que parecem inacabáveis, ela estava acompanhada do novo namorado, o fotógrafo Adnan Ghalib. Quem aconselhou a ida de Spears à igreja foi o desconhecido ator Chad Hardcastle, que ficou mobilizado após o último vexame de Spears ao n?o estar presente em mais uma audiência para a decis?o da guarda dos filhos. "N?o havia lugar melhor para ela ir, depois de um dia complicado. Lá, ela orou pedindo paz e sabedoria, e escreveu uma carta para Deus", disse o ator em entrevista ao E!News. Pedindo a ben??o de Deus, Spears n?o consegue se vê longe dos escandalos que a mostram como desequilibrada. Segundo o amigo pessoal e empresário da cantora, Sam Lufti, afirmou que Spears é uma pessoa muito normal.

20080130130702AAbJIIC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Quanto custa um milagre?	Uma história verdadeira         --------------------------------------...       Tess era uma garotinha precoce de 8 anos, quando ouviu seu Papai e sua Mam?e conversando sobre seu irm?ozinho, Andrew.       Tudo que ela sabia era que ele estava doente e que eles estavam completamente sem dinheiro. Eles se mudariam para um apartamento num subúrbio no próximo mês, porque o Papai n?o tinha recursos para pagar as contas do médico e o aluguel do apartamento.       Somente uma interven??o cirúrgica muito cara poderia salvá-lo agora, e parecia que n?o havia ninguém que pudesse emprestar-lhes o dinheiro. Ela ouviu seu pai dizer à sua m?e chorosa, com um sussurro desesperado,   "Somente um milagre poderá salvá-lo agora."       Tess foi ao seu quarto e puxou o vidro de gelatina de seu esconderijo no armário. Despejou todo o dinheiro que tinha no ch?o e contou-o cuidadosamente. Três vezes. O total tinha que estar exato. N?o havia margem de erro. Colocando as moedas de volta no vidro com cuidado e fechando a tampa, ela saiu devagarinho pela porta do fundo e andou 5 quarteir?es até a Farmácia Rexall, com seu símbolo de Chefe de Pele Vermelha sobre a porta.       Ela esperou pacientemente que o farmacêutico a visse e desse aten??o, mas ele estava muito ocupado no momento. Tess esfregou os pés no ch?o para fazer barulho. Nada! Ela limpou a garganta com o som mais terrível que ela p?de fazer. Nem assim! Finalmente ela pegou um níquel do vidro e bateu no vidro da porta.   Finalmente!       E o que você quer?" perguntou o farmacêutico com voz aborrecida.. "Estou conversando com meu irm?o que chegou de Chicago e que n?o vejo há séculos", disse ele sem esperar resposta pela sua pergunta. "Bem, eu quero lhe falar sobre meu irm?o", Tess respondeu no mesmo tom aborrecido. "Ele está realmente doente... e eu quero comprar um milagre."       "Como?", balbuciou o farmacêutico at?nito. "Ele chama Andrew e está com alguma coisa muito ruim crescendo dentro de sua cabe?a e Papai diz que só um milagre poderá salvá-lo. "Ent?o, quanto custa um milagre?"       "N?o vendemos milagres aqui, garotinha. Desculpe, mas n?o posso ajudá-la", respondeu o farmacêutico, com um tom mais suave. "Escute, eu tenho o dinheiro para pagar. Se n?o for suficiente, conseguirei o resto. Por favor, diga-me quanto custa."       O irm?o do farmacêutico era um homem bem vestido. Ele deu um passo à frente e perguntou à garota. "Que tipo de milagre seu irm?o precisa?" "N?o sei", respondeu Tess, levantando os olhos para ele. "Só sei que ele   está muito mal e Mam?e diz que ele precisa ser operado. Mas Papai n?o pode pagar, ent?o quero usar meu dinheiro."       "Quanto você tem", perguntou o homem de Chicago.    "Um dólar e 11 centavos", Tess respondeu quase num sussuro. "E é tudo que tenho, mas posso conseguir mais se for preciso."   "Puxa, que coincidência", sorriu o homem. "Um dólar e 11 centavos - exatamente o pre?o de um milagre para irm?ozinhos." Ele pegou pegou o dinheiro com uma m?o e dando a outra m?o à menina, disse " Leve-me até   aonde você mora. Quero ver seu irm?o e conhecer seus pais. Quero ver se tenho o tipo de milagre que você precisa."       Esse senhor bem vestido era o Dr. Carlton Armstrong, um cirurgi?o, especializado em neuro-cirurgia. A opera??o foi feita com sucesso e sem custo algum, e meses depois Andrew estava em casa novamente, recuperado.   Mam?e e Papai comentavam alegremente sobre a sequência de acontecimentos ocorridos. "A cirurgia", murmurou Mam?e, "foi um milagre real. Gostaria de saber quanto deve ter custado?" Tess sorriu. Ela sabia exatamente quanto custa um milagre... um dólar e onze centavos... mais a fé de uma garotinha. Um milagre n?o é a suspens?o de uma lei natural, mas o resultado de uma lei maior ..

20080207133811AA6QR8q	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	é impossivel haver onisciência. Já pensou nisso?	Onisciência: seria a capacidade que Deus tem de conhecer tudo sobre o passado, presente e futuro, inclusive vasculhar a mente e os sentimentos dos humanos.       A onisciência resultaria em um dilema. Para ser mais compreensível usarei uma ilustra??o: se eu fosse onisciente, saberia tudo que irei fazer amanh?; saberia que acordarei, cal?arei meus chinelos, irei amo banheiro, escovarei os dentes, etc., etc., etc. mas se, de repente, eu quisesse tomar café antes de escovar os dentes, eu n?o poderia fazer isso, porque previ, onisciente que sou, que eu iria escovar antes de tomar café. Se previ que irei escovar antes de tomar café e no momento certo eu tomar café antes de escovar, minha previs?o falhou e eu n?o sou onisciente. Eu n?o poderia fazer nada diferente do que estava previsto, porque se eu tentar mudar eu já teria previsto que tentaria mudar, ent?o na verdade eu n?o mudei, só fiz uma mudan?a que já estava prevista que aconteceria.
