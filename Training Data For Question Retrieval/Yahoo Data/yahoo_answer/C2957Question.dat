20090227104138AATqpXP	Environment;Green Living	Where can I bring my old magazines to be recycled?	I googled this question and everything that showed up was tips on how to recycle like dropping them off at doctor's offices, passing them on to friends or using them for crafts.      The thing is, many of them are old (early 2000's to present) so I doubt any of my friends want them, and a lot of them don't belong in doctor's offices due to nudity and vulgarity (Rolling Stone, Blender, Spin, Interview, a bunch of celebrity gossip mags, etc). Also, many of them have pages ripped out or cut up from when I used them to make collages and other crafts.      I can not throw them out, I would be filled with guilt! At the same time, I'm cleaning out my room and don't want them around anymore.      A lot of other search results said many locations do not allow you to recycle magazines with newspapers. If this country is promoting recycling and saving energy, why the hell is it so hard to find somewhere to bring these old magazines!?      Are there specific places I can bring them? Please help!      -please don't give me more "ideas" on how to "use" my old magazines! I just want an answer on where to bring them so they can be recycled.

20090227095911AANWItY	Environment	Eliminating our carbon foot print.?	With all the talk on global warming and storage of nuclear waste I thought of a possible solution. I wonder what the effects would be if we captured the carbon and sent it on a suicide mission to the sun. Carbon is one thing, what would the effects be if we did the same with nuclear waste. I understand that nuclear waste is more volitile (sp) than carbon emissions. I think it would be comparable to throwing a grain of sand at a basketball. The sun and space have way more nastier chemicals than what we have on earth. Your thoughts?
