I'm not sure if this is just me being thick or whether something has changed, but why is it that the best answer to my questions is voted for by others now? Is this due to me becoming a level 2 or something?   I don't like it because it means I no longer get to give feedback/thanks to whoever was most helpful to me.   Is there anyway I can change this? or is it just the way it is.

When I turn on my Xbox 360, I play for about 5-10 minutes and then my the sound stops, the game stops, and some lines appear on the screen that I think are faulty graphics. The red ring of death doesn't appear so I think it has something to do with overheating. If you know how to fix this problem of overheating, please respond. Cause I got Lord Of The Rings:Conquest and the Halo Wars demo which I would like to play. With Halo Wars I cant pass the training, cause it gets stuck halfway. It's as if it doesn't want me to play. So, I beg of you people please help me fix this overheating problem! Thanks.

I accidentally posted twice because I didn't see it and at first thought my computer was stuck in cyber space (I've occasionally had freezing problems, too).        Finally, I realized I was looking at comments that were posted the previous day.  There was no last button.  The only way to see the latest comments was to hit next like 40 times.        This is utterly stupid, but I may be, too.  Is there a way to change this display?  If so, can someone please enlighten me?  Thank you, in advance.  Incidentally, I've only ever had this problem on Yahoo.

Trolls keep posting rants and absurd joke posts, and then when they are answered in kind, the answerer gets a deletion before the asker, who may not get deleted at all. In the Politics and Government section, well over 90% of the posts are troll-bait. Both sides do it, and so badly that section should be shut down, removed altogether, because nothing educational and positive ever happens there.      Before you throw "freedom of speech" at me, think of what I am saying. People who are here to heckle and insult and play like children, in direct violation of the rules, are running -- and ruining -- this place.

20090220043953AAXfLpF	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Groups	Is there a place other than Yahoo where you can place invites to your group for free?  If so, is it okay to?	Just want to see my group grow.  I would like some input on places to place invites to your group online that are free outside of Yahoo.  Also, need to know if it's okay (per Yahoo) to do that?  There is an invite section of the group, where the owner & or moderator can complete the form Yahoo has designed to send invitations.   However, here is the deal on that...when you get to that page, it explains that you can send up to 50 e-mail addresses at a time on there.  Then at the top it is very confusing, because there is a comment that you cannot send invitations, as that is considered spam.  Well, everyone I know has joined my group, so to me that is confusing.  How can I invite others to join my group or even look at my home page & decide if they would like to join without the request or invitation from me being considered spam?  Please help me with this, as I am not trying to scam or spam anybody, just would like to see my group grow.  Thanks

I''ve got a separate account on Yahoo!Answers that my friend discovered recently and she always looks through my answers and questions. i mean, I don't have anything bad on it, its just private and not something i want people i know looking at. the whole point of this site is that its anonymous. she was looking through some questions i'd answered today and she was saying how stupid some of the questions were and my answers were really silly. I don't like that, people come on this site for help, not to be judged and I don't like her saying judgmental things like that, about both me and the asker. its my account and not something i want her seeing. its private to me. i tried saying not too, but she can easily have a good look through when im not there. i would just make a new account but i've got 20,000 points+ and im a TC so i don't want it gone just because of my friend. I have tried going private but she's a contact and so she can see. what can i do?
