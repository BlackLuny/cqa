gPrSklCQaa	THE PEOPLE AND THE LAND OF SIND        The land of Sind has a hoary past with some of the most striking episodes in history having occurred in its bosom. It has given a slightly different variation of its name to our neighbouring country and to the religious majority of its inhabitants. Both the words India and Hindu are derived from Sindhu, which, in Persian became Hind and Hindu (the letter H substituted for S) and in Greek and Roman, Ind (the letter S of Sind having being dropped). The meaning of the word Sindhu is water, referring to the great river. There is an old belief among Muslims that four rivers had sprung from Heaven: Neel (Nile), Furat (Euphrates), Jehoon (Juxartes) and Sehoon (Sind).    The Aryans called the whole of Pakistan, Kashmir and East Afghanistan as Sapta Sindhu -- the land of seven rivers. In Rigveda it is referred to as Sapta Sindhva, while India is named Bharat Varsa (the land of the sons of Bharat, a legendary Emperor).1 Thus, even for the Aryans there were two countries in this sub-continent: Sapta Sindhva and Bharat Varsa. The Assyrians in the 7th century B.C. knew the north-western part of the sub-continent as Sinda. However, when India began to be called Hind by Persians and Arabs, and Ind by Greeks and Romans, the local people continued to call their land, Sind. This distinction continued for centuries. Arab geographers, historians and travellers also called the entire area from the Arabian Sea to the range of Kashmir mountains Sind.3 As such, there were always two countries in the sub-continent -- Sind and Hind. The present Pakistan (including Kashmir and a major portion of Afghanistan) constituting one country, and India, another.    As regards the composition of the population of Sind Province (before Partition) the two main stocks that inhabit Sind are related to, and common, one with the Punjab and another with Baluchistan. The majority stock is that of Rajputs and Jats who are the descendants of Sakas, Kushans and Huns who also constitute the majority of the population the Punjab. During Kalhora rule a number of Jat tribes such as the Sials, Joyas and Khawars came from the Punjab and settled in Sind. They are called Sirai i.e., men from the north and speak Siraiki language.    Two main Rajput tribes of Sind are: the Samma, a branch of the Yadav Rajputs who inhabit the eastern and lower Sind and Bahawalpur; and the Sumra who, according to the 1907 edition of the Gazetteer are a branch of the Parwar Rajputs. Among others are the Bhuttos, Bhattis, Lakha, Sahetas, Lohanas, Mohano, Dahars, Indhar, Chachar, Dhareja, Rathors, Dakhan, Langah etc.4 The Mohano tribe is spread over Makran, Sind and southern Punjab. They are also identified with the 'Mallah' of the Punjab and both have in common a sub-section called Manjari. All these, old Sindhi tribes are known under the common nomenclature of Sammat.    The smaller stock is that of Baluchi tribes setlled in various parts of Sind mostly during the last five hundred years or so  Since they were martial people and ruled over Sind for some time before the arrival of the British, they acquired vast lands in the province with the result that a large number of present-day Sindhi landlords are of Baluch origin. According to the 1941 census, which was the last one held before Partition Baluchis formed 23% of the total Muslim population of Sind. Among the Baluchi tribes inhabiting Sind are the Rind, Dombki, Jakhrani, Leghari, Lashari, Chandio, Karmati, Korai, Jatoi, Burdi, Khosa, Jamali, Umrani, Bugti, Marri, Mazari, Talpur, Brohi, Nizamani, Buledhi, Karrani, Bozdar, Nukharni, Magsi etc. These tribes are spread over Baluchistan, Sind and the south-western districts of the Punjab.

Lots of snow still on the ground.  I live in the Chicago suburbs and just returned from Clearwater a few weeks ago, so I'll help you out.  I just saw the Chicago weather forecast on ABC t.v. news.  It's going to be cold Monday and Tuesday, then we're expected a warm-up.  They say it will get into the 40's (a heat wave around here) next week.      Here is a link to the 10 day Chicago forecast:  http://weather.com/outlook/travel/vacati...    This link on weather channel doesn't show it as warm as they did on ABC weather, so be prepared.  You'll feel cold in this weather, so bring the right clothes.  Heavy coat or jacket, gloves, long-sleeve shirts, hat, scarf, proper shoes in case it snows, jeans or other heavy pants, knee-socks.  You might also need thermal underwear, since you're not used to the cold.  Drink plenty of liquids, which will keep you hydrated.  You need liquids in the winter, too.  Hope you stay warm!|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	I live in the southwest suburbs.We had a heat wave today of 35 degrees just wore a sweater outside,no coat.Would not recommend that for you.I believe they are forecasting the 20s for the coming week.Bring a coat,hat,gloves,scarf,warm socks,layer your clothing,sweatshirts,sweaters,long sleeves are a must.When picking a coat go with a longer length rather than short,it helps keep the legs warm.Do you have a place to buy all this stuff?If not just bring the warmest you can find to change into at the airport (if flying).Hit all the sales up here for cold weather gear that way you don't spend alot.|`|AWVz63fFaa	really freaking cold.|`|UhX0lcK3aa	It was not 5 degrees here today!

You only get to notice when you move a few miles and get to a new town, as I did when growing up...      Basingstoke in Hampshire is a London over-spill town, but if you drive just 8 miles west, you get to Overton, and ancient country village... Distinctly more rural accents, which really stand out if the locals go to Basingstoke!  The young would be mocked as "Faaaaarmers" by the "Townies", so the youth of Overton would generally fell happier and fit in more by travelling west, again just about 7 miles, to Andover.  Andover is a smaller town than Basingstoke, but the local accent is even broader!  To this day, I can hear a few words, and tell someone is from that area...  Going in the other direction, the big city near to Basingstoke is Reading (pronounced "Redding") where the accent tends to be even more clipped, more like West-London.   Don't forget the East-End of London accent, the cockney, is utterly discreet from anywhere else in the country...|`|7u8ID6GTaa	Anywhere past Northampton and your getting into the dodgey accent zone
AA10973537	Advantages of Britain ...   - the weather in the south east is mild compared to what it is in northern Belgium where i am a lot more restricted as to what I can grow in the garden.  -  there are a lot more sunshine hours down the English south coast than in Belgium.  - Compared to Australia there are less poisonous creatures that roam the gardens especially snakes and spiders.      Disadvantages of living in Britain ...    If i stick to the subjects of natural disasters and weather there are no disadvantages to Britain as far as I'm concerned.       We emigrated a year ago ...|`|roXMdNWxaa	Well I live in Australia so hopefully I can help.    Advantages of Britain:    *Not nearly as severe weather. It can be 40 c or higher in some parts.  Average is around 25 - 30 c.    *Not as many dangerous animals - we don't have as many as people think, but in some parts. They aren't all in your backyard.      Disadvantages of Britain:    *More populated    *Not nearly as sunny    Hmm I can't think of much else at the moment.

Public transport is pretty reliable.                      When people say 9 pm they mean 9 pm,                      Most people have electricity and water to their homes.                      Kidnapping is not a normal occurence.                      There is a wide range of educational opportunity.                      Good second-hand clothes stores.                     People - you just don't know when you have it good!  Why do you think all the immigrants want to get there?    Others have put disadvantages, so I won't bother.

Disadvantages -     1) The formation of an underclass (by Government policy- past and present) [Chav/Charva culture] living quite richly on welfare. Marx would describe this culture as the 'lumpenproletariat'; but these types are costing the Govt millions in both welfare payments and legal aid when they come to Court for their various public order offences.    2) Increasing Governmental restrictions on responsible freedom. One cannot, for example, smoke a cigarette or pipe anywhere, even though segregation of smokers and non-smokers in pubs, trains etc is perfectly feasibile and has been success done in the past. 23% of the population smoke and if reduced to class dimensions 60% of Social Classes IV and V smoke ( Source-my own research with 2326 participants)    3) Excessive hours culture in British offices - we work some of the longest hours in Europe and we have to sign out from the EU directive on long hours - unless we sign out, employers can force us to work 60 hours per week. How  many employers actually offer this option to newly recruited staff. It is illegal not to do so, but who knows their rights these days - they are not exactly emblazoned on the night sky so that all can see them.    4) A media that is allowed to exploit the chav culture and promote it in favour of refinement.

(You know who i mean, the one with the look of disgust when you dare order some food.)|`|BBHRy12naa	I live in probably the most multi-cultural borough in the whole of Britain. It's a place called Stratford in London, and you would all know it coz its where the olympics are being held. So there it is! British have great opportunities, have many multicultural people that actually get along (I think), and lets face it, british weather aint great, but I rather prefer this anyday than face constant tornodas, landslides and volcanic eruptions compared to the rest of the world. And there's freedom and human rights, that many countries probably don't have!  This probably hasn't helped u with the australia bit, since australia is simialr to britain, but u can point out that so far british pounds are higher than australian dollars (unless im wrong on that)....
HsgEFrJMaa	Yes; equality of arms is the only way to safeguard the peace; that's why the U.S. armed Saudi Arabia and that's why the izzies can't shed Saudi blood the way they can with the Pals. With a good defense system and a strong potential for retaliation I daresay our fine little zionists chubbies would think twice about bombing Palestinian cities.|`|rdoPeWnzaa	Yes they should. To the people who don't think that Palestine is a country, well it is. Israel will never be considered as a country, and if it was it would be the stolen country. And yes they should have the right to arm themselves not that Israel will ever let them. Israel is allowed to get aids and have tanks, machine guns, and whatever high tech. weapon but the Palestinians don't have anything only rocks. thats there weapon rocks. For Hamas it would be the harmless rockets which don't injure anyone.|`|TA4rdQM3aa	Yes. It should declare it's independence and assert it's right to national defense. They've taken enough of this Ku Klux Klan behavior from the Jews,and anyway they aren't even in the Palestinian Territories legally.|`|adznfYe3aa	The aggressor states as you call them target those of a different ideology.

I think it is right to defend oneself when attacked by not okay to attack and then claim innocence.|`|rY9qQJIFaa	Not until a stable government is established,although Gen. Dayton has had success in training the Palestinian Security Service. They have already assumed police functions in hebron and Nablus. But as to a real military,that's a long way down the road.

These Middle Eastern countries bully Israel all the time, but when Israel attack back and blows them to hell, they cry and say that they never did anything wrong.|`|aI3WsnnEaa	Sure they should.    Should they ever chose to start attacking a military target like a true resistance would.    too bad they only go for "soft targets" aka civilians.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	yes only as part of a legitimate army not terrorist groups!|`|50zbKv0jaa	no they are israeli citizens then need to obey the laws and be good citizens  they should enjoy not being in a muslim arab state and the governmental incompetence that involves|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	they should have not elect Hamas as leaders and they won't have a aggressive state against them.|`|HXIIbVN8aa	No because there is no nation known as Palestine. Before the Arabs in the territories, can be allowed to arm themselves, they must first be shown to be able to conduct themselves as a responsible government entity. To allow a terrorist group to arm, knowing full well that it inbtends to try to kill its neighbor, would be the height of irresponsibility.  When Hamas and the Fatah groups show that they are able to conduct themselves as free, serious people, then it might be time to discuss allowing them to arm.|`|wVsjgj35aa	Absolutely,equality of arms is the only way to forestall aggression. No one can deny that the Palestinians have been the object of um considerable aggression since 1948.|`|5JFG5W4uaa	Bosco..who said that the "Palestinians" do not have weapons. War weapons supplied by other Arabian and anti-democratic countries. And those who imply that Israel (which originally was Palestine) started the aggressive war these many years.

Spartawo...|`|job9o5ioaa	Most DEFI freaking NITELY.|`|pgAnh6f7aa	Yes,after etablishing a de jure government.

Which one you complaining about.|`|8534d209ec45c31ceca33f3a403020aaaa	Palestine does not exist.  No they should not, they are aggressor criminals.|`|AA10160596	If they would stop acting as the aggressors and being useful idiots for radical Muslim hatred they'll never have a need for weapons. But for as long as they are willing to sacrifice their children, women and themselves for false ideologies then let them suffer the consequences. At first I felt bad for them but now after seeing them use occupied schools and homes and hospitals as shields to protect their cowardly selves I couldn't care less.
wVsjgj35aa	Almost two million. I know it's a stereotype but I sometimes that perhaps jews do take some sort of pleasure in getting crunched. It is a historical fact that they go out of their way to make enemies with large groups - often,as in this case,groups far,far larger than themselves. The history of zionism is available at all libraries and they went there hating Muslims before they even arrived. They had no intention of dwelling peacefully amongst them and they made no secret of that,not even as early as 1913. Deny it all they want,it's still a documented fact. What to speak of their personal charm.  They went their to expel them from Palestine and use it as a platform for endless attacks on other Muslim countries. How will it end? Probably like a boomerang. What goes around comes around. I expect in enough time there will another Good Ship Exodus heading the other way. Then they can resume vilifying Europe and European culture. They really know how to win friends and influence people.     What to speak of their background. Now let's take that Samson,is he not one of their Great National Heroes,held up as a model to all young persons so unfortunate as to be subject to such indoctrination? Ah yes,Samson. This is the guy who takes unto him a concubine,murders her and dismembers her corpse,carving it into twelve pieces and sending each piece to a different party in twelve different locales in Palestine,no reason in particular being indicated 12 is yet another "mystical" number.  What a charming suitor in any event.  As to his Mighty Blow against the Philistines,the Sacred Inspired Text ludicrously describes the crowd gathered to watch him "sport" as standing on the roof of the building which makes it difficult to see how they could have observed him "sporting" within. Hey,I have to be honest,I'm glad he's dead and I doubt there is any truth to the patently ludicrous account of the crowd-on-the-rooftop. Who wrote this garbage anyway,some hibaru version of Green River Killer? Frankly,all their horoes seem to be of similar cast.|`|B3FBgxjEaa	Fhlishtim did it to Samson, they were the first.

There are 1.5 billion Muslims, and so many of them are divided, fighting with each other.  About 13 million Jews, but they usually stick together.    So, it's easy for the Zionists to conquer, because we as a nation are quite weak due to seperation. When Muslims unite, Palestine will be free.|`|HsgEFrJMaa	About 1.5 billion Muslims. There are about 13 million self-described jews,at least half of them not even religious.     Yes,that was kind of a mistake,taking on the entire Roman Empire. It seems to be a tendency of theirs. It's called pulling the tiger by the tail. When you do that you get what you asked for. Apparently this is some sort sort of self-defeating cultural trait of theirs. They do the same thing in the U.S.,constantly attacking Christianity. The late Hyan Maccoby made a whole career out of it. Bear in mind this is a predominately Christian country and really the only thing left propping up the Great Zionist Experiment. We are also being currently deluged by hysterical anti-Muslim hate literature,all of it authored by Jews. This has not escaped the attention of Muslims. Nor has it escaped the attention of Americans that these people are intensely anti-Christian.|`|6106bf75a443c7ad47b50d9b2b1cadc6aa	True, and Muslims are there baiting Christians. Atheists are there baiting  Believers in GOD.& God is there allowing himself to become bait for any and everyone.|`|rdoPeWnzaa	Yes your right, Zionists seem to enjoy "baiting" on muslims. The Romans have never really had good relations with Jews. No one had good relations with jews. I wonder why??|`|1gmsCb4Maa	If you enjoy playing the victim you will find it necessary to provoke more powerful forces against you. it's a childish,familiar to anyone who remembers life on the  old school playground. It's a type. The usual motive is the idea that being pitiable provides a semblance of moral superiority. If you're in the 2nd grade and you can provoke a fifth grader into striking you you can play up the disparity in size,play the victim. If you create the right impression then you are the Wronged Party and therefore the Righteous Party.|`|TA4rdQM3aa	About 2 billion,and yes,it does seem that Jewish organizations never pass up a chance to harass or offend them. They definitely want Muslims to hate them. They apparently also wanted the Roman Empire to hate them. Why? I have no idea.

Wasn't it to oust the Romans and establish a just-for-jews state? Well,that's certainly zionism. I think you're the one who needs to hit the history books.     To answer your question,history repeats itself a lot because so many groups cannot change. i would wager that as long as they exist Jews will be baiting vastly superior forces. Then they can wallow in self-pity and play the victim.|`|1b47d266c534a22e56fed1ec2c0bf117aa	There were no Zionists at the time of Josephus.  Go read your History before posting such nonsense.
wVsjgj35aa	Yes. They should have done it right after their only free election in early 2006. But it's never too late.    I don't understand the Pokie's answer. The West Bank is a part of the Palestinian Territories. I thought that was well known.    I don't understand Shay's either.

You mentioned oil reserves. Those do not matter since Britain has great control of them. Same with Jordan. History tells us that Britain never really wanted to create a Jewish state but was forced too because of Irgun terrorist attacks against them (more self defense), bribery (not so much of that as people actually think) American verbal aggression towards UN participants. From what I understand it had to do with oil. They believed that Palestine had oil. IT HAS EXTREMELY LITTLE. Therefore, they do not care about is as much anymore. The oil reserves from what I understand are not from the area of Gaza, or leaked into from Sinai, I'm not really sure. Because if it truly was from Gaza, Israel would have taken control of it a long time. If you can prove to me that they profit 100% from the reserves or more than 30%, then I am wrong.|`|HsgEFrJMaa	The advantages of statehood are too numerous to list,so yes,by all means.

While there will always be antisemitism from such racist groups as the BNP or the KKK, this is simply an unavoidable fact of life. Racism will always exist, however currently, antisemitism has fallen steeply (in comparison with anti-immigrant sentiments, anyways). There is no more of a need for Israel as a Jewish safe haven than there is for the creation of a country as a Black, Hispanic, or Gay safe haven (all of which are groups that experience some form of discrimination, though not to the point of persecution).|`|jJxUCkkFaa	have ever heard ofthe Voyage of the Damned?(jewish refugees turned away from the us)the Ku Klux  Klan and other antisemtic groups, they still exist|`|8vMmUbcqaa	Gods master race can do as they please hey wait a mo don`t they sound like the Nazis.

Especially Islam.  Had the whole world not stood up and said we will not watch while a people is extinguished again.  The Muslims would have killed all the Jews and there wouldn't a  need for camps this time.  America is ashamed of not stopping Hitler sooner.  They won't allow Muslims to work their wrath on Israel. Nor do they intend to watch the move from the Saturday people to the Sunday people without a fight.  You as an unbeliever fit right into the Koran with it's 109 lines of killing all non believers.  I guess that makes sense to the godless.
7X6HxaSmaa	The southern part of phoenix proper is pretty dumpy or alternatively rather underdeveloped. You can find nice housing in that area, but there isnt a lot of stores in those areas.  South Mountain Park is in that area though, which is popular for light hiking.  If you dont mind living further away, Tempe is quite active, since it's a college area. Gammage Auditorium on ASU's campus is probably the main theatrical venue. And theres a wide variety of ethnic food in within a mile or so of campus.  Calmer areas would be Arcadia and Sunnyslope, (in phoenix but east and north respectively) and I suggest them mostly as they're near some mountains and feel vaguely artsy.    Um for general entertainment downtown has some sporting venues like america west arena(or wherever the suns play now) and chase field(or wherever the diamondbacks play now) as well as an artwalk the first friday of each month.  Outdoor adventures, well if you're willing to drive 90 miles or so you can see a lot, we have a couple man-made lakes as well as a lot of scenic roads. 4wd helps on some of those. If you prefer less desert you can go north toward payson or sedona. Payson being a foresty retreat area, and Sedona being a pretty red rock area where people wear crystals. Flagstaff to the north offers skiing for a month or two each year.|`|zZcqiRjraa	i'd suggest living in the east valley its right next to phx (mesa, tempe, scottsdale, chandler or gilbert) its a great place to live it may be a little harder to find a home thats not in a development community.. phoenix isnt one of my favorite places some of it is ok but downtown and central are a little dumpy imo.. but i grew up in gilbert and ive been in cali for a year now and i really miss it!! If you live in any of the cities in the easy valley, they're all meshed together (like one big city) so its not desolate or anything (a common misconception of AZ) there are tons of restaurants and eateries.. and you can find really good authentic mexican food. There are many mountain ranges around phx, too and its only few hours from flagstaff az (its way cooler there and the closest place for snow) and camping isn't too far of a drive either.. grand canyon and sedona az are a great for road trips..Phx and its surrounding cities has a brutal summer (from the end of april to about september) and the rest of the months youll only need a sweater/light jacket in the night/morning and day you can go without. if you'd like more info i'd be happy to help you can email me with any questions from my profile page! good luck hope you enjoy arizona =)
S5SvTGTZaa	I would describe my life routine when I was an elementary student in China more than 9 years ago:     Morning:   Getting up. Then, morning hygiene. After that, eating breakfast. A traditional Chinese breakfast contains things such as Youtiao (Oily Stick), Mantou (simple bun), Huajuan (twisted bun), Baozi (buns with fillings), Shaomai (a kind of Chinese dumpling), watery rice (rice cooked with more water, provides good hydration but is not as stomach-filling as dry rice with the same volume), milk, soymilk, etc. After that, going to school, either by bike or bus.     School:   Go to homeroom. After a while, go out into the campus and perform collective and synchronous morning exercises with the entire school student body (some thing Westerners never experienced and they might label it as "conformity"). Then go back to classroom and have classes. Classes are 40 minutes long, and there're 10 minutes breaks between class, and a set of eye exercises is performed (again collectively with entire student body but takes place in classrooms) just before one of these morning classes. For lunch, some students stay at school to eat, some students go home to eat. Before the first after-noon class, a period is devoted for students to practice calligraphy (pen or pencil calligraphy, not brushes. Brush calligraphy is taught and practiced in formal classes devoted to this subject). When I was in another elementary school, we didn't have this period, but a nap period. Then, after-noon classes progress in a similar routine with the morning classes, and the same eye-exercise set is performed for the second time just before one of these classes.     After school:   Students can stay after school for various academic reasons (mainly, making up or correcting academic works). Students can also stay after school for extracurricular activitites. Lots of homework await to be finished, and homework-doing can extend into mid-night on homework-heavy days.     Friday, just before weekends:  This day is kind of special, during afternoon a period can be devoted to Young Pioneers activites. The Pioneers movement is the Communist counterpart to the Scouting movement in the West. In China, the vast majority of elementary school students are Young Pioneers; it's part of our collective identity and bond.     Other comments on weekdays:  We have "On-Duty" days for which we do chores (such as cleaning) for the classrooms and the campus. That means, we do chores on the assigned days for which we are on duty. Sometimes, an overall cleaning task which involves the whole student body is performed by all students (usually happens on Fridays, after the Young Pioneers period, if I remember correctly). The collective nature of labor is meant to teach us Communist work and labor ethics (UNITY, not conformity as some Westerners would probably believe)    Weekends:   Each week we had to write one essay, so I devoted Saturday for it, sometimes half-day, sometimes whole-day. After that was done I could relax for the rest of weekend. It was a time before computers was widespread in China, so to relax I read books and go to parks or things like that, no any internet surfing or things like that.     Did I help? I don't know what the students' routine is like in China now but the routines I described above is what I'd experienced years ago. Different schools vary for their routine specifics but overall is probably similiar. Secondary schools probably have a similar routines, too, but their schoolworks are probably heavier and the student life is more adolesecent-like, I suppose. Non-student routines, such as those of working population, is generally the cycles of go-to-work, return-to-home-afterwork, things like that.     Well, it is the same cycles across all cultures: the cycles of study, work, and relaxation/rest.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	er-r-r... what social class are you talking about?...    basicly it's "get up - meal - activity - meal - activity - meal - activity - bed"    details vary...|`|f46iJJ6raa	Candide has given a great answer.

The sun feels very hot that far south, so wear lots of sunscreen and a good pair of sunglasses.

You answer it yourself. You simply state that this is so. There is no answer to the why you threw in to post as statement as a question. If there isn't any reason to think your statement is accurate in the first place,there is no why to answer. My answer is: Palestinian supporters do not have contempt for for facts and differing opinions. Zionists do - very much so - including you. Why?

( by u ofcourse i mean the pro-israelis)    btw most of my replies got deleted, coz there are some people over here that use many accounts to report our questions. so mature!! hiding the facts?    for ur information, i do not report every single question or answer that i don't like, just the offending ones, and I do rarely give thumbs down.    and yes for sure I will never ever agree with your opinion about the palestine/israel conflict , and i'm pretty sure that you also won't agree with me and everyone of us strongly believes that his opinion is the right one.       should i post a question asking why do the israeli supporters  have such contempt for facts and differing opinions?      edit: thanks for the thumb down, but for the one who gave me this thumb down.. will u tell me y? is there anything that u didn't like in my reply? or just it wasn't clear enough? maybe I wasn't able to express myself correctly because of the language. yeah i'm not that good in english, is there anything that u want me to explain it for u?    edit: oh... that's u sabres, btw when i've mentioned that many accounts thingie I was talking about u. twat? very classy.    sabres, u know that I don't have control over every single question that is being posted here.  i thought that this "how many Muslims are there and how many Jews?" is a question, anyway.. so now tell me... remember ur question when u've asked the ppl how long will i stay here ( of course u where blocking me, just read the title) that was a question or a rant or personal attack?     too bad , it looks like that yahoo answers has deleted many question, i was about to show u ur other rants.

However, currently Palestinians are divided into 2 camps, those supporting Hamas and those supporting Fatah.     The main Palestinian territory at the West Bank is ruled by Fatah and Gaza is ruled by Hamas.    At the moment the Palestinians in the West Bank have contempt for the Palestinians in Gaza and have blamed Hamas for the current outbreak of war with Israel.    Even Egypt, who has been a Palestinian supporter in the past, is not supporting Hamas and have closed the border between the two countries.    Israel has copped a lot of flak for closing the border and not allowing people to escape the war.     Egypt has also closed the border with them and they would normally be seen as a supporter of Palestine.    There is differing opinions throughout the world about this situation, but most people would have contempt for a terrorist organisation that has effectively ruined a country.    They are called Hamas.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	Who ever said that facts should get in the way of their global agenda?

Hamas "Member of Parliament" Fathi Hammad, brags about the Hamas use of human shields.    Fathi Hammad: "[The enemies of Allah] do not know that the Palestinian people has developed its [methods] of death and death-seeking. For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel, and so do all the people living on this land. The elderly excel at this, and so do the mujaheddin and the children. This is why they have formed human shields of the women, the children, the elderly, and the mujaheddin, in order to challenge the Zionist bombing machine. It is as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death like you desire life.'"    This may indeed be sick, but it is the Palestinian ideology.      .|`|Omb3mZaiaa	I haven't noticed that.

94b8KImYaa	Here is a part, and below the link of an article which might help you a little.     The Anti-Cruise Industry Web Sites   The number of web sites devoted to bashing the cruise industry is fairly small, thankfully, and they have one thing in common - fear-mongering as a means to stop the growth of the cruise industry because they have personal reasons for wanting to "get back" at it.    One site comes from an individual who had a family member go missing from a cruise ship and obviously refused to accept the most plausible reason for her disappearance. He is trying to "get back" at the industry, which he apparently feels was responsible for his loss.    Another individual got into the cruise bashing business by accident. By all appearances, she was looking for any topic for a web site that might attract a lot of readers so she could make money from pay-per-click advertising.

NfVwPREcaa	i would love to help you translate with thatt.  infact i am turkish myselff.:D  "bayiliyorum sana" means i adore you, or i am deely interested in youuu.. it means good things but at the same time it depends on who is saying it because, there are turkish boys who use that just to be funny and they dont mean it to be cute or anythingg.. if u understandd.. well i hope that helpedd.|`|vbTG3a4Zaa	thats not filipino(tagalog)  that is turkish|`|XvWotokIaa	Agree with Asl?.    The best English equivalent is "I am crazy for you".

Also expensive airport food.|`|IEliUISJaa	when i don't make it on a flight or my flight is delayed|`|5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	People who refuse to boot up their seat when its eating time... hello, since you are almost lying flat down, cant you smell my food coming?    There was 1 time i was on the plane, at the front row middle section where the seating is 3 seats on the left, 3 in the middle and 3 on the right(generally on international flights since it bigger planes) and through out the flight, since theres slightly more leg room in front of me, peuple kept 'squeezing' through(sometimes stepping on my stuff) to get to the other side. I mean wtf, if its meant to be walked through, they would have created an aisle or a pathway. It was so irritating.|`|54tW840Oaa	Going through the air port, curbside check in they take forever, security lines are so long and waiting for the plane to take off|`|LrGhFAkkaa	I don't like long flight in economy class. I have taken some flights that lasts 12-14 hours and I get really bored in the end and I find it hard to sleep in the economy chairs. It is also boring to wait around at airports for the next flight.|`|VlhmbHGGaa	I hate ignorant fellow passengers. Persons that block the aisle, persons that have a foul BO, drunk people, loud people.    I find security annoying but easily done. 8-9 hours adjacent to a godzilla is another matter.      Edit: I also dislike how passengers sometimes are treated by airlines in the US. Sometimes I feel like a cargo that have to be stuffed instead of a paying customer.|`|6egxGam6aa	Security is probably the most annoying part of traveling to me. I can't stand it when people put their stuff on the belt through the X-ray machine and then get their shoes back and insist upon putting them back on RIGHT THERE in the way. Drives me CRAZY.    TSA started a new thing in most airports in the country with three lines - one for families and travelers who need to declare oversize liquids (like breastmilk), one for the average traveler, and one for the "expert" traveler (it's labeled by a black diamond). It's a great idea, but it isn't being done properly at some airports - there's just one standard line. Oh well.    Other than that, I actually enjoy traveling and love airports. Call me crazy, but I do.|`|6cf0275dfcf47b6a37124ae7cc800816aa	I somehow always get sat next to the person who wants to constantly sniff and clear their throat/nose. You know that really horrid and annoying snorting noise they make and within 5 mins you feel like you're bunged up too?? Haha...maybe it's just me but I find that the rudest habit and the fact that I'm stuck next to them for a few hours too....    Also people who eat gum with their mouth wide open....so basically I hate ill manners!! LOL...

AA11763656	I know that djmr.com (DJ Montreal Records) is based in Montreal. It's an online store and not sure if they have a storefront in town. You should check craigslist and kijiji as well. I could sell you one of my 1200's.. but that would never happen ;) Brand new they are about $700 CDN each.. and like a fine car they don't depreciate in value unless to absolutely DESTROY them.. which is near impossible. But for what you are looking for, i'm sure that's not what you want to pay.     You should look for something like Stanton STR8-60's or 80's.. You could probably pick up a pair for super cheap.. and just for kicks a simple 2 channel (numark, gemini) mixer for around $40-50 bucks. All in all probably around $150 bucks could get you what I just mentioned.    Good luck.
CW8tJeUJaa	Interesting :  someone here says that anyone born in the UK calls themselves British.  I have never heard a Scotsman call themselves British,always Scottish, this also goes for the Irish and the Welsh.  I have also never heard an Indian born in the UK call themselves British or the Pakistanis, so on and so on they call themselves Indian,and so on, despite the fact they may have been born in the UK  for the true British whom had ancestors who fort in the war are now third rate citizens.|`|s65op1hGaa	Just thought I would clear things up.  Great Britain = England, Wales and Scotland.  United Kingdom = England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Ireland is not part of The UK or GB.    As for your question not many people call themselves british when they live here, they will say either English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish.  I think because the majority of British people are from England you are more likely to meet an English person, who may or may not call themselves British.    "England more or less constantly makes up 84% of the total population, Wales around 5%, Scotland roughly 8.5 %, and Northern Ireland (since 1921) less than 3%."    It may also depend who is asking. An English person asking a Scottish person what they were, the Scottish person would say they were Scottish.  If an American asked the same Scottish person he might say he was British instead.  This is just an alternative to others' comments.|`|tIup4U4iaa	I agree with much of what has been said, except for, Northern Ireland is not part of Great Britain. It is however part of the United Kingdom, which are two different entities. As it's full title is 'The United Kingdoms of Great Britain AND Northern Ireland'|`|8kIE1Dswaa	I think most English people would not think of themselves as British, either.    It is mainly those who have moved to the UK who would describe themselves as British.|`|msNXomjTaa	They do.    Unfortunately, many see British, and English as the same thing.  However, while the English are British, the British are most decidedly not English!      The English, Welsh, Scots, Northern Irish, Manx, and (arguably!) the Channel Islanders are all British.|`|TPVvddHWaa	The British Isles geographically covers the whole area and every country including Eire.    The passport business is covered by the United Kingdom or Eire.    Brits are ex-pats abroad.    Other than that I would say that it is correct, when abroad and one is asked where they come from to say the country. Nothing wrong with saying  'I am Welsh but live in England' or which ever country as appropriate either.|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	English prefer English before British too :)!  scottish accents are amazing|`|Ar1hfUIIaa	The british people are people from england, scotland, wales and northen ireland|`|WaiL2mFCaa	British people include Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish.

But yes, in my experience it's very rare to find someone from Wales, Scotland or Ireland to refer to themselves as British. Just English folk.|`|cnPKAlDYaa	Nowadays "British" only describes anybody holding a UK passport but who wasn't born here.    In Gordon Brown speak "British" includes anyone from any EU member state.|`|6egxGam6aa	People from the UK primarily identify themselves as either English, Scottish, Welsh, or Irish (and those who are Irish will probably mention that they are from Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK).    Think of it this way: if you were in a foreign country and someone asked you to identify your nationality, would you say, "North American" or "American"? You'd probably be more specific to your country instead of the continent it's located on. It's sort of the same way for those who live in Britain; they identify themselves by the specific part of the UK they reside in.    I hope that wasn't too confusing.

VlhmbHGGaa	First of all, you are indeed correct that prices can vary depending of country of departure. I benefit a lot from this myself traveling from Sweden via UK to my destination. It's much more expensive traveling from UK directly.

AA10421518	Every account gets one vote only.  High levels do not get to vote more than once.   Many trolls have more than one account, or may have friends with multiple accounts.  So they give themselves a bunch of thumbs up, and everyone else gets a bunch of thumbs down.      Someone may come to the Greece section asking a serious question about Greece.  Reg. users will give advice and serious answers.  They get the thumbs down.    And then the trolls come and insult Greece, give vicious, rude and mean answers and they get all the thumbs up!!!    It's not done with smoke and mirrors, its done with multiple accounts.|`|7lMaoTQvaa	Uhhhhm yea, Kiro you obviously dont know what a troll is. Actually I am the opposite of a troll because I defend cultures, not only the Greek culture. I defended Turkey a couple of times, and beleive it or not I have defended Fyrom once. But I do get defensive towards ppl who hate cultures. When somebody makes fun of a culture it makes me sick to my stomache but when somebody makes fun of Greeks then I get PISSED.     The only reason why I only know things about Crete is because I forgot everything in Greekschool accept all the good times that I had in there and my family is 100% Cretan and my dad and my mom tell me stories everyday. Which also adds, if you think I'm "too dark to be Greek" then you obviously have never been to Crete before.

I see questions asking "if you are greek do you like young boys" still being around a week later and offending all Greeks but my question was deleted immediately as being "offensive to some participants"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

tQsxsuNPaa	A credit card from a Spanish bank.  After reading Craig's answer, I went and looked at your questions...a Spanish credit card, whether or not you can get one (I'd take Craig's expertise on that...if you don't live in Spain, why would a Spanish bank give you a credit card?  And why would you need one?) is NOT going to get you a visa!      You know what, as I was typing that....I got it.  Some feeble attempt at a joke on the name VISA (the credit card) and a political visa!  Bad joke, is all!      No a credit card isn't going to get you permission to stay in the country, and without legal permission, you are going to wind up being an illegal immigrant.  Unless you get married.  (since your other questions indicate that's already part of the works)  Why not get married in the US?  You can still have a ceremony for his family in Spain, but your family surely wants you to have one in the States.  Once the marriage is final, then they will let you stay on Green Card Status.  As long as it isn't the Green Card that you are getting married for...which in your case, I'm convinced...    ?Buena suerte chica!  You'll work this out.  Red tape and bureaucracy in Spain are a mess, but you'll manage.|`|0yisMBdGaa	I saw the answer given in the other question you asked......im sorry but that person is an idiot!!    You can not apply for a credit card in a different country......let alone a different continent!!    To be honest with you, i dont know what it is like for Americans (or other continents) to come to Europe but all i know is Europeans trying to stay in America (or Asia etc.) for longer than 90 days is EXTREMELY difficult unless you have a lot of money or are on a Student Visa. So i wouldn't get your hopes up too much!|`|D2GiPPjTaa	Visa, Visa Electron... Maestro... Switch =P...

dDZ42kDKaa	Pretty much the only way to do it is this:    Bus  424 from airport to bus exchange  $3.75 (which will cover this and the next 2 buses)  Bus  98 from bus exchange to Seymour at West Georgia (downtown Vancouver)  N/A  Bus  257 to Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal  N/A  Ferry from Horseshoe Bay to Departure Bay  $13  Greyhound from Nanaimo (Departure Bay) to Campbell River  $34 for a refundable fare ($30 for a non-refundable)  Total:   $50.75 ($46.75 if you go for the non-refundable fare)    Some of these prices include tax, some don't. You'll save a LOT if you can get someone to meet you at Departure Bay and drive you from there to Campbell River. It's about an hour's drive, 2 hours on the bus.    Your only other options are taxi, hitch-hiking, getting someone to drive you, or taking the Greyhound the whole way, and those options are, in order, more expensive, more dangerous, not likely if you're flying in, more expensive.    Translink's website has information about the city bus and Skytrain at www.translink.bc.ca and has a very handy trip planner at tripplanner.translink.bc.ca which will tell you which buses to take, when they come, will show you a map and tell you how much it will cost.

SQWvMx6Maa	Well since it's spring time it might be half sunny or half rainy. It's really unpredictable. You should see the Aquarium, drive down the hana highway and all the tourist spots. I went there once and I recommend going to places where locals go so you can see what its like to live in Hawaii possibly interact with locals. Go to the local restaurants and have yourselves shaved ice or Hawaiian plate lunches. I recommend trying Kahlua pork with cabbage. Well clothes mostly comfortable clothes that you can move around in. And if you have any, bring hiking shoes so you can take pictures of the wildlife and explore it. If you're the beach kind of couple too pack some swimsuits and get tans if that's your thing :)  Don't forget the sunscreen because the sun shines a whole lot in Maui so you can have your skin protected. The sun comes out on and off so don't forget to wear it even if it's cloudy just to be safe. Enjoy your trip! And if you haven't already I suggest you visit the other islands too because everything is  different on each islands so it's something new to explore :D|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	we dont care, just bring alot of money|`|dIUvXolnaa	Just passing on some information.

1Jz21wyLaa	use the tfl website to get a route to high barnet, postcode en5 (there is a northern line tube station there, so it will be on the tfl routefinder).      once in high barnet, you can get on the "uno" 619 uni bus.  u cant miss it, its a pink and purple double decker.  seriously.  im not sure where exactly in high barnet you can get it from, but everything will be within walking distance.  go on the herts uni website as they help to run the uno bus and so should give some more information about it.|`|05cccXMyaa	You may make a contact with http://www.bmcoaches.co.uk in order to know more about the road's and highways and I feel they will be glad helping you find the right directions.

0bd69a0d27e95121bac8f9b19a25d7b7aa	I agree with the answer about the cold weatehr - you may even run into some snow.  If you want to take a beautiful drive and the roads are clear go up to Lake Tahoe over Mt. Rose - gorgeous drive!  Now, for Reno.  Here are some ideas:    1. National Automobile Museum - this is a really cool museum, especially if you like cars    2. Nevada Museum of Art - must see in Reno!!    3. Atlantis Casino - the best of all the casinos in my opinion    Best breakfast you will ever eat: Peg's Glorified Ham & Eggs    Best restaurant:  Sezmu    Hidden jewel restaurant: Overland Bar and Restaurant in Gardnerville, definitely worth the  drive!!!    Have fun!|`|022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	It's cold there.  Fair warning.    jdk
CyP7VMHHaa	Sorry, but there is no answer to your question. One airport is not always cheaper than another.    Airlines limit the number of seats per flight. When they're gone, the price goes up. Depending on demand, JFK might be cheaper for a departure one day, LaGuardia on another, and Newark on a third day.    Try searching on www.kayak.com. It shops many different websites and combines the results in one display. You can easily change departure airports and check which one is less when you want to go.    If you want nonstop service, you have to use JFK or Newark. At the moment, there is no nonstop service to Cancun from LaGuardia.|`|zRL1P57haa	you can search online and if you did not buy your ticket yet then try this web site ,it is very good one  www.priceline.com.When you will open and enter your destination ,there is a option of" name your own price "you can buy much cheaper then others  it is my experience and it works|`|v3gTAo3raa	Honestly, it varies all the time, so I would recommend comparing both of them.

YhECDSKRaa	No need to sneak anywhere for a good pool.  The pool at the Sheraton Waikiki was just completely done over, with water slides & other fancy stuff.  Some kid friendly activities: we have a fairly decent zoo (tiger cubs born a few months back) & an OK aquarium, both on/near Kapiolani Park & a Children's' Museum in Kakaako, not too far away.|`|pFlZFIZ8aa	They will have a great time. Most kids this age will want to play on the beach. The beach there is calm, clean and warm. You can take some towels and let the kids have fun. You will be able to stay well after sunset as this is a great spot to watch it. This is a full service hotel with shopping, lounge and hula show by the pool. The area around this hotel is very busy as you are in downtown Waikiki. There is an aquarium that the kids will like about a mile away. You can always sneak into the Hilton Hawaiian Village and use the water slide, it is at the kids pool. Just exit the Sheraton's beach entrance and go to the right. Walk down the beach the Hilton will be on the right side.
bLbi43rhaa	There are a number of ways to do this by bus and train.    1. The easiest might be just to take the NJT train from Cherry Hill to Philly.  In Philly take a SEPTA train to Trenton.  In Trenton take the NJT train to NYC.    2. Take the train to Philly and take the express bus from Philly bus terminal to Port Authority in NYC.    3. Take the train from Cherry Hill to Lindenwold. Switch to PATCO train to Broadway in Camden.  Take the River Line light rail to Trenton.  Walk across the street to Trenton Station and take the NJT train to NYC.    4. If you can get to Exit 5 of the Turnpike, there is an Academy bus which offers direct service to NYC.    5. Mount Laurel has a Greyhound Station which has a NYC express bus.    6. You could take the train to Atlantic City and get the NYC express bus from there.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, what part of South Jersey you're going.

Without knowing that it is hard to give you any advice  other than NJ Transit Buses and NJ Transit Railroad provide the main public transportation in NJ (there are some local companies).

mF8GbnJraa	I went in 2005 and was very nice in Columbus Ohio,  You'll find many of Columbus's points of interest are historic in nature or otherwise unique to the city.  Ohio Historical Center has over a million items in collection, including a variety of exhibits devoted to Ohio archaeology and history from the Ice Age to current day.  German Village Society,here you will find some of the most beautifully restored historic 19th century homes,Most of the buildings, whether quaint cottages or ornately detailed Queen Anne Victorians, have limestone foundations.  North Market, an historic market dating back to 1876, the open-air market features over thirty unique merchants, fresh and prepared foods you can eat.  Just two miles east of downtown Columbus you'll find more than 400 plant species at Franklin Park Conservatory.  Goodale Park,is one of the oldest parks in the U.S. and the oldest in Columbus. It's surrounded by Victorian Village, a group of homes with charming architecture. Stop here for a view of the Columbus skyline.  The Hocking Hills, in southeastern Ohio only 55 miles from Columbus, are the rugged foothills of the Appalachians.   Tucked away in hills and hallows are cabins and cottages perfect for   family get-together.  That the region has remained so primitive and undeveloped as they hike to Old Mans Cave, named after a Civil War-era hermit, or to Ash Cave, the largest recess cave in Ohio with a span of 700 feet.  Contact Mountain Man Mule Expeditions (740-332-0221) for a carriage ride or mule trek.   This allows you to visit the whole park, walk all the trails, and have the time to stop at several places to just sit and soak up the beauty of the place.    Hope this answer will give you some help

maJpBDuvaa	Well..IN the great wall of china are a bunch of bones/bodies and wall stuff.    What's so great about seeing the wall on the other hand, is because of the architecture and the history behind it.|`|WrDGhduxaa	You are allowed to walk or really climb the wall. The view from the different areas is spectacular.  It is more impressive the farther you walk.  It is so big, and built on very steep land that it is difficult to believe it could have been built without modern machinery.  Everything was done by hand, cut the stones, and move and then assemble them into a wall.|`|hQNHzc6faa	The view|`|KfrYqRQNaa	a nice view of green.   its not really what to see, it's the experience of climbing up the wall. it is relaly tiring.|`|V38kMY3Kaa	Mutianyu (Chinese: ; pinyin: Mtiny) is a section of the Great Wall of China located in Huairou County 70km northeast of Beijing. The Mutianyu section of the Great Wall is connected with Juyongguan Pass in the west and Gubeikou Gateway in the east. As one of the best-preserved parts of the Great Wall, Mutianyu section of Great Wall used to serve as the northern barrier defending the capital and the imperial tombs.    First built in the mid-6th century during the Northern Qi, Mutianyu Great Wall is older than the Badaling section of the Great Wall. In the Ming dynasty, under the supervision of General Xu Da, construction of the present wall began on the foundation of the wall of Northern Qi. In 1404, a pass was built in the wall. In 1569, the Mutianyu Great Wall was rebuilt and till today most parts of it are well preserved. The Mutianyu Great Wall has the largest construction scale and best quality among all sections of Great Wall.|`|E3TjdZK7aa	What are the most popular Great Wall of China sites?    These are the most frequently visited sites on the Great Wall.    Badaling  Mutianyu  Juyongguan  Simatai    What are the best Great Wall of China sites?    Defining the best Great Wall locations depends upon your definition of best. Most tourists go to Badaling or Mutianyu. For visitors who are more interested in the Great Wall than in a crowded tourist destination, I usually recommend Jinshanling, and if they want to do some hiking, the Jinshanling to Simatai hike. This is about a 3-hour drive northeast of downtown Beijing.    There are several threads of discussion of this topic on the Great Wall Forum
nEgJAtK7aa	Beaches resorts are great, but they are not in Montego Bay they are in Negril or Ocho Rios. If you are looking for adults only I would say Sandals Montego Bay. If you need a family resort I would say Riu Montego Bay. This is a new resort that just opened in 2008. All of the resorts have a different atmosphere so it really depends on what you are looking for. One resort can be great for one person and not for the next because it does not have what they are looking for in a resort.   If you are looking for a great beach then you really want to go to Negril where they have 7 mile beach. Good Luck and have a fun trip.|`|oWpckmWvaa	The Riu for sure, me and my family just went this year.  everything was absolutely amazing, even the cabbies will tell you the Riu is one of the nicest in the island. they aren't too expensive either because of the economy. we loved it, you can search the riu montego bay on the internet and the site should come up for you.|`|kctRBuY8aa	Beaches Resorts for kids and family.. and Sandals Resorts for Couples Only.

Jm3vMKx3aa	For non-domestic flights a passport is required in any case.    At present, until May 31, 2009 U.S. and Canadian citizens may travel on land and sea travel by using the drivers license as proof of ID and the original or a certified copy of the birth certificate as proof of citizenship.    Starting from June 1, 2009 a passport, a passsport card, or an enhanced driving license denoting the citizenship will be required for land and sea travel.    U.S. citizens may continue to use drivers license and birth certificate on cruise ships providing they embark and disembark the ship on the same U.S. port.    Foreign nationals will need a Passport and their U.S. residence permit for the travel; if they should just be on a visitor status to the U.S. it depends on their citizenship whether they may need a visa in addition to their passports.  The visa requirement is however mostly waived for foreigners on cruise ships.      Source(s):  http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/vacati...  http://getyouhome.gov/  http://travelininc.com/PASSPORTS.html      Edit:  based on additional information provided    If you plan to fly into the U.S. your plan will not work, you will all need passports.    A Canadian residency would not waiver a US visa requirement    @ Charlie:  The cruise ship waiver can only apply to U.S. citizens, since Canadian citizens can no longer enter the U.S. with ID and proof of citizenship after June 1, 2009.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	If you and the others are going to FLY from Canada to the U.S., you must have passports.   If you will be traveling by LAND to the U.S. after May 31, you must have passports.  U.S. citizens going on a cruise that begins and ends at the same U.S. port do not need a passport for a cruise...however,  I cannot find ( after much searching) any site that DEFINITELY says this also applies to Canadians.  It would be far safer for the Canadian citizen to just go ahead and get a passport to be safe.   Best for the American to go ahead and get one too.  If they can afford to go on a cruise, they can afford $100.00 more for a passport.  It currently takes about 3 weeks standard processing to get an American passport and 2 to 4 weeks for a Canadian passport.|`|093c633e155de952249b95398f169e87aa	for all you need to know about cruising, check out this website, www.vacationstogo.com you will find the best detailed web page filled with so much information and you will be surprised at the prices, especially last minute cruises at ridiculously cheap prices. i use them frequently,and recommend their great service and knowledge

The price does change depending on weight and until they put it on the scale you wont know the exact price.    ;) Its what I do.    Just walk in with the coat in the box and ask the price.

29ZL58Xjaa	There are two versions of the inside passage that you can take.  You can either go on the full inside passage throughout the year, or you can go on the discovery coast ferry in the summer months.    I have been on both of them before. The most current trip was this past summer when we went on the Discovery Coast ferry. This was really something. We spent 33 hours on the ferry, and we visited Bella Bella, then Shearwater, and then we stopped to Klemtu, Ocean Falls and also to Bella Coola.    If you're wanting to see wildlife, I would recommend that you go on the discovery coast ferry in the summer, and then go to Bella Coola. This is where you hook up to Tweedsmuir Park, which is one of BC's largest jewels.  There are a lot of animals that roam through these parks, and then there are a lot of animals that roam up in the Heckman's pass area near the top between Bella Coola and Anahim Lake.    For more information of this trip, feel free to visit my website at http://www.freewebs.com/theworldofbritis... and that should give you some more information that you can look at about that trip.    When I was younger, we went to the inside passage that goes all the way up to Prince Rupert. This one was a very long ferry ride, and it was still a very good one.      The information of these two trips is located on:    Inside Passage  http://www.bcferries.com/schedules/insid...  Discovery coast http://www.bcferries.com/schedules/disco...    Please note for the discovery coast ferry and for a part of the inside passage, it goes through the Queen Charlotte Strait and can become quite bumpy similar to that of a sailboat. If you're prone to becoming seasick, then take gravol, or use the motion sickness wrist bands.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	BC Ferries doesn't go to Ucluelet, but the Lady Rose does. Check the website under Lady Rose Marine. It's one of the best kept secrets of BC. It's a freight and passenger service that goes to Bamfield all year round and Ucluelet in summer. You can also take a day trip on the Uchuck, run by Nootka Sound Service, which goes from Gold River on the west coast of the island. There is also Marine Link, which runs freight boats and passenger trips up the inside passage out of Campbell River. That one is probably where you'll see the most wildlife; of course it's hard to say what you'll see on any given day. However, the freight boats like the ones I've mentioned stop at all kinds of little places, logging camps, fish farms, private docks, etc and go into small inlets, so you get a really good view of life on the coast. The big ferries stay in as deep water as they can, and don't stop except at terminals. You could, with a little planning, do all those 3 trips in one week with time for other looking around, they're not all that far apart. Take your rain gear. I did the Lady Rose trip one June day and it rained all day long.  Good doughnut shop on the dock next to it, open early!|`|9tcv3TiWaa	Ucluelet is not on the the inside passage but on the outside of the island.  There is no ferries that go that way.  The ferries that go on the inside passage are between Victoria/Vancouver, Vancouver/Nanaimo, Victoria/Gulf Islands, Vancouver/Gulf Islands, Bellingham/Alaska.      If you want to go to Ucluelet then get a rental car or something, take the ferry to Nanaimo or Victoria and go from there.  Then rent a canoe, kayak or a tour and see it from there.|`|uHs6VSmjaa	BC Ferries has a ferry that goes from Port Hardy on the north end of Vancouver Island to Prince Rupert. This is an overnight trip, and the ferry has private sleeping accommodation if you choose.     You can take your vehicle on board is you want to, and then drive back, rather than doing the round trip. This is pretty expensive, but would make a great vacation.    You should be prepared for some rough water during the trip. My sister lives in Pr. Rupert and often travels on this ferry. She has complained more than once of very rough seas. Check it out at bcferries.ca|`|b28dc809402d907f290d1fba72651a75aa	Uclulet is on the west side of Vancouver Island.  The east side of the island is where to find the inside passage.  As for wildlife viewing if you drive to Uclulet or Tofino there are tour companies that will take you on wildlife viewing tours which will include bears and whales.  Also there is a ship that delivers supplies to some of the remote area along the west side of Vancouver Island.  She is named the Lady Rose and sails out of Port Alberni and takes passengers along for the sightseeing.  On the east side of the island there are water tours out of Campbell River which are also heavily involved in eco tours including whale sightings and bear watching.  Either side of the Island has it's own opportunities.

The agents who represent the majority of the "Exotic Dancers" have a rating system of A and B "Exotic Dancers" and arrange their bookings accordingly.

The majority of the dancer play in atleast two to three bars\nightclubs 6 to 10 sets per day. Now it should be understood that is strickly for dancing, not touching, not lap dancing (lapp dancers are booked out for stag parties at $350.00 per hour)     Some quick mathematics will tell you why here in Vancouver most of the top Exotic Dancers are powerful highly successful women who have invested in realestate and are intelligent  business women that  have parlayed their Esthetic gifts into small fortunes.      The stereotype of the "Stripper" accompanied by a rather large bikers flying gang "colors" and providing body guard services; thereby protecting what was generally considered an investment they had made while  pandering to the girls favorite vices; clothing, costumes and drugs; not necessarily in that order has become a tired old stereotype that is passe' and no longer a true reflection of who these women\girls are.    Don't worry about your change buddy; the tune "You can't touch this" comes to mind" LOL!    The colors that turn the "Exotic Dancer's" head in relation to tipping is not the Green Canadian $20.00 bill ; that's just being polite, the Canadian Orange $50.00 bill will get you a smile and  the $100.00 bill will get you a smile and maybe she'll call off her body guard and save your life if you get too cute!!    I personally don't think of it as tipping but rather an advance insurance policy premium when I decide I really "must" speak to one of these "powerhouse" women.    Safetymax Out!    Change for the Dancer? What are you thinking?   Whatever province you were in I believe you were observing Exotic Dancers on the "C" circut; we don't have that circut hear in BC. Home to the most beautiful "Exotic Dancer" on the North American continent! It Rains alot here, but who cares when you can go in doors and get right down front and feel the heat gernerated from an "Exotic Fire".     Change? Cups? Slots? REEEEALLY children! I'm mean REEEEALLY!|`|oMJRbtz1aa	you dont throw them! lol but yeah you give them your coins my fiance is from canada and we go all the time! sometimes they have containers youd put it in and if its close to the states, like maine, then u can give them american money too

Imqb5ueqaa	I think it would be the EDSA Shrine. This was built as a tribute to the peace loving Filipinos who overthrew a dictatorship through a phenomenal People Power revolution.     When the Marcoses fled, the whole world was astonished at this singular accomplishment. The world then paid tribute to the Filipinos, and made headlines simultaneously in almost all the newspapers and newscasts in almost all countries. "People Power" became a buzz word, and was seen as a template for ousting dicatorships. Eventually, people power became a strategy by oppressed citizens to drive their leader out.|`|EjhJliKmaa	intramuros, magellan's cross, smole,...|`|AA11441260	jeepney, the vinta boats of zamboanga, smokey mountain, mactan chapel|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	Intramuros...

Uzzv4FYZaa	Depends.  Are you going to be in a tent, a cabin?  Sleep in a bed, on a cot, on the ground? Can you drive in or do you have to hike?  How far?  If you have an emergency, how close is help?  What about food?  How will you cook it?  How high in the mountains?  What's the weather going to be?  What if it's worse?   Who will be with you?  What can you share?  "Quickly" and "prepared" don't usually go together if you're new at this.  Short answer: you want to stay warm, dry, and mobile.  For clothes, think layers, synthetics, and wool.  For heat, have at least two separate ways to start a fire and two available sources of fuel.  For mobile, be able to walk out with no more weight than you can carry, including water, if you have to, even if you have to abandon non-essentials.  For food, think calories.  Hot drinks.  No alcohol or soft drinks.  There are internet sites that have camping-stuff lists.  Google around.  Or, check with your local outdoor outfitter's store. Have fun.

Imqb5ueqaa	How I wish I could say yes, but I do not think I can.    The youth of today hear only of the heroes in their classrooms. They are of some very distant past, and their relevance appears to be lost on them. Very few, and these are the exceptional students, would take time to ponder the lessons learned from them, the values that they represent. Love of country, the very essence of these national heroes, is mouthed but not practised.     Blame it on the times. In the rush to finish so many things, on top of the so many extraneous activities they have (gimmicks, texting, etc), mundane tasks take precedence.     Thsi is true for most poor nations. The struggle to survive, and advance their standard of living, has taken its toll. Hero worship is dead.|`|QYC6cjwEaa	I don't think so.|`|AA11441260	yes, by knowing them thru forced subjects in school, and emulating their good examples incorporated in our characters.|`|alN2JxuUaa	agree with JH on this, at some degree.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	Honestly? No.    What does our youth think of when they see a statue of Rizal?  Do they ever stop and think of the person behind the statue?  Do they remember the man fiercely hated by the Spaniards, of his heroic deeds or, what he was that made him our country's national hero?     When they see his face on matchboxes, does his image even register in their minds to remind them of his being a hero?    What of the other heroes that we have?  Do these youths even recall their names, their share in our country's history and in what manner they have carved a name for themselves?    I doubt that 3 out of 10 youths would know the answers to all my questions.|`|r1IRcrMPaa	Show any kid on the street a photo of : Tandang Sora, Juan Luna, Diego Silang, Gabriela Silang or any other heroes, and compared to the photos of Marimar (Marian Rivera), Gagambino.... see who they can identify first.|`|AA11212130	To some degree...YES!    There is still a sense of Patriotism with the Filipino youth. We might not be seeing them offering wreath to a hero's shrine, but whenever there is a need to defend and be proud of our country, they would go back to our roots and show people proud how Filipinos now came about.     Hope this helps.

Sure schools like UC Berkeley are ranked much higher, but UCR is ranked 89 overall in schools in the U.S. or 40th in public schools.  It depends what you want to do.  If you want to be a teacher then you need to look at the education department and I would strongly recommend visiting the school before you apply to get "a feeling" about it.  Sometimes you can just tell by seeing if things are good or not.  I've driven by it before but I really can't tell you much about it otherwise.

Not to discourage but did you graduate high or low for your year? I'm told that those who graduate low should bother going to college as it it a high chance they will do poor and wast their tution money. A vocation school is said to be the alternate.    Good luck with your dreams.
oi4LXCgLaa	I'd recommend you going to Westerly Health Foods.    This is the best grocery store ever! I go here at least a few times a week to buy lunch and snacks and stuff. Everything is organic, minimally processed, and they have tons of stuff, a lot of cool brands making good, socially conscious foods (like Kashi). The sandwiches and soups are good, and the yogurt selection is amazing. Also, the bulk foods/nuts are great, if a little expensive. One thing is the produce isn't the best--it's all organic, but looks a little sad a lot of the time. They also have a big vitamin and body section.|`|fukzl8oaaa	New York City has everything.............You just have to look.|`|9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	Whole Foods has vegetarian and organic food.

x5bVBKdTaa	I have lived in Iowa for most of my life till I got the freedom to move a couple years ago. I will never go back for the same reasons you are talking about. I grew up in Cedar Rapids and I can tell you that there is nothing to do in miles of that place. I am sorry to say unless you want to travel to Iowa City or Des Moines there really isn't anything to do. Dubuque has a bunch of bars, churches, and colleges. Cedar Rapids has some shopping and there are a bunch movie theaters. Davenport I would stay clear of because they have a huge crime rate and to me they have never been a safe.     As for the weather you don't go out unless you have to. You can't set the jet stream or change the wind direction. Since we don't have trees or anything like that there is nothing to stop the snow from blowing and to block the wind. It is pretty obvious why Iowa people seem to have more meat on the bones.|`|pz05GLJHaa	Offutt AFB 'caues I was assigned here and will not be here forever|`|rseR7Camaa	not a dam thing...thats why I refused to move there after a visit in July.

I've lived in a few other states out west, but I keep coming back because I love the snow.  The weather is a tad unpredictable at times.      North of Davenport is some beautiful parks.  Effigy Mounds and Pikes Peak, both which have some pretty trails.  I don't live in that area, only pass by sometimes, so I don't know of any other interesting spots on the East side of Iowa.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	If I lived in Iowa I think I'd kill myself|`|ivsKcwwvaa	That's the point.

Check out the Amana Colonies right around just west of Iowa City, they are worth staying a weekend even in the winter.  For Dubuque, I recommend going just west of town to Dyersville to check out the Field of Dreams from the movie of the same name.
a6JZjRG1aa	people all over the China should pass pu-tong-hua oral test...  that means "dialects are off the list"...    as far as you are speaking the dialect (that is "not pu-tonghua") there are no chances for you to pass any exam...    you are in a situation which many foreigners happened to have and which is called "i think i can speak Chinese"...

44OH7Si6aa	Wear bright colors. The mardi gras flag colors are purple green and gold, you can choose one of those colors to wear or you can just wear something in a nice jewel-tone. You can also pick yourself up a mask and some mardi gras beads, not sure where you live but you may be able to find some at a party supply store.      Mardi Gras did not start in Mobile: the first mardi gras festivities held in North America were held March 3, 1699 in a place on the west bank of the Mississippi river about 60 miles downriver from where New Orleans is today named Point du Mardi Gras, Mobile's first carnival celebration was in 1703.|`|e68b22a4892a43457f773b8e0670573faa	Search google images and this is the kind of stuff you will find :    http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...|`|wihrLsUKaa	Yes, we have Mardi Gras where I live, in between Mobile Alabama (where it STARTED in the U.S. contrary to popular opinion.  The Mardi Gras colors are Purple, Green and gold.  It's extravagant and the tradition comes from that being fat tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday and the beginning of lent.  So, we party like crazy, b/c the next day is lent and we go to mass and get ashes on our foreheads and abstain from things until Easter.  (at least that is what I was taught in 13 years of Catholic school and practiced myself for almost 28 years.).  Actually to be honest, if you can find a decent smaller parade, like on the Mississippi Gulf Coast they are very tasteful, no nudity and not a lot of drunkenness but a lot of fun.   Have a blast and laizze le bon temps rouller!|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	The idea behind masking and costuming at Mardi Gras is to be whoever you want to be - you can be Marie Antoinette or a flapper from the 1920's.

If you order food at a counter (like in a pub), tipping isn't expected. Tipping usually means small change, rounding up a bill, and rarely more than 10%.

jH8hIB0kaa	There are defined ports of entry for private vessels. Upon entering U.S. waters, you must radio ahead to arrange for arrival instructions at a manned port of entry inspection/customs point, before continuing to your final destination(s). The U.S. can conduct an "at sea" inspection, at it's discretion. It is a similar process as to that of aircraft entering the U.S.A. I tried to respond to your message, but it did not complete.

Like when an annoucement reads "gro?es Kinderzimmer" (large children's room), that's usually good enough for two children of about the same age to share that as their playing ground and bedroom. A flat with 120 sqm (square meters) is usually good enough for a family with two kids; if you have more kids, then of course you'll need more space. I'd sincerely recommend that when you come to Germany, you start with a big flat in a rented house before turning to something else, and don't bring too much stuff with you. We're not in the third world; you can buy all your household belongings at cheap rates here, which will probably beat the cost of a parcel from the United States. But we're also used to living in stacked-up buildings in narrow cities. And don't miscount the stairs: "2nd floor" is TWO stairs up. We don't count the groundfloor, it's zero in our counting, so "first floor" will NOT be ground level, but one stair up. And old buildings usually don't have elevators.

After the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey became a secular democracy.  The first President, Ataturk, was frankly rather hostile to religion, though the people have remained mostly Muslim.  In recent years, though, Islamists have been making inroads to the Turkish political scene, and so I imagine a certain amount of anti-Israel feeling has developed among some of the people.    Pres. Erdogan of Turkey, though considered secularist and conservative, has to deal with the political realities of the time.  He has tried to influence Israel not to fight with Gaza.  And when Pres. Peres of Israel became a bit heated at a conference, Erdogan felt the need to walk out in protest.  They have since reconciled in mutual respect, though they still differ on the Gaza issue.  That's my understanding of what happened.|`|oEVON0Xxaa	Well so far no one has stopped hamas from using human shields, I doubt turkey can do anything to stop them.|`|mE4SbWIuaa	Turkey, like Egypt and Jordan has been trying to walk a tight wire where Israel is concerned.

It would appear as though Turkish PM Erdogan may have dragged Turkey off that wire though when he threw his little tantrum at Israeli President Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland and stormed out. I guess time will tell how that all plays out.    In answer to your other question; Sadly, the only people who have any control over the civilian death rate in Gaza are the people of Gaza who can either continue to allow themselves to be used as human shields by Hamas everytime it starts another war with Israel, or they can rid themselves of Hamas and elect a government that is more concerned about building them a country than it is with destroying Israel.|`|YilXDO4Zaa	turkey and israel are friends but they had a little argument.  i don't think turkey can stop gaza from killing israelis or the other way around either.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	turkey and israel have strong ties,  in fact turkey has been one of the few islamic countries to recognize israel,  but the tukish PM wanted to be a bit show off in Davos meeting,  nothing big

MTdMCfmlaa	When will Detroit rise again?    Theres no way anyone can put a date on the answer to this question, I can tell you when according to certain events and changes occur.  Detroit will rise again as a world class city when the city finally filters out the corruption political and public servant wise. Detroit will rise again when the city and; state of Michigan can adapt to the ever changing economic evolution and, benefit from it, instead of crumble as a result of it. Detroit will rise again when employment opportunities are plentiful enough for every skill level of citizen who inhabits Detroit and; all citizens of Detroit and its suburbs are financially able enough to live within a means where not only everyone will be able to get and, maintain a roof over their head, but they will also be able to enjoy the leisures Detroit has to offer. Detroit will rise again when (as a result of employment opportunities) more businesses will be willing to relocate and/or, open up new facilities in the city limits.    Last but not least; Detroit will rise once again when the media finally realizes broadcasting nothing but bad media attention only helps hurt and further damage Detroits reputation, the original heart of Americas economy, and prevent any outside political help to turning Detroit around.    If you notice, the American economic situation is like a plague.

Good Buddhists usually do not hold any materialistic thing of importance other than the scripture.      However, some monks want to make money and sell things to people in the temples.    Falun Gong is a unique Buddhist School, found in 1992 by Master Li Hongzhi in China. About 100 million people practice in over 80 countries worldwide. Falun Gong is an ancient practice for the body, mind, and spirit based upon the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Falun Gong consists of five sets of powerful exercises.    Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Christians have been persecuted in China. The most offensive human right violation is the organ harvesting from the Falun Gong practitioners in China.  http://cipfg.org/en/news/petition.html

gJORvkrVaa	That sounds like fun! You should definitely plan on going to Times Square, just because there is so much to see and many fun shops. If you want to do any shopping for clothes, you may want to try going to Century 21 in the Financial District! You just have to take the subway to Fulton Street! If you haven't heard of it before (which I hadn't until I moved here!) it's this AWESOME, HUGE store with all kinds of designer clothes that are really discounted!!! I mean, nice stuff that is %75 less than it would be anywhere else! And it's just a really fun experience! The shoes are great too, and again everything is really cheap! I'm not sure how much time you'll have in the city or how many days you'll be here but you should also check out Little Italy or Chinatown for some cheap, fun souvenir shops and of course to eat :) If you eat in Little Italy and want to have the best dessert EVER for your birthday, you should go to this place called Ferrara's. For about $7 or $8 you can get 3 "mini" desserts, (which really aren't that small and still fill you up!) and it will probably be the best dessert you've ever had! I'm definitely having my husband take me there on my birthday this year! :) Other things you may want to do if the weather is nice is check out Central Park, which has all kinds of things going on all the time. And of course, you can always go to a Broadway Show! There are tons of great ones out there, and that would be a really fun experience for you guys!

Among children born to affluent families, the probability of more brands being followed by the kids is high, considering that affluent families tend to buy the better brands.    Now, if an adult came from a poor family, but is now capable of better brands (that their family then can not afford), chances are there will be more brands he/she uses that were not his parents'.    It is highly improbable, if not downright impossible, that all brands used by the older generation will be embraced by the younger ones. Even assuming that the brands still exist.    Foremost of the reasons is that the young ones want to assert their individuality ('this is me") so they look for some brands that represent their personality.    The second most important reason is that, with advances in technology, it is always possible that new brands could be launched that could be undeniably better than the leading brand.

Now, upon reaching the adolescent years, kids tend to try other brands and become more adventurous.    This is the stage of a child when manufacturers, through their advertisements, target them by offering a variety of brands, thus the shift.    Study shows that adolescents tend to try new brands unlike adults who sticks to the traditional items.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	Some household items/utilities remain my children's favorites in their own homes.

My parents wouldn't really use brand products that we wouldn't really use. Such as toothpaste and bath soap. And we still use products we've been using since I was a kid.

Especially now that times have changed and more revolutionary products have been introduced.|`|AA11212130	If it works, and its still available...why not?!    Though for our case...not really.
9QBlKlFmaa	The most hope you could give the place you refer to as Palestine is to understand what that is, what has happened there, and who lives there.  You can help them by convincing all the inhabitants that Israel is here to stay.    The State of Israel (which had been called at one point Palestine until it was partitioned twice), is a small (10,000 square miles at present) country at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea.  During its long history, its area, population and ownership varied greatly.  The present state of Israel consists of all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean ocean, bounded by Egypt in the south, Lebanon in the north, and Jordan in the East.  The recognized borders of Israel constitute about 78% of this land.  The remainder is divided between land occupied by Israel since the 1967 6-day war and the autonomous regions under the control of the Palestinian autonomy.  The Gaza strip occupies an additional 141 square miles south of Israel along the sea coast, and is occupied by the Palestinian Authority.  Thousands of Israelis had been living there for decades, until they were forced out of their homes in 2005.    At Israels 60th Independence Day, the countrys population stands at 7,282,000, according to figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).  Some 5,499,000 of the population (75.5 percent) are Jews, 1,461,000 (20.1%) are Arabs and the remaining 322,000 (4.4%) are immigrants and their offspring who are not registered as Jews by the Interior Ministry.    Prior to 1917, the territory that is now called Israel and Jordan was ruled by the Ottoman Turkish Empire, and included three sanjaks (districts).  The name "Palestine," which had been used by Roman and briefly by Arab rulers, was revived by the British, who received a mandate from the League of Nations to administer Palestine as a national home for the Jewish people.    Israel was created in 1948, after UN Resolution 181 partitioned the territory of the British Mandate for Palestine into two states, for Jews and Arabs.  The Arabs objected to the creation of the Jewish state and fought a war against it.  The Arab side lost the war, and the Palestinian state never really came into being.  The territory allotted to the Palestinian state by the UN partition resolution was taken over by Egypt and Jordan.  Some hundreds of thousands of Arabs became refugees.  The Arab states have made sure to keep them as refugees all these decades, as part of their war to destroy Israel.    Beginning in 1993, the Oslo agreements promised gradual withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Palestinians thought that this process might end in a state for them.  However, the peace process was marred by Arab terrorist attacks.  Following breakdown of the final status negotiations in the summer of 2000, riots erupted in September 2000 when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, after receiving confirmation from the Arabs, paid a controversial visit to the Temple Mount, which also contains buildings holy to Muslims.  Palestinians refused to accept the agreement offered by U.S.  President Clinton in December 2000, and violence continued at least until the beginning of 2005.  Election of Holocaust denier Mahmoud Abbas as Palestinian Authority Chairman and the Israeli disengagement plan (eviction of Jews from Gush Katif in Gaza and some Samaria settlements) made some na?ve observers hope for peace.  This ignored the declared intention of the Arabs to destroy the Jewish state.    On the eve of Israels 60th Independence Day, the countrys population stands at 7,282,000, according to figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).  Some 5,499,000 of the population (75.5 percent) are Jews, 1,461,000 (20.1%) are Arabs and the remaining 322,000 (4.4%) are immigrants and their offspring who are not registered as Jews by the Interior Ministry.    The per capita GDP is about $18,000 and literacy rates are over 95%.  Life expectancy is over 75 years, and infant mortality about 6.75 per thousand, comparing favorably with Europe and North America.  The Palestinian areas account for about 2,800 square miles of the total territory.  They have a population estimated at about 3 million, per capita GDP of under $2,000, literacy rate of about 86% and infant mortality of 33 per thousand.    Their main problem is that they cannot bear to have a Jewish state in the Middle east.  You can help them by convincing them that Israel is here to stay.      .|`|0pM85b5Baa	Although you may find few reasonable answers, but still there is more hate to the Palestinians.    More than 95% of the aid going to Gaza is VIA Egypt. I suggest first aid tools, emergency training and clothes for the kids.     There are many ideas and many people would love to help. I will be happy if I can help you too.     Good luck|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Learn Arabic, get a teaching credential and go there if you really want to help.

One more brand new member here at Y/A posting one more seemingly innocent question in the "ISRAEL" section that claims the non-country of "Palestine" is in Israel.     Here's a thought, if you want to help them tell your teacher you're going to volunteer to go to Gaza and become a human shield for the phony as you GazaNazi government, otherwise known as Hamas.     Or you can tell her you need a new teacher because her lessons about the history of Israel and the Arabs is full of lies.|`|Kik3epkVaa	Join your local chapter of Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch and start organizing public information lectures and meetings.

The problem is getting stuff to them.Between security risks & theft from Hamas it would never make it inside.    If you're going to do something like that support Israel where 60% of the children are now in poverty. Or Darfur, Ethiopia, Russia, China, etc. Places that will get it & appreciate it.    Mercy Corps is a good organisation for stuff like that. Another project the church kids are doing is collecting pennies. Then once they get $20. or $30. they send it to someplace like America's Second Harvest or Feed The Children where $14. can buy a ton of food.    As things stand now unless you sent money through some org. like Mercy Corps it'd never get there. Even then they would have a hard time getting it through to those who need it. Plus Hamas is giving out large checks to the people anyway while keeping other aid from getting to them. Plus so many govts. are sending them money. So send your good deeds where they'll be received & appreciated.|`|74RNHyxHaa	Right now what the Palestinians need the most is food and medical supplies. It's going to be hard to send them to Gaza, but it's worth a try.

They are legitimate and there is no law in any country against donating to them.|`|zy8mKJxeaa	Help persuade them to stop electing leaders that only care to destroy both Israelis and Palestinians. Tell them to build with all of the aid money that they are getting rather than spend it on murder weapons like rockets.|`|1NTmCWH7aa	@ Alex & killing me softly: I hope to god you never need help from anyone. They might say "you can't help people who won't help themselves."    I agree with Joey though, writing letters and creating awareness would help. As you can see from the answers below, people have this perception that Palestinians enjoy being killed, being hungry,living in terror etc    Write to ur newspapers and get local leaders to create awareness in your areas. Later on as you get many people like yourself who want to help out as a humanitarian cause ( please don't bring religion here, it doesn't belong here). You can approach the government and other bigger organizations who can help provide facilities and such to Palestine.     That's the problem right now, people aren't speaking up that much hence Israel is easily banning the small amount of help that is being sent. the more people you get, the more chances of aid actually getting where it belongs.    This is a very noble cause and yes we should all being helping those less-privileged countries (from all over the world). Your movement may run in from other countries as well; could be the start of something big..good luck:)|`|NRYx7UvQaa	pray for them to make everything better|`|R76ema39aa	- Send money to the Palestinians through charities etc..   - Write a letter to your local MP asking what they're doing.   - Write to newspapers, or major news stations.   - Organize fundraisers with all the money going to the Palestinians.   - Boycott Israeli goods.

They certainly need it more than ever.    Red Cross is called Red Crescent in Muslim countries, and the Palestine Red Crescent is doing amazing work and could really use help.  I've seen ambulances completely destroyed by Israeli soldiers and their bulldozers.  Their website is http://www.palestinercs.org    Another great organization is World Vision. I've seen a lot of their projects both in the West Bank and Gaza and was really impressed.     The Christian population is declining quickly, and now down to less than 2%.  They could really use support and an organization doing just that is HCEF (Holy Land Ecumenical Foundation).  It is based in the States, but started by a Palestinian American and a Jordanian priest.  I know these gentlemen and they're outstanding and doing great work.  Their website is http://www.hcef.org|`|mFMbA1fCaa	I can't believe that last response....      But he did have a point. At this point, Israel is not allowing many supplies into the Palestinian state. So, if you raise funds to purchase medical supplies/food/etc. as you would to help, say, Africa or Latin America, your aid would likely be denied by the IDF. At  the moment, the only real thing to do is raise awareness on the side of the Palestinians.  Perhaps you may compare their struggle to that of the Americans in 1776? French in 1789? Or, more appropriately, the "undesirables" of WWII (refering not only to the Nazi extremism, but also that of the United States and Japan). If you could start a school-wide protest group that can lobby your local senator (hopefully he/she is more left-wing. Right-wing politicans will likely not be inclined to help your cause). I am not the absolute authority on this, but given the current situation, there is not much you can do. Right now, only a couple of French ships are being allowed in at different intervals, as decided by the Israeli government.|`|yRYZcYp7aa	Don't listen to most of the answersers here,some of them are just ignorant.Yes,its good of you to help Palestinian because they are people too just like you and me..they have their own country and they are being attacked cruely.The innocent women and children died in the Israel attack..So we can help Palestinian by donating them food or clothes..we can also pray for them to be well and safe.|`|eqauIjQYaa	You can help by sending a letter and in the letter convince them to get rid of HAMAS.

I was a cashier at South Base last year and I think a pizza slice was $4.50 with a pop, so it's not as expensive as say Trent Blanc but it's more expensive compared to a reguar resturant or fast food place. If you go to...A&P in Collngwood (it's called something else now, M?) by taxi it's $15 from the Mountain, and it's not that expensive. But yea, Blue Moutain is not overly expensive but there's no traditional grocery stores, sorry. :(

94b8KImYaa	On most cruise lines, the spa is operated by a British company called Steiner.     http://www.steinerleisure.com/    It they consider employing you, you would need to go through their training in London, for 1 week or 2, (as far as I remember)     There you will learn about their products they use, the different treatments they offer - and you will learn how to sell, sell and sell their products.     The biggest part of the salary comes from the commission you earn by selling products to passengers.     So for the salary part it would depend on what kind of ship you would go, how many passengers are onboard, and if those passengers are Spa oriented or not.     Working hours was 12 hours minimum, (this was the time the Spa was open) and then they had to clean the Gym and the Spa, so we are talking about 14 to 15 hours a day.     They also had training sessions very frequently.     Each of the Therapist had 1,5 days off per week - which is a great luxury onboard a cruise ship.

Something inside so strong  I know that I can make it  Tho' you're doing me wrong, so wrong  You thought that my pride was gone  Oh no, something inside so strong  Oh oh oh oh oh something inside so strong    Brothers and sisters  When they insist we're just not good enough  When we know better  Just look 'em in the eyes and say  I'm gonna do it anyway x 2    Something inside so strong  And I know that I can make it  Tho' you're doing me wrong, so wrong  You thought that my pride was gone  Oh no, something inside so strong  Oh oh oh oh oh something inside so strong    Brothers and sisters  When they insist we're just not enough  When we know better  Just look 'em in the eyes and say  I'm gonna do it anyway x 4    Because there's something inside so strong  And I know that I can make it  Tho' you're doing me, so wrong  Oh no, something inside so strong  Oh oh oh oh oh something inside so strong    Palestinians particularly the little children routing the cowardly Israeli's with mere stones make the decent world proud!|`|bIXafENhaa	Everyones proud of their heritage. If they're not, then they should be.

Despite so many attempts by Israel to get rid of them, they're still there. The most resistant race I've ever seen.  Palestine is the land of the Prophets, and Jerusalem is one of the holiest cities in the world.  People are usually proud of their heritage, and Palestinians have a lot more to be proud of than others.|`|wxO3eatxaa	Because we worship our country, we love the grains of sand that makes palestine, the grape vines, the trees, the ocean, the smell of history in the atmosphere and feeling that we belong. We will fight to the end to defend our country and the right to live in peace in it, something people like you will never understand because its not within you.     Palestine is the holy land and you cannot expect people who dont have faith and dont live for god to understand this. people who live for their own selfishness and desires, for the worship of themselves cannot understand the perseverence of a religion that lives and dies for god and for the freedom of others.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Here are some reasons, but thsy may not convince you.    Hamas "Member of Parliament" Fathi Hammad, brags about the Hamas use of human shields.    Fathi Hammad: "[The enemies of Allah] do not know that the Palestinian people has developed its [methods] of death and death-seeking. For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel, and so do all the people living on this land. The elderly excel at this, and so do the mujaheddin and the children. This is why they have formed human shields of the women, the children, the elderly, and the mujaheddin, in order to challenge the Zionist bombing machine. It is as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death like you desire life.'"    This may indeed be sick, but it is the Palestinian ideology.      .

I recently had something sent from australia to UK and had to pay custom taxes, the threshold in the UK is 60GBP its probably like about 100ASD back home.    Check on Australia posts website and they will let you know what is the minimum amount that could be send.    Alternatively if you get a friend to buy all your gear in the UK then tick the 'gift' box when sending and ensure the value is like 20 Euros you wont have to pay custom taxes. If your buying online dont' think this option will be available for you.

AA11435892	Okay here is the real deal that no one has gotten so far. Newark, bad. You want to try to avoid being there at all costs. Never park on the street, you probably will never see your car again. Although the closer you get to Seton Hall University in South Orange, the better the area.     In Brooklyn, a good majority is safe. You naturally have your bad areas. But I leave my car parked in Brooklyn on the street (I'm seriously in Coney Island, Williamsburg, Bay Ridge, Gravesend, and Borough Park all the time), and never have had a problem.     But generally speaking Brooklyn is much safer than Newark.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	I lived in Brooklyn most of my life. Its really not as bad as people think except for certain neighborhoods.

LDqzP2LVaa	When I moved to the UAE I thought I was gonna live in the desert, but I was surprised to see the strength of development there, especially in Dubai and Abi Dhabi.   Dubai is more of a cosmpolitan city with its skyscrapers and malls, while Abu Dhabi is a more relaxed beach city, with big sidewalks, bicycle alleys, and sooooo many trees.   So I think it's definitly a developed country regarding these 2 cities.|`|3bc80c62eac090b136c41da84008bc69aa	i think the definition of developed country is to be set first before u can look forward to classify the country.  before it was the idea that all western word is developed and the easter r developing.  now if u see the education and industries r shifting and therefore more defined aproach is required.  there is every thing available and affordable here in UAE what can be imagined in west . so u can decide if this country is developed or developing or transitional ?|`|NmQdojJYaa	Not developing rather running, and very soon will become one of the most beautiful tourist place in the world.|`|ehIsuFAmaa	Its not developing rather developed and getting better day by day.|`|p7foZpheaa	Its a developing country.

Good luck and enjoy the experience.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Apart from the weather its a lovely place to live.    i live in Aberdeen city centre|`|a7bfe052a2f29eb67432ef60384d97a7aa	What a co incidence - I live in Australia and have frequently visited Aberdeen , actually i stayed just outside in Inverurie.    You can't compare Adelaide with Aberdeen , but you'll notice a temperature difference !!   If you want to have a top education , meet great folks , pick up a bit of a Scottish accent twang , it's a great place. But look , all these things are subjective and depends on you.    But I'd say go for it , just for the experience and set your mind up to take in the different lifestyle - how lucky for you !!|`|xsZB4XDFaa	Aberdeen is a nice place to live.  Since you are only 14, you will not need to worry about money.  (It is really expensive to live in Aberdeen)  The International School is really good.  People that you will go to school with will be in the same shoes as you (from another country) so it will be good.  It is BEAUTIFUL near Aberdeen (not the city itself, but the countryside)   It is quite cold though.  Average highs in the SUMMER only about 60's degrees Fahrenheit.  That is as warm as it gets.    Shopping is not good.  You need to go to Glasgow for good shopping.    Lots of good castles to tour really close to you.    If eating out is your thing...it is terrible.  Restaurants have no parking!  The roads are REALLY narrow, so it is nerve racking driving.|`|c26d7e95660baedb57bcbaaf575a6619aa	Population  Adelaide - 1,158,259   Aberdeen - 184,788  oh and all the buildings are grey  and the UK is in the middle of a recession  Mannofield is a nice area but it's probably nicer in sunny warm Oz|`|SZqlmSX6aa	Werid stuff some of the comments you have had. That Leigh saying some bullshite..    Shopping is very good, but for girls(im presuming your a boy) i can understand why she say that, because they need more Verity, the more shops the better for them eh? But Aberdeen has everything you need in terms of shops...    Restaurants are excellent, if you know where to go. Narrow roads, of course its a city, what people expect in a city motorways? ( But you dont drive so i dont see why mentioing it matters)    Sorry i should not be criticizing others strange opinions, but its not as if your coming here for a flying visit..    Any-way, i have stayed here all my life. And to be quite frank, Aberdeen is a shite-hole, its dull, cold, and right now its snowing. You will find it very hard to get used to the climate here, evan in the summer time its gets cold, mid August, you may get 25 degree's one day and 10 the next, 25 is probably the best you will get, up-to -10 in the winter..  Crime is high, with randoms muggings very popular, you should be save-ish in mannofield. But you will need to learn what parts of the city are good-ish and what parts are very bad. You will struggle to get used to the local accent, its very broad and un-like any-thing you will of heard before. Cane fit i meen loon? But really its no different than any other city in Scotland in terms of its bad points..    You will get a good education in Aberdeen, i presume the school you will go to, will have the same kind of kids that are in your situation, so i don't think you will have problems making friends. And there is plenty to do for 14 year olds in and around Aberdeen ..    You will either hate it, or love it...
